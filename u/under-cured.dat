40|$|The {{increasing}} use of {{polymer matrix}} composites (PMCs) in structural applications created demand for advanced repair techniques to fix internal delaminations in PMCs. One {{of a variety of}} repair techniques is injection repair, which involves injecting a low viscosity resin directly into the damaged area and subsequently curing the resin to heal the damage. In this study, bisphenol E cyanate ester (BECy) was investigated as a potential resin for injection repair of bismaleimide-carbon fiber based composite panels for aircraft. Temperature sensitive repair applications required a technique that avoided the high temperature post-cure of the injection repair resin. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC) experiments were used to examine the degree of cross-linking and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of <b>under-cured</b> injection repair resin. The chemistry of cross-linking in <b>under-cured</b> BECy was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Lap shear tests of the <b>under-cured</b> injection repair resin on composite substrates revealed the influence of change in isothermal under-cure temperature on the bond strength. Temperature dependent dynamic mechanical analysis disclosed the significance of sub-Tg relaxations on the adhesive properties of the <b>under-cured</b> resin. Post-fracture surface analysis of the lap shear specimens, performed using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) micrographs, indicated a mixed mode of fracture {{in the form of a}} combination of resin and resin–composite interface failure.

30|$|Conversely, if the {{concentration}} of photoinitiators were kept too low, photocurable composite materials could be <b>under-cured.</b> If inadequate levels of conversion are achieved in the polymerization, mechanical properties and wear performance can be compromised [1], amount of leachable residual monomer increase and color stability may decline [4, 5, 7]. However, if conversion is maximized to reduce these difficulties, then problems inherent polymerization shrinkage of the composite become more critical [1].|$|E
40|$|This study investigates two {{technically}} simple {{methods to}} determine the irradiance distribution of light curing units that governs {{the performance of a}} visible-light curing resin-based composites. Insufficient light irradiation leads to <b>under-cured</b> composites with poor mechanical properties and elution of residual monomers. The unknown irradiance distribution and its effect on the final restoration are the main critical issues requiring highly sophisticated experimental equipment. The study shows that irradiance distributions of LCUs can easily be determined qualitatively with generally available equipment. This significantly helps dentists in practices to be informed about the homogeneity of the curing lights...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{postcure}} high energy (gamma), ultraviolet (UV) and thermal treatment on {{the properties of}} polyester-melamine clearcoats {{of a range of}} compositions has been investigated. Two initial cure conditions were used, of which one was 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 optimally 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 cured and the other undercured. It was found that postcure treatments, particularly gamma and UV, led to coatings of similar mechanical and thermal properties irrespective of initial cure, although the change in properties on postcure treatment was greater for the <b>under-cured</b> samples. The results were interpreted in terms of the effect of the treatments on the structure of the crosslinked matrices. The study suggests the possibility of the development of a dual-cure process for polyester-melamines, whereby cure optimization and property improvement can be achieved. This could also be used to 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 correct 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 for small variations in thermal cure levels brought about by adventitious online fluctuations in cure oven conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} time aging on {{mechanical}} behavior of optical fiber with partially cured coating is investigated experimentally. Fiber samples were drawn with different {{primary and secondary}} coating curing level. Fiber samples were exposed to fluorescent light and stored in a controlled laboratory environment. Tensile strength, two-point bend strength, primary & secondary coating diameters and curing of primary and secondary coatings were measured at various time intervals after draw upto 180 days. Dynamic fatigue of the samples was measured just after drawing and after 120 days of time aging. Increase in strength & fatigue, degree of curing of both primary & secondary coatings and decrease in coating diameters with time aging were observed. Weibull parameter (M-value) was also increased with time aging for the <b>under-cured</b> fiber. However, the increasing rate was different for various fiber samples and dependent on coating shrinkage and increase in curing level. It is found that mechanical properties of optical fiber have a strong relation on time aging and coating curing...|$|E
40|$|Glass fiber technology, {{which enables}} light {{transmission}} and communication over great distances, {{was developed in}} the U. S. and has evolved into a major industry in this country. Continuous innovation is required to maintain the leadership position that the U. S. enjoys in glass optical fiber technology. This project addressed a key quality assurance aspect of glass optical fiber and cable assembly production-namely, assuring full cure of the polymer coating that protects the fiber from physical damage and moisture degradation. Properly cured coatings are imperative for the cable-assembly industry because they provide protection from the environment and assure both mechanical strength and long-term performance of the cable assembly, The industry loses approximately 5 % of its production due to <b>under-cured</b> fiber. This loss amounts to roughly $ 70, 000, 000 per year. The standard procedure in the industry is to spot check cables after production because no on-line method has been available to continuously monitor cure during either the glass-fiber drawing process, which operates at high speeds of roughly 1 kilometer per minute, or the cable-assembly process. Many kilometers of out-of-specification material can therefore be produced before tests catch the flaw. This project strove to eliminate this delay...|$|E
40|$|For {{the first}} time {{influence}} of the carbon nanotubes obtained by catalyst synthesis in pseudoliquid layer and activated and non-activated carbon nanotubes obtained in high-tension discharge plasma on the mechanical-and-physical and pr otective properties of coating {{on the base of}} modified alkyd and epoxy primers was investigated. Carbon nanotubes injection methods in the form of suspension in polar (acetone, cyclohexanone, butanol- 1, ethyl cellosolve) and non-polar (o-dimethylbenzene) solvents for alkyd primers and in the form of suspension in Р - 5 А solvent and curing agent for epoxy primer were examined. In all cases the carbon nanotubes suspension in curing agent and solvent was produced by previous dispersion in cell ultrasonic bath during 15 minutes with further mixture during 20 minutes on laboratory dissolver with milling mixer. The investigation showed that modification of the alkyd primer Belakor with carbon nanotubes suspension in polar solvents increases primer properties to a greater degree than carbon nanotubes suspension in non-polar solvents. For epoxy primers it was determined that modification with carbon nanotubes suspension in solvents is more effective than in curing agent. The modification of epoxy primer with carbon nanotubes suspension in curing agent decreases coating properties in many cases, probably because of functional groups adsorption on the surface of carbon nanotubes, which results in <b>under-cured</b> coatings; it can be seen from decreasing hardness, and consequently, protection properties...|$|E
