5|$|From {{the early}} 15th century on the Shetlanders had sold their goods through the Hanseatic League of German merchantmen. This {{trade with the}} North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union when high salt duties {{prohibited}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression as the Scottish and local traders were not as skilled in trading with salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took <b>up</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmer/fishermen of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they now had to fish for these merchant-lairds.|$|E

With Dive Coasters that use floorless trains, {{in order to}} allow riders to load and unload the train, a movable floor is necessary. Because the front row has nothing in front of it to stop riders from walking {{over the edge of the}} station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the gate opens and the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. When the next train enters the station, the gate is closed and the floors are brought back <b>up</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> next riders board.|$|E
