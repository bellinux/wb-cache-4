40|$|Abstract:—Fault {{diagnostics}} of induction machines {{have been}} widely researched however, an integrated motor control with automated fault detection, prevention and condition monitoring is still missing. Condition monitoring can reduce the downtime of the processes and increase the maximum interval between failures, thus minimizing the number and cost of <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenances,</b> which is highly beneficial. Also an integrated approach can {{reduce the cost of}} the system and enhance its integrity. A new algorithm is introduced for control with embedded systems fault prediction and analysis of AC induction machines. The embedded control and diagnostics algorithm is implemented using the Analog Devices Blackfin ™ ADSP-BF 531 digital signal processor (DSP) which mainly controls the AC induction machine, and communicates to a Windows XP ™ PC through the USB to monitor and display the electrical parameters of the inverter and the Motor. The algorithm employs various techniques to detect and predict different faults of the AC drive system. In this paper the Inverter fault prediction and diagnosis are covered...|$|R
40|$|The gearbox {{is seen as}} one of {{the most}} {{important}} assets of a wind turbine, so a major concern is how to keep it running smoothly to maximise its service time and reduce the cost. However, wind turbines are often located at remote locations where icing is possible and likely, e. g. high altitudes or cold regions. This challenges the wind turbine stability and causes a variety of problems. Furthermore, rapid expansion of wind energy, along with high operation and maintenance costs, all lead to the need for a condition monitoring system which can offer diagnostics of present condition and prognostics of future condition to improve the reliability of wind turbine and reduce the cost of <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenances</b> and unexpected failures. The proposed approach is demonstrated by using a Bayesian Belief Network and Dynamic Bayesian Network under LabVIEW and GeNIe respectively. The proposed procedure is applied on a wind turbine gearbox model to show its feasibility...|$|R

In order to develop models evaluating aircraft availability, an understanding of these parameters, along with the corresponding metrics, is required. An analysis of historical data for a modern long range transport aircraft shows that <b>unscheduled</b> organizational-level <b>maintenance</b> and depot maintenance are the largest contributors to downtime.

In this thesis, the steps taken to implement an airline schedule recovery model in a realistic simulation of the U. S. airspace system are presented. The MIT Extensible Network Simulation (MEANS), an event based queueing model of the U. S.

Thus, the addition of a recovery model is critical to obtain accurate simulation results.

40|$|Frequent <b>unscheduled</b> random <b>maintenance</b> {{activities}} have significantly increased the operating cost of Offshore Wind Turbines (OWT).

This work performs a quantitative evaluation of the maintenance model suggested by Sinha Y et al.

This study suggests that the model put forward provides a comprehensive framework to make maintenance decisions for OWT components by questioning their Availability, Reliability, Safety, Productivity and Availability of Upgrade Technology. Some case studies have been discussed towards the end of this work that validates this model and brings financial benefits. It is expected that practical use of the maintenance decision model, along with relationships developed in this work, would result in planning for economical, effective and efficient OWT maintenance.

50|$|The {{motivation}} for pre-estimate aggregation {{may be that}} no ground truth data are available. This may occur in situations where diagnostics {{does a good job}} in detecting faults that are resolved (through maintenance) before system failure occurs. Therefore, there are hardly any run-to-failure data. However, there is incentive to know better when a system would fail to better leverage the remaining useful life {{while at the same time}} avoiding <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> (<b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> is typically more costly than scheduled maintenance and results in system downtime). Garga et al. REF describe conceptually a pre-estimate aggregation hybrid approach where domain knowledge is used to change the structure of a neural network, thus resulting in a more parsimonius representation of the network. Another way to accomplish the pre-estimate aggregation is by a combined off-line process and on-line process: In the off-line mode, one can use a physics-based simulation model to understand the relationships of sensor response to fault state; In the on-line mode, one can use data to identify current damage state, then track the data to characterize damage propagation, and finally apply an individualized data-driven propagation model for remaining life prediction.|$|E

40|$|International audienceStudies {{over the}} last 20 years have {{indicated}} that around Europe, the direct cost of maintenance is equivalent to between 4 % and 8 % of total sales turnover. The indirect cost of maintenance {{is likely to be}} a similar amount (Pinjala et al., 2006). Thus, in the countries where modern maintenance practices have yet to be well adopted by industry, the potential savings from modern maintenance are massive (Alsyouf, 2006). These modern and efficient maintenances imply to identify the root-cause of component failures, to reduce the failures of production systems, to eliminate costly <b>unscheduled</b> shutdown <b>maintenances,</b> and to improve productivity as well as quality. It means, for the companies, to migrate from their traditional reactive approach, which is “Fail and Fix” to “Predict and Prevent” (Lee et al., 2003). The advantage of the latter is that maintenance is performed only when a certain level of equipment deterioration occurs. This “Proactive” maintenance is mainly based on prognosis process often considered as the Achilles heel while its goal is fundamental for implementing anticipation capabilities. This paper looks into this issue by proposing the development of an innovative prognosis process integrating the modelling of maintenance actions and their impacts on system performances. It leads to offer a maintenance aided decision-making tool able of assisting the decision-maker in selecting the best maintenance plan to be carried out...|$|R

40|$|The {{reduction}} of the overall Life Cycle Costs (LCC) is a key issue in manufacturing sector. Among the various contributions to LCC an important part is due to Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) issues and therefore a substantial reduction in LCC {{can be achieved by}} a conscious decisions and planning. Besides the failure and repair characteristics, the R&M related costs vary according to the maintenance strategy and policy selected for each components that form the manufacturing system. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe a mathematical model that takes into account the R&M related fraction of the LCC in order to compare scenarios in which different maintenance strategies and policies are applied on the components of manufacturing systems. The calculations cover three policy possibilities: internal crew, external service (on-demand) and external service (annual contract).

On the basis of the proposed formulae, optimization is carried out with a view to find the best solution in economical aspect. Furthermore, the method takes into account the possibility of clustering the scheduled interventions with the intention of reaching a predefined availability constraint while keeping the costs as low as possible.

Hardware and software for reading data from the sensors has also been constructed. All hardware is built into a box where each sensor measures a controllable object, such as a motor and a heating element. The program for data acquisition uses an interrupt-based architecture so every time a big enough change is detected in one of the sensors the DDC-signal is updated by the program.

40|$|Longitudinal joints are {{the portion}} of the road where two lanes meet and are formed because the lanes are paved at {{different}} times. Longitudinal joints tend to be the weakest portion of the roadway, and yet few regulations exist to control their quality. Currently, Arkansas specifications for asphalt pavement do not include any requirements for the measurement of joint quality. The purpose of this research project is to determine the most effective method for evaluating longitudinal joints in hot-mix asphalt (HMA) pavements. Most of the literature concerning longitudinal joints focuses on density as the determining factor of quality because density is easy to measure, and denser pavement is less likely to allow air and water to penetrate. Numerous studies have determined that joints with higher densities perform better than those with lower densities. However, measurement of other asphalt properties could provide a good alternative to density testing as a means of quality control. For this project, three field test sites were chosen, one site which was of good quality, one which was of marginal quality, and one which was of poor quality. Several cores were taken from these sites across the longitudinal joint and analyzed using the following methods: AASHTO T- 166 (SSD), AASHTO T- 331 (CoreLok), Kuss displacement, percent water absorbed, ASTM PS- 129 (permeability), AASHTO T- 30 (gradation), and oven derived percent binder content. The data resulting from the various laboratory tests were visually and statistically analyzed to determine which method of testing yields data having the most direct correlation to the performance of the core and provides the greatest discrimination among the different levels of joint quality. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify which testing method shows the greatest relative differentiation of quality across the joint and from site to site so that this method may be studied further in order to recommend a minimum standard for the quality of longitudinal joints. By testing longitudinal joints and maintaining a minimum quality, the life of the pavement will be extended and the necessary amount of both scheduled and <b>unscheduled</b> pavement <b>maintenance</b> will be reduced, thus decreasing the cost of maintenance...|$|R

There are two possibilities of beta valve malfunction; mis-rigging after some maintenance work or fair wear & tear during routine service. Unfortunately, the beta system’s integrity and rigging status could not be verified because the propeller governor had been completely consumed in the post ground impact fire. However, it was confirmed from the documented history and the engineering staff that there was neither any reported defect related to the beta system nor was there any scheduled or <b>unscheduled</b> <b>maintenance</b> performed in the recent past. Therefore, the only probable cause of occurrence could be fair wear and tear of the beta valve.|$|E

Logistics is one essential administration {{that should be}} made by an organization. The logistic procedures consist of procurement, recording, storage, distribution, maintenance, and elimination. At present, the logistic activities at economics faculty are running quite well. However, based on the studies conducted by many researchers, the logistic impacts require further examination and analysis. The pre-research study based on interviews shows that no logistic staff handles the logistic management. For the time being, the logistic activities are handled by the public utility staffs.

40|$|Costs {{associated}} with <b>unscheduled</b> and preventive <b>maintenance</b> can {{contribute significantly to}} an airline's expenditure. Reliability analysis can help to identify and plan for maintenance events. Reliability analysis in industry is often limited to statistically based approaches that incorporate failure times as the primary stochastic variable, with additional strict assumptions regarding independence of events and underlying distributions of failure phenomena. This foregoes the complex nature of aircraft operations, where {{a whole range of}} operational factors may influence the probability of occurrence of a maintenance event. The aim of this research is to identify operational factors affecting component reliability and to assess whether these can be used {{to reduce the number of}} unscheduled occurrences (i. e. failures). To do so, a data-driven approach is adopted where historical operational and maintenance data is gathered and analysed to identify operational factors with a measurable influence on maintenance event occurrence. Both time-independent and time-dependent Proportional Hazard Models (PHMs), models which incorporate operational factors as covariates, are employed to generate reliability estimates. Results obtained from analysing historical data of a set of ten components with respect to unscheduled removals indicates that adopting new maintenance schedules, derived from the proposed reliability models, could reduce the number of unscheduled occurrences by approximately 37 %. The potential benefits of adopting the proposed strategy are extensive. Nonetheless, numerous assumptions have been introduced to overcome challenges imposed by the complex nature of the data.

40|$|The {{automation}} of {{the control}} to a power plant is indeed a challenge {{mainly because of the}} occurrences of random and unpredictable variations in output demands as well as because of highly non-linear behavior of the system itself. It is sometimes argued that the 'best' control for a power plant is the operators themselves. Experienced operators are capable of making decisions on the basis of incomplete and imprecise information. The extent to which these decisions are correct is a matter of speculation. Erroneous conclusions, established post facto, are chalked up to the learning process and in fact, contribute to the forming of a good, experienced control team. The need to automate the control process for a plant is even more acutely felt when considering the complexity of the plants themselves and the volume of data {{that would have to be}} processed before a control decision can be taken. Factored into this decision would also be several governing parameters such as costs, reliability, other constraints and their interdependency, as well as planned and <b>unscheduled</b> outages for <b>maintenance</b> and so on.

It is intended to demonstrate that thermal efficiency may be improved by better techniques for automated control of throttle valves in the steam turbine of the plant.
