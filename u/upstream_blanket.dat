50|$|Under {{the third}} stage of construction, works were carried out on the closure of {{diversion}} channel and construction of the dam in that portion while the river was made to flow through diversion tunnels. The remaining portion of <b>upstream</b> <b>blanket</b> and the main dam at higher levels was also completed as part of stage 3 works, which were concluded in 1976.|$|E
50|$|The main {{embankment}} dam and the <b>upstream</b> <b>blanket</b> were constructed across the main {{valley of the}} river Indus {{as part of the}} second stage of construction. During this time, water from the Indus river remained diverted through the diversion channel. By the end of construction works in stage 2, tunnels had been built for diversion purposes. Stage 2 construction took 3 years to complete.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, {{the problem of}} earth dam with <b>upstream</b> <b>blanket</b> is mathematically studied, to find effect of the blanket length on each of {{discharge}} and head loss due to blanket. It was found that mathematical solution is valid for the relative depth of the impervious layer ranging from 0. 014 to 0. 164. The recommended mathematical solution is compared with that given by Rezk and Nasr [1] {{and it is clear}} that mathematical results tends to experimental when (d/l) ⩾ 0. 60. Also head loss due to blanket in case of mathematical and experimental work is presented...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{rates are}} {{traditionally}} used for solving seepage problems in soils. In this paper, {{the method of}} fragments {{is presented as a}} good alternative for solving seepage problems. A user friendly and interactive computer program for the method of fragments has been developed. Several randomly selected problems are solved by the flow net method, the method of fragments and the finite difference method. It was found that the method of fragments and the finite difference method gave very close predictions of the quantity of flow, exit gradient and uplift force. Furthermore, the effects of different positions and lengths, and number of sheet piles, and <b>upstream</b> <b>blankets</b> on the values of quantity of flow, exit gradient and uplift force are examined...|$|R
40|$|Relief wells {{are used}} {{extensively}} to relieve excess hydrostatic pressure in pervious foundation strata overlain by impervious top strata, conditions which often exist landward of levees and downstream of dams and hydraulic structures. Placing well outlets in below-surface trenches or collector pipes helps dry up seepage areas downstream of levees and dams. Relief wells {{are often used}} in combination with seepage control measures, such as <b>upstream</b> <b>blankets,</b> downstream seepage berms, and grouting. Draining seepage water into relief wells decreases uplift and prevents piping. This study examined the effect of relief wells with different diameters at different distances downstream of a homogeneous earth dam using Seep/W software. Also the effect of upstream water level of reservoir on seepage flow to each well was carried out. Results show that by decreasing the distance between relief wells and increasing {{the diameter of the}} relief wells, total uplift pressure decreases. The optimum distance between relief wells to decrease uplift pressure was found to be 5 m. The proposed method is recommended in designing relief wells by providing optimum diameter and distance of wells for the sustained yield...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Determine the {{effective}} point of measurement (EPOM) of 12 thimble ion chambers, including miniature chambers and three models widely used for clinical reference dosimetry. The EPOM {{is the point}} at which the measured dose would arise in the measurement medium in the absence of the probe: For cylindrical chambers, it is shifted upstream relative to the central axis of the chamber. Although current dosimetry protocols prescribe a <b>blanket</b> <b>upstream</b> EPOM shift of 0. 6 r, with r as the chamber cavity radius, it has been shown in recent years that the EPOM does, in fact, depend on every detail of the chamber design and on the beam characteristics. In the wake of this finding, the authors undertake a comprehensive study of the EPOM for a series of chambers in water. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The Al-Fulaij {{recharge}} dam {{is located}} on the Al Batinah coast in Oman and was constructed in 1992. The dam is about 3. 3 km long and 7. 7 m high with a storage capacity of 3. 7 million cubic meters of water. It is an earthfill dam with silty, sandy gravel fill in the embankment. Excessive seepage of between 5, 000 – 12, 500 m 3 /day was observed during floods in 1993, and several sinkholes were noticed close to the upstream toe. Remedial work consisting of an <b>upstream</b> <b>blanket</b> and a cutoff trench wall was performed in 2000. However, these remedial measures failed and almost the same seepage was noticed again during the impoundment. This paper investigates possible causes of the seepage using a finite element model. The input data for the model were collected from site investigations and field records during the construction and monitoring of the dam. The study reveals that the most probable cause of the excessive seepage is the presence of a permeable soil layer underneath the dam due to the dissolution of the gypsum material...|$|E
