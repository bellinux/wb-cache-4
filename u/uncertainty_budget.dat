40|$|This volume {{presents}} measurement <b>uncertainty</b> and <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> {{in a form}} {{accessible to}} practicing engineers and engineering students from across {{a wide range of}} disciplines. The book gives a detailed explanation of the methods presented by NIST in the “GUM” – Guide to Uncertainty of Measurement. Emphasis is placed on explaining the background and meaning of the topics, while keeping the level of mathematics at the minimum level necessary. Dr. Colin Ratcliffe, USNA, and Bridget Ratcliffe, Johns Hopkins, develop <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> and explain their use. In some examples, the budget may show a process is already adequate and where costs can be saved. In other examples, the budget may show the process is inadequate and needs improvement. The book demonstrates how <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> help identify the most cost effective place to make changes. In addition, an extensive fully-worked case study leads readers through all issues related to an uncertainty analysis, including a variety of different types of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets.</b> The book is ideal for professional engineers and students concerned with a broad range of measurement assurance challenges in applied sciences. This book also: Facilitates practicing engineers’ understanding of <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets,</b> essential to calculating cost-effective savings {{to a wide variety of}} processes contingent on measurement Presents <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> in an accessible style suitable for all undergraduate STEM courses that include a laboratory component Provides a highly adaptable supplement to graduate textbooks for courses where students’ work includes reporting on experimental results Includes an expanded case study developing uncertainty from transducers though measurands and propagated to the final measurement that can be used as a template for the analysis of many processes Stands as a useful pocket reference for all engineers and experimental scientist...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper compares two {{techniques}} to assess uncertainty in emission measurements. The first approach, described in ISO 14956, defines a procedure to establish <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> from the systematic assessment of {{all relevant factors}} influencing the result. The second approach is based on inter- and intra-laboratory field experiments set out according to ISO 5725 - 2. These two concepts were applied during field validation of reference methods for sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are described in the European draft standards prEN 14791 and prEN 14792. For the SO 2 manual reference method, <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> are in excellent agreement with confidence intervals determined in field tests, {{due to the fact}} that the major uncertainty contribution is the chemical analysis of sulphate, which had previously been determined in an inter- laboratory study. Results obtained for the automatic NOx method show pronounced discrepancies between both approaches, illustrating that reliable <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> are only obtained if a number of demanding conditions are met...|$|R

5000|$|Until 2003 {{there were}} {{separate}} standards for exponential and linear integrating sound level meters, {{but since then}} IEC 61672 has described both types. The classic exponential meter was originally described in IEC 123 for 'industrial' meters followed by IEC 179 for 'precision' meters. Both of these were replaced by IEC 651, later renamed IEC 60651, while the linear integrating meters were initially described by IEC 804, later renamed IEC 60804. Both IEC 60651 and 60804 included four accuracy classes, called [...] "types". In IEC 61672 these were reduced to just two accuracy classes 1 and 2. New in the standard IEC 61672 is a minimum 60 dB linear span requirement and Z-frequency-weighting, with a general tightening of limit tolerances, {{as well as the}} inclusion of maximum allowable measurement uncertainties for each described periodic test. The periodic testing part of the standard (IEC61672.3) also requires that manufacturers provide the testing laboratory with correction factors to allow laboratory electrical and acoustic testing to better mimic Free field (acoustics) responses. Each correction used should be provided with uncertainties, that need to be accounted for in the testing laboratory final Measurement <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budget.</b> This makes it unlikely that a sound level meter designed to the older 60651 and 60804 standards will meet the requirements of IEC 61672 : 2013. These 'withdrawn' standards should no longer be used, especially for any official purchasing requirements, as they have significantly poorer accuracy requirements than IEC 61672.|$|E

40|$|Detailed <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> {{of three}} major {{ultraviolet}} (UV) ozone absorption cross-section datasets {{that are used}} in remote sensing application are provided and discussed. The datasets are Bass–Paur (BP), Brion–Daumont–Malicet (BDM), and the more recent Serdyuchenko–Gorshelev (SG). For most remote sensing application the temperature dependence of the Huggins ozone band is described by a quadratic polynomial in temperature (Bass–Paur parameterization) by applying a regression to the cross-section data measured at selected atmospherically relevant temperatures. For traceability of atmospheric ozone measurements, uncertainties from the laboratory measurements {{as well as from the}} temperature parameterization of the ozone cross-section data are needed as input for detailed uncertainty calculation of atmospheric ozone measurements. In this paper the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> of the three major ozone cross-section datasets are summarized from the original literature. The quadratic temperature dependence of the cross-section datasets is investigated. Combined <b>uncertainty</b> <b>budgets</b> is provided for all datasets based upon Monte Carlo simulation that includes uncertainties from the laboratory measurements as well as uncertainties from the temperature parameterization. Between 300 and 330  nm both BDM and SG have an overall uncertainty of 1. 5  %, while BP has a somewhat larger uncertainty of 2. 1  %. At temperatures below about 215  K, uncertainties in the BDM data increase more strongly than the others due to the lack of very low temperature laboratory measurements (lowest temperature of BDM available is 218  K) ...|$|R
