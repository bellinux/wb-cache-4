40|$|Object of {{the paper}} is the {{simulation}} of reinforced concrete bars behaviour, accounting for crack opening and concrete-rebar slippage. A macro beam element with a single <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> is studied in details in the uniaxial case. Distinct constitutive hypotheses are formulated for the materials. The CEB-FIP Model Code 90 rules the behaviour of the materials interface that is assumed to be fully dissipative. Steel is supposed to behave elastoplastically with hardening. Crack opening in the concrete matrix is introduced by means of a strong discontinuity approach (SDA). All the relevant equations of the problem are variationally derived from a mixed energy functional. Two enhancements of the enriched kinematics, based on polynomial or exponential shape functions, respectively, are compared with the usual SDA enhancement. As an alternative approach, high-order interpolation of the displacement field based on B-splines, both for steel and concrete, is proposed. These functions appear to be adequate in reproducing rapidly varying fields, like the stress gradients occurring in the shear lag problem near the boundaries or where slips and/or cracks occur. Their use allow to use few macro-element instead of the very dense meshing required in those areas by the traditional FE interpolations...|$|E

40|$|Social agents, {{both human}} and computational, inhabiting a world con-taining {{multiple}} active agents, need to coordinate their activities. This is because agents share resources, and without proper coordination or “rules of the road”, everybody will be interfering with the plans of others. As such, we need coordination schemes that allow agents to effectively achieve local goals without adversely affecting the problem-solving capabilities of other agents. Researchers {{in the field of}} Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) have de-veloped a variety of coordination schemes under different assumptions about agent capabilities and relationships. Whereas some of these research have been motivated by human cognitive biases, others have approached it as an engineering problem of designing the most effective coordination architec-ture or protocol. We evaluate individual and concurrent learning by mul-tiple, autonomous agents as a means for acquiring coordination knowledge. We show that a <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> learning algorithm suffices as a coor-dination mechanism in both cooperative and adversarial situations. Using a number of multiagent learning scenarios with both tight and loose coupling between agents and with immediate as well as delayed feedback, we demon-strate that agents can consistently develop effective policies to coordinate their actions without explicit information sharing. We demonstrate the vi-ability of using both the Q-learning algorithm and genetic algorithm based classifier systems with different payoff schemes, namely the bucket brigade algorithm (BBA) and the profit sharing plan (PSP), for developing agent coordination on two different multi-agent domains.

40|$|AbstractReinforcement schemes are a {{class of}} non-Markovian {{stochastic}} processes. Their non-Markovian nature allows them to model some kind of memory of the past. One subclass of such models are those in which the past is exponentially discounted or forgotten. Often, models in this subclass have the property of becoming trapped with probability 1 in some degenerate state. While previous work has concentrated on such limit results, we concentrate here on a contrary effect, namely that the time to become trapped may increase exponentially in 1 /x as the discount rate, 1 −x, approaches 1. As a result, the time to become trapped may easily exceed the lifetime of the simulation or of the physical data being modeled. In such a case, the quasi-stationary behavior is more germane. We apply our results to a model of social network formation based on ternary (three-person) interactions with <b>uniform</b> positive <b>reinforcement...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{properties}} of a metal matrix composites depend upon the properties of the reinforcement phase, of the matrix and of the interface. A strong interface bonding without any degradation of the reinforcing phase is one of the prime objectives {{in the development of the}} metal matrix composites. Therefore, the objective of this work is to characterize the interface structure of WE 43 /SiC particles composite. Magnesium alloys containing yttrium and neodymium are known to have high specific strength, good creep and corrosion resistance up to 250 °C. The addition of SiC ceramic particles strengthens the metal matrix composite resulting in better wear and creep resistance while maintaining good machinability. In the present study, WE 43 magnesium matrix composite reinforced with SiC particulates was fabricated by stir casting. The SiC particles with 15 μm, 45 μm and 250 μm diameter were added to the WE 43 alloy. The microstructure of the composite was investigated by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and XRD analysis. YSi and Y 2 Si reaction products are observed at the interfaces between SiC particles and WE 43 matrix in the composite stirred at 780 °C. Microstructure characterization of WE 43 MMC with the 45 μm, stirred at 720 °C showed relative <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> distribution. Moreover, the Zr-rich particles at particle/matrix interface were visible instead of Y-Si phases.

40|$|Geosynthetic {{reinforced}} soil (GRS) walls {{involve the}} use of geosynthetic reinforcement (polymer material) within the retained backfill, forming a reinforced soil block where transmission of overturning and sliding forces on the wall to the backfill occurs. Key advantages of GRS systems include the reduced need for large foundations, cost reduction (up to 50 %), lower environmental costs, faster construction and significantly improved seismic performance as observed in previous earthquakes. Design methods in New Zealand have not been well established and as a result, GRS structures {{do not have a}} uniform level of seismic and static resistance; hence involve different risks of failure. Further research is required to better understand the seismic behaviour of GRS structures to advance design practices. The experimental study of this research involved a series of twelve 1 -g shake table tests on reduced-scale (1 : 5) GRS wall models using the University of Canterbury shake-table. The seismic excitation of the models was unidirectional sinusoidal input motion with a predominant frequency of 5 Hz and 10 s duration. Seismic excitation of the model commenced at an acceleration amplitude level of 0. 1 g and was incrementally increased by 0. 1 g in subsequent excitation levels up to failure (excessive displacement of the wall panel). The wall models were 900 mm high with a full-height rigid facing panel and five layers of Microgird reinforcement (reinforcement spacing of 150 mm). The wall panel toe was founded on a rigid foundation and was free to slide. The backfill deposit was constructed from dry Albany sand to a backfill relative density, Dr = 85 % or 50 % through model vibration. The influence of GRS wall parameters such as reinforcement length and layout, backfill density and application of a 3 kPa surcharge on the backfill surface was investigated in the testing sequence. Through extensive instrumentation of the wall models, the wall facing displacements, backfill accelerations, earth pressures and reinforcement loads were recorded at the varying levels of model excitation. Additionally, backfill deformation was also measured through high-speed imaging and Geotechnical Particle Image Velocimetry (GeoPIV) analysis. The GeoPIV analysis enabled the identification of the evolution of shear strains and volumetric strains within the backfill at low strain levels before failure of the wall thus allowing interpretations to be made regarding the strain development and shear band progression within the retained backfill. Rotation about the wall toe was the predominant failure mechanism in all excitation level with sliding only significant in the last two excitation levels, resulting in a bi-linear displacement acceleration curve. An increase in acceleration amplification with increasing excitation was observed with amplification factors of up to 1. 5 recorded. Maximum seismic and static horizontal earth pressures were recorded at failure and were recorded at the wall toe. The highest reinforcement load was recorded at the lowest (deepest in the backfill) reinforcement layer with a decrease in peak load observed at failure, possibly due to pullout failure of the reinforcement layer. Conversely, peak reinforcement load was recorded at failure for the top reinforcement layer. The staggered reinforcement models exhibited greater wall stability than the <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> models of L/H= 0. 75. However, similar critical accelerations were determined for the two wall models due to the coarseness of excitation level increments of 0. 1 g. The extended top reinforcements were found to restrict the rotational component of displacement and prevented the development of a preliminary shear band at the middle reinforcement layer, contributing positively to wall stability. Lower acceleration amplification factors were determined for the longer <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> length models due to reduced model deformation. A greater distribution of reinforcement load towards the top two extended reinforcement layers was also observed in the staggered wall models. An increase in model backfill density was observed to result in greater wall stability than an increase in <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> length. Greater acceleration amplification was observed in looser backfill models due to their lower model stiffness. Due to greater confinement of the reinforcement layers, greater reinforcement loads were developed in higher density wall models with less wall movement required to engage the reinforcement layers and mobilise their resistance. The application of surcharge on the backfill was observed to initially increase the wall stability due to greater normal stresses within the backfill but at greater excitation levels, the surcharge contribution to wall destabilising inertial forces outweighs its contribution to wall stability. As a result, no clear influence of surcharge on the critical acceleration of the wall models was observed. Lower acceleration amplification factors were observed for the surcharged models as the surcharge acts as a damper during excitation. The application of the surcharge also increases the magnitude of reinforcement load developed due to greater confinement and increased wall destabilising forces. The rotation of the wall panel resulted in the progressive development of shears surface with depth that extended from the backfill surface {{to the ends of the}} reinforcement (edge of the reinforced soil block). The resultant failure plane would have extended from the backfill surface to the lowest reinforcement layer before developing at the toe of the wall, forming a two-wedge failure mechanism. This is confirmed by development of failure planes at the lowest reinforcement layer (deepest with the backfill) and at the wall toe observed at the critical acceleration level. Key observations of the effect of different wall parameters from the GeoPIV results are found to be in good agreement with conclusions developed from the other forms of instrumentation. Further research is required to achieve the goal of developing seismic guidelines for GRS walls in geotechnical structures in New Zealand. This includes developing and testing wall models with a different facing type (segmental or wrap-around facing), load cell instrumentation of all reinforcement layers, dynamic loading on the wall panel and {{the use of}} local soils as the backfill material. Lastly, the limitations of the experimental procedure and wall models should be understood...|$|E
40|$|When a {{component}} is produced from textile reinforcement, {{it is well}} known that the reinforcement conforms to the shape of the tooling, predominantly by in-plane shear deformation. Current structural analysis techniques for composite components frequently neglect the effects of this deformation on subsequent mechanical properties. In this thesis the effects of shear deformation in the reinforcement on mechanical properties of the composite are shown to be significant, both for flat laminates with <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> deformation, and for {{a component}} where deformation changes over the geometry. Methods are developed to predict the elastic behaviour and initial failure of components manufactured from textile reinforced composites, giving consideration to reinforcement deformation. One of the main objectives is to employ techniques which are purely predictive wherever possible, such that experimental test data are required principally for validation, rather than as input to the models. Implementation is performed in a modular fashion such that alternative models may be substituted at any stage in the procedure without affecting subsequent stages. Micromechanics models are employed to predict the properties of unidirectional composites from fibre and matrix properties and experimental validation is performed. A failure criterion is employed to determine lamina failure under biaxial loading. A simple model for woven fabric stiffness is implemented and extended to predict failure. Classical laminate theory is used to predict elastic and failure behaviour of angle-ply laminates; predictions are subsequently validated against experimental data. Material property and compaction models are incorporated into a draping simulation software tool which is used to create input files for structural analysis of components using layered shell finite elements, thought to be the most rigorous technique for textile composite components published to date. Results are shown to agree well with experimental data. To give full consideration of reinforcement geometry, initial studies of finite element modelling of the repeating unit cell are performed, whereupon the benefits and disadvantages of this technique are highlighted.

The paper reports test results of eight beams reinforced with {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP) or steel bars, combined with steel fibers. For given <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> ratio, different number and distribution of bars was assumed in the section. Experimental curvatures were checked against the predictions by design codes (Eurocode 2, ACI 318 and the new Russian code SP 52 - 101) and recommendations (Italian CNR-DT 203 and American ACI 440). The study examined capability of different code techniques to predict deformations of beams with varying reinforcement characteristics. It has been shown that distribution of reinforcement had a significant influence on the prediction accuracy. In a more elaborate analysis, the tension-stiffening effect was investigated using an inverse technique earlier developed by the authors. Stress-strain tension-stiffening relationships were obtained for each of the beams using the test moment-curvature diagrams. Unlike the common practice, the analysis took into account the shrinkage effect which was different for steel and GFRP reinforced elements. To verify adequacy of the obtained results of constitutive modeling, the derived tension-stiffening relationships were implemented into finite element simulation as material laws for tensile concrete.

40|$|Austenitic 316 L {{stainless}} steel alloy {{is an attractive}} industrial material combining outstanding corrosion resistance, ductility, and biocompatibility, with promising structural applications and biomedical uses. However, 316 L has low strength and wear resistance, limiting its high-performance applicability. Adding secondary hard nanoscale reinforcements to steel matrices, thereby forming steel-matrix nanocomposites (SMCs), can overcome these problems, improving the performance and thereby the applicability of 316 L. However, SMC parts with complex-geometry cannot be easily achieved limiting its application. This can be avoided through additive manufacturing (AM) by generating layer-by-layer deposition using computer-aided design data. Expanding the range of AM-applicable materials is necessary to fulfill industrial demand. This dissertation presents the characteristics of new AM-processed high-performance 316 L-matrix nanocomposites with nanoscale TiC or TiB 2 reinforcements, addressing specific aspects of material design, process control and optimization, and physical metallurgy theory. The nanocomposites were prepared by high-energy ball-milling and consolidated by AM selective laser melting (SLM). Continuous and refined ring-like network structures were obtained with homogenously distributed reinforcements. Additional grain refinement occurred with reinforcement addition, attributed to nanoparticles acting as nuclei for heterogeneous nucleation. The influence of reinforcement content was first investigated; mechanical and tribological behaviors improved with increased reinforcement contents. The compressive yield strengths of composites with TiB 2 or TiC reinforcements were approximately five or two times those of 316 L respectively. Hot isostatic pressing post-treatment effectively eliminated major cracks and pores in SLM-fabricated components. The effects of the SLM processing parameters on the microstructure and mechanical performance were also investigated. Laser re-melting through double-scanning created higher-density SLM-processed parts with improved mechanical properties but longer production times. Certain scanning patterns minimized texture, creating near-isotropic structures. The energy density η crucially improved densification {{at the expense of}} increased grain size, causing mechanical behavior tradeoffs. It also influenced the size and dispersion state of TiC. In-situ SMCs were fabricated by SLM, an encouraging low-cost processing approach for high-performance parts. Interestingly, in-situ SMCs exhibited higher microhardness values in comparison to the ex-situ composites under fixed SLM processing conditions because of fine, <b>uniform</b> <b>reinforcement</b> distribution.

For developing MMCs by liquid infiltration, preform will be required. In this research paper, developed a hybrid fiber preform and investigated their microstructure properties. Graphite nano fiber (GNF) and Alumina fiber were used for fabrication of the preform. The main objective of developing a preform is i) attainment of <b>uniform</b> distribution of <b>reinforcement</b> ii) minimization of mechanical and chemical damage. Since, it is extremely difficult to disperse nano-size fibers uniformly into the preform. An attempt has been made for hybrid preform with alumina micro-fiber and graphite nano fiber. Microscopic investigations revealed good disperse of the nanofibers in the preform...|$|R

The effect of different amounts of B 4 C on the microstructure and mechanical properties of aluminum matrix was examined. The maximum bending (238  ±  10  MPa) and compressive strength (330  ±  10  MPa) values were measured for composites sintered at 950 and 750  °C, respectively. The maximum hardness (112  Vickers) was measured for Al– 20  wt% B 4 C composite sintered at 850  °C. XRD investigations showed the decomposition of boron carbide and also the formation of Al 3 BC by heating the composites at 850  °C.

40|$|In this research, the {{mechanical}} properties and microstructure of Al- 15 wt % TiC composite samples prepared by spark plasma, microwave, and conventional sintering were investigated. The sintering process {{was performed by}} the speak plasma sintering (SPS) technique, microwave and conventional furnaces at 400 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C, respectively. The results showed that sintered samples by SPS have the highest relative density (99 % of theoretical density), bending strength (291 ± 12 MPa), and hardness (253 ± 23 HV). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigations showed the formation of TiO 2 from the surface layer decomposition of TiC particles.

The {{creep behaviour}} of the FGM is described by a Norton’s Power law. The effect of varying distribution of SiCP particles of creep stresses and creep rates in the FGM cylinder has been analyzed and compared with a cylinder, having <b>uniform</b> distribution of <b>reinforcement.</b> The study reveals that the increasing particle content in the cylinder, tangential and effective stresses increase near the inner radius but decrease near the outer radius.

40|$|Abstract — Aluminum alloy matrix {{composites}} {{have been}} receiving considerable attention as competitive materials {{due to their}} excellent mechanical and thermal properties compared with the conventional materials. This paper deals with stir casting of LM 6 (Aluminium alloy) /Gr (Graphite) particulate metal matrix composite and evaluation of its hardness. The casting of PMMC was performed by using a stir casting machine.

40|$|Abstract: Several {{technical}} challenges exist {{with the}} casting technology in achieving a <b>uniform</b> distribution of <b>reinforcement</b> within the matrix, which affects {{directly on the}} properties and quality of composite material. In the present study a modest attempt would be made to develop Aluminum based silicon carbide particulate MMCs with an objective to develop a conventional low cost method of producing MMCs and to obtain homogenous dispersion of ceramic material. To achieve these objectives two step-mixing method of stir casting technique has been proposed and subsequent property analysis has been made. Aluminum 6063 T 6 and SiC particle has been chosen as matrix and reinforcement material respectively. Experiments are planned for conducting varying weight fraction of SiC (in the steps of 5 %) while keeping all other parameters constant. The results would be evaluated by Tests-Hardness, Impact (including micro-structure) for this ’development method’. The trend of hardness and impact strength with increase in weight percentage of SiC would be observed and recommendation made for the potential applications accordingly...|$|R
