Two factors, namely bulk density (two levels) and sample composition (five levels) were considered. Thin sections were cut and the microfabrics studied in detail both qualitatively and quantitatively. A {{broad range of}} significant and systematic microfabric changes were observed. With {{an increase in the}} activity and content of the clay fraction, the void volume (especially those > 30 μm) decreased drastically whereas the shape changed from compound packing voids to occluded planar voids and vughs. Aggregates were flattened at contacts, became more angular and showed evidence of fusion into compound units. Related distribution patterns were altered from dominantly matrigranic to matrigranoidic, fragmoidic and porphyric with scattered vughs. There was a gradual closing of voids and a concomitant coalescence of aggregates. Plasmic fabrics showed mainly an increase in long (> 10 μm) and narrow (< 5 μm) but sharply defined plasma separations.

To provide a fundamental {{understanding of the}} mechanics and physical mechanisms governing the strength and ductility in heterogeneous nanostructured metals, we conduct both atomistic and crystal plasticity modeling studies of heterogeneous nanostructured metals in this thesis. The heterogeneous nanostructured metals studied include gradient nano-grained copper, transmodal grained aluminum and additively manufactured stainless steel. A general modeling framework is developed for heterogeneous nanostructures. Specifically, we develop a Voronoi tessellation-based geometrical method to build the heterogeneous nano-grained structures. The distribution of grain size and the spatial arrangement of nonuniform grains are fully controllable. We also develop a crystal plasticity finite element model that accounts for grain-size-dependent yield strength and strain hardening. The associated finite element simulations reveal both the gradient stress and gradient plastic strain. To gain mechanistic insights into the controlling deformation mechanisms in heterogeneous nanostructured metals, we perform large scale molecular dynamics simulations to reveal grain boundary-dominated plastic deformation. Moreover, we also perform atomistic studies of unit processes of plastic deformation, including dislocation slip, deformation twinning and grain boundary sliding, through direct coupling with in situ transmission electron microscopy experiment. The uncertainties arising from the heterogeneous grains {{with a variety of}} size and spatial distributions are quantified. Heterogeneous microstructures turn microstructure uncertainties into valuable features of material properties.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Kabuk deformasyonları belirleme çalışmaları jeoloji, jeofizik, jeodezi, inşaat ve maden müdendislikleri gibi farklı disiplinlerde çalışan bilim insanları tarafından yürütülmektedir. Günümüzde, levhalar üzerinde seçilen koordinatların deformasyon ölçümleri yapılabilmektedir. Bu tür ölçümler vasıtasıyla ilgili kabuk içerisinde birikmesi öngörülen gerilme değerleri ve belirlenen bu gerilme değerleri altında litosferin elastik özelliklerine bağlı olarak nasıl bir davranış sergileyeceğini tespit etmek mümkündür. Böylece plakaların hareketinden yola çıkarak plaka içerisinde birikmesi öngörülen basınç değerlerinin doğru bir şekilde yapılabilmesi için, GPS ölçümlerinin yüksek hassasiyette yapılması gerekmektedir. Benzer araştırmalar tektonik hareketlerin zamana bağlı davranışlarını anlama ve depremlerin meydana gelme olasılığını kestirme açısından hayati önem taşımaktadır. Ele alınan bölge için kabuk yapısında meydana gelen değişimlerin belirli bir zaman aralığında tespiti için kullanılması gereken ölçümlerin de sürekli olması gerekmektedir. Ancak bu şekilde deprem öncesi, deprem anı ve deprem sonrası ölçümleri yardımıyla fay hareketlerinin tanımlanması mümkündür. Bu çalışma kapsamında farklı bölgeler için hem sürekli GPS verileri hem de yıllık ortalama GPS verileri kullanılarak 3 farklı veri seti ile çalışılmıştır. Birinci çalışma alanını oluşturan, Türkiye ve çevresini kapsayan bölge için 7 adet sürekli ölçümleri bulunan GPS istasyonu ile bir GPS ağı oluşturulmuştur. 17 Ağustos 1999 Gölcük Depremi’nin oluşturulan GPS ağı üzerindeki etkisini belirlemek için 7 Mayıs 1998 ile 27 Temmuz 2008 tarihleri arasında kalan yaklaşık 10 yıllık bir zaman dilimini kapsayan GPS ölçümleri analiz edilmiştir. İkinci çalışma alanı yine Türkiye ve yakın çevresi için 1988 - 1997 yılları arasında yapılan GPS ölçümlerinin yıllık ortalaması kullanılarak toplam 32 adet GPS istasyonunu içeren ve ilk çalışmaya göre daha geniş kapsamlı olan bir ağ oluşturulmuştur. Üçüncü çalışma alanı Marmara Denizi ve yakın çevresini kapsayan GPS ağı 28 adet istasyon kullanılarak oluşturulmuştur. Elde edilen sonuçlar ile ilgili çalışma alanlarının asal gerilme haritaları konturlama yöntemi ile farklı temalar kullanılarak elde edilmiştir. Yapılan hesaplama ve haritalama çalışmalarının hepsinde MATLAB programından faydalanılmıştır. Elde edilen sonuçlar Türkiye’nin genel plaka tektoniği ile karşılaştırılmış ve sonuçların tutarlı olduğu görülmüştür. Sonuç olarak, günlük yaşamımızın bir parçası olan GPS sisteminin uzaktan algılama ve ölçme sistemlerinde son derece etkin ve gelişmeye açık bir sistem olduğu düşünülürse, yerkürenin dinamiğinin anlaşılması mümkündür. Bu çalışmada kurulan GPS ağının seyrekliği, kullanılan dataların kesikli ve kısa bir dönemi kapsaması bir dezavantaj gibi görülmesine rağmen daha yoğun GPS ağları ve daha zengin ve sürekli istasyon verileri kullanarak çok daha doğru sonuçlara gidilebileceği anlaşılmıştır. Turkey tectonically {{is part of}} {{the famous}} Alpine belt that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalaya Mountains. There are many large and small faults endowed with {{different}} mechanisms {{as a result of the}} collision of Arabian and African plate with Eurasian Plate. North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) is one of the most active region where very destructive earthquakes took place in the past, situated from Karlıova to Mudurnu. As a consequence of those tectonic movements East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ) generate many important earthquakes as well, starting from Antakya - Amik Basin to Karlıova junction. In addition to this situation, Eagen Graben System is very known active area in terms of earthquake occuring in the East Mediterranean Sea. Regarding these three very important earthquake zone, it can be said that Turkey is at risk in the sense of destructive earthquakes occuring obviously In the last century, Turkey was land owner of several catastrophic earthquakes like 1939 Great Erzincan Earthquake (M= 7. 9), 1943 Tosya Ladik Earthquake (M= 7. 2), 1999 Marmara Earthquake (M= 7. 5) and the last example is 2011 Van Earthquake (7. 2). Earthquakes which come with loss of life and property affect negatively to the countries in terms of materiality and spirituality. Due to that reason, prediction of some parameters like the time of the occuring, magnitude and location of earthquakes are investigated by many scientists from different disciplines. In the earthquake prediction researches there is not only deterministic approaches but also there are many stochastic approximations. For that purpose, great numbers of parameters are investigated just like, alteration of magnetic field and electrical field, flactuations of radon gas, changes of water level and temperature for water wells and anomaly behaviour of animals. Earthquake source parameters, fault slip length, hypocentral depth, spreading of the stress fields and reaction with other faults provides improved estimations of earthquake risk analyses. Reliably presenting of earthquake threat is enabled by constucting monitoring local, regional, national networks. Before, after and at the time of the earthquake, description of the physical and chemical changes that occured as a result of crustal deformation contribute to definition of active faults, reaction of the faults with eachothers, earthquake prediction research. With the new scientific approaches, scientists tried to protect from natural disasters by determining them more accurately. It is a major step that human beings enabled monitoring the planet from space by means of satellite technology. Technological improvements not only provide making more precise analysis about understanding of planet but also come with new approximation methods that should be interdisciplinary. In this manner, studies of earthquakes, fault mechanism, earthquake parameter determination and earthquake effects on surface and undergound are leaded by geology, geophysics, geodesy, civil and mining engineers. Firstly, GPS is used by USA-Ministery of Defence for military aims like finding directions, military attacts and rockets firings. After its permission for civil usage, it has got several application field such as geodesy, geophysics, archeology and mining. The Global Positioning System has been the most applicable to understand crustal movements, fault behaviours, periodicity of the earthqukaes. GPS consist of satellites spin around orbit continously and receiver-controler system situated definite position on plates. The satellites porpagate radio signals to receivers and GPS receivers enables positionings of stations. GPS technology is widely use by geodesy and photogrammetry for positionings borders, structures and map theme. By taking data from a GPS device repeatedly, movement along the faults and subduction zones between plates can be determined. Earthquakes can be describe as a complex elastik wave propagation due to relaxion of accumulated energy (flexibal deformation) in the faults. After the earthquakes, two type deformation emerge, static and dynamics deformation. Static deformation is a permanent (plastic) deformation depending on offset quantity and mechanism of the fault. Dynamic deformation propagates by elastical waves during and after fracturing of the fault and it cause to pressure, rotation and distortion. Reid, source of inspiration in this monitoring technology, is first person leaded to study about earthquake mechanism solution and crust deformation by geodetic measurements on San Francisco Earhquake back in 1906. Elastic rebound theory is an clarification for how energy is spread during earthquakes. According to Reid s theory, the geodetic network and triangulation station is being deformed when it is subject to any seismic forces, and faults behaviours can be modelled with the help of this theory. Determination studies of crustal deformation are conducted by many scientists work in different disciplines. Nowadays, deformation measurements of specific coordinate which take place on the plates is available. By the help of these measurements, expected stress value that accumulated in crustal and under these stress values ascertainment of litosphere s behaviour that depends on its elastical properties is available. In order to do these calculation correctly GPS measurements have to have high presicion. These researches have vital importance from the view point of understanding time dependent tectonic movements and prediction of occurrence probability. The biggest disadvantage of GPS technology is being dependant to USA decision as seen 2003 Iraq War. Due to these manipulations, GPS stations don t have continous data. These kind of shortages removed by linearization. Regarding the area to be considered, the measurements which are to determine the changes in structure of crustal that occurred in specific time should be continual. Only when this applied, the fault behaviours can be defined by means of the measurements that are taken before the eartquake, at the time of earthquake and after the earthquake. Three different data sets are worked by using the continous and year average of GPS data sets for different regions in the extent of this study. Referring to the results of the study areas, the principal stress maps are obtained by making use of contouring methods with using different themes. All of this application is executed in MATLAB. Anayzing, visualization and mapping application for all of the study areas are composed of some hierarchy coding in MATLAB. Firsly, latitude and longitude values of stations are executed for the interested study area. After that, lateral displacement component of the stations are executed to the MATLAB Workspace as inputs. And then coordinat values of coastal lines for the interested study area are entered to the MATLAB. After that input execution, decisive parameters like <b>unit</b> <b>deformation</b> velocity tensor, stress velocity tensor, principal velocity values and rotations of this values are obtained by doing some linear assumption. Seven GPS stations which have continous measurements and a GPS network are created for the region of the first study area and its surroundings. To determine the effect of 17 August 1999 Gölcük Earthquake on GPS network, GPS measurements that cover approximately 10 yers time period between 7 May 1998 and 27 July 2008 are analyzed. To determine whether there is any relationship between changes in GPS datas and earthquakes or not, 1356 earthquake record is defined that covered the study area between 7 May 1998 and 1 January 2006. Earthquake data sets are obtained from Kandilli Observatory and Earthquake Research Institution. Taking into consideration of finite element network for the first study area, for the most affected element by 17 August 1999 Gölcük Earthquake, displacement and stress alterations are compared with definite earthquake records. According to the comparisons, after the 17 August Gölcük Earthquake, there is a strict harmony between seismicity of the area and strain velocity and <b>unit</b> <b>deformation</b> velocity. In so far as roughness of the GPS network and because of linear behaviour assumption of the crust, creep behaviour that should be observed in especially Ismetpasa segment of the North Anatolian Fault can t be obtained. When principal stress maps are investigated for the first study area, stress values are compatible with tectonics of the areas. Most affected element of the network takes place in Aegean region, hence this region is one of the most famous area in terms of earthquake activity. Principal stress maps refer that there is not only a decreasing of the stress values but also shows that there is a counter clockwise rotation of the stress values. For second study area which take place on Turkey and surrounding, by considering yearly avarage GPS measurements between 1988 and 1997 which involde 32 GPS station and 51 element, more detailed than first study network is designed. The measurements cover all area from Cucasus Mountains to Adriatic Sea and from north of the African plate to south margin of the Europian plate. After analyzing of the second study area, when distribution of the principal stress values are investigated, regions that contain the highest stress values like Erzincan and surrounding area, Eagen costlines and Saros Gulf are at the same time most active regions in terms of sesimic activity. Also, there is a obvious lineament between the distribution of the shearing stress values and North Anatolian Fault. This Lineaments proofs right lateral strike baheviour for the NAFZ. As it is well known, after Marmara and Düzce Earthquake,Marmara region is a center of attention for many scientists who are from different disciplines. Especially, there are many studies for the Marmara region about determination of the faults mechanism and periodicity for taking some precaution to be protected from destructive effects of earthquakes. In the third study area, the most appropriate GPS network is constructed and using the finite element method proposed by Aydan (2000), the variation of the quantity and the direction for the principal stress distribution is executed in Marmara Sea and the vicinity of it. The last study area GPS network that cover Marmara Sea and nearby is created with using 28 GPS station and 43 element. According to maps show distribution the principal stress values, the most notable areas in terms of high shearing stress are compatible with clustering of epicentres. The results obtained are compared with Turkey’s plate tectonic and they are consistent with each other. In conclusion, as a part of our daily life GPS which is a system of remote sensing and measurement is very effective and open-to-improvement instrument for defining earth dynamics. With the widespread usage of GPS scientif researchers would be able to understand nature easily. Although in this study, analyzied data and density of the networks for all case studies were rough, by using more dense network and more continous GPS time series, better result could be obtained.

In computer games or simulations it is often useful to allow the user to modify the terrain since this can help to foster immersion.

We present a new terrain deformation framework which is able to produce persistent, real-time deformation by utilising the capabilities of current generation GPUs.

In central Alexander Island, several distinct lithologic associations can be identified, including two interpreted as underplated units: (i) a sandstone-mudstone association, consisting of thin- to medium-bedded non-channelled turbidite deposits, representing probable trench fill, and (ii) a basalt-chert association, representing oceanic crustal rocks, and its siliceous sedimentary cover. These two units are complexly deformed by dominantly westward-(oceanward-) directed thrusting. Structural relief introduced by later faulting reveals {{a wide range}} of structural styles and metamorphic grades representing different levels within the progressively deforming underplated <b>units.</b> <b>Deformation</b> ranges from thrust-related stratal disruption of poorly-lithified clastic sediment, achieved by independent particulate flow and cataclasis, through solution-dominated processes in clastic and siliceous rocks, to the development of pervasive cleavage fabrics at green-schist and transitional blueschist facies, with local crystal-plastic deformation. Later deformation (crenulation fabrics and isolated zones of folding) is of uncertain origin but probably resulted from further accretionary adjustments within the underplated units. The deepest levels may have been partially exhumed by syn-accretionary backthrusting or by transpression within a strike-parallel zone related to oblique convergence. Microstructural evidence reveals the importance of fluids in controlling deformation. Fluids were introduced with the underthrusting sediment and/or were generated during diageneis and metamorphism. In particular, evidence for locally elevated pore-fluid pressures is consistent with the rapid tectonic burial of a lithologically heterogeneous sequence and its subsequent evolution in a semi-closed system, with only limited fluid escape. Such microstructural criteria may be crucial to the identification of underplated units in other ancient accretionary prisms where the overall large-scale structural geometry cannot be reconstructed from fragmentary exposures...|$|R

However, the origin of such fabrics is still not well understood. The most commonly accepted hypothesis is that such textures originate by a magmatic flow mechanism. In order to characterise this mechanism and test the possibility of generation of strong magmatic fabrics, in-situ experiments on the orientation of crystals in an already partially crystallised magma are being conducted. The experimental procedure is divided in two steps: partial crystallisation of glass cylinders in Internally Heated Pressure Vessels (IHPV), followed by the deformation of the cylinders at 0. 1 MPa. Experiments are conducted on the Eburru rhyolite (Kenya), a massive, bubble- and crystal-free, peralkaline obsidian with 0. 2 wt % H 2 O, from which glass cylinders have been cored. In order to explore {{a wide range of}} crystallisation, partially crystallised cylinders are produced at different temperatures between 700 °C and 900 °C and 150 MPa. Kinetics of crystallisation of peralkaline magmas ensure a fast attainment of chemical equilibrium (100 to 300 hours depending on temperature). Deformation experiments are conduced in a new apparatus designed to deform cylindrical samples (L= 10 - 15 mm – Ø= 5 mm) of crystal-bearing magma. This new apparatus works on the principle of the parallel-plate viscosimeter (coaxial strain). It allows deformation to be performed at different temperatures, pressures, strain rates, shortening ratios, and viscosity to be measured as well. Calibration measurements of the apparatus on viscosity of the standard melt DGG 1 and the Eburru rhyolite at 0. 1 MPa have demonstrated its precision to be within ± 0. 2 log <b>units.</b> <b>Deformation</b> experiments are conduced at 0. 1 MPa between 600 °C and 850 °C. Due to the short duration of experiments, neither new crystallisation nor bubble nucleation occurs. The results obtained from deformation at 0. 1 MPa will be presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|A new {{mesoscale}} modeling {{technique for}} the thermo-mechanical behavior of metallic glasses is proposed. The modeling framework considers the shear transformation zone (STZ) as the fundamental <b>unit</b> of <b>deformation,</b> and coarse-grains an amorphous collection of atoms into an ensemble of STZs on a mesh. By employing {{finite element analysis}} and a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, the modeling technique is capable of simulating glass processing and deformation on time and length scales greater than those usually attainable by atomistic modeling. A thorough explanation of the framework is presented, along with a specific two-dimensional implementation for a model metallic glass. The model is shown to capture the basic behaviors of metallic glasses, including high-temperature homogeneous flow following the expected constitutive law, and low-temperature strain localization into shear bands. Details {{of the effects of}} processing and thermal history on the glass structure and properties are also discussed. United States. Office of Naval Research (contract N 00014 - 08 - 1 - 0312...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAggregation-induced {{crystallization}} of iron iodate nanorods within organic-inorganic aggregates {{of primary}} amorphous precursors is probed by time-dependent hyper-Rayleigh scattering measurements in Triton X- 100 based-microemulsions. In {{the context of}} a growing interest of noncentrosymmetric oxide nanomaterials in multi-photon bioimaging, we demonstrate by a combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy that an increase in the synthesis of temperature results in faster crystallization kinetics and in a better shape-control of the final Fe(IO 3) (3) nanorods. For initial microemulsions of fixed composition, room-temperature synthesis leads to bundles of 1 - 3 mu m long nanorods, whereas shorter individual nanorods are obtained when the temperature is increased. Results are interpreted in terms of kinetically unfavorable mesoscale transformations due to the strong binding interactions with Triton molecules. The interplay between the nanorod crystallization kinetics and their corresponding <b>unit</b> cell <b>deformation,</b> evidenced by lattice parameter refinements, is attributed to a temperature-dependent adsorption of surfactants molecules at the organic-inorganic interface...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} disordered atomic structure, {{amorphous}} metals (termed metallic glasses) have fundamentally differentdeformation mechanisms compared with polycrystalline metals. These different mechanisms give metallic glasses high strength, but {{the extent to}} which they affect other macroscopic deformation properties is uncertain. For example, the nature of the plastic-yield criterion is a point of contention, with some studies reporting yield behaviour roughly in line with that of polycrystalline metals,and others indicating strong fundamental differences. In particular, it is unclear whether pressure- or normal stress-dependence needs to be included in the plastic-yield criterion of metallic glasses, and how such a dependencecould arise from their disordered structure 1 – 4. In this work we provide an atomic-level explanation for pressure-dependent yield in amorphous metals, based on an elementary <b>unit</b> of <b>deformation.</b> This simple model compares favourably with new atomistic simulations of metallic glasses,as well as existing experimental data. In polycrystalline metals, the fundamental unit of plasti...|$|R
40|$|The Southern Variscan Front in the Tinerhir area {{involves}} Palaeozoic allochthonous units (Ouaklim and Tilouine units) thrust {{onto the}} northern edge of the West African Craton during late Carboniferous time. Illite crystallinity data highlight an anchizonal grade for the Ouaklim Unit, and a diagenesis-anchizone transition for the Tilouine <b>Unit</b> during <b>deformation</b> phase D 1. The tectonic stack is crosscut by major dextral reverse faults bounding E–W trending domains of dominant shortening deformation (central domain) and strike-slip deformation (northern and southern domains), later segmented by a network of post-Variscan faults. This complex deformation pattern is the result of kinematic partitioning of dextral transpression along the Southern Variscan Front, coeval with the Neovariscan (300 – 290 Ma) oblique convergence observed at the scale of the whole Moroccan Variscides. Partitioning of dextral transpression described in the Tinerhir area is consistent with dextral wrench faulting along the Tizi n’ Test Fault, and with Appalachian-style south-directed thrusting in the Tinerhir and Bechar-Bou Arfa areas...|$|R

SensorTape is {{composed}} of interconnected and programmable sensor nodes on a flexible electronics sub-strate. Each node can sense its orientation with an inertial measurement <b>unit,</b> allowing <b>deformation</b> self-sensing of the whole tape. Also, nodes sense proximity using time-of-flight infrared. We developed network architecture to automatically determine the location of each sensor node, as SensorTape is cut and rejoined. Also, we made an intuitive graphical inter-face to program the tape. Our user study suggested that Sen-sorTape enables users with different skill sets to intuitively create and program large sensor network arrays. We devel-oped diverse applications ranging from wearables to home sensing, to show low deployment effort required by the user.

40|$|The {{southern}} {{margin of}} the Caribbean Plate is well exposed in the Cordillera de la Costa of northern Venezuela, where amalgamated terranes consisting of continental and oceanic units occur. In the Cordillera de la Costa, metamorphosed oceanic units crop out along the coast near Caracas. Among them, the Tacagua unit is characterized by metaserpentinites and metabasites showing mid-oceanic ridge basalt geochemical affinity. These lithologies, representative of a disrupted ophiolite sequence, are associated with metasediments consisting of calcschists alternating with pelitic and psammitic schists, whose protoliths were probably represented by deep-sea hemipelagic and turbiditic deposits. In the Tacagua <b>unit,</b> a polyphase <b>deformation</b> history has been reconstructed, consisting of four folding phases from D 1 to D 4. Geological setting suggests an involvement of the Tacagua unit in the processes connected with a subduction zone. The following deformations (from D 2 to D 4) observed in the field {{might be related to}} the exhumation history of the Tacagua <b>unit.</b> The late <b>deformation</b> history consists of an alternation of deformation phases characterized by displacement parallel (D 2 and D 4 phases) and normal (D 3 phase) to plate boundary between the Caribbean and South America Plates. All lines of geological evidence suggest that the whole evolution of the Tacagua unit was acquired in a setting dominated by oblique convergence, in which alternation of strike-slip and pure compressional or pure extensional tectonics occurred through time...|$|R

In this approach the representative microstructure of two-phase lamellae has been simplified in a unit cell model. The lamellar fracture, which can be interlamellar and translamellar type, has been described in the unit cells where the underlying debonding and cleavage mechanisms have been captured using cohesive damage behaviour. The macroscopic response of material failure has been calculated from the lower scale <b>unit</b> cell <b>deformation</b> and fracture behaviour. Stress-strain behaviour of undamaged state has been calculated using first order homogenization approach and the damaged behaviour has been calculated averaging the local stress-strain evolution at the damage zone after the onset of cracks as described by cohesive model.

A parameter, the quasi-nearest atom, is used to characterize the configurational disorder in metallic glasses.

The broad configurational disorder regions distribution is the indicator of abundant potential <b>deformation</b> <b>units</b> and relaxations. Plastic flow, as well as relaxation, is believed to start at configurational disorder regions.
