50|$|Many of {{the young}} sailors who have {{represented}} Canada in international competition have been members of, or trained by, the Royal Hamilton Yacht Club. For nearly half a century, RHYC's Youth Sailing Program, and, more recently, its Graduate Program, have helped these {{young men and women}} develop the skills and attitudes they need to excel in international competition. The success of these is due largely to the work of dedicated volunteers from the RHYC sailing community. Recent awards won by young Hamilton sailors include the E. Aileen Clarke Youth Performance Ranking Trophy awarded to the highest-ranking Club in the 13 and Under Provincial Youth Regatta Series (2005, 2001), and the <b>Unistrut</b> Central Youth Performance Ranking Trophy for winning the 16 and under series in 1998.|$|E
40|$|Transfers {{are crucial}} for {{independent}} mobility. However, transfers can cause problems if appropriate precautions are not considered. For instance, transfers {{can result in}} skin damage, overstretching of the low back, wrist and fingers, excessive motion in unstable spinal segments, and shoulder injury. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop and evaluate a transfer measurement system, to determine an objective method to delineate the different phases of a transfer, and to determine the peak dynamic joint forces and moments at the wrist, elbow, and shoulder experienced by wheelchair users with paraplegia during a level tub bench transfer. A transfer measurement system was developed which consists of a steel frame, two <b>unistruts,</b> two handrail attachments, two aluminum-mounting plates and two force-plates. A mock trial was conducted to determine whether the transfer systems performed correctly. The types of the transfer surfaces that we can evaluate include a tub bench, a toilet seat, and car seat. The phases of transfer from wheelchair to tub bench and back were identified based on force plate data and position and velocity of trunk marker (C 7). The phase identification method was used to identify the approximate force coming on the hand during tub bench transfer using force plate data. We studied nine paraplegic subjects transferring from wheelchair to level tub bench and back. We modeled the arm as a serial linkage mechanism in analyzing the peak dynamic joint forces and moments. It was found that peak net joint dynamic forces at the joints are greater in the trailing arm than in the leading arm. It was observed that the peak joint forces were minimum at the wrist and maximum at the shoulder in all nine subjects with paraplegia. The moments at the wrist were lower than the moments at the shoulder. In wheelchair to tub bench transfer, there was an inverse relationship between wrist force and transfer time. Examining leading and trailing arm forces in conjunction with transfer time may assist in modifying transfer styles in individuals with weakness, strength imbalance and shoulder pathologies...|$|R
50|$|RapidBlocs are a {{moveable}} obstacle system. The {{system was}} developed by Scott Shipley of S2o Design and Engineering and Andy Laird of Engineering Paddler Design. The system was developed for the Lee Valley White Water Centre that {{was used for the}} 2012 London Olympic Games. The system is made of modular blocs, among other shapes, that can be secured via <b>unistrut</b> at any point in a compatible channel. The blocs are stackable and can therefore be combined to create a variety of shapes. These shapes are configured to create waves, eddies, other hydraulic jumps. There are also a variety of utilitarian configurations that can be created to make stairs, rescue platforms, and to configure varying rescue scenarios for rescue training. At the London Games the RapidBloc system created all of the waves and features and was also used to create the starting gate.|$|E
50|$|The {{front of}} house sound {{position}} is somewhat unusually {{located at the}} rear of the Dress Circle. Another oddity is the motor hanging points for the advance truss, which are not parallel with the line of the front of stage. The Auditorium Left point is about 500 mm further into the auditorium than the centre and house right. Towards the rear of the stalls, there is 41 mm <b>unistrut</b> Product 221-724 fixed to the ceiling to facilitate the hanging delay speakers. In the Gallery there is also a winch bar across the full width of the auditorium to again facilitate the hanging of delay speakers. The theatre now benefits from a lift to bring up 45' trailers and tractor units up to stage level, which is three floors below street level {{at the rear of}} the theatre.|$|E
5000|$|Many major {{industries}} have {{located in the}} village over the years. The Prouty and Glass Carriage Factory was the first, moving from Detroit in 1888. At the time, this made Wayne the largest carriage and sleigh producer in the country. In 1899, the Detroit interurban railroad (a streetcar system connecting Detroit to outlying towns) reached Wayne and ran until 1929. Ray Harroun, winner of the first Indianapolis 500, built the Harroun motor car in Wayne from 1916-21. The Gotfredson Truck was produced from 1924-27, and The Graham-Paige car company made vehicles in Wayne from 1928-36. Stinson Aircraft was also located at the nearby Detroit Industrial Airport and produced small planes from 1926-48. The Michigan Assembly Plant was built in 1957, and the Gar-Wood company built garbage trucks and hydraulic equipment from 1947-72.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} work {{to characterize}} the <b>Unistrut</b> steel connection method for M 10 blind fixings using pultruded fiber- reinforced polymer (PFRP) profiles of channel section. Both the standard nut and a smooth nut (standard without the serrations), {{have been used in}} the series of tests to determine the degree of shear connection via load-slip behavior, under various applied bolt torques, and pure shear loading. It is shown that the standard nut provides adequate connection shear strength and stiffness, but with severe PFRP material damage that might be detrimental to the connection's structural performance over 30 years or more. The smooth connection is shown to significantly reduce PFRP damage. However, this advantage is linked to a 35 % reduction in the connection's shear resistance, making it less suitable for the development of an economic connection. Preliminary hot/wet aging and creep tests are used to estimate the reduction in strength and stiffness with time. The test results are used to establish four <b>Unistrut</b> connection design parameters that are required for the development of lightweight modular systems of PFRP...|$|E
40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} is an {{evaluation}} of a novel box beam system of Pul- truded Fibre Reinforced Polymer (PFRP) shapes. The flat-pack modular beam system consists of separate PFRP flange and web shapes joined together with a new method of mechanical fastening. It {{is based on the}} first generation Star- tlink building system, conceived by UK engineers in 1999. The Startlink building system is introduced, and classified within the scope of Modern Methods of Con- struction (MMC), and its merits are discussed. In the context of MMC a critical review by the author finds that, although the proposed 1999 generation Startlink system offers design flexibility, it will probably have a limited market potential. The novel use of the steel MlO <b>Unistrut</b> connection method as a means of fastening distinct PFRP shapes in a building system is characterised. Individ- ual connector design parameters for joint stiffness and resistance are identified and determined, under pure shear loading. The results of a series of physical tests show no significant loss of stiffness or strength with long term environmen- tal exposure. Values of key mechanical properties for design calculations are recommended. A 400 x 200 x 2848 mm prototype PFRP box beam assembly is fabricated from two flange and two web panel-type shapes, cut from existing off-the-shelf PFRP shapes. This is 60 mm deeper than the largest single PFRP shape that {{could be used as a}} beam. The assembly is joined at the web-flange junction with M 10 <b>Unistrut</b> connectors set at various spacing's, in the range 50 to 400 mm. These connectors carry the longitudinal shear that is generated between the joined shapes when the modular assembly is in flexure, Theoretical deflections, cal- culated using a modified form of a partial-interaction analysis model developed for composite concrete and steel structures, are predicted for the assembly ac- counting for the finite shear stiffness of the web-flange connection. A series of 16 four-point bending load tests on the beam assembly, across two load arrange- ments, show that its performance is linked to the designated spacing of the M 10 <b>Unistrut</b> connections. The flexural rigidity and degree of interaction present in the assembly are determined from analysis of vertical deflections and longitudi- nal strains, as the beam is deformed. The influence of secondary effects, due to the poor tolerances achieved in the hand fabrication of the beam's assembly, are found to greatly affect the ability of the deflection analysis to give the required measured deflections. Comparison of the effective joint shear rigidities obtained from theory and testing indicates a higher individual connection stiffness in the prototype beam than previously determined by way of the individual <b>Unistrut</b> connector characterisation. It is found through the combined analytical and physical testing research that the M 10 <b>Unistrut</b> connection method can only provide the necessary joint shear stiffness and resistance to the 400 mm deep beam if the connector spacing, along the four joints, is ≤ 50 mm. The total number of connectors this represents in the beam is likely to make this modular construction approach too expensive for it to be commercially viable. Although the M 10 connector could be used to fabricate beams of lesser depths, since the number of connectors will then be reduced, these beams would find it difficult to compete with the available off-the-shelf PFRP beam shapes, of up to 300 mm deep. There is however scope to use the <b>Unistrut</b> method of connection to provide longitudinal shear resistance in building systems where, for example, a floor panel is to be stiffened by a channel shaped beam and the overall depth is ≤ 300 mm. The research work contained {{in this thesis}} has contributed to a radical change in the PFRP product offerings now proposed in the 2006 generation Startlink building system. ...|$|E

Containment techniques can be very costly, ungainly and time consuming to construct. A novel containment concept is introduced which is fabricated out of modular sections of polycarbonate glazed into a <b>Unistrut</b> metal frame. A containment study for a high speed centrifuge is performed which includes the development of parameters for secondary containment design.

40|$|The Los Alamos LSDDP {{demonstrated}} a Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear to remove legs from plutonium glove boxes. The baseline technology used at LANL for removal of glove box legs is a reciprocating saw. Legs on glove boxes are typically either 3 -inch diameter pipe or <b>unistrut.</b> During the demonstration, the Mega-Tech hydraulic cutting shear cut eight pipe legs in 15 minutes, while the reciprocating saw took 45 - 60 minutes {{to cut through}} eight legs, including a rest break to alleviate worker fatigue. Despite its lower production rate, the reciprocating saw may be favored in confined spaces, {{because it does not}} require as much access room as the hydraulic shears. Based on the faster production rate of the hydraulic shear, LANL and Rocky Flats are expected to begin using the hydraulic shear as their new baseline technology to remove legs from over 1, 500 plutonium glove boxes at the two sites...|$|E
40|$|A bench-scale shake {{table was}} {{designed}} and constructed for the Swarthmore College Engineering Department. The frame of the shake table was made of <b>Unistrut.</b> It's powered by a motor with a complete built-in servo control system that takes analog output as the velocity through an A/D converter. Two transfer functions were developed: one that connects the motor to the base plate and the other connecting the plate to a simple test structure (lumped mass model). Sensors (LVDT and accelerometers) were hooked onto the base plate and structure to measure acceleration and displacement data to {{be sent back to}} Matlab for further analysis and plotting. We used Matlab's linear simulator (lsim) to calculate the theoretical output for a known input waveform, and compared the results to the actual measured output (by the accelerometer).

40|$|A {{hoisting}} {{rail system}} has been designed for lifting loads from the north sidewalk of the D 0 collision hall into the collision hall pit. This engineering note documents the design. The hoisting system was conceived primarily to aid in getting heavy loads into the pit during short (less than a few days) accesses. The typical use for the hoist will be to lift a BLS power supply (120 lbs) and carrier (16 lbs) from a roll around cart {{on the sidewalk and}} onto a similar cart in the collision hall pit. The hoist system will alleviate the need for two persons to carry this heavy load up and down a narrow (24 -inch) staircase. The hoisting system has a designed lift rating of 150 lbs. All members and components are well within a conservative safety factor when subjected to this loading at it's worst possible configuration, that is with it's boom cantilevered out 8 feet from the base rail. See the hoisting rail assembly sketch (in the hand calculations section) and the picture inserted below to get an orientation of the device. The hoisting system is designed using BLine 'unistrut' system components. The hoist consists of a 'base' rail that is fastened to either the northeast or northwest air handler platforms. This fixed base rail has (2) two sided trolley assemblies inserted into it's lower <b>unistrut</b> member. One assembly is locked in place on the base rail. Another is locked in place on the lower 'boom' rail. The trolley assemblies are free wheeling which allows boom movement in the north-south direction about 7 1 / 2 feet within the fixed base rail. An electric hoist hangs from the 'boom' rail on a single trolley. The hoisting system meets Fermilab Environment and Safety Manual chapter 5021 entitled 'Overhead cranes hoists and rigging'. Inclusive in that requirement is that it meets the applicable Fermilab 'work smart standards' of ANSI B 30. 11 - 1998 'Monorails and underhung cranes', and ANSI B 30. 16 - 1998 'Overhead hoists (underhung) '. The design criteria for the structural members per these standards is that static stresses shall not exceed 0. 2 times the average ultimate material strength. The <b>unistrut</b> members are fabricated from hot rolled carbon steel. The B-Line catalog states that the minimum yield strength of the virgin material is 33, 000 psi and the cold worked average yield stress is 42, 000 psi. The ultimate strength of the material is not given in the catalog, but based on the description of the material and values listed in the Ryerson steel catalog, I will use a value 58, 000 psi for the ultimate strength. A minimum safety factor of 5 must be achieved based on ultimate strength...|$|E
40|$|The S-Farm overground {{transfer}} (OGT) {{line will}} bypass the existing line(s), between valve pits 241 -S-B and 241 -S-D {{that no longer}} meet system requirements. The new OGT line will provide a waste transfer pipeline between these valve pits in support of saltwell pumping activities. The length of the OGT line is approximately 180 ft from pit to pit. The primary pipe is nominal 1 -in. diameter stainless steel (SST) braided Ethylene-propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) hose. The encasement pipe is a nominal 3 -in., flanged, SST pipe made up of several different length pipe spool pieces (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 1 and sh. 2). The OGT line slopes from valve pit 241 -S-B toward valve pit 241 -S-D. At each end, the primary and encasement pipe connect to a pit entry spool piece. The pit entry spool pieces are constructed of prefabricated SST materials. These spool pieces allow for {{the separation of the}} primary and encasement pipelines after the pipes have entered the valve pits (drawing H- 2 - 818280, sh. 2). The pit entry spool pieces also allow for leak detection of the encasement pipe at each end (drawing H- 2 - 829564, sh. 2). The OGT encasement pipeline is supported above ground by adjustable height <b>unistrut</b> brackets and precast concrete bases (drawing H- 2 - 829654, sh. 1). The pipeline is heat-traced and insulated. The heat tracing and insulation supply and retain latent heat that prevents waste solidification during transfers and provides freeze protection. The total length of the pipeline is above ground, thereby negating the need for cathodic corrosion protection. This Construction Integrity Assessment Report (CIAR) is prepared by Fluor Daniel Northwest for Numatec Hanford Corporation/Lockheed Martin Hanford Corporation, the operations contractor, and the U. S. Department of Energy, the system owner.

40|$|The {{proposed}} piping layout for the DO upgrade {{will run}} along the south wall of DAB. The cryogenic service pipe runs above {{the upper and lower}} cleanroom roofs and will need to be supported by the roofs beams. Calculations were done to determine the stresses in the I-beams created by the existing and additional loads due to the upgrade. Refer to drawing no. 3823. 115 -ME- 317283 for drawings of the piping layout. Figure 1 shows the 'plan view' portion of this drawing. The weight of the individual lines were calculated in figure 2 assuming a pipe density of O. 28 lbm/in{sup 3 } for stainless steel (0. 12 % C) and a fluid density (assuming LN 2 at 1 atm) of 0. 03 lbm/in{sup 3 }. The weights of the corrugated steel flooring, assembly hall feed cans, support beams, and roof hatch were also included in the analysis. These loads are calculated on pgs. 5 - 6. A floor load of 50 lbf/ft{sup 2 } was also added {{in order to maintain the}} existing floor load limit in addition to the added piping loads. Measurements of the dimensions of the I-beams determined that the nominal sizes of the beams were W 8 x 21 for the lower roof and W 14 x 26 for the upper roof. Pipe lengths were determined from the drawing for each of the lines on pgs. 1 - 2 of the calculations (refer to all piping by line numbers according to figure 2). A total weight was calculated for lines 3 - 9 along the south wall and lines 1 - 2 running along the north wall of the lower cleanroom roof. To simplify the calculations these weights were assumed to be evenly distributed on the 5 I-beam supports of the lower cleanroom roof 2. 5 feet in from the south wall. The stress analysis was done using FrameMac, a 2 -D finite element program for the Macintosh. Beam 3 was not included in the analysis because it is structurally equivalent to beam 1. The program outputted maximum values for shear stress, bending stress, shear force, and moments in each of the beams analyzed. These values were then compared to the allowable stresses as per the specifications and codes stated in the AISC: Manual of Steel Construction. The stresses on the roof beams needed to be determined in a number of different places. The first was in the beam itself which included the flange and web sections. The second place was at the ends of the beams where the flanges were removed to make the perpendicular connections to the other beams on the lower roof. The final point was the framed beam connection which included the bolt analysis. FrameMac calculated stresses only for the beams which included the sections where the flanges were removed to make the end connections. To analyze the connections, the allowable bending and shear stresses were solved for allowable shear and moments. This was done because FrameMac does not have the capability to analyze the dimensions for the bolts and angles used in the connections were known and the program outputted values for reaction forces and moments at the ends of the beams. Multiplying the allowable shear stress for the bolts and angle connections by their respective areas gave the allowable shear force. The allowable moment for the angle connection was calculated by multiplying the section modulus of the angle by the allowable bending stress. These allowable loads are calculated on pgs. 7 - 8. The allowable and maximum calculated stresses by FrameMac are summarized in a table. In conclusion, the cleanroom roofs will be able to safely support the weight of the upgrade cryogenic piping, feed cans, corrugated flooring and a 50 lbf/ft{sup 2 } floor load with the addition of diagonal braces at the ends of beams 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. The location and size of these diagonal braces are shown in fig. 4. Also, the piping supports and feed cans will all need to be placed directly above the I-beam supports. These supports will consist of <b>unistrut</b> structures that will be detailed and specified separate to this analysis. The output and input data from FrameMac and the drawings used in the analysis follow the calculation pages...|$|E
