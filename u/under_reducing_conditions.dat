25|$|Oxidation and {{reduction}} affects {{the migration of}} arsenic in subsurface environments. Arsenite is the most stable soluble form of arsenic in reducing environments and arsenate, which is less mobile than arsenite, is dominant in oxidizing environments at neutral pH. Therefore, arsenic may be more mobile <b>under</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions.</b> The reducing environment is also rich in organic matter which may enhance the solubility of arsenic compounds. As a result, the adsorption of arsenic is reduced and dissolved arsenic accumulates in groundwater. That is why the arsenic content is higher in reducing environments than in oxidizing environments.|$|E
25|$|It is well {{established}} that the macromolecular structure of nonviral gene delivery vectors alters their transfection efficacy and cytotoxicity. The cyclized structure has been proven to reduce cytotoxicity and increase circulation time for drug and gene delivery applications. The unique structure of cyclizing chains provides the single chain cyclized polymers a different method of interaction between the polymer and plasmid DNA, and results in a general trend of higher transfection capabilities than branched polymers. Moreover, {{due to the nature}} of the single chain structure, this cyclized polymer can “untie” to a linear chain <b>under</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions.</b> Transfection profiles on astrocytes comparing 25 kDa-PEI, SuperFect® and Lipofectamine®2000 and cyclized polymer showed greater efficiency and cell viability whilst maintaining neural cell viability above 80% four days post transfections.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} {{important}} oxygen-centered free radicals are superoxide and hydroxyl radical.

Excessive amounts of these free radicals can lead to cell injury and death, which may contribute to many diseases such as cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes and major disorders. Many forms of cancer {{are thought to be}} the result of reactions between free radicals and DNA, potentially resulting in mutations that can adversely affect the cell cycle and potentially lead to malignancy. Some of the symptoms of aging such as atherosclerosis are also attributed to free-radical induced oxidation of cholesterol to 7-ketocholesterol. In addition free radicals contribute to alcohol-induced liver damage, perhaps more than alcohol itself. Free radicals produced by cigarette smoke are implicated in inactivation of alpha 1-antitrypsin in the lung. This process promotes the development of emphysema.|$|E

[...] Under oxidizing conditions, arsenic can be mobilized from pyrite or iron oxides especially at elevated pH. <b>Under</b> <b>reducing</b> <b>conditions,</b> arsenic can be mobilized by reductive desorption or dissolution when associated with iron oxides. The reductive desorption occurs under two circumstances. One is when arsenate is reduced to arsenite which adsorbs to iron oxides less strongly.

40|$|Study of gas-liquid {{two-phase}} flows <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions</b> {{is extremely}} important. One {{of the major}} applications of gas-liquid two-phase flows <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions</b> is {{in the design of}} active thermal control systems for future space applications. Previous space crafts were characterized by low heat generation within the spacecraft which needed to be redistributed within the craft or rejected to space. This task could easily have been accomplished by pumped single-phase loops or passive systems such as heat pipes and so on. However with increase in heat generation within the space craft as predicted for future missions, pumped boiling two-phase flows are being considered. This is because of higher heat transfer co-efficients associated with boiling heat transfer among other advantages. Two-phase flows <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions</b> also find important applications in space propulsion as in space nuclear power reactors as well as in many other life support systems of space crafts. ^ Two-fluid model along with Interfacial Area Transport Equation (IATE) is a useful tool available to predict the behavior of gas-liquid two-phase flows <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions.</b> It should be noted that considerable differences exist between two-phase flows <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> and normal gravity conditions especially for low inertia flows. This is because due to suppression of the gravity field the gas-liquid two-phase flows take a considerable time to develop <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions</b> as compared to normal gravity conditions. Hence other common methods of analysis applicable for fully developed gas-liquid two-phase flows under normal gravity conditions, like flow regimes and flow regime transition criteria, will not be applicable to gas-liquid two-phase flows <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions.</b> ^ However the two-fluid model and the IATE need to be evaluated first against detailed experimental data obtained <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions.</b> Although lot of studies have been done in the past to understand the global structure of gas-liquid two-phase flows <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions,</b> using experimental setups aboard drop towers or aircrafts flying parabolic flights, detailed data on local structure of such two-phase flows are extremely rare. ^ Hence experiments were carried out in a 304 mm inner diameter (ID) test facility on earth. Keeping in mind the detailed experimental data base that needs to be generated to evaluate two-fluid model along with IATE, ground based simulations provide the only economic path. Here the <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>condition</b> is simulated using two-liquids of similar densities (water and Therminol 59 ® in the present case). Only adiabatic two-phase flows were concentrated on at this initial stage. Such a large diameter test section was chosen to study the development of drops to their full extent (it is to be noted that <b>under</b> <b>reduced</b> gravity <b>conditions</b> the stable bubble size in gas-liquid two-phase flows is much larger than that at normal gravity conditions). Twelve flow conditions were chosen around predicted bubbly flow to cap-bubbly flow transition region. Detailed local data was obtained at ten radial locations for each of three axial locations using state-of-the art multi-sensor conductivity probes. The results are presented and discussed. Also one-group as well as two-group, steady state, one-dimensional IATE was evaluated against data obtained here and by other researchers, and the results presented and discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Wetland {{rice fields}} are source of {{atmospheric}} methane.

Application of or in-situ availability of terminal electron acceptors (oxidants) such as ferric iron or sulfate allows iron or sulfate reducers to successfully compete for substrates, hydrogen or acetate, with methanogens.

Since iron redox system plays a dominant role in tropical rice soils, which are rich in iron, the role of iron oxides and hydroxides as electron acceptor for controlling methane emission from wetland rice fields deserves more attention. For mitigating methane emission from wetland rice fields, ferric iron as a terminal electron-accepting agent, can either {{be added to the}} soil or regenerated in the soil by manipulating redox potential through soil and water management.
