500|$|Steinitz rated Anderssen {{as one of}} the two {{greatest}} attacking {{players of}} his time: [...] "We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king’s-side attack, and perhaps I myself may not have learnt enough." [...] Although Anderssen is regarded {{as a member of the}} [...] "heroic" [...] attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: [...] "Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack", a principle more recently labelled [...] "Makogonov's rule". According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.|$|E
500|$|Rayner {{described}} Scherger as [...] "the most quoted {{and best}} known of contemporary military leaders" [...] in Australia from 1957 to 1966, recognised and admired by civilian and soldier alike. Detractors accused him of cunning and excessive politicking, Air Marshal Williams declaring that Scherger favoured his friends in the service and later in TAA and CAC, and Prime Minister John Gorton famously calling him [...] "a politician in uniform". Scherger was also labelled a self-publicist, but argued [...] "...you can't sell your ideas <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sell yourself, {{and if you can}} sell yourself you're half way to selling the ideas that you've got". The newest of the northern air bases he proposed while CAS, near Weipa in Cape York, was opened in 1998 and named RAAF Base Scherger in his honour. His name is also borne by Sir Frederick Scherger Drive in North Turramurra, New South Wales.|$|E

Of his original {{decisions about the}} show's format, McGlaughlin says, [...] "It’s very hard to talk about music on the radio <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hear a sound, so I said I need a piano. Instead of saying 'a minor third,' I can play it. I wanted {{to make certain that}} what you could hear was prominent." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, Brando's agent {{recommended}} he take a co-starring role in The Eagle Has Two Heads with Tallulah Bankhead, {{produced by}} Jack Wilson. Bankhead had {{turned down the}} role of Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire, which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946-1947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. [...] "I don't care what your grandmother did," [...] Wilson exclaimed, [...] "and that Method stuff, I {{want to know what}} you're going to do!" [...] Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. [...] "It was marvelous," [...] a cast member recalled. [...] "Everybody hugged him and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, 'They don't think you can act <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> yell.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|As an alternative, {{there is}} the [...] "bare king" [...] rule. [...] A {{historic}} description of chu shogi mentions, [...] "When pieces are gone, and there are only the 2 kings, one can mate only {{if he has a}} promoted gold". Nonetheless, this is only one specific case, and the motivation for such a rule is uncertain given that king and rook (a promoted gold) against king is an easy forced checkmate. The Japanese Chu-Shogi Association has altered this into a general baring rule similar to that of shatranj, where a bare king immediately loses against any other material, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> bare the opponent on the following move (in which case the game is a draw), or you can capture the opponent's sole remaining king or prince on the following move (in which case the opponent loses).("　三.両軍がともに駒を消耗しあい、駒枯れの状態になった場合、玉将２枚と成金１枚だけが盤面に残ったときは成金のある側が勝ちとなります。")An example of this is discussed in section 5.5 of the same page, second diagram. This makes a difference in the endgames of king and pawn against king, or king and ferocious leopard against king, which cannot be won by the stronger side without the bare king rule (and also in some cases with blind tigers, silver generals, and copper generals that can be trapped by the enemy king when separated from their own kings). Further detail is offered in their standardised rules: king and any piece against king is an immediate win by the bare king rule, except if the piece is a pawn or go-between, in which case it must be promoted safely (to a gold general or drunk elephant respectively) before the win can be claimed. Furthermore, [...] "dead pieces" [...] do not count under this rule; a king and an immobile pawn or lance at the far rank against a king is still a draw.|$|E

2500|$|Swervedriver {{appeared}} to rebound when they signed a three-album deal with DGC Records (a subsidiary of Geffen Records) in early 1996. Originally, the first album {{in the deal}} was to be an American release of Ejector Seat Reservation; the band had attempted to talk A into relinquishing them the rights, but after news of their talks with Geffen was publicized on the Internet, A had come back with an exorbitant price for its sale (to avoid the same missed opportunity after previously dropped Soul Asylum hit it big with 1992's Grave Dancers Union). With their advance, they finished building their own recording studio, Bad Earth in Farringdon, and instead began work on a new record for the label. Over the next year, the group would record 99th Dream with Moulder at the helm, this time taking a more simple, laid-back approach than with previous productions. They scaled back from 48-track to 24-track recording, condensing the layering of guitar in the process, and employed more full-ensemble straight live track, partly with the mindset of {{making it easier to}} play the guitar lines live. During that time, the band also put out a pair of self-produced boutique label seven-inch singles, including the double split [...] "Why Say Yeah" [...] with indie collaboration act Sophia. DGC distributed promotional copies of the album and scheduled a release date of 7 May 1997. Meanwhile, in December 1996 Swervedriver went back into the studio and re-recorded the album track [...] "These Times," [...] citing their growing dislike for the original's faster-paced, Oasis-like sound and a bad experience with one of the label's reps during mixing. Three and a half weeks before 99th Dream was due to be released, DGC dismissed the band's A representative, Jody Kurilla, in a corporate downsizing and three hours later terminated their contract (though they would not impede the record's future release). Considering the recent break with their third label in two years, Hindmarsh stated, [...] "Someone from A once told us that it takes four or five listens to a Swervedriver album to see {{whether you like it or}} not, and in this marketplace, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> hit immediately it's not going to register with people." ...|$|E
