40|$|This {{dissertation}} theses {{addresses the}} phenomenon of the unregistered mark for goods and services in accordance with trade mark law of the Czech Republic, while taking into consideration the given scope of EU law and its comparison with the legal protection of applied trade marks in the framework of the "passing-off" doctrine of the legal systems of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. While the subject of trade marks has already been thoroughly established in juristic theory and has also become commonplace in legal practice, the institute of the <b>unregistered</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> has not yet to be comprehensively examined, and as such it presents significant difficulties in applied practice, as it bears no solid legal foundation, and {{in the context of the}} regulations of trade mark law it is always possible to identify specific special entitlements arising from the existence or application of unregistered trade marks, whereas the nature of their verbal formulations and systematic classification presents difficulties in the interpretation and application of such entitlements. The basis for this reasoning is namely the historical evolution of {{the phenomenon of}} the unregistered mark in trade mark law in Austrian, respectively in subsequent Cisleithania, and its reception and evolvement within Czechoslovak law as the legal predecessor to the Czech Republic. The goal of the research presented herein is to identify answers to the underlying theoretical questions concerning unregistered marks of fundamental significance to applied practice, and in so far as they concern the nature of the unregistered mark as perceived by trade mark law and its definitional attributes, terms of origin, duration, and expiration of unregistered marks, or more precisely as they concern rights to them, as well as the terms and scope of disposition with unregistered marks, namely in so far as they in turn relate to transfer or conversion and the grant of license or other temporary right of use. Subsequently, the establishment of answers to the aforementioned questions addresses the problem of the absence of an explicit legal principle to {{the phenomenon of the}} unregistered mark and the interpretation difficulties offered in the poorly formulated laws and subsequent fluctuations in legal practice. This problem is examined within the legal setting of the Czech Republic as a democratic nation with a market economy, in which holds true the classic legal rudiment of "that which is not prohibited by law is permitted", and in which hold true the fundamental and indefeasible rights of man, a component of which is the right to freely pursue economic activities and possess property within a framework of restrictions favouring the preservation of the rights of others as set forth by the law...|$|E

5000|$|The law of {{trademark}} in India before 1940 {{was based}} on the common law principles of passing off and equity as followed in England before the enactment of the first Registration Act, 1875. [...] The first statutory law related to trademark in India was the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act, 1940 which had similar provision like the UK <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act, 1938. In 1958, the <b>Trade</b> and Merchandise <b>Marks</b> Act, 1958 was enacted which consolidated the provisions related to trademarks contained in other statutes like, the Indian Penal Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Sea Customs Act.

40|$|Domain {{names are}} still a {{relatively}} unknown occurrence and despite being a natural part in most people’s every-day life, there are few who reflect over their importance. The original function of domain names was merely to serve as technical addresses and to facilitate the locating of websites on the Internet. Today domain names are much more than this. In addition to the address function, domain names may also serve as indications of goods, services, businesses or information. The domain name is usually the first contact one gets with a website {{and it has become}} crucial for businesses to have their company name or trade marks registered as domain names. The issue of the legal status of domain names has mainly been discussed from an American point of view and in Sweden this discussion has almost entirely fallen under the radar. If the legal status of a domain name were clear, it would be easier for businesses to avail themselves of the value of that domain name. It would possibly even contribute to strengthening the legal protection for the domain name holder, in for example insolvency or bankruptcy procedures. Intellectual property exists in many different forms, the main being patents, trade marks, copyright and design rights. Although there are many differences between them, they all have in common that they establish property protection over intangibles such as ideas, inventions, signs and information. As a domain name is not a physical object, {{there can be no doubt}} that it is an intangible. The question is whether it is property. Intellectual property is not a static area and it can, in line with societal and technological development, be expanded to include new types. The legal status of domain names is generally discussed in the light of the close connection they have with trade marks. Except from their original function, the trade mark function of domain names can probably be considered as one of the most commonly accepted. It is indicated in this thesis that that function contributes to that a domain name can be considered as a distinctive sign and thereby obtain protection, in the same way as an <b>unregistered</b> <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> According to current accounting rules, businesses may, to some extent, avail themselves of the value of a domain name. Domain names are under certain circumstances identified as intangible assets and even as ‘similar rights’ to for example trade marks and patents in accounting and taxation situations. At this time it is not possible to legislate on the area of the legal status of a domain name on a Community level, as this most likely would have to include a consideration of the existence of property rights and consequently fall outside the legislative powers of the Community. Both the legal development and the legal discussions on the topic of the legal status of domain names in Sweden have been relatively sparse. Nonetheless, there have been some interesting opinions. By investigating what positions the different authorities, academics and practitioners have taken on the legal status of domain names it can be concluded that the prevailing opinion in Sweden is that domain names are not considered as property. The reason for this seems to be that domain names as such, are in fact no more than technical constructions and that by registering a domain name the registrant only becomes the holder of a contractual right. However, there are some diverging opinions which could suggest that the legal status of domain names in Sweden is not yet settled. The aspects which are then taken into consideration include that domain names have developed to become important and valuable assets for an increasing number of businesses. A domain name is a precondition for the creation of a website and therefore of crucial importance for, in particular, online based businesses. However, they are of increasing importance for all businesses to reach out to and compete over the same customers. It is advocated that the fact that domain names are freely traded with indicates that domain names are property. It has also been questioned whether an asset with a true economic value, such as a domain name, can exist without being considered as an item of property. The steps taken in other jurisdictions have shown that the legal status of domain names is not even clear in some of the countries with the greatest experience of domain names. Nonetheless, the legal status is given attention in those countries and the discussion has been initiated. In general, it can be concluded that the development seems to go toward higher awareness of the value of domain names...|$|E

If properly protected, <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> can last forever; and can provide the business with a unique and immediately visible identification to its customers and the world beyond. A <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> cannot be protected by the law unless it is registered, since registration is considered as a basis of the legal protection. The <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 together with its Rules organize all matters concerning registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> and provide the procedure to be followed in obtaining such registration. This thesis examines the registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in Sudan under the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969. Chapter One highlights {{the historical development of}} the <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> laws in the Sudan and discusses the definition of the <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> under both the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Ordinance 1931 and the <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act 1969 and the various functions of the <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> The discussion in Chapter Two is mainly about the registrability of <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Chapter Three concentrates on the procedure of registration.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} for the first time, a history of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia. Its {{focus is on the}} latter to middle part of the 19 th century and early into the 20 th century, predating the Commonwealth <b>Trade</b> <b>Marks</b> Act. This is because it was during this period when the legislative framework for <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> protection was first established under the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime and the most important, characteristic features of modern <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law developed. With a specific focus on this critical period, the legal narrative and this thesis considers the inception of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime, contextualising its genesis. It also examines the architecture of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The final part of the narrative focuses on the operation of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The key reason for this particular doctrinal focus is twofold. The primary reason relates to the lack of consideration given to the historical development of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in Australia to date, and in particular, the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. The second ancillary reason relates to the potential importance of this thesis to modern debates about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, which often refer back to and rely upon the assumed traditional principles of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, without any inquiry or deep understanding as to what those traditional foundations actually are, at least from an Australian perspective. In taking a doctrinal and empirical approach, this thesis draws on the relevant legal archive, containing the limited primary and secondary sources available relating to the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. Here, particular attention is paid to the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registers, which have been examined in detail. However, the relevant legal archive also includes the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> statutes, the related Hansard reports, colonial newspapers and the case law reported as arising out of the colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime. This thesis further draws on the body of 19 th century British (and to a lesser extent American) <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and other treatises as the authoritative legal texts of the time, as well as the statutory protection afforded to <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in the United Kingdom and the extrinsic material concerning early British <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law, so far {{as it relates to the}} colonial <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> regime...|$|R
40|$|Modern <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> perform {{multiple}} functions {{taken up}} in a functional matrix. Amongst them the distinguishing function is invariable whilst the other functions are variable. A legal-historical and comparative investigation {{of the law of}} <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> in the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U. S. A. and South Africa reveals that only certain <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> functions have traditionally been afforded protection under law. This is mainly because of a historical resistance to accepting <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> as property in the Anglo and American <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> systems and the primacy of origin theory in the European Community <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> system. The bedrock of South African <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law has been the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law of the United Kingdom. The restrictions brought about by common law property theory have been carried over into the South African law of <b>trade</b> <b>marks.</b> The South African law of property is however derived from the civil law and not the common law. The historical break in continuity of the common law <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> tradition {{as a consequence of the}} interposition of the European Union and the reception of EC <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law in the United Kingdom affords the opportunity for a theory of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> rights to be established in South Africa which is derived from concepts already present in South African law. The thesis proposes that the legal right to the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> in South African law is an independent subjective right of the kind proposed by Joubert. The legal object of this right is the <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> The entitlements of use of the holder of the right are the functions which the holder is entitled to have the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> perform. A range of values in which the property in a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> is to be found are associated with the functions.

The first problem is about law protection for the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right holder in the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law, {{the second is the}} role of government and law enforcement officer in preventing and to overcome law violation on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right, and the third is about consumer's law culture in relation with consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> The law protection for owner or right holder of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> has been regulated comprehensively covering administrative, civil and crime sides in a juridical way which is stated in the new <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law.. From administrative side by implementing constitutive system, the owner of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> is acknowledged and given exclusive right, that is being protected as the one and only person who has the right of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> In case of law violation on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right, the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> owner can do legal remedy through administrative action, sue a person for civil liability as well as crime liability. Based on its authority, the government plays important role in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right violation. As the authority holder, the government has the rights to make rule and policy on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Through the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office the government has a role as <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> administrator, consultant and controller on the use of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> in the community, as well as a law enforcement officer by a way of appointing the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office employee as Civil Investigator. From the analysis of field research result, it is revealed that the cancellation of registered <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> within constitutive system still happens due to weak performance of the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> office in examining the substansial requirements during <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> registration request. Beside that the absence of implementation guidance of some rules in <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law has influenced law enforcement on <b>trade</b> <b>mark.</b> Meanwhile, the lack of knowledge and understanding about <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> among law enforcement officer has influenced them in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation. They tend to give minor punishment to those who violate the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Law. This condition shows the <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law protection is not effective yet because the role of government through the <b>Trade</b> <b>Mark</b> Office and law enforcement officer in preventing and to overcome <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation, need to be improved. On the other hand, <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law protection and <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> violation preventing action are also influenced by community's law culture as consumers who consume the goods and the services. The consumer's law culture gives negative response or does not support consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> which happens in the community whose opinion and behaviour do not give symbolical meaning on <b>trade</b> <b>mark,</b> the communal values which consider <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> imitation as something acceptable {{as long as it does}} not harm the consumers, especially their lives, and submissive behaviour to keep peace and harmony in life, and the tendency to avoid conflict in consumer dispute. The community will give positive response or support the consumer protection on <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> if their opinion and behaviour are meaningful on symbolical <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> and they realise that <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> right violation considered illegal, since it harms not only the consumers, but also blurs symbolical meaning of a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> since a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> means symbol, prestige, as well as certain lifestyle to the user. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> {{litigation}} has gradually {{increased in the}} High Court of Tanzania (HCT). 1 This litigation includes disputes over registration of <b>trade</b> <b>marks,</b> applications for temporary injunctions, <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> infringement, and passing-off. 2 Although I have classified <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> litigation into four distinct groups, more often they tend to overlap in practice [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Problems of {{enforcement}} {{led to a}} major revision of South African labour law, {{with the introduction of}} the Industrial Conciliation Act 1937. The 1937 Act tried to introduce more councils, in a greater geographical spread, so that more collective engagements could be facilitated. There was a proliferation of <b>unregistered</b> <b>trades</b> union for black people, who were legislatively excluded.

Sustaining a brand requires both investment in its reputation amongst consumers and the defence of the brand against followers that infringe upon it. I study the defence of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> through opposition at a <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> office. A structural model of opposition and adjudication of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> disputes is presented. This is applied to <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> opposition in Europe. Results show that brand owners can benefit from a reputation for tough opposition to <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> applications. Such a reputation induces applicants to settle <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> opposition cases more readily. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{rationale for}} the legal protection of <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> is that <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> protect consumers from con fusion and reduce consumer search costs in the market place. Producers use <b>trade</b> <b>marks</b> to distinguish their goods and services from {{the goods and services}} of their competitors. Facilitating competition is therefore a fundamental, underlying principle of <b>trade</b> <b>mark</b> law. <b>Trade</b> <b>mark</b> protection provides incentives to producers to invest in consistency and quality, which benefits consumers. <b>Trade</b> <b>marks</b> thus have origin, guarantee and investment functions. They are indicators of trade source, they serve as guarantees of quality, and they provide a mechanism and incentive for investment in advertising and promotion...|$|R
