5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, <b>usage</b> results in not fulfilling responsibilities, <b>usage</b> results in social problems, <b>usage</b> results in health problems, <b>usage</b> results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E

40|$|Trade <b>usages</b> and {{business}} practices are {{key elements of}} international commerce. In their day-to-day activities, traders {{and business}} {{people around the world}} constantly rely upon trade <b>usages</b> and business practices across a variety of industries. <b>Usages</b> and practices tend to be dignified by the business community with a status equivalent to that of actual law. As a matter of fact, many business persons often tend to regard trade <b>usages</b> and business practices as very powerful tools to ensure the stability of their bargain and, at times, transact business solely based on such <b>usages</b> and practices, without any written contract. Due to the importance of this subject, distinguished international legal commentators have often attempted to define trade <b>usages</b> and business practices and, in doing so, they have indeed succeeded at providing a substantial amount of theoretical ammunition {{for the benefit of the}} interpreter. What is more challenging, in my opinion, is to understand the interplay (and the related legal and commercial consequences) arising from the application of trade <b>usages</b> and business practices alongside the black letter rules of international conventions and model law instruments, which often refer to <b>usages</b> and practices without defining them...|$|R

40|$|An {{approach}} to mine frequently appearing ordered sets of function-call <b>usages,</b> {{taking into account}} their proximal control constructs (e. g., if-statements), in the source code is presented. These ordered sets are termed as call-usage patterns. Additionally, variant <b>usages,</b> such as those with missing or out of order calls, are automatically identified along with their specific contextual location. The approach uses lightweight source code analysis and frequent sequential pattern mining. The hypothesis is that these call-usage patterns embody latent programming rules that developers commonly reuse, for example standard <b>usages</b> of API calls. The variants are an indicator of future changes such as the elimination of non-standard <b>usages</b> and/or bugs...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Usages</b> {{combined}} {{fragments of}} Roman and Visigothic law with the resolutions of the comital court of Barcelona {{and the religious}} canons of ecclesiastic synods.

However, the evidence for Ramon's work dates from the codes of James the Conqueror of a later date (reigned 1213-1276). James, seeing that some judges ruled by Gothic law and some by Roman law, according to a tradition of usus terrae (local custom), approached the Catalan Courts in 1251 to establish {{the primacy of the}} <b>Usages.</b> Though the <b>Usages</b> applied legally only to the Barcelonan county, in practice they were applied to the entire Principality of Catalonia.|$|R

In this study, we combine a foundation study of accounting <b>usages</b> over two centuries in the Kiribati Islands; and an exposé of these <b>usages</b> {{from the perspective of}} the I-Kiribati indigenes. The study is unusual in linking the history of a colony with the history of an emerging economy. We argue that colonisers espied economic, social and political benefits of colonialistic acts, and accounting <b>usages</b> were initiated and maturated alongside these, to avail commerce and life 2 ̆ 7 s personal dealings, religion-making, and government and public policymaking. Several persisting inadequacies of these accounting <b>usages</b> are revealed. They derive mostly from how asymmetric power relations in various contexts have played important roles in ways that accounting <b>usages</b> were constituted and sustained, and that this continues to be the case. The indigenes have not been accounted to, nor have had ready access to information concerning them. The indigenes have shared in some benefits but only incidentally and invariably down the pecking order. The indigenes have been precluded, befuddled and amazed by the <b>usages,</b> which concomitantly have enabled successive colonisers to re-define, enclose, exploit, subject and neo-liberalise them...|$|R
