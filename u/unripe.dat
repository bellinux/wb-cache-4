5|$|Green {{the color}} most {{commonly}} associated in Europe and the U.S. with youth. It also often {{is used to}} describe anyone young, inexperienced, probably by the analogy to immature and <b>unripe</b> fruit. Examples include green cheese, a term for a fresh, unaged cheese, and greenhorn, an inexperienced person.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the golden-crowned sifaka {{consists}} {{of a wide variety}} of plants—as many as 80species—whose availability varies based on the season. It is a seed predator, making seeds a year-round staple in its diet when available. The golden-crowned sifaka also eats <b>unripe</b> fruits, flowers, and leaves. One study showed a diet composition of 37%unripe fruit and seeds, 22%immature leaves, 17%mature leaves, 13%flowers, and 9%fruit pulp. Individuals have also been observed consuming tree bark during the dry season. In general, approximately 60% of its diet {{consists of}} <b>unripe</b> fruits and seed, mainly from leguminous pods, and less than 50% consists of leaves. At Daraina, it has been observed feeding on the sakoa tree (Poupartia caffra) and on mango trees. Immature leaves and flowers are eaten when available, in the early wet season. Daily traveling distance tends to increase when immature leaves are available. Studies have also shown that when food distribution is patchy, feeding times are shorter and more time is spent traveling. Dietary diversity has been shown to be consistent between populations, suggesting that it is important for the lemur to get a varied mix of nutrients and to protect itself from high levels of specific plant toxins.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{exterior}} of the Pont du Gard is rough and relatively unfinished, the builders took care to ensure that the interior of the water conduit was as smooth as possible so that the flow of water would not be obstructed. The walls of the conduit were constructed from dressed masonry and the floor from concrete. Both were covered with a stucco incorporating minute shards of pottery and tile. It was painted with olive oil and covered with maltha, a mixture of slaked lime, pork grease and the viscous juice of <b>unripe</b> figs. This produced a surface that was both smooth and durable.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating <b>unripe</b> fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the <b>unripe</b> fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E
5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most <b>unripe</b> stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|In Thailand, durian {{is often}} eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is {{adulterated}} with pumpkin. <b>Unripe</b> durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted preserves from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} Cabernet Sauvignon is {{strongly}} influenced by the ripeness of the grapes at harvest. When more on the <b>unripe</b> side, the grapes are high in pyrazines and will exhibit pronounced green bell peppers and vegetal flavors. When harvested overripe the wines can taste jammy and may have aromas of stewed blackcurrants. Some winemakers choose to harvest their grapes at different ripeness levels in order to incorporate these different elements and potentially add some layer of complexity to the wine. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, the wines typically exhibit strong fruit flavors of black cherries and plum. The aroma of blackcurrants {{is one of the}} most distinctive and characteristic element of Cabernet Sauvignon that is present in virtually every style of the wine across the globe. Styles from various regions and producers may also have aromas of eucalyptus, mint and tobacco. As the wines age they can sometimes develop aromas associated with cedar, cigar boxes and pencil shavings. In general New World examples have more pronounced fruity notes while Old World wines can be more austere with heightened earthy notes.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical perianth, consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when <b>unripe,</b> and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
25|$|Some foods, such as <b>unripe</b> fruits, contain tannins or {{calcium oxalate}} that cause an {{astringent}} or puckering sensation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. Examples include tea, red wine, rhubarb, some {{fruits of the}} Syzygium genus, and <b>unripe</b> persimmons and bananas.|$|E
25|$|Diospyrobezoar is type of phytobezoar {{formed from}} <b>unripe</b> persimmons. Coca-Cola {{has been used}} in the treatment.|$|E
25|$|Green pepper, like black, is {{made from}} the <b>unripe</b> drupes. Dried green peppercorns are treated {{in a way that}} retains the green colour, such as {{treatment}} with sulphur dioxide, canning or freeze-drying. Pickled peppercorns, also green, are <b>unripe</b> drupes preserved in brine or vinegar. Fresh, unpreserved green pepper drupes, largely unknown in the West, are used in some Asian cuisines, particularly Thai cuisine. Their flavour has been described as spicy and fresh, with a bright aroma. They decay quickly if not dried or preserved.|$|E
25|$|Once {{separated}} from the stalks, the grain was used {{in a number of}} ways: Most simply, <b>unripe</b> kernels of grain were eaten fresh, particularly in the spring, before ripe grain was available, and both <b>unripe</b> and ripe grain was roasted over fire for immediate use. Ripe grains of wheat were also parboiled and dried, like modern bulgur, and then prepared as porridge. Whole or cracked grain was also used to make gruel and in stews. Most frequently, grains were ground into flour to prepare bread.|$|E
25|$|Many berries are edible, but others, such as {{the fruits}} of the potato and the deadly nightshade, are {{poisonous}} to humans. Some berries, {{such as the}} white and red mulberry, are poisonous when <b>unripe,</b> but are edible in their ripe form.|$|E
25|$|This clause, in {{addition}} to setting out {{the scope of the}} jurisdiction of the federal judiciary, prohibits courts from issuing advisory opinions, or from hearing cases that are either <b>unripe,</b> meaning that the controversy has not arisen yet, or moot, meaning that the controversy has already been resolved.|$|E
25|$|Broad beans (Spanish: habas) {{are widely}} {{cultivated}} in Spain. Culinary uses vary among regions, {{but they can}} be used as the main pulse in a stew (Favetes, habas estofadas, michirones) or as an addition to other dishes (menestra, paella). In certain regions they can be eaten while <b>unripe</b> or fried and packaged as a snack.|$|E
25|$|The {{fruit is}} high in vitamin C. The <b>unripe</b> fruit is {{extremely}} astringent. The ripe fruit may be eaten raw, cooked or dried. Molasses {{can be made from}} the fruit pulp. A tea can be made from the leaves and the roasted seed is used as a coffee substitute. Other popular uses include desserts such as persimmon pie, persimmon pudding, or persimmon candy.|$|E
25|$|As for the Bank's Due Process claim, the Court {{held that}} since {{liability}} for a due process violation {{would require a}} finding that the Agency's regulations had the same effect as an outright appropriation of the Bank's property, {{the effect of the}} regulations could not be determined {{because of the lack of}} a final determination (see above), the due process claim was also found to be <b>unripe.</b>|$|E
25|$|The USDA food {{database}} {{reveals that}} many common fruits contain nearly {{equal amounts of}} the fructose and glucose, {{and they do not}} present problems for those individuals with fructose malabsorption. Some fruits with a greater ratio of fructose than glucose are apples, pears and watermelon, which contain {{more than twice as much}} fructose as glucose. Fructose levels in grapes varies depending on ripeness and variety, where <b>unripe</b> grapes contain more glucose.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to harvest the pods when they are fully ripe, because if the pod is <b>unripe,</b> the beans will have a low cocoa butter content, or sugars in the white pulp will be insufficient for fermentation, resulting in a weak flavor. After fermentation, the beans must be quickly dried to prevent mold growth. Climate and weather permitting, this is done by spreading the beans {{out in the sun}} from five to seven days.|$|E
25|$|Somtam is a green papaya {{salad with}} a salty, spicy, and sour taste. The main items in it are young, <b>unripe</b> papaya, soy sauce, groundnuts, fish sauce, lime juice, and chilies. These items are {{combined}} in a mortar, pounded with a pestle for few seconds and served. The salty and lime juicy taste is very popular. This light dish is {{widely available in}} regions {{with large numbers of}} ethnic Thais, such as Tumpat and Siamese wats.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{immature}} nuts {{in their}} husks are preserved in vinegar. In the UK, these are called pickled walnuts {{and this is}} one of the major uses for fresh nuts from the small scale plantings. In Armenian cuisine, <b>unripe</b> walnuts, including husks, are preserved in sugar syrup and eaten whole. In Italy, liqueurs called Nocino and Nocello are flavoured with walnuts, while Salsa di Noci (walnut sauce) is a pasta sauce originating from Liguria. In Georgia, walnuts are ground with other ingredients to make walnut sauce.|$|E
25|$|Prior to Heinz (and {{his fellow}} innovators), {{commercial}} tomato ketchups {{of that time}} were watery and thin, {{in part due to}} the use of <b>unripe</b> tomatoes, which were low in pectin. They had less vinegar than modern ketchups; by pickling ripe tomatoes, the need for benzoate was eliminated without spoilage or degradation in flavor. But the changes driven by the desire to eliminate benzoate also produced changes that some experts (such as Andrew F. Smith) believe were key to the establishment of tomato ketchup as the dominant American condiment.|$|E
25|$|All {{parts of}} Tropaeolum majus are edible. The flower has most often been consumed, making for an {{especially}} ornamental salad ingredient; {{it has a}} slightly peppery taste reminiscent of watercress, and is also used in stir fry. The flowers contain about 130mg vitamin C per , {{about the same amount}} as is contained in parsley. Moreover, they contain up to 45mg of lutein per 100 g, which is the highest amount found in any edible plant. The <b>unripe</b> seed pods can be harvested and dropped into spiced vinegar to produce a condiment and garnish, sometimes used in place of capers.|$|E
25|$|Black pepper is {{produced}} from the still-green, <b>unripe</b> drupes of the pepper plant. The drupes are cooked briefly in hot water, both to clean {{them and to}} prepare them for drying. The heat ruptures cell walls in the pepper, speeding the work of browning enzymes during drying. The drupes dry in the sun or by machine for several days, during which the pepper around the seed shrinks and darkens into a thin, wrinkled black layer. Once dry, the spice is called black peppercorn. On some estates, the berries are separated from the stem by hand and then sun-dried without the boiling process.|$|E
25|$|The {{poppy straw}} methods predominate in Continental Europe and the British Commonwealth, with the latex method in most common use in India. The latex method can involve either {{vertical}} or horizontal slicing of the <b>unripe</b> pods with a two-to five-bladed knife with a guard developed specifically {{for this purpose}} to the depth of {{a fraction of a}} millimetre and scoring of the pods can be done up to five times. An alternative latex method sometimes used in China in the past is to cut off the poppy heads, run a large needle through them, and collect the dried latex 24 to 48 hours later.|$|E
25|$|The {{structural}} formula of morphine {{was determined by}} 1925 by Robert Robinson. At least three methods of total synthesis of morphine from starting materials such as coal tar and petroleum distillates have been patented, {{the first of which}} was announced in 1952, by Dr. Marshall D. Gates, Jr. at the University of Rochester. Still, the vast majority of morphine is derived from the opium poppy by either the traditional method of gathering latex from the scored, <b>unripe</b> pods of the poppy, or processes using poppy straw, the dried pods and stems of the plant, the most widespread of which was invented in Hungary in 1925 and announced in 1930 by the chemist János Kabay.|$|E
25|$|A {{mechanical}} grape harvester {{works by}} beating the vine with rubber sticks {{to get the}} vine to drop its fruit onto a conveyor belt that brings the fruit to a holding bin. As technology improves mechanical harvesters have become more sophisticated in distinguishing grape clusters from mud, leaves and other particles. Despite the improvement many harvesters still have difficulties in distinguishing between ripe, healthy grapes and <b>unripe</b> or rotted bunches which must then be sorted out at the winemaking facility. Another disadvantage is the potential of damaging the grape skins which can cause maceration and coloring of the juice that is undesirable {{in the production of}} white and sparkling wine. The broken skins also bring the risk of oxidation and a loss of some of the aromatic qualities in the wine.|$|E
25|$|At harvest time, AOC {{regulations}} stipulate grapes for Grand Cru vineyard must {{be picked}} {{with a potential}} alcohol level of at least 11 percent, at least 10.5 percent for Premiers Crus and 9.5 percent for AOC Chablis vineyards. Yields in Grands Crus must be limited to 3.3 tons per acre (45 hectoliters per hectare) with a 20% allowance for increased yields. There is no official regulation {{on the use of}} mechanical harvesting, but most Grand Cru producers prefer hand picking because human pickers tend to be more delicate with the grapes and can distinguish better between ripe and <b>unripe</b> bunches. Over the rest of the Chablis region, mechanical harvesting was used by around 80% of the vineyards {{at the turn of the}} 21st century. The traditional style of vine training in Chablis is to have the vine trained low to the ground for warmth with four cordons stretching out sideways from the trunk.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the world's wine producing regions lie between the temperate latitudes of 30° and 50° in both hemispheres with regions lying closer to the equator typically harvesting earlier due to their warmer climates. In the Northern Hemisphere, vineyards in Cyprus begin harvesting as early as July. In California some sparkling wine grapes are harvested in late July to early August at a slightly <b>unripe</b> point to help maintain acidity in the wine. The {{majority of}} Northern Hemisphere harvesting occurs in late August to early October with some late harvest wine grapes being harvested throughout the autumn. In Germany, the United States and Canada, ice wine grapes can be harvested as late as January. In the Southern Hemisphere harvest can begin as early as January 1 {{in some of the}} warmer climate sites in New South Wales, Australia. The majority of Southern Hemisphere harvesting occurs between the months of February and April with some cool climate sites like Central Otago, New Zealand picking late harvest wine grapes in June.|$|E
25|$|Wolf hunting proponents {{have drawn}} {{attention}} to the fact that wolves will on occasion commit acts of surplus killing when within the confines of human-made livestock shelters. Rare incidents of surplus killing by wolves in Minnesota are reported to leave up to 35 sheep killed and injured in flocks and losses of 50 to 200 birds in turkey flocks. In spite of the low percentage of attacks on livestock in Minnesota, farms in wolf territories and environments may become more susceptible to depredation under certain conditions. These conditions include larger farm size, increased numbers of cattle, an increased distance from human management, and improper disposal of livestock carcasses. While loss of livestock by wolves makes up only a small percentage of total losses in North America, surveys in Eurasia show some instances where wolf predation was frequent. In some areas of the former Soviet Union, wolves cause serious damage to watermelon plantations. Wolves will usually only take ripe melons after giving test bites, which can render even <b>unripe</b> fruits worthless for future consumption. Sometimes, up to 20% of the total watermelon crop can be destroyed on one raid.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is {{the most}} {{abundant}} opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly scoring the <b>unripe</b> seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine is generally 8–14% of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26% or produce little morphine at all (under 1%, perhaps down to 0.04%). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, thebaine and oripavine, which {{are used in the}} manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and etorphine and some other types of drugs. P. bracteatum does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of thebaine. Occurrence of morphine in other Papaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce codeine, thebaine, and in some cases negligible amounts of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro-thebaine, and hydrocodone (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and oripavine).|$|E
25|$|Malic acid, {{along with}} tartaric acid, {{is one of}} the {{principal}} organic acids found in wine grapes. It is found in nearly every fruit and berry plant, but is most often associated with green (<b>unripe)</b> apples, the flavor it most readily projects in wine. Its name comes from the Latin malum meaning “apple”. In the grape vine, malic acid is involved in several processes which are essential for the health and sustainability of the vine. Its chemical structure allows it to participate in enzymatic reactions that transport energy throughout the vine. Its concentration varies depending on the grape variety, with some varieties, such as Barbera, Carignan and Sylvaner, being naturally disposed to high levels. The levels of malic acid in grape berries are at their peak just before veraison, when they can be found in concentrations as high as 20g/l. As the vine progresses through the ripening stage, malic acid is metabolized in the process of respiration, and by harvest, its concentration could be as low as 1 to 9 g/l. The respiratory loss of malic acid is more pronounced in warmer climates. When all the malic acid is used up in the grape, it is considered “over-ripe” or senescent. Winemakers must compensate for this loss by adding extraneous acid at the winery in a process known as acidification.|$|E
500|$|Figs are {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} potential keystone species in communities of fruit-eating animals because of their [...] fruiting patterns. Nathaniel Wheelwright reports that emerald toucanets fed on <b>unripe</b> F. aurea fruit at times of fruit scarcity in Monteverde, Costa Rica. Wheelwright listed the species as a year-round food source for the resplendent quetzal at the same site. In the Florida Keys, F. aurea {{is one of five}} fruit species that dominate the diet fed by white-crowned pigeons to their nestlings. F. aurea is also important in the diet of mammalian frugivores—both fruit and young leaves are consumed by black howler monkeys in Belize.|$|E
500|$|Bovista pila {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in North America (including Hawaii). [...] There are few well-documented occurrences of B.pila outside North America. Hanns Kreisel recorded it from Russia, {{in what is}} now known as the Sakha Republic. The puffball has been tentatively identified from the Galápagos Islands, and has been collected from Pernambuco and São Paulo, Brazil. The South American material, however, has grayish-yellow coloration in the gleba, which may be indicative of not yet fully matured specimens. This renders identification of this material tentative, as <b>unripe</b> material may have different microscopic characteristics from mature material. Although the puffball has been reported from both the European part of Turkey as well as Anatolia, and from Morocco, reports without supporting microscopic or macroscopic information are viewed with skepticism.|$|E
500|$|Ficus aurea is a tree {{which may}} reach heights of [...] It is monoecious: each tree bears {{functional}} {{male and female}} flowers. The {{size and shape of}} the leaves is variable. Some plants have leaves that are usually less than 10cm (4in) long while others have leaves that are larger. The shape of the leaves and of the leaf base also varies—some plants have leaves that are oblong or elliptic with a wedge-shaped to rounded base, while others have heart-shaped or ovate leaves with cordate to rounded bases. F. aurea has paired figs which are green when <b>unripe,</b> turning yellow as they ripen. They differ in size (0.6–0.8cm , about 1cm , or 1.0–1.2cm [...] in diameter); figs are generally sessile, but in parts of northern Mesoamerica figs are borne on short stalks known as peduncles.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{approaches}} allegory {{in many of}} its details, such as {{the green}} plums of the title. Mothers warn their children not to eat green, <b>unripe</b> plums, claiming that they are poisonous. Yet the novel regularly depicts police officers gorging themselves on the fruit: [...] "The officers' lack of constraint in engulfing the fruit parallels the remorseless persecution of the human race" [...] under Nicolae Ceauşescu. The green plums also suggest childhood, or regression into childhood: [...] "The narrator watches the Romanian police guards {{in the streets of}} the city as they greedily pocket green plums... 'They reverted to childhood, stealing plums from village trees.' Ms. Muller's vision of a police state manned by plum thieves reads like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony, stupidity and brutality." ...|$|E
