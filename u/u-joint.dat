50|$|Over {{the winter}} months the {{pin-hole}} leak developed into a split, and {{a crack in the}} 16-inch pipework outside the buoy allowed water and oil to flood the central trunkway. This caused the buoy to lose more of its buoyancy. The loss of buoyancy in turn caused the upper <b>U-joint</b> to go into compression which allowed the 2,404 pound <b>U-joint</b> pin to wrench itself free.|$|E

50|$|A {{configuration}} {{known as}} a double Cardan joint drive shaft partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation. This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an intermediate shaft, with the second <b>U-joint</b> phased {{in relation to the}} first <b>U-joint</b> to cancel the changing angular velocity. In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the driving shaft, provided that both the driving shaft and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase. This assembly is commonly employed in rear wheel drive vehicles, where it is {{known as a}} drive shaft or propeller (prop) shaft.|$|E
50|$|A {{universal}} joint (universal coupling, <b>U-joint,</b> Cardan joint, Spicer or Hardy Spicer joint, or Hooke's joint) {{is a joint}} or coupling in a rigid rod whose axis are inclined to each other, and is commonly used in shafts that transmit rotary motion. It consists {{of a pair of}} hinges located close together, oriented at 90° to each other, connected by a cross shaft. The {{universal joint}} is not a constant-velocity joint.|$|E

50|$|Smaller {{diameter}} refrigerant paths {{can also}} be realized with extruded aluminium tubes. These have been designed with several microchannels in one flat, ribbon-like tube. Aluminium microchannel technology offers significant advantages over conventional copper-aluminium round tube plate fin coil, including improved heat transfer performance and reduced refrigerant charge.However, copper MicroGroove offers higher heat transfer efficiencies than aluminium microchannel tubes and it enables smaller refrigerant volumes because the tube ends of MicroGroove are connected by small <b>U-joints</b> rather than large headers.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, {{the slave}} {{cylinder}} on manual transmissions was moved {{outside of the}} transmissions bellhousing to allow for easier replacement, and in 1995 the Dana 30 larger U-joints were used axle U-joints (297x) and rear pinion <b>U-joint</b> (1330). For the 1992 model year, the YJ switched over to an electronic speedometer, outmoding the cable speedos on older YJs. 1995 was the only model year to have a fully galvanized frame and body.|$|E
50|$|On January 17, 1979, it was {{reported}} that the buoy was not standing up straight anymore. A diver was sent down to investigate and discovered that the <b>U-joint</b> pin had fallen out. The only thing keeping the buoy from floating away were the jumper hoses bridging the articulation. Three days later, after the buoy sustained more flooding, a diver reported that the buoy was now actually grounding on top of the riser.|$|E
50|$|In the Hotchkiss drive, slip-splines or a plunge-type (ball and {{trunnion}} <b>u-joint)</b> eliminate thrust transmitted {{back up the}} driveshaft {{from the}} axle, allowing simple rear-axle positioning using parallel leaf springs. In the torque-tube type this thrust is taken by the torque tube to the transmission and thence to the transmission and motor mounts to the frame. While the torque-tube type requires additional locating elements, such as a Panhard rod, this allows the use of coil springs.|$|E
50|$|Single-U {{butt welds}} are welds that have both {{edges of the}} weld surface shaped like a J, but once they come together, they form a U. Double-U joints have a U {{formation}} on both {{the top and bottom}} of the prepared joint. <b>U-joints</b> are the most expensive edge to prepare and weld. They are usually used on thick base metals where a V-groove would be at such an extreme angle, that it would cost too much to fill.|$|R
50|$|Alignment of {{the test}} {{specimen}} in the testing machine is critical, because if the specimen is misaligned, either at an angle or offset to one side, the machine will exert a bending force on the specimen. This is especially bad for brittle materials, because it will dramatically skew the results. This situation can be minimized by using spherical seats or <b>U-joints</b> between the grips and the test machine. If the initial portion of the stress-strain curve is curved and not linear, it indicates the specimen is misaligned in the testing machine.|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. This thesis details the initial development of a non-intrusive torque measurement system to measure torque in a rotating driveshaft like those commonly found on internal combustion engine powered irrigation pumping plants. A typical driveshaft used in pumping plant applications consists of flanged <b>U-joints</b> on each end with a constant cross-section steele tube portion connecting the <b>U-joints.</b> The photoelectric sensor based system was able to predict torque to within 3 ? 9. 1 N-m (346 in-lbs) under constant rpm conditions. Two sensor types, phototransistor and photodiode, were tested. The photodiode sensor was tested with two emitter types: infrared LED and red laser. No significant difference in response was found using either the LED or red laser emmitters. Both the photoelectric and photodiode sensor measurements showed correlation to actual torque. The photoelectric sensor configuration correlation had a standard error of 5 ?% of a typical natural-gas pumping plant installation running at 773. 9 N-m of torque. The sensors were mounted independent of the driveshaft and measured the phaseshift of two pins mounted on the shaft as they passed through the photosensing area. This caused extreme sensitivity to vibration of the engine and driveshaft. A similar design with a temporary mount connected to the shaft and transmitting the response signal via radio frequency telemetry could decrease the effects of vibration on the system...|$|R

50|$|During operation, the Thistle Alpha {{platform}} fed {{oil to the}} SALM {{through a}} pair of 16-inch pipelines. This hard piping ran up the base from opposing sides and terminated {{at the bottom of}} the riser near the first <b>U-joint</b> articulation. From that point the oil bridged the articulation through a pair of very thick 16-inch flexible jumper hoses, then continued up the riser through more hard piping, and over the riser-buoy articulation through another set of jumper hoses. From there, the oil flowed through product hoses to the shuttle tanker which was moored to the buoy.|$|E

They were {{equipped with a}} V8 petrol engine and slight suspension modifications to accommodate for slightly larger tires. The roof racks carried necessary supplies and equipment including rooftop tents where the team spent many nights out of the cold. The bumpers carried winches and lighting for rescue and low visibility driving. There were few troubles with the vehicles as a whole, but the punishing roads took its toll over time. Strut and exhaust bolts loosened up in South America, windows dropped into doors in the Outback, and a <b>U-joint</b> broke in Siberia. The biggest obstacle was fuel economy, which averaged around 12 mpg.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the kinematics of {{a special}} 6 -DOF parallel micro-manipulator with offset RR-joint configuration. Kinematics equations are derived and numerical methodologies to solve the inverse and forward kinematics are presented. The inverse and forward kinematics of such robots {{compared with those of}} 6 -UCU parallel robots are more complicated due to the existence of offsets between joints of RR-pairs. The characteristics of RR-pairs used in this manipulator are investigated and kinematics constraints of these offset <b>U-joints</b> are mathematically explained in order to find the best initial guesses for the numerical solution.

40|$|The paper proposes the {{mechanical}} {{design of a}} lockable spherical joint, {{which is designed to}} be manually or automatically configured in different kinematic solutions. In fact it {{can be used as a}} conventional spherical joint or converted in a universal joint or still downgraded to a revolute joint. Therefore different configurations can be chosen according to user needs. In particular, two of the three axes of revolution, arranged in the typical roll-pitch-roll sequence of robot spherical wrists, can be locked alternatively in order to provide two differently arranged <b>U-joints.</b> It can be demonstrated that such behavior allows to activate different mobilities of two classes of reconfigurable parallel kinematics manipulators. The transition between such mobilities occurs exploiting the concept of over-constrained kinematics, which is realized by the lockable joint during the switching phase in order to avoid an instantaneous mobility of the robot...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Failed <b>U-joint</b> is {{the most}} common {{vehicles}} driveline problem. The entry of dirt and water, as well as grease leakage caused by improper lubrication and sealing lead to corrosion and wear of <b>U-joint</b> bearings. When signs of excessive wear occur <b>U-joint</b> lose operational ability. Investigations have shown that proper motion transmission between shafts and <b>U-joint</b> operational ability significantly depends on its dimensions. Therefore, it is necessary to replace failed <b>U-joint</b> by a new one or to repair it. The repair is restoring to worn elements their useful properties and elemental functions through reconstruction of shape and dimensions. But when does the <b>U-joint</b> is going to repair is the important thing to be determine. This paper gives the analysis to determine repair life of <b>U-joint.</b> This can be done by finding wear after certain revolution of rotation of needle bearing...|$|E
30|$|A UP-equivalent PM can be {{obtained}} by connecting a moving platform to a fixed base using the three limbs listed in Table  2 or Table  3.

This Dana 44 had no axle tubes but {{attached}} to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had [...] "open air" [...] axles which traveled through the beams to the spindles.

A finite-element model of the antenna structural system was analyzed for response to this ground motion. Dynamic forces and displacements were computed in the locality of components that had failed during the earthquake. Calculated forces {{in the range of}} 30, 000 to 35, 000 lb on failed Y-axis actuator <b>U-joints</b> were consistent with laboratory load tests. The load capacity of these joints was found to be below the range of 34, 000 to 42, 000 lb.

3000|$|There {{are several}} {{necessary}} geometrical {{conditions in the}} mechanism. The first rotational axes of the two U-joints (s 1, s 7) are coincident. In limb 1 and limb 2, the R pairs have parallel axes (s 3, s 4, s 5, s 6). In limb 3, the R pair has an axis (s 9) parallel to line B 1 B 2 and the second rotational axis (s 8) of the <b>U-joint</b> within the same limb. The three P pairs (denoted by P [...]...|$|E

In an initial configuration, as shown in Figure  5 (a), s 1 and s 7 are parallel to s 3, s 4, s 5 and s 6. s 8 and s 9 are parallel to line B 1 B 2 and the second rotational axis (s 2) of the <b>U-joint</b> in limb 1. From this configuration, if we fix P 3 as well as axis s 1 of the <b>U-joint</b> and give P 1 and P 2 with different displacements, the mechanism will move to a configuration as in Figure  5 (b), in which s 2 is no longer parallel to s 8, s 9, and line B 1 B 2. The mechanism degenerates into a 2 -DOF mechanism with one rotational DOF around axis s 1 (s 7) and a translational DOF. This is denoted by 1 R 1 T configuration. In contrast, if we fix axis s 1, P 1, and P 2 in the initial configuration, and give a displacement to P 3, the mechanism will move to a configuration in Figure  5 (c), in which s 1 and s 7 are not parallel to s 3, s 4, s 5 and s 6. The mechanism in this configuration has three DOFs, including two rotations around axes s 1 and s 2; {{this is called the}} 2 R 1 T configuration. The rotational angle of s 1 always equals that of s 7, and the displacements of P 1 and P 2 are the same since limb 1 and limb 2 are designed to have identical dimensions. Therefore, if the mechanism is in the initial configuration, to prevent it from moving to the 1 R 1 T configuration, P 1 and P 2 should be properly controlled to ensure that | OA_ 1 | = | OA_ 2 | (O is the center of the <b>U-joint</b> in limb 1). Thus, s 2 will remain parallel to s 8, s 9, and line B 1 B 2. The mechanism continues working in the 2 R 1 T operation mode.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{kinematic}} geometry {{of a special}} 6 -RUS parallel manipulator for which the axes of all base actuated R-joints coincide, the centers of all U-joints move along the same circular track, and the platform S-joints coincide in pairs. Partic-ularly, the paper presents a geometric algorithm for the computa-tion of the constant-orientation workspace. An already known methodology has been enhanced to include the physical con-straint, modelled as three Bohemian dome surfaces, on the <b>U-joint</b> interference. In addition, the singularity loci for a constant orientation are shown to form a quartic surface. The workspace boundaries and the singularity loci are analytically computed and represented as horizontal cross-sections. Important observations are made on the singularities of general parallel mechanisms with pair-wise coincident S-joints. The paper also introduces the phe-nomenon that the workspace of some parallel mechanisms is di-vided into regions corresponding to different branch sets. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{instantaneous}} spatial higher pair to lower pair substitute-connection which is kinematically equivalent up to acceleration analysis for two smooth surfaces in point contact. The existing first-order equivalent substitute-connection {{consisting of a}} Hooke's joint (<b>U-joint)</b> and a spherical joint (S-joint) connected by an additional link is extended up to second-order. A two step procedure is chalked out for achieving this equivalence. First, the existing method is employed for velocity equivalence. In the second step, the two centers of substitution are obtained as a conjugate relationship involving the principal normal curvatures of the surfaces at the contact point and the screw coordinates of the instantaneous screw axis (ISA) of the first-order relative motion. Unlike the classical planar replacement, this particular substitution cannot be done by merely examining the profiles of the contacting surfaces. An illustrative example of a three-link direct-contact mechanism is presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{is already}} diffused and well-accepted as a revolutionary method of manufacturing. The main advantage gained by using AM compared to conventional subtractive method is its capability to produce parts which have high shape complexity, different material composition, hierarchical complexity and functionality complexity. Besides, {{to be able}} to utilize fully the abilities of AM, specific design tools are needed. For example, the part orientation must be optimally defined before fabrication by AM. Several studies to optimize part orientation have been proposed. Indeed, aspects to optimize in the choice of the orientation include the minimization of the surface roughness, build time, need of supports, and the increase of the part stability in building process, but there are very few work related to the accuracy of the part. Despite all these considerations, they consider the part as a single component. AM instead can directly fabricate assemblies, such as mechanical joints. In this type of part, the most important feature is the assembly feature. As such, orientation consideration should mainly focus on these features and not necessarily the whole part. This paper proposes a method to orient a part considering all components as a functional assembly. A case study of universal <b>U-joint</b> is presented to validate the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|The bearing {{stiffness}} has {{a considerable}} {{influence on the}} nonlinear coupling vibration characteristics of the shaft-final drive system. A 14 -DOF nonlinear coupled vibration model was established by employing the lumped mass method so as to identify the coupling effects of the bearing stiffness to the vibration response of the shaft-final drive system. The engine’s torque ripple, the alternating load from the universal joint (<b>U-joint),</b> and the time-varying mesh parameters of hypoid gear of the shaft-final drive system were also considered for accurate quantitative analysis. The numerical analysis of the vibration response of the coupled system was performed and the experimental measurements were carried out for the validation test. Results show that, at the given driving speed, improving the bearing stiffness can reduce the vibration response of the given coupled system; however, when the bearing stiffness increases to a critical value, the effects of bearing stiffness on the vibration reduction become insignificant; when the driving speed changes, the resonance regions of the coupled system vary with the bearing stiffness. The results are helpful to determine the proper bearing stiffness and the optimum control strategy for the shaft-final drive system. It is hoped that the optimal shaft-final drive system can provide good vibration characteristics to achieve the energy saving and noise reduction for the vehicle application...|$|E
