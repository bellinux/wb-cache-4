I speak of those colossal reservoirs cut out of the native rock and fed by a single spring, discharging their waters into an aqueduct of perforated stone, which, until a comparatively recent period, still conveyed them to Jerusalem. They are three in number, of varying lengths from five to six hundred feet, and almost as broad; their depth, still undiscovered. They communicate with each other, so that the water of the <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir,</b> flowing through the intermediate one, reached the third, which fed the aqueduct. They are lined with a hard cement like that which coats the pyramids, and which remains uninjured; and it appears that hanging gardens once surrounded them. The Arabs still call these reservoirs the pools of Solomon, nor is there any reason to doubt the tradition. Tradition, perhaps often more faithful than written documents, is a sure and almost infallible guide in the minds of the people where there has been no complicated variety of historic incidents to confuse and break the chain of memory; where their rare revolutions have consisted of an eruption once in a thousand years into the cultivated world; where society has never been broken up, but their domestic manners have remained the same; where, too, they revere truth, and are rigid in its oral delivery, since that is their only means of disseminating knowledge.|$|E

I examined potential limiting factors for black crappie in 4 sequential reservoirs on the Salt River, Arizona. Only in Roosevelt Reservoir, the <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir,</b> were crappie relatively abundant. I identified 3 possible limiting factors. Apache, Canyon, and Saguaro reservoirs lacked sufficient spawning substrates. All 4 reservoirs lacked sufficient cover. Finally, the lower 3 reservoirs are less productive during the fall according to chlorophyll a levels than Roosevelt Reservoir. Low productivity may have resulted in fewer zooplankton and possibly a limited forage base for juvenile crappie.

40|$|The Middle Jurassic Brent Group {{reservoirs}} in Northwest Hutton comprise shallow-marine, marginal-marine, and coastal-plain reservoir sandstones of both channelized and sheet geometries. The connectivity {{and production}} characteristics of these sandstones can be predicted {{through the application}} of high-resolution sequence stratigraphic correlation techniques. The Broom Formation overlies a basal Brent sequence boundary and is a lowstand to transgressive systems tract tidal-estuarine complex. The overlying Rannoch Formation comprises shoreface sands that represent a highstand systems tract. The overlying Etive Formation is a multilayer fluvial to estuarine channelized system of near fieldwide development interpreted as incised valley fills. The superjacent Ness Formation is genetically related to the Etive and is the main oil-bearing interval over much of the field. The Lower Ness comprises mouth-bar parasequences and is interpreted to be a transgressive systems tract to the Etive lowstand. The Upper Ness is a nonmarine delta plain succession, interpreted as a highstand systems tract. Upper Ness channel sands typically correlate between several wells and are oriented west-east. An interval of widespread, stacked channels indicates a change in drainage orientation and is related to a high-frequency relative sea level fall. The <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir</b> unit is the Tarbert Formation, related to a further major sequence boundary. Original repeat formation tester data support a stratigraphically well-connected reservoir model. Compartmentalization exists and is due to stratigraphic layering (laterally persistent mudstones creating low vertical permeability) and variable dimensions of channels and valley fills...|$|E
40|$|Saline {{formations}} {{are considered}} to be candidates for carbon sequestration due to their great depths, large storage volumes, and widespread occurrence. However, injecting carbon dioxide into low-permeability reservoirs is challenging. An active demonstration project for carbon dioxide sequestration in the Ordos Basin, China, began in 2010. The site is characterized by a deep, multi-layered saline reservoir with permeability mostly below 1. 0 × 10 - 14 m 2. Field observations so far suggest that only small-to-moderate pressure buildup has taken place due to injection. The Triassic Liujiagou sandstone {{at the top of the}} reservoir has surprisingly high injectivity and accepts approximately 80 % of the injected mass at the site. Based on these key observations, a three-dimensional numerical model was developed and applied, to predict the plume dynamics and pressure propagation, and in the assessment of storage safety. The model is assembled with the most recent data and the simulations are calibrated to the latest available observations. The model explains most of the observed phenomena at the site. With the current operation scheme, the CO 2 plume at the <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir</b> would reach a lateral distance of 658 m by the end of the project in 2015, and approximately 1, 000 m after 100 years since injection.

The basalts are slightly alkaline or transitional, have peaks at Ba and Nb in the mantle-normalized diagrams and relatively low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 7039 - 0. 7044). The silicic rocks (pantellerites and comendites) are rich in sanidine and anorthoclase, with mafic phases being represented by fayalite-rich olivine, opaque oxides, aenigmatite and slightly Na-rich ferroaugite (ferrohedenbergite). These rocks were generated after prolonged fractional crystallization process (up to 90 - 95 %) starting from basaltic parent magmas at shallow depths and fO 2 conditions near the QFM buffer. The apparent Daly Gap between mafic and evolved Boseti rocks is explained with a model involving the silicic products filling upper crustal magma chambers and erupted preferentially with respect to basic and intermediate products.

40|$|Anastamosing, low {{gradient}} distributary channels produce {approx} 30 gravity, paraffinic oils {{from the}} Middle Member of the lacustrine Eocene Green River Formation in the south-central {{portion of the}} Uinta Basin. This localized depocenter was situated along the fluctuating southern shoreline of Lake Uinta, where complex deposits of marginal-lacustrine to lower delta plain accumulations are especially characteristic. The Middle Member contains several fining-upward parasequences that can be recognized in outcrop, core, and downhole logs. Each parasequence is about 60 to 120 feet thick and consists of strata deposited during multiple lake level fluctuations that approach 30 to 35 feet in individual thickness. Such parasequences represent 300, 000 -year cycles based on limited absolute age dating. The subaerial to subaqueous channels commonly possess an erosional base and exhibit a fining upward character. Accordingly, bedding features commonly range from large-scale trough and planar cross bedding or lamination at the base, to a nonreservoir, climbing ripple assemblage near the <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir</b> boundary. The best reservoir quality occurs within the laminated to cross-stratified portions, and the climbing ripple phase usually possesses more deleterious micas and/or detrital clays. Diagenesis also exerts a major control on reservoir quality. Certain sandstones were cemented by an early, iron-poor calcite cement, which can be subsequently leached. Secondary intergranular porosity (up to 20 %) is {{largely responsible for the}} 10 - 100 millidarcy rock, which represents petrophysical objectives for both primary and secondary production. Otherwise, intense compaction, silicic and iron-rich carbonate cements, and authigenic clays serve to reduce reservoir quality to marginal economic levels...|$|E

Ineach year, survival was estimated from observations of marked fish in a portion of thehydropower system corridor. We expanded these estimates to calculate an annual estimate ofsurvival over the entire system (head of <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir</b> to tailrace of lowermost dam). Temporal changes in the hydropower system were compared with trends in estimated survival toevaluate the effects of dams on survival of downstream migrants. When only four dams were inplace (1966 – 1967), estimates of survival through the hydropower system were 32 – 56 %. Fouradditional dams were constructed between 1968 and 1975. Survival estimates during the 1970 stypically were 10 – 30 % for spring–summer Chinook salmon, but less than 3 % in the drought yearsof 1973 and 1977. From 1993 to 1999, after structural and operational changes in the hydropowersystem, survival estimates of spring–summer Chinook salmon and steelhead ranged from 31 % to 59 %. Smolt-to-adult return rates of Snake River wild spring–summer Chinook salmon from themiddle to late 1960 s generally exceeded 4 % but decreased during the 1970 s. Although survivalthrough the hydropower system in the 1990 s is substantially greater than that in the 1970 s, adultreturn rates in the 1990 s have remained low.

Its total catchment area is around 6, 200 km 2, while the {{mean annual precipitation}} and runoff are 680 mm and 40 m 3 /s, respectively. The Hellenic part of the catchment has undergone a substantial hydroelectric development, since two dams associated with major hydropower pumped-storage facilities are in operation. The main objective of the paper is to assess the expected sediment delivery of Nestos R. at the <b>uppermost</b> Thisavros <b>reservoir</b> site. This {{has been carried out}} by implementing the Universal Soil Loss Equation in a GIS environment for determining the mean annual soil erosion in conjunction with a suspended sediment measurement program (114 measurements in total) accomplished between 1965 and 1983 adjacent to the dam site. The sediment discharge rating curve between sediment and river discharges in a power form has been constructed using five alternative techniques, namely (a) the linear regression of the log-transformed variables, (b) the same as (a) but with the Ferguson correction, (c) different ratings for the dry and wet seasons of the year, (d) the nonlinear regression, and (e) the broken line interpolation that utilizes different rating parameters for two discharge classes. It is shown that the mean annual sediment yield is almost equal for all rating curve formulations and varies between 178. 5 t km- 2 and 203. 4 t km- 2 and the highest value results from the broken line interpolation method.

The core plugs are all fine- to medium-grained, Franciscan-assemblage (late Mesozoic) metagraywacke with sparse Franciscan metamorphic quartz-calcite veins and late Cenozoic, hydrothermal quartz-calcite-pyrite veins. The matrices of three plugs from the caprock are rich in metamorphic mixed-layer illite/smectite and disseminated hydrothermal pyrite; the reservoir plug instead contains abundant illite and only minor pyrite. The reservoir plug and one caprock plug are sparsely disrupted by latest-stage, unmineralized microfractures which both follow and crosscut veinlets but which could be artifacts. Porosities of the plugs, measured by Boyles-law gas expansion, range between 1. 9 and 2. 5 %.

Matrix permeabilities in the range 10 - 21 m&sup 2; (= 1 nanodarcy) were measured for two plugs that included mineral-filled veins but no unfilled microfractures. Greater permeabilities were measured on plugs that contained microfractures; at 500 psi net confining pressure, an effective aperture of 1. 6 µm was estimated for one plug.

The eastern province of Haltenbanken in the Norwegian Sea constitutes a normally- to hydrostatic pressured region, and is host to several large {{oil and gas}} fields as well as minor discoveries. This study aims to investigate the controls on the hydrocarbon column-heights {{and the distribution of}} hydrocarbons in the area. Regional seismic interpretation of the main reservoir units in the area, the Fangst and Båt Groups, has been conducted on the basis of 3 -D seismic and published well data. Investigation and mapping of fluid contact locations relative to spill points allowed for distinguishing between filled and underfilled structures. Seismic amplitude variations in the overburden above the Jurassic reservoirs were investigated to identify potential areas of leakage. Results from the 15 investigated structures in the study area can give the following categorization: 1) fluid contacts coinciding with spill point, 2) fluid contacts that do not coincide with spill point and 3) structures where {{it was not possible to}} determine the controlling factors. Nine structures have fluid contacts coinciding with spill point, and are suggested to be filled. The location of spill point is suggested to be the controlling factor on the column-height in these structures. One structure is suggested to be underfilled, and in one of the structures the <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir</b> level is suggested to be underfilled while deeper reservoir levels are likely filled. The column-heights in the reportedly underfilled reservoirs are suggested to be controlled by vertical leakage. In one of the structures the fluid contact is located deeper than spill point, and the column-height is suggested to be controlled by fault sealing and/or leakage through the seal. The controlling factor on hydrocarbon column-heights in the remaining four structures remains unclear, as it has not been possible to map the fluid contacts relative to spill point. Two additional dry structures in the area were investigated, where lack of migration and lack of structural closure is suggested to be the cause for the lack of hydrocarbons.

40|$|This study {{examined}} petroleum occurrence in Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian reservoirs in the Illinois Basin. Results from this project {{show that there}} is excellent potential for additional discovery of petroleum reservoirs in these formations. Numerous exploration targets and exploration strategies were identified {{that can be used to}} increase production from these underexplored strata. Some of the challenges to exploration of deeper strata include the lack of subsurface data, lack of understanding of regional facies changes, lack of understanding the role of diagenetic alteration in developing reservoir porosity and permeability, the shifting of structural closures with depth, overlooking potential producing horizons, and under utilization of 3 D seismic techniques. This study has shown many areas are prospective for additional discoveries in lower Paleozoic strata in the Illinois Basin. This project implemented a systematic basin analysis approach that is expected to encourage exploration for petroleum in lower Paleozoic rocks of the Illinois Basin. The study has compiled and presented a broad base of information and knowledge needed by independent oil companies to pursue the development of exploration prospects in overlooked, deeper play horizons in the Illinois Basin. Available geologic data relevant for the exploration and development of petroleum reservoirs in the Illinois Basin was analyzed and assimilated into a coherent, easily accessible digital play portfolio. The primary focus of this project was on case studies of existing reservoirs in Devonian, Silurian, and Ordovician strata and the application of knowledge gained to future exploration and development in these underexplored strata of the Illinois Basin. In addition, a review of published reports and exploration in the New Albany Shale Group, a Devonian black shale source rock, in Illinois was completed due to the recent increased interest in Devonian black shales across the United States. The New Albany Shale is regarded as the source rock for petroleum in Silurian and younger strata in the Illinois Basin and has potential as a petroleum reservoir. Field studies of reservoirs in Devonian strata such as the Geneva Dolomite, Dutch Creek Sandstone and Grassy knob Chert suggest that there is much additional potential for expanding these plays beyond their current limits. These studies also suggest the potential for the discovery of additional plays using stratigraphic concepts to develop a subcrop play on the subkaskaskia unconformity boundary that separates lower Devonian strata from middle Devonian strata in portions of the basin. The lateral transition from Geneva Dolomite to Dutch Creek Sandstone also offers an avenue for developing exploration strategies in middle Devonian strata. Study of lower Devonian strata in the Sesser Oil Field and the region surrounding the field shows opportunities for development of a subcrop play where lower Devonian strata unconformably overlie Silurian strata. Field studies of Silurian reservoirs along the Sangamon Arch show that opportunities exist for overlooked pays in areas where wells do not penetrate deep enough to test all reservoir intervals in Niagaran rocks. Mapping of Silurian reservoirs in the Mt. Auburn trend along the Sangamon Arch shows that porous reservoir rock grades laterally to non-reservoir facies and several reservoir intervals may be encountered in the Silurian with numerous exploration wells testing only the <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir</b> intervals. Mapping of the Ordovician Trenton and shallower strata at Centralia Field show that the crest of the anticline shifted through geologic time.

40|$|I {{would like}} to thank the Sleipner License Partners (Statoil, Total E&P Norge and ExxonMobil) for access to seismic {{reflection}} datasets and for permission to publish my results. Since 1996, super-critical CO_ 2 has been injected at a rate of ∼ 0. 85 Mt yr^- 1 into a pristine, saline aquifer at the Sleipner carbon capture and storage project. A suite of time-lapse, three-dimensional seismic reflection surveys have been acquired over the injection site. This suite includes a pre-injection survey acquired in 1994 and seven post-injection surveys acquired between 1999 and 2010. Nine consistently bright reflections within the reservoir, mapped on all post-injection surveys, are interpreted to be thin layers of CO_ 2 trapped beneath mudstone horizons. The areal extents of these CO_ 2 layers are observed to either increase or remain constant with time. However, volume flux of CO_ 2 into these layers has proven difficult to measure accurately. In addition, the complex planform of the shallowest layer, Layer 9, has proven challenging to explain using reservoir simulations. In this dissertation, the spatial distribution of CO_ 2 in Layer 9 is measured in three dimensions using a combination of seismic reflection amplitudes and changes in two-way travel time between time-lapse seismic reflection surveys. The CO_ 2 volume in this layer is shown to be growing at an increasing rate through time. To investigate CO_ 2 flow within Layer 9, a numerical gravity current model that accounts for topographic gradients is developed. This vertically-integrated model is computationally efficient, allowing it to be inverted to find reservoir properties that minimise differences between measured and modelled CO_ 2 distributions. The best-fitting reservoir permeability agrees with measured values from nearby wells. Rapid northward migration of CO_ 2 in Layer 9 is explained by a high permeability channel, inferred from spectral decomposition of the seismic reflection surveys. This numerical model is found to be capable of forecasting CO_ 2 flow by comparing models calibrated on early seismic reflection surveys to observed CO_ 2 distributions from later surveys. Numerical and analytical models are then used to assess the effect of the proximity of an impermeable base on the flow of a buoyant fluid, motivated by the variable thickness of the <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Spatial gradients in the confinement of the reservoir are found to direct the flow of CO_ 2 when the current is of comparable thickness to the reservoir. Finally, CO_ 2 volume in the second shallowest layer, Layer 8, is measured using structural analysis and numerical modelling. CO_ 2 in Layer 8 is estimated to have reached the spill point of its structural trap by 2010. CO_ 2 flux into the upper two layers is now ∼ 40 % of total CO_ 2 flux injected at the base of the reservoir, and is increasing with time. This estimate is supported by observations of decreasing areal growth rate of the lower layers. The uppermost layers are therefore expected to contribute significantly to the total reservoir storage capacity in the future. CO_ 2 flow within Layer 9 beyond 2010 is forecast to be predominantly directed towards a topographic dome located ∼ 3 km north of the injection point. This dissertation shows that advances in determining the spatial distribution and flow of CO_ 2 in the sub-surface can be made by a combination of careful seismic interpretation and numerical flow modelling.

Both zones in the corehole are developed in superficially similar, fractured, complexly veined and locally sericitized, Franciscan (late Mesozoic) graywacke-argillite sequences. However, whereas the reservoir rocks host two major fluid conduits (potential steam entries), the caprock is only sparingly permeable. This discrepancy appears to reflect principally vein texture and mineralogy. Two types of veins {{are common in}} the core [...] randomly-oriented, Franciscan metamorphic quartz-calcite veins; and high-angle, late Cenozoic veins deposited by The Geysers hydrothermal system. The older veins locally contain hydrothermal carbonate-dissolution vugs, which, although concentrated at the larger fluid conduit, are scattered throughout the core. The younger veins, commonly with intercrystalline vugs, consist dominantly of euhedral quartz, calcite, K-feldspar, wairakite, and pyrite [...] those in the reservoir rock also contain minor epidote and illite. The corresponding caprock veins are devoid of epidote but contain abundant, late-stage, mixed-layer illite/smecite (5 - 18 % smectite interlayers) with minor chlorite/smectite (40 - 45 % smectite interlayers). We suggest that clots of these two expandable clays in the caprock clog otherwise permeable veins and carbonate-dissolution networks at strategic sites to produce or enhance the seal on the underlying steam reservoir. Illite/smectite geothermometry indicates that the SB- 15 -D caprock clays were precipitated in the approximate temperature range 180 - 218 C, {{and those in the}} reservoir at about 218 - 238 C. These temperatures, along with occurrence of the clays on commonly etched calcite, K-feldspar, or wairakite, suggest that the clays were precipitated from mildly acidic steam condensate under conditions similar to those now prevailing...|$|R
40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringBP’s Skarv {{field is}} a stacked three layer {{reservoir}} structure. The field development plan involves drilling deviated and horizontal wells into the <b>uppermost</b> <b>reservoir</b> layer, Garn, and the lowermost reservoir layer, Tilje. Above Garn {{is a high}} pressure zone, that requires 1. 59 sg mud weight to be drilled. When Garn {{have proven to be}} a strong formation, the overburden and Garn is drilled as one section in Skarv drilling phase 1 to reach Tilje. A 9 7 / 8 ” shoe is set in top Tilje and the reservoir section in Tilje is drilled with an 8 ½” bit and left open hole and completed with gravel pack. The drainage strategy involves pressure support in Tilje, hence Garn will deplete with a faster rate. In phase 2 Garn will have depleted to an extent that drilling with 1. 59 mud will become a to large overbalance regarding differential sticking issues. The 9 7 / 8 ” shoe must therefore be set in top Garn. Due to the low pressure in Garn, Garn must be sealed off before drilling Tilje to avoid crossflow from Tilje into Garn. Garn and Ile, the middle sand, will be drilled with an 8 ½” bit. Traditionally a 7 ” liner will be set between top Garn and top Tilje. This will give a slim hole solution in the Tilje reservoir section which can lead to insufficient gravel packing resulting in hole collapse. It was proposed that expandable liner could be the solution to maintain an 8 ½” hole in Tilje. Available solutions for Skarv have been identified and Expandable liners from two vendors, Enventure GT’s SET® open hole liner and Baker Hughes linEXX™ monobore liner have been analyzed in StressCheck for installation, drilling and production loads an expandable liner could possible need to endure through the life off the well. Skarv’s J- 4 well, Skarv basis of design, Skarv casing design, NORSOK and BP internal regulations are used to set up a model in StressCheck. Expandables are special tubulars that are expanded down hole by mechanically or hydraulically pushing or pulling a cone or mandrel through the tubular. beyond the yield point, permanently deforming the pipe. When undergoing such expansion the mechanical properties of the pipes are changed. To gain a complete picture of what load scenarios the expandable must endure, the expandables were modeled both as pre- and post expanded. The analysis includes five different pressure regimes and four different mud weights as drilling and displacement fluids. Pressure regimes were calculated based on the expected depletion rate in Garn and mud weight were calculated based on minimum required mud weight in relation to well stability. Output from the analysis are safety factors, SF. For Skarv, minimum required SF for burst and collapse loads are 1. 10 and 1. 00 for collapse. In general, the limiting factor for an expandable is the collapse strength. The results however show that the limiting factors for depleted Garn is related to the burst loading, when the liners internal pressure which is the weight of the mud and the applied surface pressure, as in a pressure test, will exceed the low external reservoir pressure. For the 7. 625 X 9 7 / 8 ” SET® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 93 for burst and 2. 35 for collapse. For the 8. 625 X 10 3 / 4 ” SET® liner, the minimum SF was 0. 88 for burst and 2. 02 for collapse. For linEXX™ liner was 0. 73 for burst and 1. 32 for collapse. For all cases it was the high test pressure and injection pressures that casued the low SF. The internal pressure in a well is the pressure that can be controlled, which propose that expandables are a god solution for depleted reservoirs. By designing the well parameters to ensure the liners burst limit will not be exceeded, by e. g. tailor making the mud weight, expandable liner can be installed in Skarv wells. The expandables are not easily modeled in StressCheck when it proved challenging to ensure the correct properties are input for the pre- and post-expanded pipes and combining the two. For StressCheck to be a reliable tool for expandables, vendor should supply exact numbers or a range for both the pre-and post-expansion properties as the input variables required in StressCheck.
