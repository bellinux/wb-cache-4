In any household with more than one occupant, this is a nonprobability sample, because some {{people are more likely to}} answer the door (e.g. an <b>unemployed</b> <b>person</b> who spends most of their time at home is more likely to answer than an employed housemate who might be at work when the interviewer calls) and it's not practical to calculate these probabilities.|$|E
500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture an <b>unemployed</b> <b>person,</b> living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E

40|$|Older {{people are}} one of the most {{vulnerable}} categories, and day after day they are exposed to various risks. One of the risks is unemployment which results in deterioration of the financial situation and consequently in diminishing of the autonomy and the quality of life. Risk society can help older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> at integration in the educational process and in this manner can contribute to risk control. For this reason older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons,</b> registered at Employment Service, are integrated in measures of active employment politics, and in this way they become more employable in the labour market. In my research I tried to get acquainted more in detail with possibilities offered to older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> with a higher education in the labour market, in case they integrate into an institutionalized educational process and acquire additional computer skills. I wanted to establish whether the education was an important factor at motivation and integration in the educational process. Further on I tried to find out what the role of a social pedagogue at Employment Service was, and in what manner the social pedagogue could induce motivation of older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> at their integration in additional functional educational processes. I performed a quantitative research by means of a non-standard questionnaire, which I offered to <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> who in the period of unemployment integrated in a computer course in order to obtain ECDL Certificate. Data were processed by means of a quantitative analysis. The results show that there are not substantial differences between motivation of older and younger <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons,</b> as well as there are no differences between educational structure of the <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons.</b> Older <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> with a higher education are not more motivated than their counterparts with a lower education. However, older women are more motivated for the educational process than older men. When discussing work experience, I found out that <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> with less work experience are as eager to participate in the educational process as their counterparts with more work experience. The role of employment advisor at Employment Service is comparable to the role of social pedagogue; namely the employment advisor introduces social pedagogical doctrine in his/her work, he/she acts directly in the actual situation, at solving problems he/she originates from the needs and wishes of the individual, and finally he/she tries to empower the individual to find, with a professional help and intervention, employment as soon as possible. ...|$|R
