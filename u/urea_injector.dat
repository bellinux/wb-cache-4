40|$|Abstract—Diesel vehicle {{should be}} {{equipped}} with emission after-treatment devices as NOx reduction catalyst and particulate filters {{in order to meet}} more stringer diesel emission standard. Urea-SCR is being developed as the most efficient method of reducing NOx emissions in the after-treatment devices of diesel engines, and recent studies have begun to mount the Urea-SCR device for diesel passenger cars and light duty vehicles. In the present study, the effects of the mixer on the efficiency of urea-SCR System (i. e., NH 3 uni-formity index (NH 3 UI) is investigated by predicting the transport phenomena in the urea-SCR system. The three dimensional Eulerian-Lagrangian CFD simulation for internal flow and spray characteristics in front of SCR is carried out by using STAR-CCM+ 7. 06 code. In addition, the paper proposes a method to minimize the wall-wetting around the <b>urea</b> <b>injector</b> in order to prevent injector blocks caused by solid urea loading. Keywords—Computational fluid dynamics, Multi-phase flow, NH 3 uniformity index, Urea-SCR system, Urea-water-solution. I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Selective Catalytic Reduction is {{effective}} in the reduction of NOx emission. This research focused to evaluate {{the performance of a}} urea-SCR system and was conducted in two procedures. One is SCR reactor test using model gas in order to provide an optimal injection condition itself. In this step, some parametric study on emission temperature, space velocity, aspect ratio and the formation of urea spray were made by using flow visualization and Computation Fluid Dynamics techniques. The basic simulation results contributed in determining the layout for an actual engine test. The other is an engine performance and emission test. The <b>urea</b> <b>injector</b> was placed at the opposite direction of exhaust gases emitted into an exhaust duct and an optimal amount of a reducing agent is estimated accurately under different engine loads and speeds. Furthermore, the variation of NOx emission and applied amount of urea was investigated in terms of modes under the condition of with and without SCR, and other emissions such as PM, CO and NMHC were evaluated quantitatively as well. This research may provide fundamental data for the practical use of urea-SCR in future...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Diesel engines {{can produce}} higher fuel {{efficiency}} and lower CO 2 emission, they {{are subject to}} ever more stringent emission regulation. However, there are two major emission concerns for diesel engines like such as particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Moreover, {{it is not easy to}} satisfy the regulations on the emission of NOx and PM, which are getting more strengthened. One of the solutions is to apply the new combustion concept using multistage injection such as HCCI and PCCI. The other solution is to apply after-treatment systems. For example, lean NOx trap catalyst, Urea-SCR and others have various advantages and disadvantages. Especially, Urea-SCR system have advantages such as a high conversion efficiency and a wide operation conditions. Hence the key factor to implementation of Urea-SCR technology, good mixing of urea(Ammonia) and gas, reducing Ammonia slip. Urea mixer components are required to facilitate evaporation and mixing because the liquid state of urea poses significant barriers for evaporation, and the distance to mixer is the most critical that affect mixer performance. In this study, to find out the distance from injector to mixer and simulation factor, a laser diagnostics and high speed camera are used to analyze <b>urea</b> <b>injector</b> spray characteristics and to present a distribution of urea solution in transparent manifold In addition, Drople...|$|E
40|$|With {{every new}} {{revision}} of government emission regulations, the {{limit on the}} tailpipe NOx is getting lower, forcing engine manufacturers to innovate {{in order to meet}} new targets. NOx emission reduction can be achieved through engine management strategies, however, {{there is a limit to}} the level of NOx reduction and, often, a penalty is associated with completely relying on engine strategies. Urea-SCR system, a type of diesel aftertreatment, provides a means of reduction of NOx downstream of the engine so as to provide the engine more flexibility to operate at higher efficiencies, which can be associated with high engine-out NOx emissions. ^ The aim of this research is to explore various urea-SCR dosing control strategies and evaluate the benefits and tradeoffs associated with change in operating parameters as well as amongst different strategies for a light-duty diesel application. Various components such as supply module, <b>urea</b> <b>injector,</b> sensors, etc., were calibrated and integrated to form the urea-SCR system, centrally controlled by Woodward SECM 112 controller. The system integration included communication channel setup and internal diagnostics for fault detection. Two principal dosing control strategies were developed, namely stoichiometric dosing strategy and NH 3 feedback control strategy. Stoichiometric dosing strategy doses DEF to produce NH 3 which is in stoichiometric equivalence to the engine-out NOx. NH 3 feedback control uses the NH 3 sensor to track a certain NH 3 slip set-point. ^ Protocols were developed for dynamometer testing in order to ensure repeatability of tests and to maintain the system at conditions that would ensure all measurement equipment was in safe operating region. Testing of the current platform was done on a chassis dynamometer and measurements were taken from on-board sensors. Steady-state and transient tests were performed by multiple parameters such as catalyst temperature and ANR (Ammonia to NOx Ratio). Drive cycles such as the UDDS and the HWFET were run to perform transient testing. ^ The lowest measured tailpipe emission levels were 0. 47 g/mile for a UDDS cycle with a constant ANR of 2. The performance of the NH 3 feedback control was evaluated in terms of ability to track an NH 3 slip set-point for steady state and in the presence of disturbances such as fluctuating NOX concentrations upstream and fluctuating space velocities at the catalyst. The performance of the feedback control system was found to be robust. This thesis concludes with recommendations for improvement in the performance of the current urea-SCR system based on the results obtained from testing. ...|$|E
