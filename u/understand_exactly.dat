25|$|We do not <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> how Renaissance artists {{thought about}} the Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian Piazza San Marco was adorned with carpets hanging from {{the windows of the}} {{surrounding}} palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate pseudo-kufic writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did not understand.|$|E

[...] "The reality is that even with Miranda warnings, it's doubtful that young people <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> what it all means and understand their choices, and so in the long run, I doubt that there will be many fewer confessions because of this opinion." ...|$|E

The {{latter half of the}} episode introduced a very wide array of twists; Owen speculated that the episode could lose viewers at the end due to its [...] "minimal hand-holding", suggesting {{that there may have been}} too many twists. [...] "If you missed just one line of dialogue", he explained, [...] "it would've left you scrambling to <b>understand</b> <b>exactly</b> what's going on between the three characters".|$|E

2500|$|Sunset Boulevard was {{the last}} {{collaboration}} between Wilder and Brackett. They parted amicably and respected their long-term partnership by not airing any grievance publicly.

To this end, a questionnaire was answered by 41 experts and 297 students. The results show that both, students and professors, possess misconceptions regarding confidence intervals. The conception that these intervals contain sample means or single values of the population instead of possible parameter values, and the interpretation of significance levels as a measure of certainty, without any frequency referent, were found to be the most generalized misconceptions...|$|R
