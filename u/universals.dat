5|$|The {{first few}} (1–3 in Ayt Ayache and Ayt Ndhir) {{cardinal}} numerals have native Berber and borrowed Arabic forms. All higher cardinals are borrowed from Arabic, {{consistent with the}} linguistic <b>universals</b> that the numbers 1–3 {{are much more likely}} to be retained, and that a borrowed number generally implies that numbers greater than it are also borrowed. The retention of one is also motivated by the fact that Berber languages near-universally use unity as a determiner.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his {{linguist}} friends who also worked {{to spread the}} influence of Whorf's ideas on the relation between language, culture and cognition. Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death. In the 1960s Whorf's views fell out of favor and he {{became the subject of}} harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive <b>universals</b> rather than cultural differences. Critics argued that Whorf's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for some}} 17 years. Like Plato, he sought <b>universals</b> in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos and the marine life in the island's lagoon at Pyrrha. This study made him the earliest natural historian whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) and Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{preparing}} {{for the beginning of}} her new talk show, Dealbreakers. Jack's rival, Devon Banks (Will Arnett), complicates the situation by threatening to publicly ridicule Jack if the show loses money. Jack, under pressure, begins to interfere with Liz's appearance, sending her over the edge with insecurity. After 510 takes, they finally settle on an opening title to the show. After Liz locks herself in her dressing room, Jack shuts Dealbreakers down, but manages to break even by selling the show's opening titles; in future, whenever a television show is playing in the background of a Sheinhardt <b>Universals</b> soap opera, the Dealbreakers titles will be shown.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for about}} 20 years. Like Plato, he sought <b>universals</b> in his philosophy, but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos, where he spent about two years, and the marine life in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre. This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lycaeum, where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong's {{theory of}} <b>universals</b> {{gives him the}} basis for an {{understanding}} of laws of nature as being relations between <b>universals,</b> a non-Humean account of laws of nature proposed independently by Armstrong, Michael Tooley, and Fred Dretske. This account posits that the relations between <b>universals</b> are truthmakers for the statements about physical laws, and it is realist as it accepts that laws of nature are {{a feature of the}} world rather than just a way we talk about the world. Armstrong identifies the laws as holding between <b>universals</b> rather than particulars as an account of laws involving just particulars rather than <b>universals</b> would not adequately explain how laws of nature operate in the case of counterfactuals.|$|E

25|$|In addition, Aristotle {{disagreed}} with Plato about {{the location of}} <b>universals.</b> As Plato spoke {{of the world of}} the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that <b>universals</b> exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated.

25|$|Plato, a pupil of Socrates, {{was one of}} the earliest, most {{influential}} philosophers. His reputation comes from his idealism of believing in the existence of <b>universals.</b> His Theory of Forms proposes that <b>universals</b> do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the dialogue of The Republic, the character of Socrates describes the Form of the Good. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant {{to the question of the}} meaning of life.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle {{disagreed}} with Plato on this point, arguing that all <b>universals</b> are instantiated. Aristotle {{argued that there}} are no <b>universals</b> that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.|$|E

25|$|Anthroposophy {{describes}} reincarnation {{from the}} point of view of Western philosophy and culture. The ego is believed to transmute transient soul experiences into <b>universals</b> that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death. These <b>universals</b> include ideas, which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal (spiritual consciousness), intentionally formed human character (spiritual life), and becoming a fully conscious human being (spiritual humanity). Rudolf Steiner described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation, such as that one's will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next, and a number of successive lives of various individualities.|$|E
