5|$|Pomeranians have a thick, double coat. While {{grooming}} is not difficult, breeders {{recommend that}} it be done daily to maintain {{the quality of the}} coat and because of its thickness and the constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and harsh in texture while the <b>undercoat</b> is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily, particularly when the <b>undercoat</b> is being shed, which happens twice a year.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} Renaissance, {{painters}} such as Duccio di Buoninsegna learned to paint faces {{first with a}} green <b>undercoat,</b> then with pink, which gave the faces a more realistic hue. Over the centuries the pink has faded, making some of the faces look green.|$|E
5|$|The Galloway is {{naturally}} hornless, {{and instead of}} horns has a bone knob {{at the top of}} its skull called the poll. This breed's shaggy coat has both a thick, woolly <b>undercoat</b> for warmth and stiffer guard hairs that help shed water, making them well adapted to harsher climates.|$|E
40|$|For {{jewellery}} applications electroplated white bronze (CuSn) {{was investigated}} as <b>undercoating</b> for noble metal finishes as alternative to nickel. A strongly acidic plating bath was developed with an organic additive to suppress hydrogen evolution and obtain bright coatings. An electrochemical {{study of the}} bath shows that the additive strongly inhibits the hydrogen evolution reaction around the equilibrium potential for Sn deposition. Whereas at more anodic potentials Sn UPD is observed, at more cathodic potentials mass transfer controlled CuSn deposition takes place with 95 % current efficieny. Under these conditions bright nanocrystalline CuSn alloy coatings with 0 - 50 % Sn are formed. The corrosion resistance of gold finished jewellery items with a 5 um 50 % Sn bronze <b>undercoating</b> was compared to that with a 5 um nickel <b>undercoating.</b> Various accelerated corrosion tests show that both the first onset of corrosion and the corrosion propagation are equal or slower for bronze compared to nickel. The bronze coating prevents tarnishing in a thioacetemide test for more than 144 hours whereas with a nickel <b>undercoating</b> tarnishing is seen after 8 hours. EIS analysis indicates slower coating degradation with a CuSn <b>undercoating</b> when abraded in artificial sweat actual jewellery items coated in an industrial pilot bath gave similar promising results...|$|R

5|$|The Scottish Terrier {{typically}} has a hard, wiry outer {{coat with}} a soft, dense <b>undercoat.</b> The coat should be trimmed and blended into the furnishings {{to give a}} distinct Scottish Terrier outline. The longer coat on the beard, legs and lower body may be slightly softer than the body coat but should not be or appear fluffy.|$|E
5|$|The West Highland White Terrier, {{commonly}} known as the Westie is a breed of dog from Scotland with a distinctive white harsh coat with a somewhat soft white <b>undercoat.</b> The modern breed is descended from a number of breeding programs of white terriers in Scotland before the 20th century. Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, is credited with the creation of the modern breed from his Poltalloch Terrier, but {{did not want to be}} known as such.|$|E
5|$|Their fur is {{darker than}} other spaniels {{and they have}} no <b>undercoat</b> like most of the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some {{occasional}} markings on the chest. They can make good family dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.|$|E
40|$|Tension and shear {{tests have}} been carried out to clarify the effects of surface 	treatments of carbon steel and {{stainless}} steel on the bonding strength of gas 	sprayed aluminium castings on them. Surface treatments of steels used in this 	investigation consisted of polyshing by emery paper， sand blasting and acid 	pickling respectively. In addition， effect of Ni-Al <b>undercoating</b> which sprayed 	after above treatments was tested. 	Aluminium coatings sprayed on the surfaces polyshed by emery paper and acid 	pickled were easy to peel off from steel surfaces during spraying and Ni-Al 	<b>undercoating</b> was useful in order to improve on bonding strenngth. Thikness of 	this <b>undercoating</b> was enough at most O. 05 mm. Due to this undercoating， carbon 	steel polyshed by sand blasting and stainless steel pickled in acid were established 	strong bonding strength. These treatments generated on the surface of steel the 	optimum pitting shapes which provided sprayed aluminium with anchoring effect. 	Bonding strength of coating was highly increased by the use of annealing process 	after deposit...|$|R

40|$|Microstrip gas {{chambers}} {{are highly}} performing {{in terms of}} stable operation at high rates and fluxes of minimum ionizing particles. They are manufactured on thin glass (D- 263) coated with a thin diamond-like layer by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) before photolithogrpahy (<b>undercoated)</b> or after (overcoated), thus rendering the substrate within the desired range of surface resistivities 10 ^ 14 - 10 ^ 16 W/q. Several overcoated and <b>undercoated</b> chambers have been operational for detecting minimum ionizing particles. The highly ionizing fragments due to copious rate of thermal neutrons and low energy hadrons however, are a serious concern for the discharge limits of these devices in a severe environment {{like that of the}} CMS tracker at LHC. In this work, we have performed a systematic investigation of such limits exposing overcoated and <b>undercoated</b> chambers to 5 MeV alphas, operating with gas mixtu res of argon or neon with DME. The results indicate a definite decrease of maximum voltage and a weak dependence on the gas choice. The dependence on the artwork and the metalization used for the strips remains to be investigated...|$|R
5|$|They have a {{moderately}} long single coat with no <b>undercoat.</b> Feathering of the fur {{appears on the}} chest, belly, ears and {{on the back of}} the legs. The coat is not as heavy as that of a Cocker Spaniel but will require grooming in order to prevent mats from appearing in the fur. Docked tails were often used in working dogs, as poor blood flow left healing of the non docked tail difficult.|$|E
5|$|Before {{applying}} the top coats of paint, the LMS would apply a matt <b>undercoat</b> of shop grey {{in which it}} was customary to photograph the locomotive for the first time. The ensuing LMS top coats for the Coronation Class came in two basic colours during this period: Caledonian blue and crimson lake. Linings for streamliners involved the renowned 'speed whiskers' comprising stripes emerging from a fixed point in the lower centre of the front of the locomotive to run in parallel along the sides. Non-streamliners carried the standard LMS-style lining.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant <b>undercoat</b> with a silky outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E

50|$|Underseal (often called <b>undercoating</b> in the U.S.) is a thick {{resilient}} coating {{applied to}} the underbody or chassis of an automobile to protect against impact damage from small stones, which would rapidly chip ordinary paint, allowing rusting to begin.|$|R
2500|$|Airedales bearing <b>undercoats</b> are {{generally}} groomed by hand stripping {{where a small}} serrated edged knife is used to pull out loose hair from the dog's coat. [...] Most Airedales require frequent (6 to 8 weeks) clipping or stripping as they do not shed.|$|R
5|$|The Maine Coon {{is a long}} {{or medium}} haired cat. The coat is soft and silky, {{although}} texture may vary with coat color. The length is shorter {{on the head and}} shoulders, and longer on the stomach and flanks with some cats having a lion-like ruff around their neck. Minimal grooming is required for the breed, compared to other long-haired breeds, as their coat is mostly self-maintaining owing to a light-density <b>undercoat.</b> The coat is subject to seasonal variation, with the fur being thicker in the winter and thinner during the summer.|$|E
5|$|They have a white {{double coat}} which {{requires}} regular brushing {{with a wire}} comb {{in order to prevent}} matting. It has a dense <b>undercoat,</b> while the outer coat is wiry and weather resistant. Markings on the face can be in a variety of colours including lemon, black, brown, blue, and badger, which is a mix of brown and black. Heavy body markings or patches or excessive ticking on the coat are discouraged. Sealyhams are low to the ground, and in muddy weather their long coats can become quite dirty. Sealyham coats are groomed by hand stripping, {{in order to keep the}} coat from becoming too soft.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{many other}} dogs, Vizslas {{do not have}} an <b>undercoat.</b> Therefore, they are unsuited for living outdoors.|$|E
50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} often {{preferred}} for kitchen sinks {{because of its}} ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning. In better models, acoustic noise is controlled by applying resilient <b>undercoating</b> to dampen vibrations.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of five primers [Super-Bond C&B Monomer (SB), Clearfil Ceramic Primer, Alloy Primer, M. L. Primer, and AZ Primer] and two <b>undercoating</b> opaque resins [Super-Bond C&B (S-opaque) and Ceramage Pre-opaque (C-opaque) ] on the bonding of a resin composite veneering material to a ceria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals/alumina nanocomposite (Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3). Disk-shaped specimens of Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 were sandblasted with alumina and primed. The <b>undercoating</b> opaque resins and resin composites were subsequently applied to the specimen, and then light cured. After 5000 thermocycles at 4 °C and 60 °C, shear bond strengths were determined. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, Tukey–Kramer honest significant difference test, and Student t test (n =  10, α =  0. 05). With the exception of SB/S-opaque, all S-opaque groups exhibited significantly higher bond strengths than C-opaque groups. The use of S-opaque resin is recommended when veneering frameworks made of Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3...|$|R
