After Cottonwood Pass to the south, it is the second-highest pass with an improved road in the state, the fourth-highest paved road {{in the state and}} the highest paved crossing of the Continental Divide in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> the heavy snowfall at its elevation, it is closed in wintertime, isolating Aspen from direct access from the east during the ski season.|$|E
5|$|The Proposal is a 2009 American {{romantic comedy}} film {{directed}} by Anne Fletcher and written by Peter Chiarelli.

5|$|Terns have {{sometimes}} benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could {{lead them to}} fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution {{has been a problem}} in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the <b>US.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.|$|E

25|$|The magical tale of Ambrosius Aurelianus {{and the two}} dragons found beneath Dinas Emrys. This {{origin of}} the later legend of Merlin is clearly a local tale that had {{attracted}} the names of Vortigern and Ambrosius to usurp the roles of earlier characters. Neither of them has any association with that remote part of Wales, but the character Vortigern is best known to <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> this tale.|$|E
25|$|The seed for {{the first}} Woman's Rights Convention in the United States in Seneca Falls, New York was planted in 1840, when Elizabeth Cady Stanton met Lucretia Mott at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London. The conference refused to seat Mott and other women delegates from the <b>U.S.</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their sex. In 1851, Stanton met temperance worker Susan B. Anthony, and shortly the two would be joined in the long {{struggle}} to secure the vote {{for women in the}} U.S. In 1868 Anthony encouraged working women from the printing and sewing trades in New York, who were excluded from men's trade unions, to form Workingwomen's Associations. As a delegate to the National Labor Congress in 1868, Anthony persuaded the committee on female labor to call for votes for women and equal pay for equal work. The men at the conference deleted the reference to the vote. In the U.S. women in the Wyoming Territory could vote as of 1869. Subsequent American suffrage groups often disagreed on tactics, with the National American Woman Suffrage Association arguing for a state-by-state campaign and the National Woman's Party focusing on an amendment to the U.S. Constitution.|$|E
25|$|The Maria Sharapova Foundation is {{committed}} to helping children around the world achieve their dreams. Sharapova has donated $100,000 to Chernobyl-related projects. In partnership with the UNDP, she launched a $210,000 scholarship program for students from Chernobyl-affected areas of Belarus that will award five-year scholarships to 12 students at the Belarusian State Academy of Arts and the Belarusian State University. At the 2004 US Open, Sharapova, along with several other Russian female tennis players, wore a black ribbon in observance of the tragedy after the Beslan school hostage crisis, which took place only days before. In 2005, she donated around US$50,000 to those affected by the crisis. On February 14, 2007, Sharapova was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and donated US$210,000 to UNDP Chernobyl-recovery projects. She stated {{at the time that}} she was planning to travel back to the area after Wimbledon in 2008, though it didn't happen since she had to travel back to the <b>US</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> her shoulder injury. She fulfilled the trip in late June/early July 2010. Sharapova has helped to promote the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and was the first torch bearer in the torch-lighting ceremony during the opening festivities. In addition, with Angela Haynes, Maria Kirilenko, Nicole Vaidišová, Rennae Stubbs, Governor Jeb Bush, and Jennifer Capriati, Sharapova participated in an exhibition in Tampa in December 2004, raising money for the Florida Hurricane Relief Fund. In July 2008, Sharapova sent a message on DVD to the memorial service of cancer victim Emily Bailes, who had performed the coin toss ahead of the 2004 Wimbledon final that Sharapova had gone on to win.|$|E

German films depicted homosexuality and were distributed throughout Europe, but 1931's Mädchen in Uniform was not distributed in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the depiction of an adolescent's love for a female teacher in boarding school.|$|E
500|$|Time news {{magazine}} reported that statistically the [...] "nonskeds" [...] in general were [...] "more than 30 times as dangerous" [...] {{in the number}} of fatalities per passenger mile as the scheduled airlines in 1961. According to Time, the U.S. military had been effectively forced to rely on nonskeds such as Imperial Airlines to carry troops within the <b>U.S.</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the combination of two laws. First, the Congress had mandated the use of civilian air carriers (for economic reasons); and second, the Pentagon was obligated to bid for such services and select the lowest bidder, which often turned out to be financially unsound companies with a poor safety record.|$|E
500|$|To {{revive the}} fervor of punk, which the band felt was being {{distorted}} by new wave, the Idles sought {{to look as}} intimidating as possible. They shaved their heads, grew mohawks and wore various punk accessories. Nelson and MacKaye even drove thumbtacks into the soles of their boots so they would make an [...] "ominous clacking" [...] sound when they walked. The band's visual presentation was at odds with their demeanor; according to MacKaye, [...] "In our shows and within our own community, we were totally goofy guys. We were painfully honest — we didn't shoplift, we didn't vandalize, we didn't spray-paint. [...] We don't do anything — everybody just hates <b>us</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the way we look".|$|E

500|$|As {{leader of}} the Klan, Evans {{advanced}} a form of nativist, white supremacy that cast Protestantism as a fundamental part of American patriotism.

He maintained that white Protestants had the exclusive right to govern the <b>U.S.</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their descent from early colonists, whom he described as fleeing Europe for the U.S. to escape its societal bounds. He admitted that many Klan members were of rural, uneducated backgrounds but argued that power {{should be given to}} [...] "the common people of America".

500|$|Most of the {{population}} of the region in earlier decades followed traditional tribal religious practices. However, Roman Catholicism had been known in the area long before its acquisition by the <b>U.S.</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the many French traders who lived and intermarried there. Catholic missionary activity among the Métis expanded greatly in the early 19th century with the Catholic Church becoming particularly established in Saint Paul. Protestantism was rather a much newer phenomenon though some Protestant missionaries had entered the region in the early 19th century as well. The first Protestant church appeared in 1848 (Market Street Church, [...] Saint Paul). The waves of immigration in the 1850s, however, would rapidly make Protestants the largest religious group. Indeed, as in the much of the rest of the U.S. community leaders made a deliberate effort to recruit immigrants from Protestant areas of Northern Europe in order to ensure Protestant control of the region.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{a fourth}} season of Plaza Sésamo was produced.

[...] The producers created outreach materials for Hispanic families, {{for the purpose of}} promoting media literacy and helping parents improve their roles as their children's first teachers. [...] The fourth season aired in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> the large population of Spanish-speakers in the country; {{it was the first time}} an original co-production was shown in the U.S. [...] As Gary Knell, an executive at the CTW stated, [...] "Our mission is to educate all kids.

[...] Disch afterwards recalled that some of the experimental language in the book was written in the knowledge that New Worlds was available as a market for unconventional fiction. [...] Other new writers who appeared in the magazine include M. John Harrison and Robert Holdstock, both of whom appeared in the November 1968 issue. [...] The December 1968 issue included Samuel R.
