5|$|Following the {{entrance}} of the People's Republic of China into the war in late November 1950, Brown and his squadron were dispatched to the Chosin Reservoir, where an intense campaign was being fought between the People's Volunteer Army and the US X Corps. Approximately 100,000 Chinese troops had surrounded 15,000 <b>U.S.</b> <b>troops,</b> and Brown and other pilots on Leyte flew dozens of close air support missions every day to prevent the Chinese from overrunning the <b>U.S.</b> <b>troops.</b>|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next week, the <b>US</b> <b>troops</b> were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of flares to signal various actions and {{coordinate}} them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans that green flares were used to signal an attack on a given area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green flares and then, after the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions. This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to the points of greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire. The <b>US</b> <b>troops</b> also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to remove them. When this happened, <b>US</b> <b>troops</b> fired flares to illuminate the scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.|$|E
