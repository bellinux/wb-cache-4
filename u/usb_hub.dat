5|$|Standard <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> ports {{can provide}} from the typical 500mA/2.5W of current, only 100mA from non-hub ports. USB3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8A/9.0W (for {{dedicated}} battery charging, 1.5A/7.5W full bandwidth or 900mA/4.5W high bandwidth), while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60watts of power, although 10 to 20watts is more typical.|$|E
5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
5|$|High-speed USB2.0 hubs contain devices called {{transaction}} translators that convert between high-speed USB2.0 {{buses and}} full and low speed buses. When a high-speed USB2.0 hub is plugged into a high-speed USB host or hub, it operates in high-speed mode. The <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> then uses either one transaction translator per hub {{to create a}} full/low-speed bus routed to all full and low speed devices on the hub, or uses one transaction translator per port to create an isolated full/low-speed bus per port on the hub.|$|E
50|$|A USB {{network is}} built from <b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> {{connected}} downstream to USB ports, which themselves {{may stem from}} <b>USB</b> <b>hubs.</b> <b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> can extend a USB network {{to a maximum of}} 127 ports. The USB specification requires that bus-powered/passive hubs may not be connected in series to other bus-powered hubs.|$|R
50|$|<b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> {{are often}} built into {{equipment}} such as computers, keyboards, monitors, or printers. When such a device has many USB ports, they all usually stem from one or two internal <b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> rather than each port having independent USB circuitry.|$|R
50|$|Windows 7 can {{individually}} suspend <b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> {{and supports}} selective suspend for all in-box USB class drivers.|$|R
5|$|To {{eliminate}} this danger, if a <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> detects {{a mix of}} {{high speed}} or full speed and low speed devices, it will by default disable communication to low speed device unless requested to switch to low speed mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it will temporarily re-enable the output port to all low speed devices, to allow the host to send a single low speed packet to low speed devices. After the low speed packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal will tell the hub to disable all outputs to low speed devices again.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Lexar {{introduced}} a Compact Flash (CF) {{card with a}} USB connection, and a companion card read/writer and USB cable that eliminated {{the need for a}} <b>USB</b> <b>hub.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{block diagram}} depicts ModelsA, B, A+, and B+. ModelA, A+, and the PiZero lack the Ethernet and <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> components. The Ethernet adapter is {{internally}} connected to an additional USB port. In ModelA, A+, and the PiZero, the USB port is connected {{directly to the}} {{system on a chip}} (SoC). On the Pi1 ModelB+ and later models the USB/Ethernet chip contains a five-point <b>USB</b> <b>hub,</b> of which four ports are available, while the Pi1 ModelB only provides two. On the PiZero, the USB port is also connected directly to the SoC, but it uses a micro USB (OTG) port.|$|E

25|$|The AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule will {{recognize}} multiple disks connected via a <b>USB</b> <b>hub.</b> Hard drives over 3TB are not recognized. Apple's specifications pages do not mention this limitation. As of March 2013, no firmware upgrade {{is available to}} remedy this issue.|$|E
25|$|Often, several decorations are {{connected}} to a single <b>USB</b> <b>hub,</b> which is limited to 400mA if it has no external power connection and is drawing all its power from a host computer. With each device drawing 100mA, it is therefore only possible to run four low-power decorations.|$|E
25|$|The Xbox 360 {{features}} three USB 2.0 ports (two on the front, {{one on the}} back). The new Xbox 360S, however, {{has five}} USB 2.0 ports (two on the front, three in the back) along with a dedicated Kinect port. These are used for connection of accessories such as wired controllers, the wireless networking adapter, the Xbox Live Vision camera and USB storage devices. Although the number of wired controllers {{is limited by the}} number of ports, up to four may be used {{through the use of a}} <b>USB</b> <b>hub.</b>|$|E

25|$|Any USB-compatible {{microphone}} can be {{used for}} the vocal parts. A <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> {{can be used}} for up to three microphone players. Rock Band 3 does not require the vocalists to be signed in on the console's systems; this allows Rock Band 3 to surpass the usual limitation of four local players that exists on the Wii and Xbox 360. Vocal harmonies cannot be performed by separate players over networked connections due to latency issues. Pitch correction technology developed by iZotope has been integrated into the game, allowing vocalists to add effects to their vocal performances within the game.|$|E
25|$|The HD DVD player {{connects to}} the Xbox 360 using a mini USB connection. All of the audio and video {{processing}} and output come from Xbox 360 itself. The unit can also function as a <b>USB</b> <b>hub,</b> with 2 ports on the rear. It also includes a clip for attaching the wireless network adapter to it, much like what Xbox 360 consoles of the time had. The device also has an integrated 256MB memory unit which is used for storage of HD DVD data and is accessible to the user for saving other data such as saved games.|$|E
25|$|Similar to a {{breakout}} device, some docking stations produce multiple connections from one port, only instead of extracting them from internal chipsets, they create them inside the dock using converters. They are functionally identical to a hub with various converters plugged in. Typically USB- or Thunderbolt-based, they incorporate {{a range of}} converters such as USB display adapters or a full external GPU, audio chipsets, NICs, storage enclosures, modems and memory card readers even PCI Express card slots connected through an internal <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> or PCI Express bridge to give the host computer access to extra connections it did not previously possess. Simpler “docking stations” consist of {{nothing more than a}} hub inside a stand.|$|E
50|$|Windows 98 {{had more}} robust USB support (e.g. support for USB {{composite}} devices) than Windows 95 which only had support in OEM versions (OSR2.1 or later). Windows 98 supports <b>USB</b> <b>hubs,</b> <b>USB</b> scanners and imaging class devices. Windows 98 also introduces built-in support for some USB Human Interface Device class (USB HID) and PID class {{devices such as}} USB mice, keyboards, force feedback joysticks etc. including additional keyboard functions through {{a certain number of}} Consumer Page HID controls.|$|R
50|$|W-USB {{devices are}} {{categorized}} {{in the same}} way as traditional USB. Because of the existence of wire adapters, traditional <b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> are not needed. A device supports one or more communication pipes to the host, and allocates endpoint 0 for the USB control pipe. Device type information is available through this pipe.|$|R

2500|$|If {{instead a}} <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> has an {{external}} power adapter, {{it may be}} able to support much higher power loads. [...] In many cases, the powered hub may not even need to be connected to a computer host, but can serve as a stand-alone power source for USB decorations that need only DC power.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company has}} {{announced}} plans to restart production in 2015, introducing a [...] "new generation Pony". The new Pony [...] will be powered either by a PCM (Peugeot-Citroen Moteurs) or FIAT (1360 cc) engine, while retains the lines of the old Pony, and because is a new era car the interior will feature a <b>USB</b> <b>hub.</b> According to the company, a number of countries in Asia, Africa and South America have expressed interest in license production of the new model. It will cost about 7.000€.|$|E
2500|$|The new AirPort Disk feature {{allows users}} to plug a USB hard drive into the AirPort Extreme {{for use as a}} network-attached storage (NAS) device for Mac OS X and Microsoft Windows clients. Users may also connect a <b>USB</b> <b>hub</b> and printer. [...] The {{performance}} of USB hard drives attached to an AirPort Extreme is slower than if the drive were connected directly to a computer. [...] This is due to the processor speed on the AirPort extreme. [...] Depending on the setup and types of reads and writes, performance ranges from 0.5 to 17.5 MB/s for writing and 1.9 to 25.6 MB/s for reading. [...] Performance for the same disk connected directly to a computer would be 6.6 to 31.6 MB/s for writing and 7.1 to 37.2 MB/s for reading.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{class of}} USB extenders are {{actually}} <b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> with {{a length of}} cable permanently attached. These do comply with the USB standard, if not more than {{a limited number of}} them are connected together. However, they require power from the USB connection and so may reduce the power available for the device at the [...] "B" [...] end.|$|R

50|$|USB cables {{are limited}} to 3 m for {{low-speed}} USB 1.1 devices. A hub {{can be used as}} an active USB repeater to extend cable length for up to 5 m lengths at a time. Active cables (specialized connector-embedded one-port hubs) perform the same function, but since they are strictly bus-powered, externally powered (non-bus-powered) <b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> would likely be required for some of the segments.|$|R

5000|$|The floor {{can display}} {{different}} patterns and flash under computer control. A row or square matrix of panels share a control module. [...] The control modules are typically {{connected to the}} computer via <b>USB</b> cables. <b>USB</b> <b>hubs</b> handle fan-out {{to a number of}} control modules and extend the distance that can be reached. In future, cabling and control will be simplified by connecting the control modules to each other.|$|R
5000|$|Any <b>USB</b> 2.0 <b>hub</b> that {{supports}} {{a higher standard}} than USB 1.1 (12 Mbit/s) will translate between the lower standard and the higher standard using {{what is called a}} transaction translator (TT). For example, if a USB 1.1 device is connected to a port on a <b>USB</b> 2.0 <b>hub,</b> then the TT would automatically recognize and translate the USB 1.1 signals to USB 2.0 on the uplink. However, the default design is that all lower-standard devices share the same transaction translator and thus create a bottleneck, a configuration known as the single transaction translator.Consequently, multi transaction translators (Multi-TT) were created, which provide more transaction translators such that bottlenecks are avoided. [...] Note that <b>USB</b> 3.0 <b>hubs</b> do not currently perform transaction translation to super-speed for USB 2.0 devices.|$|R
