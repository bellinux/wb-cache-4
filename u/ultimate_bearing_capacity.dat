50|$|In {{geotechnical}} engineering, {{bearing capacity}} is {{the capacity of}} soil to support the loads applied to the ground. The bearing capacity of soil is the maximum average contact pressure between the foundation and the soil which should not produce shear failure in the soil. <b>Ultimate</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> is the theoretical maximum pressure which can be supported without failure; allowable bearing capacity is the <b>ultimate</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> divided {{by a factor of}} safety. Sometimes, on soft soil sites, large settlements may occur under loaded foundations without actual shear failure occurring; in such cases, the allowable bearing capacity is based on the maximum allowable settlement.|$|E

50|$|The Interference of the {{footings}} is {{a phenomenon}} that is observed when two footings are closely spaced. The buildings when are to be constructed nearby to each other, the architectural requirements or the less availability of space for the construction forces the engineers to place the foundation footings {{close to each other}}, and when foundations are placed close to each other with similar soil conditions, the <b>Ultimate</b> <b>Bearing</b> <b>Capacity</b> of each foundation may change due to the interference effect of the failure surface in the soil.|$|E
50|$|It is {{observed}} {{by the researchers}} that the characteristic behaviours of an isolated footing are affected if there exist other footing or group of footings {{close to each other}} and their individual zone of influence interfere with each other leading to interference phenomenon. The <b>ultimate</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> increases with decrease in the clear spacing between the footings and attains a peak magnitude at some critical spacing and thereafter with further decrease in clear spacing, the <b>ultimate</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> decreases and at spacing equal to zero the two footings act as an isolated footing of twice the width when width of two interfering footings are similar and loaded symmetrically. Moreover, the settlement at failure of interfering footing {{is observed}} to be greater than that of isolated footing at failure and the same decreases with increase in clear spacing between the footings. The variation of <b>ultimate</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> and settlement at failure of interfering footings were observed with respect to clearing spacing ratio by introducing efficiency factors which are defined as the ratio of magnitude of ultimate bearing capacity/settlement of interfering footings to that of the magnitude of ultimate bearing capacity/settlement of an isolated footing.The bearing capacity and the settlement of footings are the basic criterion which influence {{in the design of the}} footings and these are affected by the presence of one or more of the footings close to each other; however the interference phenomenon is not considered in the design of shallow footing. In the present scenario the structures may be forced to come close to each other or due to rapid urbanization, the buildings may be constructed in an irregular manner or due to lack of construction space or architecture of the building; the foundations or group of foundation may be laid close to each other which may lead to interference phenomenon and thereby influence the characteristic behaviour of an isolated footing which governs the design criterion and therefore make the motivation in the present study of interference of footings.So far the interference of footings is concerned all most all the study dealt with the interference phenomenon on <b>ultimate</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> and the settlement of interfering footings at failure for two or more closely spaced surface footings resting on either unreinforced or reinforced foundation soil beds. In the literature the foundation soil was considered to be cohesion-less, homogeneous, layered (each layer being homogeneous), Young’s modulus linearly varying with depth etc. and the interfering footings were strip, square, rectangular, circular in shapes resting on the surface of foundation soil medium. Most of the literature dealt with interfering footings of symmetrical geometry and loading conditions except Nainegali et al. Though the interference phenomenon has been observed and studied since Stuart, the effect of interference on the group of footings is not being considered in the design.|$|E

He examined the effect of footing interference on <b>ultimate</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> of strip footings by theoretical analysis using limit equilibrium method, assuming a non-linear failure surface wherein the cross section composed of logarithmic spiral and straight line portion tangent to the curvilinear portion.

The study of Stuart (1962) was further extended by West and Stuart (1965) by performing a series of small-scale laboratory tests to examine the effect of interference on bearing capacity of strip footings resting on the surface of cohesion-less soil bed. Moreover, West and Stuart (1965) carried out few theoretical analyses using method of stress characteristics to observe the eccentricity of load and reactions at the base of footing resulting from interference effect for footings resting on the surface of sand. The results obtained from this theory were smaller than those observed by Stuart (1962) using limit equilibrium method; however the trend was similar to the variation as observed by Stuart (1962) and the results obtained by experiments reasonably matched with those of the theoretical analysis. The researchers carried out the study by theoretical or numerical techniques for interfering footings by making use of the following methods : Method of stress characteristics, Analytical method, Probabilistic approach, Upper bound limits analysis, Lower bound limits analysis, Finite element method, Finite difference method.|$|E

40|$|The use {{of shells}} in {{foundation}} structures over traditional forms has grown steadily since their inception {{in the early}} nineteen–fifties. Shell foundations outperform conventional flat footings and are reputable performers especially when heavy superstructural loads are to be transmitted to weak bearing soil. The geotechnical performance of shells in an elastic continuum concerns their <b>bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> and settlement behaviour, whose study has been trailing behind that of their structural performance. Bringing contact pressures closer to uniformity at the soil–shell structure interface is essential in developing a viable behavioural response under vertically concentric and monotonic loading conditions. This study encapsulates {{the development of new}} shell foundation geometries employing shell inversion under such loading conditions. Experimental investigation involves validation of the numerical phase in a comparative study following a two–dimensional analysis of shell models using commercially available geotechnical software with finite element analysis. New inverted triangular footings embedded in sand composed of ultra–high performance iShell Mix concrete using fiber–reinforced polymeric (FRP) microfibers are analyzed. A parametric analysis examines key sensitivity elements including shell angle and shell thickness in granular soil for both upright shells and their inverted counterpart. Linearly–elastic behaviour of concrete material is assumed while soil media is modeled under nonlinear elastic perfectly–plastic conditions following the Mohr–Coulomb yield criterion for loose, medium and dense sand states. Theoretical modeling was developed to generate inverted shell <b>bearing</b> <b>capacity</b> factors to predict <b>ultimate</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>capacities</b> of the shell footings.
