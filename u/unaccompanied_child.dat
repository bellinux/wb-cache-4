40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a qualitative research of asylum seeking of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> in Sweden. Children {{who find themselves}} traveling borders without company of a family member {{are in a very}} vulnerable position. In this thesis, the experience of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> undergoing an asylum process in the Swedish jurisdiction is presented and the consequences of this process are also presented. With the creation of territorial boundaries embodied with an institution of state sovereignty, <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> finds themselves in a position of statelessness which produces a situation of rightlessness as they find themselves outside their own territories. This research suggests that, the territorial system provides great examples of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> in a situation of statelessness even when they find themselves inside a new community. Even in this new state they do not automatically gain access to the community, instead through migration system, they must undergo investigations and procedures to prove that they have the rights to belong to that current community, a procedure that contributes to stress and other negative factors to the health of these children. From the findings of the interviews with <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> undergoing the process of seeking asylum and also <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> in hiding, it is seen that the asylum seeking process in the condition of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> is characterized by the paradoxical system of national states, territorialism, totalitarianism, state sovereignty and an effort of maintaining human rights. The suggestion is that, the paradigm of territorialism and state sovereignty deprives <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> from what one in the Arendtian sense would call the right to have rights. As their journey to a new community starts off as a position of statelessness and with a 50 % chance of returning back to that position. Their position slowly emerges from <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children,</b> to a stateless adultescence and lastly to a forgotten undocumented adult...|$|R

The article delineates several intersecting institutional logics—the universalization of childhood, the pathologization of mobility, and the criminalization of transnational parents—that underpin federal policies and practices for the care and custody of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children.</b> The article argues that these policies overflow from the spaces of detention and shape young people’s help-seeking behaviors and sentiments of belonging following release from detention...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Following disasters, {{separated}} and <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> {{are among the}} most vulnerable, therefore international organisations have formed guidelines regarding the management of these children. Guidelines include recommendations for identifying and registering children, tracing family members, reunification and arrangements for interim and durable care. There is a lack of experiential evidence on how these principles are put into practice at operational levels, and whether existing policies were useful. There is a particular lack of empirical evidence from the disaster prone country of Iran. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the role of Non- Governmental Organisations (NGOs) in the management of {{separated and}} <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children,</b> following disasters in Iran in order to plan for and provision of future disasters. Findings The Iranian Red Crescent Organisation, Committee Emdad Imam Khomeini (a national organisation unique to Iran that is protected by the government and supported by public contributions) and Behzisti (the government welfare organisation in Iran) are the main figures involved in the management of separated and <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children,</b> following disasters in Iran. NGOs are rarely responsible for caring for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children,</b> however they provide valuable support including financial assistance, arrangement of educational and extra-curricular activities and psychosocial support. Following the initial chaos after the Bam earthquake, international guidelines on separated and <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> were largely followed. Conclusions Systems for managing separated and <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> following disasters in Iran, involving NGOs, are emerging. However, most are yet to be formalised. </p...|$|R

40|$|Many {{children}} and adolescents up to the age eighteen come from other countries alone to Sweden to seek asylum. Sweden receives many <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> {{and the number of}} <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> is increasing every year. There are various reasons to why the <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> flee their homeland to come to Sweden. Many of the <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> come from countries such as Somalia, Afghanistan and Eritrea. The unaccompanied children’s families choose {{to send their children to}} Sweden to protect them from armed conflict and other social or political unrest going on in their homeland.   This essay aims to explore how the integration of the newly arrived <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> works in schools. The following questions in my survey I have assumed to achieve the purpose of this essay are, how does Annerstaskolan work to integrate the newly arrived unaccompanied students in school, how the staff at the accommodation, Vårljus, where the <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> live help these students integrate into school and how Huddinge municipality supports Annerstaskolan and other schools in Huddinge in their work to integrate the <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children.</b> To achieve this purpose I have done qualitative research interviews and two days of structured non-participant observations in the preparatory class. The qualitative research interviews were conducted with the teacher in the preparatory class, Dan Fränkel, who is an officer in Huddinge municipality and Damir Tomic, who works at Vårljus accommodation.   Annerstaskolan is using the path that Peder Haug is describing as segregating integration (Haug, 1998). The option Annerstaskolan is using is that the child is being removed from the regular class and placed in a smaller group. The student is being removed from the regular class and placed into a preparatory class...|$|R
40|$|Author: Hanna Wennerhov Title: The {{construction}} of “unaccompanied children” in regional media – a discourse analysis of representation, {{in the light}} of the “refugee crisis” 2015 [Translated title] Supervisor: Barzoo Eliassi Assessor: Ulf Drugge The purpose of this study was to problematize how <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> were depicted in news articles in regional media, {{in the light of}} the so called “refugee crisis” of 2015. 18 news articles concerning <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> have been analysed from a social constructive perspective, using discourse theory, the concept of representation and Michel Foucault’s perspective on power. Through this analysis, I have been able to identify two main discourses, where <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> were represented mostly by individuals in power position. The category was thus represented in two diverse ways, on the one hand as exposed and in need of help and protection, on the other hand as encumbering to the society. They were at the same time depicted as a homogenous group, passive in relation to the surrounding society. I have further been able to illustrate how <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> were being excluded from the discourses, through their limited participation and opportunity to represent themselves through the articles. When given this opportunity in one of the articles, four young people categorised as “unaccompanied children” represented the category as active, responsible individuals, thus presenting an alternative portrayal of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children.</b> With this study, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of what kind of portrayals of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>children</b> that may have become a premise from which people think of and treat these young people. I also aimed to raise awareness of how the power of medias portrayal of diverse groups of people can affect the conception of individuals that are categorised into these groups, as well as those individuals’ conception of themselves.   Keywords: <b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>children,</b> construction, representation, media, discourse analysis Nyckelord: Ensamkommande barn, konstruktion, representation, media, diskursanaly...|$|R

50|$|According to UNHCR data, 58% of the {{refugees}} and migrants arriving in Europe by sea in 2015 were men, 17% were women and 25% were children.

In war-torn countries, men are also at greater risk of being forced to fight or of being killed.
