Depending on habitat and the amount {{ingested}} per body weight, effects can range from nausea and twitching to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes is {{heightened}} by alternating between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and <b>unpredictability</b> <b>of</b> the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E

40|$|The {{gravitational}} N-body problem, for N> 2, is {{the oldest}} unsolved problem in mathematical physics. Some of the most ideal examples {{that can be found}} in nature are globular star clusters, with N ∼ 10 ^ 6. In this overview, I discuss six types of fundamental sources <b>of</b> <b>unpredictability,</b> each <b>of</b> which poses a different challenge to attempts to determine the long-term behavior of these systems, governed by a peculiar type of thermodynamics.

5|$|Due to the <b>unpredictability</b> <b>of</b> the storm, a {{hurricane}} warning was issued from Freeport, Texas to Intracoastal City, Louisiana at 1600UTC, only eight hours prior to landfall. Simultaneously, two separate tropical storm warnings were posted, from Matagorda to Freeport and Intracoastal City to Morgan City. Although {{the storm had}} already made landfall, a tropical storm warning was issued from Freeport to Intracoastal City at 0400UTC on October16. By six hours later, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unpredictability</b> <b>of</b> {{the show}} and Banksy's elusive nature stirred {{excitement}} amongst fans, while defacement from competing street artists and vandals became an imminent problem. While Banksy's works were inherently illegal, no official complaints were reported to the police; most property owners praised the art and some took measures to protect it. The month-long residency drew controversy amongst some locals for its more politically strong pieces, and received mixed reviews from critics. A documentary film covering this period titled Banksy Does New York was released in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Coleman Reese, an {{accountant}} at Wayne Enterprises, deduces that Bruce is Batman {{and tries to}} go public with the information. After observing the <b>unpredictability</b> <b>of</b> the Joker, Maroni informs Commissioner Gordon of the Joker's location. The Joker sets fire to the mob's money, burning Lau alive in the process, and kills the Chechen. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless someone kills Reese. Gordon orders the evacuation of all the hospitals in Gotham and goes to secure Reese. The Joker finds Dent in Gotham General and manipulates him into seeking revenge for Rachel's death on Gotham's corrupt systems. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree based on a coin flip and targets people he holds responsible for Rachel's death, killing Wuertz and Maroni while sparing Ramirez.|$|E

40|$|In Epic Reinvented, Mary Ellis Gibson {{examines}} Ezra Pound's Cantos {{to trace}} connections between his aesthetics and his politics. She treats little-known and unpublished writings, including many early poems. One substantial poem, "In Praise of the Masters," appears here in print {{for the first}} time. Discussing Pound's relationship to his Victorian predecessors, particularly Robert Browning and nineteenth-century historians, Gibson demonstrates how Pound's attempt to write a post-Romantic epic both confronted questions of genre and social order {{and led to the}} <b>unpredictabilities</b> <b>of</b> his politics. She develops a rhetorical tropology to account for the formal and cultural dimensions of Pound's contradictions. Exploring fin-de-siecle publishing, Gibson investigates how Pound's utopian political vision was rooted in nineteenth-century and fascist ideologies of gender. Violence is implicit in both. For Gibson, the aesthetic Pound and the political Pound, Pound the visionary and Pound the historian, are one...|$|R
5|$|Ferrell {{was once}} again traded; this time he {{returned}} to the Senators in March1944. He earned {{a reputation as one of}} the best knuckleball catchers in baseball when he had the arduous task of catching for a Senators' starting pitching staff made up entirely of knuckleball pitchers. Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to the <b>unpredictability</b> <b>of</b> the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell's former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944American League pennant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, naturalists {{were faced with}} {{increasing}} pressure to add rigor and preferably experimentation to their methods, as the newly prominent laboratory-based biological disciplines had done. Ecology had emerged as a combination of biogeography with the biogeochemical cycle concept pioneered by chemists; field biologists developed quantitative methods such as the quadrat and adapted laboratory instruments and cameras for the field to further set their work apart from traditional natural history. Zoologists and botanists did what they could to mitigate the <b>unpredictability</b> <b>of</b> the living world, performing laboratory experiments and studying semi-controlled natural environments such as gardens; new institutions like the Carnegie Station for Experimental Evolution and the Marine Biological Laboratory provided more controlled environments for studying organisms through their entire life cycles.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{an execution}} time model for predicting {{the performance of}} computation intensive scientific Java applications. Performance modeling can help in balancing the application workload of different problem sizes in a Grid environment. We propose a profiling based modeling method and introduce the concepts of point of predictability (PoP) and point <b>of</b> <b>unpredictability</b> (PoU) for performance prediction of Java programs. The point of predictability accounts for the volatile nature {{of the effects of}} JIT compilation on the execution time for small problems, while the point <b>of</b> <b>unpredictability</b> accounts for the effects of memory limitations and garbage collection on large problems. We present strategies to determine the point of predictability and point <b>of</b> <b>unpredictability.</b> Experimental results show that this model can accurately predict execution time for problem sizes between these two points which enables us to perform practical load balancing for scientific Java applications intended for execution on a Grid...|$|R
30|$|In {{relation}} to opening space for absent upper lateral incisors, {{the option of}} a resin-retained cantilever bridge design shows good long-term survival rates, but there remains a potential for rotational relapse of the canine and subsequent poor aesthetics. With respect to a single implant-stabilised prosthetic replacement, {{there appears to be}} longitudinal data to demonstrate high levels <b>of</b> <b>unpredictability,</b> in terms <b>of</b> the risks of progressive infraocclusion and marginal bone loss, compromising aesthetics [7, 8]. In view of the weak evidence regarding treatment of missing upper laterals, prospective clinical trials are much needed to give further light and guidelines to clinicians.|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>unpredictability</b> to explore its {{implications}} for forecasting strategies in a non-stationary world subject to structural breaks, where model and mechanism differ. Six aspects of the role <b>of</b> <b>unpredictability</b> are distinguished, compounding the four additional mistakes most likely in estimated forecasting models. Structural breaks, rather than limited information, are the key problem, exacerbated by conflicting requirements on ‘forecast-error corrections’. We consider model transformations and corrections to reduce forecast-error biases, as usual at some cost in increased forecast-error variances. The analysis is illustrated by an empirical application to M 1 in the UK...|$|R

5000|$|Jugni (Firefly) is {{the beat}} of the soul, the {{free-flying}} spirit. Jugni is Vibhavari or 'Vibs' (Sugandha Garg). Vibs is a music director, working on her first big break in the Hindi film industry. When work and home affairs, with her live-in boyfriend Sid (Samir Sharma) hit a high tide, Vibs hits the road with a glint of hope; to find music. The journey takes her to a village in Punjab in the search of a Bibi Saroop (Sadhana Singh), whose voice holds the promise that Vibs is searching for. But as the twist of fate would have it, Mastana (Siddhant Behl), Bibi's son and a proficient singer himself, is the voice and man who winds his way into Vibs' heart. From here on, Jugni is about striking balances, making tough decisions while trying to soften the blows and dealing with the studied dramatic turns and <b>unpredictabilities</b> <b>of</b> life and finding the place which one can call home; home of the heart, where the firefly is at her brightest.|$|R
