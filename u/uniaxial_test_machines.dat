40|$|The {{necessity}} to increase performances {{in terms of}} lifetime and security in mechanical components or structures is the motivation for intense research in fatigue. Applications range from aeronautics to medical devices. With {{the development of new}} materials, {{there is no longer a}} fatigue limit in the classical sense, where it was accepted that the fatigue limit is the stress level such that there is no fracture up to 1 E 7 cycles. The recent development of ultrasonic testing machines where frequencies can go as high as 20 kHz or over enabled tests to be extended to ranges larger than 1 E 9 in just a few days. This area of studies is now known as Very High Cycle Fatigue (VHCF). On the other hand, most of the existing test equipment in the market for both classical and VHCF are <b>uniaxial</b> <b>test</b> <b>machines.</b> However, critical components used in Engineering applications are usually subjected to complex multi-axial loading conditions. In this paper, it is presented the methodology to redesigning existing cruciform test specimens that can be used to create an in-plane biaxial state of stress when used in ‘uniaxial’ VHCF ultrasonic testing machines (in this case, the term ‘uniaxial’ is used not because of the state of stress created at the centre of the specimen, but because of the direction at which the load is applied). The methodology is explained in such a way that it can be expanded to other existing designs, namely cruciform designs, that are not yet used in VHCF. Also, although the approach is presented in simple and logical terms, it may not be that obvious for those who have a more focused approach on fatigue rather than on modal analysis. It is expected that by contributing to bridging the gap between the sciences of modal analysis and fatigue, this research will help and encourage others exploiting new capabilities in VHCF...|$|E

Specimens with preexisting cracks were loaded in a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> until the process zone appeared at {{the tips of the}} preexisting cracks. ESEM analysis reveals an increase in microcrack density in the process zone with increased loading of the specimen. Nanoindentation testing comprised of lines and grids of single nanoindentations located both near and far from the process zone shows a decrease in both indentation modulus and indentation hardness near grain boundaries in intact material, and with closeness to the process zone. Ultimately, the study confirms that the crack-tip process zone manifests itself as an area of reduced indentation hardness and indentation modulus in marble...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{structural}} properties of the original MPFL and to compare it to a MPFL-reconstruction-technique using a strip of quadriceps tendon. MethodsIn 13 human cadaver knees the MPFLs were dissected protecting their insertion at the patellar border. The MPFL was loaded to failure after preconditioning with 10 cycles in a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> evaluating stiffness, yield load and maximum load to failure. In the second part Quadriceps-MPFL-reconstruction was performed and <b>tested</b> in a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine.</b> Following preconditioning, the constructs were cyclically loaded 1000 times between 5 and 50 N measuring the maximum elongation. After cyclic testing, the constructs have been loaded to failure measuring stiffness, yield load and maximum load. For statistical analysis a repeated measures (RM) one-way ANOVA for multiple comparisons was used. The significance was set at P< 0. 05. ResultsDuring the load to failure tests of the original MPFL the following results were measured: stiffness 29. 4 N/mm (+ 9. 8), yield load 167. 8 N (+ 80) and maximum load to failure 190. 7 N (+ 82. 8). The results in the QT-technique group were as follows: maximum elongation after 1000 cycles 2. 1 mm (+ 0. 8), stiffness 33. 6 N/mm (+ 6. 8), yield load 147. 1 N (+ 65. 1) and maximum load to failure 205 N (+ 77. 8). There were no significant differences in all tested parameters. ConclusionsIn a human cadaveric model using a strip of quadriceps-tendon 10 mm wide and 3 mm deep, the biomechanical properties match those of the original MPFL when tested as a reconstruction. Clinical relevanceThe tested QT-technique shows sufficient primary stability with comparable biomechanical parameters to the intact MPFL...|$|R
40|$|In snowboarding, {{the wrist}} {{is the most}} common injury site, as snowboarders often put their arms out to cushion a fall. This can result in a {{compressive}} load through the carpals coupled with wrist hyperextension, leading to sprains or fractures. Wrist protectors are worn by snowboarders in an effort to reduce injury risk, by decreasing impact forces and limiting wrist hyperextension during falls. However, there is no international standard or universally-accepted performance specification that these products should conform to, resulting in an inability to judge which design elements offer the most protection. EN 14120 : 2003 prescribes requirements that roller sports wrist protectors should meet, and has been identified {{as a starting point for}} developing a snowboarding-specific standard. This paper critiques the EN 14120 : 2003 test protocol and goes on to present a mechanical test for assessing the ability of snowboard wrist protectors to resist extension of the hand under an applied load. A bespoke rig incorporating the hand/arm surrogate from EN 14120 : 2003 was mounted to a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine,</b> and wrist protectors were strapped to the surrogate at a set tightness (tight, moderate, loose). Linear displacement of the <b>uniaxial</b> <b>test</b> <b>machine</b> was transferred to angular displacement of the hand via a galvanised steel cable passing through a low friction pulley. Linear displacement was set to 200 mm/min and force was measured at the load cell until 80 N was reached. The test, presented here, found that the ability of the protectors to limit hand extension was dependent on how tightly they were fitted to the surrogate; therefore, strap tightness must be accounted for during further wrist protector safety assessments. This test provides a repeatable way to characterise the ability of snowboarding wrist protectors to limit wrist extension...|$|R

While they both aim at providing cost-effective {{solutions for the}} monitoring of local information on large-scale structures, the technologies are different in their applications and physical principles. One sensor is made of a cementitious material, which could make it suitable for embedding within the core of concrete structures prior to casting, and is a resistor, consisting of a carbon nanotube cement-based transducer.

A <b>uniaxial</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> repeatedly applied a compressive load, beginning at 25 N and incrementally continuing up to 450 N, to a pair of epoxy dental casts with articulating paper interposed. The resultant paper markings (n =  600) were photographed, and analyzed the mark area using a photographic image analysis and sketching program. A two-tailed Student’s t-test for unequal variances compared the measured size of the mark area between twelve different teeth (p <  0. 05). Graphical interpretation of the data indicated that the mark area increased non-linearly with increasing load. When the data was grouped to compare consistency of the mark area between teeth, a high variability of mark area was observed between different teeth at the same applied load. The Student’s t-test found significant differences in the size of the mark area approximately 80 % of the time. No direct relationship between paper mark area and applied load could be found, although the trend showed increasing mark area with elevating load.

Samples of Carrara marble with pre-existing cracks ("flaws") were loaded in a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> until the process zone appeared at the tips of the pre-existing cracks in form of "white patching". Three techniques were then used to obtain nanomechanical properties of the process zone and relate them to macroscale crack initiation: digital photography, to visually assess the macrostructure and crack formation, environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), to visually assess microstructure, and nanoindentation, to yield nanomechanical properties and assess nano/microheterogeneities. Nanoindentation testing was comprised of lines and grids of single nanoindentations located both near and far from the process zone. The purpose of nanoindentation testing is to investigate the underlying trend in nanomechanical property change between intact and process zone marble. Analysis of nanoindentation testing results showed a decrease of both modulus and hardness (a) near grain boundaries in intact material, and (b) with closeness to the process zone.

The studies in this thesis aimed to decrease these problems or conduct research that would aid future work and development in the area. The mechanical properties of normal and malignant bladder tissue were quantified using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). A <b>uniaxial</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> applied sinusoidally varying strains to specimens and the response stresses were measured; from this the elastic and viscous components of the soft tissues were calculated. Porcine bladder tissue {{was used as a}} model for normal bladder and exhibited a higher modulus than tumourous bladder tissue. Potentially these viscoelastic properties have many utilities, which include but are not limited to: diagnosis of bladder tumours, computational modelling of the bladder, comparison to current replacement materials, manufacture of more appropriate bladder replacement materials and manufacture of synthetic tumours for surgical trainers. One problem with the procedure for removing non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) is tumour re-implantation. An add-on instrument was designed, manufactured and tested to attempt to stop the travel of tumourous cells which could then re-implant. A prototype of the device was manufactured using the shape memory metal nickel titanium in conjunction with latex. The device would open into a cone shape once inside the bladder to physically prevent the movement of tumour cells away from the tumour site.

Under fatigue loading, the aramid fiber has excellent properties compared with metallic materials, showing gentle slopes in S-N curves, although large scatter bands exist.

The aim {{of this study is to}} improve methods of cemented cup fixation through validation experiments and FEA. Methods Five Sawbones composite pelves with cemented UHMWPE cups were tested. Each pelvis was instrumented with triaxial strain gauges at four locations of predicted high strain. Each sample (n = 5) was bolted at the sacroiliac joint in a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine.</b> A load of 500 N was applied in the direction of the peak force during normal walking, for five repetitions. The directional surface strains were used to evaluate the equivalent strain. Specimen specific finite element models were developed based on CT scan data using ScanIP. Each mesh consisted of an average of 2. 5 million linear tetrahedral elements and was solved in ANSYS. Results The experimentally measured strains were compared against the finite element predictions. The mean linear gradients and SD of the mean at each gauge location were: 1. 00 (16 %), 0. 78 (17 %), 0. 90 (13 %) and 1. 05 (4 %). Discussion The agreement between the predicted and experimental equivalent strains was good, but varied across the population. This was caused by the variation in mechanical properties between specimens, and the sensitivity of the gauges to location (steep surface strain gradients). This is most evident with the second strain gauge (0. 78, 17 %), which is at a suboptimal location. This specific methodology of conducting finite element analyses of the pelvis based on CT image data has been validated. The same methodology has been used to develop a patient specific FEA model, including a bone remodelling algorithm and muscle forces, based on the CT images from the Virtual Human Project. This model is currently being used to optimize the cemented fixation and will be verified experimentally using composite pelves. This research is aimed at informing clinical practice and enhancing long-term cemented fixation.

40|$|Metal foams are {{relatively}} novel materials {{that due to}} excellent mechanical, thermal, and insulation properties have found wide usage in different engineering applications such as energy absorbers, bone substitute implants, sandwich structure cores, etc. In common numerical studies, the mechanical properties of foams are usually introduced to FE models by considering homogenized uniform properties {{in different parts of}} a foamy structure. However, in highly irregular foams, due to complex micro-geometry, considering a uniform mechanical property for all portions of the foam leads to inaccurate results. Modeling the micro-architecture of foams enables better following of the mechanisms acting in micro-scale which would lead to more accurate numerical predictions. In this study, static mechanical behavior of several closed-cell foam samples has been simulated and validated against experimental results. The samples were first imaged using a multi-slice CT-Scan device. Subsequently, experimental compression tests were carried out on the samples using a <b>uniaxial</b> compression <b>testing</b> <b>machine.</b> The CT data were then used for creating micro-scale 3 D models of the samples. According to the darkness or brightness of the CT images, different densities were assigned to different parts of the micro-scale FE models of the foam samples.

40|$|Introduction The total hip {{replacement}} (THR) {{is the second}} most successful and cost-effective surgical procedure of all time. Over the last few decades patients have developed considerably higher expectations after joint replacement and are demanding earlier joint replacement surgery. The registry data from both Sweden and the UK show that cemented hip cups have a superior survival compared to cementless hip sockets. Much research has focused on the stem design and fixation, but the data shows that hip cup failure is the greater problem. The focus {{of this study is to}} improve methods of cemented cup fixation through validation experiments and finite element analysis (FEA). Methods Experimental testing was conducted on five Sawbones composite pelves (4 th generation, model 3405). A custom 3 D printed jig was used to drill four 8 mm bolt holes at the superior part of the sacroiliac joint, used later for clamping. The pelves were reamed to a diameter of 60 mm in a CNC machine. The cups were machined out of a bar of UHMWPE (TIVAR 1000) to inner and outer diameters of 28 mm and 54 mm respectively. Surgical Simplex P cement (Stryker) was vacuum mixed at room temperature, to fix the cup to the acetabulum. A custom jig ensured a mantle thickness of 3 mm and cup positioning of 45 ° abduction and 10 ° anteversion. [1] Each composite pelvis was instrumented with triaxial strain gauges (SGD- 2 / 350 -RY 63, Omega Engineering Limited) at four different locations of high predicted strain. The samples were bolted securely in the <b>uniaxial</b> <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> (Series 5965 with a 5 kN load cell; Instron) with the loading vector F in the direction of the peak force during normal walking. After preconditioning load was applied to the each construct through a 28 mm metal head up to 500 N in increments of 50 N, for a total of five repetitions. The directional surface strains were used to evaluate the equivalent strain. Specimen specific finite element models were developed based on CT scan data using ScanIP (2016. 09 Synopsis Inc.). The images were obtained using a micro CT scanner (XTH 225 ST, Nikon Metrology UK). The mesh (Figure 2) consisted of an average of 760 thousand linear tetrahedral elements and was solved in ANSYS APDL 15. 0. Results and Discussion The equivalent strain at each location was repeatable for each pelvis but varied within the group. This could be caused either by the variation in mechanical properties between the pelves, or the sensitivity of the gauges to positioning. The agreement between the predicted and experimental equivalent strains was good. Hence, validating this specific methodology of conducting finite element analyses of the pelvis based on CT image data. The next stage is to use the same methodology to develop a patient specific FEA model, including a bone remodeling algorithm and muscle forces, based on the CT images already obtained (VHP). This model will be used to optimize the cemented fixation and would be verified experimentally using composite pelves. This research is aimed at informing clinical practice and enhancing longterm cemented fixation.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} path {{stability}} in inelastic bifurcation problems have shown that, {{even if the}} specimen is stable, strain softening in <b>uniaxial</b> <b>tests</b> must localize right after the peak stress state into the smallest length permitted by the material, which is approximately equal to the characteristic length of nonlocal continuum. Without knowing this length, the uni~xial stress-strain relation cannot be identified from <b>uniaxial</b> <b>test</b> data.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} characterisation of {{the asphalt}} concrete {{in terms of}} both the fatigue resistance and the stiffness modulus is necessary to use any design method of the flexible road pavements. Different kinds of test are usually used in experimental work such as bending <b>tests,</b> <b>uniaxial</b> <b>tests,</b> etc., but sometimes they do not give the same answer. In this paper mechanical characterization was carried out by means of fatigue tests undertaken with two most used <b>testing</b> <b>machines</b> for asphalt material: two point bending (2 PB) test at IFSTTAR in Nantes (France) and four point bending (4 PB) test at University of Palermo, in Palermo (Italy). Different strain controlled tests were been undertaken for the same material under the same loading conditions, frequency and temperature (15 Hz and 20 ˚C), according to the European standard 12697 part 24 and 26. The first results of this interlaboratory activity are showed in this paper. ...|$|R

The acoustic emission test was carried out with a DS 5 acoustic emission monitor. The system has 8 channels and can monitor the external parameters such as temperature and pressure. Moreover, the system can identify the location of acoustic emission and record the waveform characteristics in the whole experiment process.|$|R

However, there are neither international standards nor a common nomenclature for engineered tissues.

40|$|Abstract. This paper aims {{to present}} an {{experimental}} study for determining the mechanical properties of woven fabrics used for airbags manufacturing. In order to realise the study, there were chosen two types of fabric, one that is coated with silicon {{and one that is}} uncoated. The experimental tests that were carried out were <b>uniaxial</b> tension <b>tests</b> for samples extracted on the warp and on the weft direction, the Bias test, a test specific for shear loads and the dome test, a test specific for biaxial loads. For the <b>uniaxial</b> tension <b>test</b> the force-displacement curve was obtained and the maximum values of the loads and the displacement. For the last two tests (bias test and dome test) there have been determined the maximum load, the displacement at maximum load, but also the local major strains obtained. All tests were carried out on a tensile and compression <b>testing</b> <b>machine</b> Instron 5587, while for measuring the main strains there has been used also the optical measuring system Aramis...|$|R
