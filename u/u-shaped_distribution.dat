40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} three factors that might influence the spatial distribution. of attention after {{the identification of}} a first target during attentional blink: the maximum distance between the two targets, the spatial configuration of stimuli, and eye movements. Results showed that the <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> of attention during attentional blink persisted in the circular configuration of stimuli irrespective of the radius of the circle. In addition, the <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> of attention during attentional blink depends on the circular configuration of stimuli and the central fixation. When two targets appeared in noncircular configurations and eye movements were not strictly restrained, {{a large proportion of}} observers showed a gradient for the accuracy of the second target (T 2) during attentional blink. However, when observers kept fixating on the central cross in a noncircular configuration, they showed a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> of T 2 performance during attentional blink. Furthermore, observers are more likely to show a gradient distribution of T 2 performance during attentional blink as their probability of fixating the first target (T 1) increases. These results suggest that maintaining equal eccentricity for each stimulus is critical for producing the <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> of attention during attentional blink...|$|E

This paper explores the mechanism of pedestrian street crossings during the red-man phase of traffic light signals and proposes a model for pedestrians’ waiting times at signalized intersections. We start from a simplified scenario for a particular pedestrian under specific traffic conditions. Then we take into account the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians via statistical unconditioning. We show that this in general leads to a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> of the pedestrians’ intended waiting time. This <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> characterizes the nature of pedestrian street-crossing behavior, showing that in general there are a large proportion of pedestrians who cross the street immediately after arriving at the crossing point, and a large proportion of pedestrians who are willing to wait for the entire red-man phase.

A moisture correction function was constructed by milling narrow size fractions of wheat tempered to different moisture contents, and subtracting the breakage function at a base moisture content of 16 % from that at other moisture contents. The effect of adding moisture was to change an initially inverted <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> at low moisture contents to a linear distribution at 16 % moisture, {{then to a}} <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> at higher moisture contents, reminiscent of the particle size distributions produced by dull-to-dull milling.

40|$|Models {{based on}} the {{breakage}} equation for roller milling {{have been developed to}} predict the output particle size distribution delivered by First Break roller milling of wheat from distributions of single kernel characteristics. These models allow prediction of the breakage of mixtures of kernels of unknown origin or varieties and varying in size and hardness, based solely on Perten Single Kernel Characterisation System (SKCS) characteristics. Predictions have been developed for both Sharp-to-Sharp and Dull-to-Dull roll dispositions, and show good agreement with independent data. Milling under a Dull-to-Dull disposition is more sensitive to kernel bardness and gives a more pronounced <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> of output particle sizes (i. e. large proportions of both small and large particles, with few in the mid-size range) than Sharp-to-Sharp milling. Similarly, softer wheats break to give a more <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> than harder wheats. These findings also demonstrate that kernel hardness as reported by the SKCS is meaningful in relation to wheat breakage during roller milling. Previous work has shown that single kernel moisture measurements can be included in predictive equations; further work reported here demonstrates the potential to add the fourth SKCS parameter, kernel mass, to predictions in order to allow for the effect of kernel shape on breakage. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{deals with}} the {{lead-time}} demand forecasting for inventory management of multiple slow-moving items in the case when the available demand history is very short. Two stochastic models of demand are compared: (i) the first based on the “population-averaged ” binomial distribution of requests (the traditional approach); and (ii) the second based on the beta-binomial probability distribution that assumes that the demand probabilities for the inventory items follow the beta distribution, and employs the Bayesian framework to forecast the lead-time demand (longitudinal statistical approach). The conducted simulation study shows that using the latter model leads to the significant decrease of the holding cost and higher inventory system reliability. Besides, as follows from the simulation results, the beta-binomial demand model is especially useful when the demand probabilities are low and have the <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The gene {{composition}} of bacteria {{of the same}} species can differ significantly between isolates. Variability in gene composition can be summarized in terms of gene frequency distributions, in which individual genes are ranked according to the frequency of genomes in which they appear. Empirical gene frequency distributions possess a U-shape, such that there are many rare genes, some genes of intermediate occurrence, and many common genes. It would seem that <b>U-shaped</b> gene frequency <b>distributions</b> can be used to infer the essentiality and/or importance of a gene to a species. Here, we ask: can <b>U-shaped</b> gene frequency <b>distributions,</b> instead, arise generically via neutral processes of genome evolution? Results We introduce a neutral model of genome evolution which combines birth-death processes at the organismal level with gene uptake and loss at the genomic level. This model predicts that gene frequency distributions possess a characteristic U-shape {{even in the absence of}} selective forces driving genome and population structure. We compare the model predictions to empirical gene frequency distributions from 6 multiply sequenced species of bacterial pathogens. We fit the model with constant population size to data, matching U-shape distributions albeit without matching all quantitative features of the distribution. We find stronger model fits in the case where we consider exponentially growing populations. We also show that two alternative models which contain a "rigid" and "flexible" core component of genomes provide strong fits to gene frequency distributions. Conclusions The analysis of neutral models of genome evolution suggests that <b>U-shaped</b> gene frequency <b>distributions</b> provide less information than previously suggested regarding gene essentiality. We discuss the need for additional theory and genomic level information to disentangle the roles of evolutionary mechanisms operating within and amongst individuals in driving the dynamics of gene distributions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ribosomal RNA genes, {{known as}} ribosomal DNA or rDNA, are {{commonly}} found in tandem arrays of hundreds of repeating units. The sequences of each unit in an array {{were thought to be}} near-identical but it is now known that frequent mutations may occur, causing heterogeneity amongst units. Opposing these divergent mutational processes, unit sequences are homogenised through concerted evolutionary processes such as unequal sister chromatid exchange (USCE) and gene conversion (GC). In this study Perl software has been used to uncover rDNA sequence variation in the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus, using data derived from the Saccharomyces Genome Resequencing Project. This analysis, in conjunction with a reanalysis of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae data from the same project, has provided detailed information regarding rDNA sequence heterogeneity in two contrasting, yet closelyrelated yeast species. Additionally, the rDNA flanking sequences of four yeast strains have been characterised via an analysis of new next generation sequencing reads, adding to our knowledge of concerted evolutionary processes in these genomic regions. Partial Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (pSNPs) within these datasets are shown to reflect genome mosaicism within a population, and to identify strains with signs of genome hybridisation undetectable by other means. This information provides further insights into the dynamics of the rDNA region in the two yeast species. In particular, examination of the percentage occupancies of pSNPs reveals <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distributions</b> which differ between the two species. Further investigations of rDNA evolutionary dynamics through the development of two Java simulation tools (SIMPLEX and CONCERTINA), which model USCE and GC events, follow the fate of both single and multiple pSNPs in one or more rDNA arrays. Initial simulations show the distribution of pSNPs varies depending upon the balance between mutations and concerted evolutionary events, and provide a framework to investigate the mechanisms involved in altered rDNA dynamics in various cellular processes...|$|R

Simulations using neural fields show the inverted <b>U-shaped</b> RT <b>distribution</b> as an emergent consequence of lateral inhibition.

For a wide-band regime, this paper shows the possibility of multiple equilibria, giving rise to a `wall within the wide band'. Such a `wall' serves as a barrier to exchange rate movements and therefore helps stabilize exchange rate fluctuations, although it does not eliminate the possibility of the collapse of the system.

40|$|The gene {{content of}} genomes of closely related {{bacteria}} can differ significantly. For example, pair-wise comparisons of genome sequences from isolates {{of the same}} species often do not share a substantial fraction of their gene content. When a large number of genomes within a bacterial “species ” are sequenced, the gene content variability can be summarized as a gene frequency distribution: given G sequenced genomes, some genes are found in k of these genomes where k ranges from 1 to G. Empirically, such gene frequency distributions possess a characteristic U-shape, such that there are many genes that only appear in one genome, fewer genes which appear in an intermediate number of genomes, and many genes which appear in all genomes. Genes within each of these three categories have been labeled accessory, character and core genes, respectively 1. It would seem that <b>U-shaped</b> gene frequency <b>distributions</b> can be used to infer the essentiality and/or importance of a gene to a species. Instead, we ask: is it possible to recapitulate findings of <b>U-shaped</b> gene frequency <b>distributions</b> in the absence of selective forces driving genomic and population composition? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative by proposing a simple and analytically tractable neutral model of genome evolution that explicitly accounts for gene composition of genomes. In this model, genomes undergo birth-death processes in a neutral sense and also acquire and lose genes. The model differs from most previous efforts to analyze genome evolution by self-consistently treating the dynamics at two scales: population level drift and genomic level change. We analyze our model using coalescent theory and derive closed form solutions for gene frequency distributions.

As in the migration-only models studied previously, the genealogy of any sample includes two phases: a brief sample-size adjustment followed by a coalescent process that dominates the history. This result will hold for metapopulations that are composed {{of a large number of}} demes. It is robust to the details of population structure, as long as the number of possible source demes of migrants and colonists for each deme is large. Analytic predictions about levels of genetic variation are possible, and results for average numbers of pairwise differences within and between demes are given. Further analysis of the expected number of segregating sites in a sample from a single deme illustrates some previously known differences between migration and extinction/recolonization. The ancestral process is also amenable to computer simulation. Simulation results show that migration and extinction/recolonization have very different effects on the site-frequency distribution in a sample from a single deme.

The minimum of this distribution decreases significantly and shifts to midgap for moderate annealing temperatures. For higher annealing temperatures, the trend is reversed. In the silicon-rich films, the percolation of rigidity caused by the chains of Si-Si bonds impedes the initial decrease of the defect density. For thicker films, the strain of the: SiNx:H film produces a higher density of defects that results in increased levels of leakage currents and poorer electrical characteristics...|$|E

Fb – Structures and {{organization}} in complex systems Abstract – We study {{the growth of}} bipartite networks in which the number of nodes {{in one of the}} partitions is kept fixed while the other partition is allowed to grow. We study random and preferential attachment as well as combination of both. We derive the exact analytical expression for the degree-distribution of all these different types of attachments while assuming that edges are incorporated sequentially, i. e., a single edge is added to the growing network in a time step. We also provide an approximate expression for the case when more than one edges are added in a time step. We show that depending on the relative weight between random and preferential attachments, the degree-distribution of this type of network falls into one of the four possible regimes, which range from a binomial distribution for pure random attachment to an <b>u-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> for dominant preferential attachment. Copyright c © EPLA, 2007 A bipartite network is a graph that connects two distinct sets (or partitions) of nodes, which we will refer to as the top and the bottom sets. An edg...|$|E
40|$|Background: Congenital {{microcephaly}} {{has been}} linked to maternal Zika virus infection. However, ascertaining infants diagnosed with microcephaly can be challenging. Methods: Thirty birth defects surveillance programs provided data on infants diagnosed with microcephaly born 2009 to 2013. The pooled prevalence of microcephaly per 10, 000 live births was estimated overall and by maternal/infant characteristics. Variation in prevalence was examined across case finding methods. Nine programs provided data on head circumference and conditions potentially contributing to microcephaly. Results: The pooled prevalence of microcephaly was 8. 7 per 10, 000 live births. Median prevalence (per 10, 000 live births) was similar among programs using active (6. 7) and passive (6. 6) methods; the interdecile range of prevalence estimates was wider among programs using passive methods for all race/ethnicity categories except Hispanic. Prevalence (per 10, 000 live births) was lowest among non-Hispanic Whites (6. 5) and highest among non- Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics (11. 2 and 11. 9, respectively); estimates followed a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> by maternal age with the highest prevalence among mothers 3 ̆c 20 years (11. 5) and 3 ̆e/= 40 years (13. 2). For gestational age and birth weight, the highest prevalence was among infants varied; 41. 8...|$|E
40|$|In type I intermittency, simple models {{known for}} at least twenty years show that a {{characteristic}} <b>u-shaped</b> probability <b>distribution</b> is obtained for the laminar phase length. We have shown elsewhere that, for some cases of pathology, the laminar phase length distribution characteristic for type I intermittency may be obtained in human heart rate variability data. The heart and its regulatory systems are presumed to be both noisy and nonstationary. Although the effect of additive noise on the laminar phase distribution in type I intermittency is well known, neither the effect of multiplicative noise nor of nonstationarity (i. e. changes of the control parameter with the time) have been studied. In this paper, we first discuss the properties of two classes of models of type I intermittency: a) the control parameter of the logistic map is changed dichotomously from a value within the intermittency range to just below the bifurcation point and back; b) the control parameter is changed randomly within the same parameter range as in the model class a). We show that the properties of both models are importantly different from those obtained for type I intermittency in the presence additive noise as obtained by Hirsch twenty years ago. The two models help {{explain some of the}} features seen in the intermittency in human heart rate variability. Comment: 15 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|Sickle cell disease (SCD) is {{a common}} cause of {{cerebrovascular}} disease in childhood. Primary stroke prevention is effective using transcranial Doppler (TCD) scans to measure intracranial blood velocities, and regular blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide when these are abnormal. Inadequate TCD scans occur {{when it is not}} possible to measure velocities in all the main arteries. We have investigated the prevalence and significance of this in a retrospective audit of 3915 TCD scans in 1191 children, performed between 2008 and 2015. 79 % scans were normal, 6. 4 % conditional, 2. 8 % abnormal and 12 % inadequate. 21. 6 % of 1191 patients had an inadequate scan at least once. The median age of first inadequate scan was 3. 3 years (0. 7 - 19. 4), with a <b>U-shaped</b> frequency <b>distribution</b> with age: 28 % aged 2 - 3 years, 3. 5 % age 10 years, 25 % age 16 years. In young children reduced compliance was the main reason for inadequate TCDs, whereas in older children it was due to a poor temporal ultrasound window. The prevalence of inadequate TCD was 8 % in the main Vascular Laboratory at King's College Hospital and significantly higher at 16 % in the outreach clinics (P< 0. 0001), probably due to the use of a portable ultrasound machine. Inadequate TCD scans were not associated with underlying cerebrovascular disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} into age of onset in affective disorders has produced conflicting results. This paper examines {{the influence of}} heterogeneity on the age-at-first-registration distribution for the ICD- 9 diagnostic group 2 ̆ 7 affective psychosis 2 ̆ 7. Method: For 1979 - 1991, data for age-at-first-registration for 4985 individuals diagnosed with affective psychosis (ICD- 9 296. x) were extracted from a name-linked mental health register. These data were divided into (i) 2 ̆ 7296. 1 only 2 ̆ 7, a category used to code unipolar depression (males = 700; females = 1321); and (ii) 2 ̆ 7296 other 2 ̆ 7, all 296 cases other than 296. 1 (males = 1280; females = 1684). Inception rates for each 5 -year age division were adjusted for the background population age-structure as a rate per 100 000 population. Results: The age-at-first-registration distribution for affective psychosis has a wide age range, with women outnumbering men. There is a near-linear increase in inception rates {{for both men and}} women with 296. 1 only, while the bulk of those with affective psychoses (296 other) have an inverted <b>U-shaped</b> age <b>distribution.</b> Males have an earlier modal age-at-first-registration for 296 other compared to females. Conclusion: The heterogeneity in terms of subtypes and sex in affective psychosis clouds the interpretation of age-at-first-registration. Separating those with unipolar psychotic depression from other subclassifications and differentiating by sex may provide clues to factors that precipitate the onset of affective psychosis...|$|R
