40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of restrainers is to prevent <b>unseating</b> of bridge spans. Pipe seat extenders are the {{preferred}} (and in some cases required) method of preventing <b>unseating</b> since they increase the relative displacement capacity of bridge frames.

40|$|<b>Unseating</b> of bridge spans due to {{excessive}} relative hinge opening {{is a common}} problem for bridges subjected to strong ground motion. Various <b>unseating</b> prevention devices have been developed in both the United States and Japan to try to {{reduce the likelihood of}} collapse due to <b>unseating.</b> This paper presents the results of the evaluation of <b>unseating</b> prevention devices using nitinol shape memory alloys (SMAs). Superelastic SMAs have the ability to remain elastic under very large deformations, due to a solid-state martensitic transformation. This unique property leads to enhanced performance of the adaptive superelastic <b>unseating</b> prevention device, compared with conventional devices used in the United States and Japan. To assess the effectiveness of the devices, nonlinear time history analyses are performed on a typical multiple frame reinforced concrete box girder bridge using a suite of representative ground motions. The results show that for multiple frame reinforced concrete box girder bridges the adaptive superelastic devices are very effective in limiting the relative hinge displacement and preventing <b>unseating,</b> compared with the conventional steel cable restrainers. 1...|$|R

Pratt continued with legal challenges and finally was allowed to serve out his term. Though Cantrill's decision was based on the invalidation of Louisville's vote and the votes of four counties in eastern Kentucky, none of the legislators from those areas were <b>unseated.</b>|$|E

He ran for lieutenant governor in 1971 on an informal ticket with former Governor Bert T. Combs. Combs lost in the Democratic primary to Wendell Ford, but Carroll defeated his primary opponents and {{went on to win the}} general election. He was elevated to the governorship in December 1974, after Ford <b>unseated</b> Moderate Republican U.S. Sen. Marlow Cook. Carroll won a term as governor in his own right in 1975.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1380s, the {{governor}} of Gaza, Akbuga Safawi, plotted to commit treason against Sultan az-Zahir Barquq. The plot was detected and Safawi was exiled to al-Karak, and replaced by Husam al-Din ibn Bakish. Soon after, the city fell {{into the hands of}} Emir Yalbugha an-Nasiri who revolted against Barquq. Gaza was retaken without violence, and Ibn Bakish met Yalbugha at its gates with gifts and proposals of peace. The <b>unseated</b> Barquq regained his throne in 1389, and retook Gaza the next year. In 1401 a swarm of locusts destroyed Gaza's crops. A battle between the rival Mamluk emirs Akbirdi and Qansuwa Khamsiyah occurred in Gaza; Khamsiyah had failed in usurping the Mamluk throne and fled to Gaza where he made his unsuccessful last stand. Between 1428 and 1433, Gaza was governed by Emir Sayf ad-Din Inal, who would later become sultan in 1453. During his sultanate, in 1455, Inal's dawadar (executive secretary) had the Madrasa of Birdibak built in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Notre Dame {{nonetheless}} {{opened the}} season with a 31–7 victory over heavily favored Wisconsin, a game in which Huarte threw for more yards than the team's leading passer had over the entire 1963 season. Notre Dame players carried Parseghian off the field after the win, which vaulted the team to ninth place in the polls. A string of victories followed, first against Purdue and then Air Force and UCLA. Notre Dame rose to first place in the national polls following a 40–0 win over Navy in October. The team went undefeated until the last game of the year against USC, who won 20–17 in the final minutes on a touchdown pass from Craig Fertig to Rod Sherman. The loss <b>unseated</b> Notre Dame from the top ranking in the national polls, but the team still won the MacArthur Trophy, a championship awarded by the National Football Foundation.|$|E
5|$|On March 10, 1900, {{the circuit}} court of Jefferson County upheld the General Assembly's actions that {{certified}} Goebel as governor. The case was appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the court of last resort in Kentucky. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals ruled 6—1 that Taylor had been legally <b>unseated.</b> Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and on May 21, 1900, the Court refused to hear the case. Only Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan dissented from this refusal. With Taylor's legal options exhausted, Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, ascended to the governorship. During his short term as governor, Taylor had done little beyond making a few appointments and issuing a few pardons.|$|E

5|$|Wizard's {{first race}} as a five-year-old was a {{sweepstakes}} of 100 guineas each on 20 April at Newmarket. He faced three opponents and won the race from odds-on favourite Spaniard. He was then intended to face 1810 Derby winner Whalebone at Newmarket in early May, but Whalebone's owner, the 4th Duke of Grafton, paid a forfeit and the race never took place. He beat Middlethorpe at Newmarket after Middlethorpe <b>unseated</b> his rider {{in the early stages}} of the race. The match against Middlethorpe won him 500 guineas. The following day he beat Anthonio over five and a half furlongs. He faced Middlethorpe again in September when he fell lame and Middlethorpe beat him. This was his final race and he was retired to stud. Throughout his racing career Wizard earned 3850 guineas.|$|E
5|$|As the {{celebrations}} {{in honor of}} Scott's military career continued across Kentucky, he began {{to consider the possibility}} of running for governor in 1808. By mid-1806, state senator Thomas Posey and Lexington lawyer Thomas Todd had already declared their candidacies. Posey had been chosen speaker pro tem of the state Senate and, with the death of Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell in 1804, had assumed the role of acting lieutenant governor and presiding officer in the Senate. He subsequently lost his senatorial re-election bid, but continued to act as lieutenant governor and preside over the Senate. His opponents claimed that since he was no longer a member of the Senate, he was not qualified to act as lieutenant governor; additionally, they charged that he was sympathetic to the hated Federalist Party, even though he self-identified as a Democratic-Republican. Although he was not successfully <b>unseated</b> as the Senate's presiding officer, the controversy diminished his chances in the 1808 election. In 1807, Todd removed himself from contention as well, accepting Governor Greenup's appointment to the Kentucky Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|In January 2006 Queen Mary 2 {{embarked}} on a circumnavigation of South America. Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was <b>unseated.</b> In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod. At the same time, sprinkler systems were installed in all of the vessel's balconies to comply with new safety regulations which had come into effect since the MS Star Princess fire. Additionally, both bridge wings were extended by two metres to improve visibility.|$|E
