In January 1943 production had to be scaled down, and the ore dressing mill reduced to a single shift per day. But a bigger blow was to follow. In May 1943, as one of the shafts was being deepened, the miners encountered bands of soft, black shale. The Ministry sent in a team of Canadian Engineers with diamond drilling equipment, and this confirmed that the Skiddaw Group of rocks lay at about [...] below the main entrance to the mine (The Lucy Level), not at [...] as the geologists had predicted.

[...] Strathfield council soon afterwards released a press statement that it [...] "will not and does not" [...] tolerate misconduct. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is currently investigating whether claims developers were given inside information about land rezoning proposals put to Strathfield Council have any substance and the pictures taken by The Australian were handed to them for further investigation.|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{euro area}} enlargement, we develop a simple model of {{exchange}} rate dynamics {{in a context}} of capital inflows (a modified version of Dornbusch’s (1976) overshooting model). The model suggests that in a regime of inflation targeting and free float, the real and nominal exchange rates will exhibit important fluctuations after an exogenous shock of capital inflows, {{but in the long run}} the current account is balanced and price stability is maintained. In the case of a fixed exchange rate regime, the real exchange rate will appreciate permanently (through an inflation differential) following the shock, thus implying impossibility to maintain price stability and the current account balance. These insights show a conflict between exchange rate and price stability. In the context of euro area integration, the price stability criterion is stricter as the exchange rate criterion allows for (large) fluctuation bands. We then argue that the choice of inflation targeting-floating exchange rate regime strategically dominates the fixed exchange rate option. A second argument against the fixed exchange rate option is that it could lead to <b>unsustainable</b> <b>developments.</b> The model can also be used to analyse risks and challenges for NMS of an early adoption of the euro. Monetary union can be approximated by the case of a fixed exchange rate.

Using data from 500 undergraduate students from one university in Bandung this study constructs five factors regarding car perception through principle component analysis: symbolic/affective, arrogant prestige, independence, comfort, and social/env. care. These five factors plus some socio-demographic variables, such as monthly income, are used as explanatory variables for modelling car ownership using structural equation modelling.

Our analysis incorporates land use measures of population density which affect the proximity of trip origins to destination. Population density represents the connectivity of the city which affects the level of vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT), the rate of non-motorized transport, and thus the level of household vehicle emissions.

40|$|Recent major coastal {{disasters}} in the Asia-Pacific region {{have resulted in}} a massive loss of life and high societal costs. Unbridled development, growing coastal populations and injudicious land planning amplifies the predicted disaster risk due to climate change and extreme weather events. As it typifies expanding coastal development in areas prone to extreme weather events, the town of Exmouth (NW Australia) was used to investigate economic strategies for coastal risk mitigation. Recent marina development, with a loss of disaster mitigating ecosystem functions, has increased risk to previously unaffected areas. The extent to which risk perceptions of cyclonic storm-surge inundation and flooding influenced the price buyers paid for residential property in Exmouth over the period 1988 – 2013 was examined using a Hedonic Price Model. The analysis indicated that prices did not reflect the real societal cost of risk. Due to the absence of a monetary signal, such as higher insurance premiums, buyers tended to be risk insensitive and give greater weight to coastal amenity. To internalize these costs, a mandatory private insurance scheme for high-risk properties, penalties for local councils undertaking <b>unsustainable</b> <b>developments,</b> and a hybrid economic instrument aimed at correcting the market failure in coastal land, is proposed...|$|R

Flood is a frequent natural hazard that has significant financial consequences for Australia. The emergency response system in Australia is very successful and has saved many lives over the years. However, the preparedness for natural disaster impacts in terms of loss reduction and damage mitigation has been less successful. In this paper, a newly derived flood loss function for Australian residential structures (FLFA rs) has been presented and calibrated by using historic data collected from an extreme event in Queensland, Australia, that occurred in 2013. Afterwards, {{the performance of the}} method developed in this work (contrasted to one Australian model and one model from USA) has been compared with the observed damage data collected from a 2012 flood event in Maranoa, Queensland.

Results obtained from the new empirically based function (FLFA rs) and the other models indicate that it is apparent that the precision of flood damage models is strongly dependent on selected stage damage curves, and flood damage estimation without model calibration might result in inaccurate predictions of losses.
