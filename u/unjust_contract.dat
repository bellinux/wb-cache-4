The contract made him liable for virtually all recording expenses incurred for all of his Bang Records recordings before royalties would be paid, and after those expenses were recouped, the revenue would become the [...] "subject of some highly creative accounting." [...] Morrison vented frustration about this <b>unjust</b> <b>contract</b> in his sarcastic nonsense song [...] "The Big Royalty Check." [...] Morrison has stated that [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] is not among his favorite songs, remarking [...] "it's not one of my best. I mean I've got about 300 songs that I think are better".|$|E
40|$|Standard form {{contracts}} are drafted in advance by the supplier of {{goods or services}} and presented to the consumer on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. The consumer’s only choice is to adhere to, or refuse to adhere to, {{the terms of the}} standard form contracts. They have various advantages for both contracting parties such as cost saving and uniformity. They also have some disadvantages as they are one-sided against consumers and impose unfair terms to the contracting party. Once a contract is signed, it must be honoured. However, public policy can be used to rescue the person from greatly unfair obligations that arise from the contracts. Public policy derives from the Constitution and the fundamental values it enshrines. Consequently, a contractual term that violates the Constitution is contrary to public policy and unenforceable. The Consumer Protection Act (CPA) has a significant impact on standard form contracts. It imposes a duty on the supplier to draw the attention of the customer to the exemption clauses or other contractual terms that oust common law protection. However, the CPA applies only to transactions between suppliers and consumers. The prohibition of unfair, unreasonable or <b>unjust</b> <b>contract</b> terms should apply to every contract. Parliament should intervene and enact legislation to prevent the abuse of freedom of contract by the strong party, to the detriment of other contracting party...|$|E

40|$|An Introduction to the Law of Contract is {{a highly}} {{successful}} overview {{of the principles of}} contract law and how they apply in practice. This seventh edition incorporates references to the new Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) as it applies to contracts generally but with especial reference to the provisions dealing with misleading and deceptive conduct, consumer guarantees, <b>unjust</b> <b>contracts,</b> exemption clauses, harassment and coercion, the effectiveness of disclaimers and the provision of alternative remedies. Major cases included are: United Group Rail Services Ltd v Rail Corporation New South Wales and AMCI (IO) Pty Ltd v Aquila Steel Pty Ltd – agreements to negotiate in good faith; Olivaylle Pty Ltd v Flottweg AG (No 4) – the application of the postal rule in cases of emailed acceptances; PRA Electrical Pty Ltd v Perseverance Exploration Pty Ltd and Waldorf Apartment Hotel, The Entrance Pty Ltd v Owners Corp SP 71623, following the principle in Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Co in relation to contracts that arise through conduct; IATA v Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd – contractual intention and the need to give commercial contracts a businesslike interpretation; Ford v Perpetual Trustees Victoria Ltd – non est factum and the test for negligent signing; and Insight Vacations Pty Ltd v Young – strict interpretation of exemption clauses. This edition also contains more detailed discussion on how the requirement for a signed memorandum can be satisfied by a series of connected documents; how the exceptions to the parol evidence rule apply, particularly in cases of ambiguity; the basis on which rectification will be ordered; the operation of the pleas of duress, undue influence and unconscionability; the validity of restraint of trade clauses; the consequences of repudiation, and the calculation of damages.

The plaintiffs' claim concerned Circuit City's cancellation of its warranty plan without full {{disclosure of the}} plan {{at the time of}} sale. The plaintiffs cited breach of <b>contract,</b> <b>unjust</b> enrichment, and violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act. Circuit City requested the matter be dismissed. The court, however, upheld the plaintiffs' claim that the monies paid for the protection plan be reimbursed and credit be issued for non-working goods returned.|$|R
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} tort and <b>unjust</b> enrichment, <b>contract</b> is {{typically}} {{viewed as the}} part of the law of obligations which deals with voluntary undertakings, and accordingly gives a high priority to ensuring that only bargains to which people have given their true consent will be enforced by the courts. While it is not always clear when people have truly agreed in a subjective sense, English law takes the view that when one person objectively manifests their consent to a bargain, they will be bound. However, not all agreements, even if they are relatively certain in subject matter, are considered enforceable. There is a rebuttable presumption that people do not wish to later have legal enforcement of agreements made socially or domestically. The general rule is that contracts require no prescribed form, such as being in writing, except where statute requires it, usually for large deals like the sale of land. In addition and in contrast to civil law systems, English common law carried a general requirement that all parties, in order to have standing to enforce an agreement, must have brought something of value, or [...] "consideration" [...] to the bargain. This old rule is full of exceptions, particularly where people wished to vary their agreements, through case law and the equitable doctrine of promissory estoppel. Moreover, statutory reform in the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 allows third parties to enforce the benefit of an agreement that they had not necessarily paid for so long as the original parties to a contract consented to them being able to do so.|$|R
40|$|This book is {{the first}} part of an {{investigation}} into defences in private law. The present volume explores tort law defences. Three further volumes are planned, on <b>unjust</b> enrichment, <b>contract</b> and equity. The chapters that constitute the present volume were delivered at a workshop at All Souls College, Oxford in January 2014. In helping to bring the workshop to fruition, we are grateful, first and foremost, for the support of All Souls College, which provided both the setting for the proceedings and significant financial support. The workshop could not have gone ahead without the further financial assistance of the Oxford Law Faculty and the University of Oxford’s Fell Fund. We were also able to call on several members of the Faculty—both administrative and academic—for guidance. Discussions at the workshop were greatly enriched by the contributions of several observers, including Lord Hoffmann, Timothy Endicott and John Gardner and, on behalf of the Law Commission, Sir David Lloyd-Jones and David Hertzell. Finally, Anna Kim’s patience and efficiency helped immeasurably in the lead up to the workshop. For their assistance in helping to turn the workshop papers into the chapters that feature in this volume, we are grateful to Jodi Gardner, Elizabeth Houghton, Krishnaprasad Kizhakkevalappil, Niranjan Venkatesan and Binesh Hass. We are indebted to Hart Publishing for their editorial assistance, and in particular to Richard Hart for the characteristic enthusiasm and professionalism with which he embraced the project as a whole. Finally, we are grateful to Lord Hoffmann for generously agreeing to write the Foreword...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers and evaluates how {{the implementation}} of the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 (CPA) and more specifically Part G thereof influences the common law in relation to contract law and the consumer s rights to fair just and reasonable contract terms, together with considering the pit falls of the CPA in its current form and the sections which require amendment. It will be illustrated that the CPA has been drafted with the clear intention of protecting and benefiting the consumer by codifying the common law provisions in order to strengthen the consumer s position within consumer markets. Many terms and principles introduced by the CPA are foreign to the South African legal system. It can be expected with any entirely new piece of legislation implemented within an existing legal system that there will be conflicts and uncertainties in the application thereof. Ultimately this dissertation has found two sets of conclusions. Firstly the general effect that Part G of the CPA has on consumer markets, namely strengthening consumer rights thereby enabling consumers, more particularly historically disadvantaged consumers to actively partake in consumer markets as a whole. Secondly this dissertation unfortunately has also found that the CPA has failed to use essential mechanisms as used in the United Kingdom and European Union unfair terms legislation to curb unfair <b>unjust</b> and unreasonable <b>contract</b> terms.

40|$|This article {{examines}} {{the extent to which}} the doctrine of unconscionable conduct protects the interests of victims of exploitative asset-based lending. It considers the possibility of a loan made to a borrower unable to conserve his or her own interests and secured on the family home being set aside through general principles of unconscionable dealing in equity, including the current requirement to show a 'situational special disadvantage', under the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001 (Cth) (ASIC Act), and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth). Moreover, this study investigates the courts' jurisdiction to reopen an <b>unjust</b> housing loan <b>contract</b> under the National Consumer Credit Protection 2009 (Cth) (Consumer Credit Code) and the Contracts Review Act 1980 (NSW). First, the {{article examines}} whether the lender knew of the vulnerability of the borrower. This article argues that the information given in a loan application may in some cases provide a basis for finding that a lender had knowledge of the inability of a borrower to look after his or her own interests for the purposes of establishing unconscionable dealing and unfair conduct. The case analysis revealed that asset-based lending may constitute unconscionable conduct in certain circumstances; however asset-based lending itself is not unconscionable. Second, a lender may have a duty to make further enquiries regarding a borrower's circumstances in cases where the loan documentation is incomplete or irregular. Third, the courts are willing to consider the information contained in the loan documentation when determining whether a lender had knowledge of a borrower's personal and financial circumstances. Lastly, the requirement that a borrower should 'do equity' and account for any benefit they have received has a significant impact on the utility of the relief granted by the courts. Full Tex...|$|R

The lawyers for the plaintiffs reviewed the request and said that this is fairly common {{at this stage of the}} process and that the case would be reviewed before a judge in November 2010. In February 2011 all claims of false advertising in the case were dismissed but the plaintiffs were allowed to appeal and amend the case and the other claims that the removal violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse act were allowed to go forward. In March 2011 the plaintiffs amended their complaint to refute Sony's claims that it was within its rights under the TOS and warranty to remove the feature adding more details to their claims including breach of warranty, breach of implied warranty, breach of <b>contract,</b> <b>unjust</b> enrichment, and breach of several California unfair business practices laws. In April 2011 SCEA again asked that the case be dismissed and made claims that the plaintiffs refiled claim was insufficient and that they were hackers and wanted to violate Sony's intellectual property and asked the judge to grant search rights on their PS3 systems. SCEA also made claims that they were not the division solely responsible for the removal and should not be held responsible despite conflicting information to the contrary. On April 18, 2011 the plaintiffs fired back at Sony's renewed efforts to have the case dismissed by pointing out the fact that Sony had made many of the same claims before and that they had been dismissed by the court and also pointed out several legal precedents under California law that refuted Sony's claims. In December 2011 the whole case was dismissed under the grounds that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that they could expect the [...] "Other OS" [...] feature beyond the warranty of the machine. However this decision was overturned in a 2014 appellate court decision finding that plaintiffs had indeed made clear and sufficiently substantial claims.|$|R
