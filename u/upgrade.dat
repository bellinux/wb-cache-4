40|$|Abstract—Facing the {{pressure}} of increasing population, poverty and inequality during the rapid urbanization, the issue of informal urban <b>upgrading</b> has been {{paid more attention to}} in developing countries. Firstly, this paper explains the conception of informal city and points out the spacial and social character of informal city. Secondly, at the view of time sequence and <b>upgrading</b> motivity, three <b>upgrading</b> models of informal cities in developing countries are put forward and analyzed, which include the <b>upgrading</b> model of government-initiated interventions, the <b>upgrading</b> model of self-help approach, and the <b>upgrading</b> model of multiple participations. Thirdly, the enlightenment of informal urban <b>upgrading</b> in developing countries upon Chinese urban <b>upgrading</b> is put forward. At last, based on the analysis of the three <b>upgrading</b> models, a conclusion is drawn that the sustainable urban <b>upgrading</b> can’t be achieved by any single objective and sector.

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the GR1B/T2B <b>upgrade,</b> the RAF {{launched}} a plan to <b>upgrade</b> its Jaguar fleet to a common standard, incorporating improvements introduced to some aircraft during the Gulf War, together with adding the ability to use TIALD and new reconnaissance pods. The <b>upgrade</b> came in two parts; the interim GR3 (Jaguar 96) <b>upgrade</b> added a new HUD, a new hand controller and stick top, integrated GPS and TERPROM Terrain Referenced Navigation. It was delivered in two standards, for recce and TIALD. The further upgraded Jaguar GR3A (also known as Jaguar 97) introduced fleet-wide compatibility with TIALD and the new EO GP1 (JRP) digital reconnaissance pod, a helmet mounted sight, improved cockpit displays, a datalink, and improved Night vision goggles compatibility. All GR3As were subsequently re-engined with the new Adour 106 turbofan.|$|E

Lockheed Martin responded to talk of CAPES cancellation with a fixed-price <b>upgrade</b> package for foreign users. CAPES {{was not included in the}} Pentagon's 2015 budget request. The USAF said that the <b>upgrade</b> package will still be offered to Taiwan, and Lockheed said that some common elements with the F-35 will keep the radar's unit costs down.
