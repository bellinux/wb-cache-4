Frances Morris died when Virginia was fourteen. The {{teenager}} then moved to Bee Branch in Van Buren County {{to live with her}} maternal aunt and uncle by-marriage, Mildred Boots French and Thomas Quinn French (1903-1981). Her father, meanwhile, served in the United States Marine Corps. Virginia Morris graduated as the valedictorian of South Side High School in Bee Branch and procured a scholarship to study at Draughon’s School of Business in Little Rock, the state's largest city and capital and the seat of Pulaski County. After graduation, she was employed as a legal secretary at the law firm of Carter, Pickthorne, and Jones. Later, she worked as an <b>under-insurance</b> secretary in Little Rock.|$|E
40|$|<b>Under-insurance</b> {{is one of}} the scourges of homeowner insurance: when it is {{established}} after a claim that the rebuilding cost of a dwelling has been underestimated by the policyholder, the proportional rule applies {{in the sense that the}} indemnity is reduced in proportion of the <b>under-insurance.</b> To avoid this dramatic problem, prejudicial to all parties concerned, a Belgian company has in 1983 marketed a model to evaluate rebuilding costs: if the policyholder fills in correctly a two-page form, the company forgoes the application of the proportional rule. The construction of this model is explained; then, it is shown how a statistical study sponsored by the Professional Union of Insurance Companies allowed the model to improve. © 1986, International Actuarial Association.

40|$|The work {{introduces}} a simple framework {{to study the}} relationship between competition and incentives under non-exclusivity. We characterize the equilibria of an insurance market where intermediaries compete over the contracts they offer to a single consumer {{in the presence of}} moral hazard. Non-exclusivity is responsible for <b>under-insurance</b> and positive profits in an otherwise competitive set-up. A relevant notion of optimality is also introduced and it is argued that market equilibria fail to be constrained-efficient...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{macroeconomic}} model with physical and human capital, human capital risk, and limited contract enforcement. We show analytically that young (high-return) households {{are the most}} exposed to human capital risk and are also the least insured. We document this risk-insurance pattern in data on life-insurance drawn from the Survey of Consumer Finance. A calibrated version of the model can quantitatively account for the life-cycle variation of insurance observed in the US data and implies welfare costs of <b>under-insurance</b> for young households that are equivalent to a 4 percent reduction in lifetime consumption. A policy reform that makes consumer bankruptcy more costly leads to {{a substantial increase in}} the volume of credit and insurance. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the face}} of {{escalating}} costs, declining productivity, and constraints on fund- ing for public transit, many governments have turned to transit privatization {{in an effort to}} improve cost efficiency. Privatization of bus services occurs in a range of forms and regulatory environments. Privatization proponents argue that publicly owned and subsidized transit operations are inefficient due to higher labor costs, restrictive work rules, and large bureaucracies. Critics of privatization argue that several market failures counteract these theorized benefits, resulting in <b>under-insurance,</b> substandard vehicle maintenance, and higher levels of pollution, congestion, and accident rates, among other inadequacies. This paper reviews the research and debates on privatization in the form of contracting, including its effects on cost-efficiency, quality of transit provision, and labor...|$|E
40|$|We study a {{monopoly}} insurance model with endogenous information acquisi-tion. Through a continuous effort choice, consumers determine {{the precision of}} a privately observed signal that is informative about their accident risk. The equi-librium effort is, depending on parameter values, either zero (implying symmetric information) or positive (implying privately informed consumers). Regardless {{of the nature of}} the equilibrium, all offered contracts, also at the top, involve <b>under-insurance.</b> The reason is that underinsurance at the top discourages information gathering. We identify a missorting effect that explains why the insurer wants to discourage information acquisition. Moreover, a public policy that decreases the information gathering costs can hurt both parties. Lower such costs can harm consumers because the insurer adjusts the optimal contract menu in an unfavor-able manner...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper studies public {{provision}} {{of long-term care}} insurance {{in a world in}} which family assistance is (i) uncertain and (ii) endogenous, depending on the time parents spend raising their children. Public benefits will be paid in case of disability but cannot be combined with self-insurance or family aid. The benefits are provided equally to all recipients and financed by a proportional payroll tax. The paper shows that tax distortions imply that full insurance is undesirable. It characterizes the optimal tax and identifies the elements that determine its size. Of crucial importance are the extent of <b>under-insurance,</b> the effect of the tax on the probability of altruism, the distortionary effect of the tax, and, with wage heterogeneity, the covariance between the social marginal utility of lifetime income and (i) earnings (positive effect) and (ii) the probability of altruism default (negative effect) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{fire season}} has started early. Homes were {{destroyed}} {{last month in}} bushfires near Lancefield, Victoria, while buildings and lives have been lost as fires continue to sweep through southern Western Australia. Alongside the devastating loss of life and properties, many properties potentially {{in the path of}} Australian bushfires are inadequately insured. While we have known about high rates of non-insurance and <b>under-insurance</b> across Australia for some time, there is surprisingly little solid data on the issue. We recently set out to address this gap at both the national and regional level. Early findings from a national survey (which we will be presenting at the 2015 TASA conference later this month) indicate 13 % of those surveyed are without insurance cover for their assets - 9 % of home owners are without house insurance and 41 % of tenants do not have contents insurance. Approximately one-quarter of those who are insured may also be inadequately covered...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{focus on the}} uninsured from national and state levels. There are also many Americans who have health insurance but are unable to afford their recommended care and are considered underinsured. This {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of <b>under-insurance</b> among patients seen in primary care clinics. Methods: Patients in 37 primary care practices in 3 practice-based research networks completed a survey to elicit the prevalence of underinsurance among those who had insurance for a full 12 months, including private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. Being underinsured was based on patients report-ing the delay or omission of recommended care because of their inability to afford it. Results: Of those with insurance for a full year, 36. 3 % were underinsured. Of those who were under-insured, 50. 2 % felt that their health suffered because they could not afford recommended care, a rate similar among those who were uninsured. Conclusions: When evaluating underinsurance in primary care offices, using an experiential defini-tion based on self-reports of patients about their inability to pay for recommended health care despite having insurance, the prevalence is quite high. It is important for the primary care physician to under-stand that a substantial percentage of their patients may not follow through with their recommendation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} to analyse {{the choice of}} risk {{management}} activity made by a nonindustrial private forest owner who derives utility from consumption and from the sentimental value of the forest that bears a risk of disaster. We consider a bivariate utility function depending on consumption and sentimental value of forest. In this context, we analyse insurance and/or self-insurance decisions. We show that, under fair premium, full insurance is optimal only if the cross derivative of the utility function equals zero. <b>Under-insurance</b> and over-insurance may also be optimal depending on the sign of this cross derivative. We also show that, under a positive loading factor, optimal partial insurance is validated only if the cross derivative is positive; otherwise full insurance may be optimal even with a loading insurance. We also observe that risk aversion increases the level of insurance demand and self-insurance activity, extending this standard result obtained with an univariate utility function to a bivariate utility function. Moreover, when the forest owner can simultaneously insure and invest in self-insurance activity, full insurance is never optimal if the cross derivative is positive. Finally, we prove that insurance and self-insurance may be substitutes, and if preferences are separable and exhibit decreasing absolute risk aversion, then insurance and self-insurance are always considered as substitutes...|$|E
40|$|Crop {{yield and}} revenue {{insurance}} products with coverage based on actual production history (APH) yields dominate the U. S. Federal Crop Insurance Program. The APH yield, which plays {{a critical role}} in determining the coverage offered to producers, is based on a small sample of historical yields for the insured unit. The properties of this yield measure are critical in determining the value of the insurance to producers. Sampling error in APH yields has the potential to lead to over-insurance in some years and <b>under-insurance</b> in other years. Premiums, which are in part determined by the ratio of the APH yield to the county reference yield, are also affected by variations in APH yields. Congress has enacted two measures, yield substitution and yield floors, that are intended to limit the degree to which sampling error can reduce the insurance guarantee and producer welfare. We examine the impact of sampling error and related policy provisions for Texas cotton, Kansas wheat, and Illinois corn. The analysis is conducted using county level yield data from the National Agricultural Statistics Service and individual insured-unit-level yield data obtained from the Risk Management Agency’s insurance database. Our findings indicate that sampling error in APH yields has the potential to reduce producer welfare and that the magnitude of this effect differs substantially across crops. The yield substitution and yield floor provisions reduce the negative impact of sampling error but also bias guarantees upward, leading to increased government cost of the insurance programs.

40|$|Fear of {{floating}} ” {{is one of}} the central empirical characteristics of exchange rate regimes in emerging markets. However, while some view it as the optimal discretionary monetary policy, for example when foreign exchange markets suffer excess volatility from noise trading, others suggest that “fear {{of floating}} ” arises out of an inefficient lack of commitment to floating, contributing to private sector <b>under-insurance</b> against sudden stops. In this paper we develop a model of the optimal exchange rate regime when both issues are present. We compare three regimes: a state-contingent regime with commitment, which allows exchange rate flexibility during sudden stops but interventions during normal times; a discretionary regime in which choices are made ex-post; and a non-contingent regime with commitment in which the exchange rate is uniformly flexible. Since it is only “fear of floating ” during crises which is costly, we reexamine the data on exchange rate regimes for evidence that exchange rate flexibility is state-contingent. We find few examples of state contingent policies supporting the claim that “fear of floating ” is an inefficient discretionary policy for many emerging markets. However, we also find counterexamples which shed light on exchange rate policy choices. Recent committed floaters exhibit little state contingency because of a uniformly high degree of flexibility, suggesting that it takes time to establish a credible commitment to floating. More established floaters with credibility do exhibit state-contingent regimes. Together the evidence suggests that escaping the “fear of floating ” trap may be more difficult if it entails short-term costs while credibility is acquired, but that the benefits to floating can be substantial...|$|E
