Hague questioned the feasibility of Operation Backstop, because the advance-warning requirement was considered impossible to meet. The UNPROFOR had no reliable military intelligence on HV movements outside the UNPAs, or beyond -wide zones around the UNPAs (where only United Nations Military Observers were present).

40|$|The {{temporal}} {{impact of}} clearing trees on litter production, litter decomposition and on C, N and P release through decomposition of litter was {{examined in the}} pasture systems of a semi-arid zone of central Queensland. Paired sites for cleared pastures (developed from clearing woodlands) and <b>uncleared</b> (intact woodland) pastures were selected to represent three dominant tree communities of the region i. e. Eucalyptus populnea, E. melanophloia and Acacia harpophylla, with three different time-since-clearing (5, 11 – 13 and 33 y) treatments. Yearly litter production was greater at <b>uncleared</b> sites (1732 – 1948 kg ha[minus sign] 1 y[minus sign] 1 for eucalypt and 2596 kg ha[minus sign] 1 y[minus sign] 1 for acacia communities) compared with cleared sites (1038 – 1282 kg ha[minus sign] 1 y[minus sign] 1 for eucalypt and 1100 kg ha[minus sign] 1 y[minus sign] 1 for acacia communities averaged over three time-since-clearing treatments). Rates of litter decomposition and of release of C, N and P from decomposing litter were higher at cleared than <b>uncleared</b> sites for all three tree communities. The cleared and <b>uncleared</b> sites {{did not differ significantly}} in total amount of C and N released per year since the concentrations of C and N were greater in litter from <b>uncleared</b> sites but the rate of release was less than that at cleared sites. Slow but continuous release of nutrients in eucalypt and acacia woodlands may be an adaptation of these communities to maintain the nutrient cycle and to avoid leaching of nutrients in the nutrient-poor soils of the region...|$|R
40|$|Tree {{clearing}} is {{a topical}} issue the world over. In Queensland, the {{high rates of}} clearing in the past were mainly to increase pasture production. The present research evaluates the impact of clearing on some soil biological properties, i. e. total soil respiration, root respiration, microbial respiration, and microbial biomass (C and N), and the response of soil respiration to change in temperature. In-field and laboratory (polyhouse) experiments were undertaken. For in-field studies, paired cleared and <b>uncleared</b> pasture plots were selected to represent three major tree communities of the region, i. e. Eucalyptus populnea, E. melanophloia, and Acacia harpophylla. The cleared sites were chosen to represent three different time-since-clearing durations (5, 11 - 13, and 33 years; n= 18 for cleared and <b>uncleared</b> plots) to determine the temporal impact of clearing on soil biological properties. Experiments were conducted in the polyhouse to study in detail the response of soil respiration to changes in soil temperature and soil moisture, and to complement in-field studies for estimating root respiration. The average rate of CO 2 emission was 964 g CO 2 /m 2 /yr, with no significant difference (P< 0. 05) among cleared and <b>uncleared</b> sites. Microbial respiration and microbial biomass were greater at <b>uncleared</b> compared with those at cleared sites. The Q 10 -value of 1. 42 (measured for different seasons in a year) for in-field measurements suggested a small response of soil respiration to soil temperature, possibly due to the limited availability of soil moisture and/or organic matter. However, results from the polyhouse experiment suggested greater sensitivity of root respiration to temperature change than for total soil respiration. Since root biomass (herbaceous roots) was greater at the cleared than at <b>uncleared</b> sites, and root respiration increased {{with an increase in}} temperature, we speculate that with rising ambient temperature and consequently soil temperature, total soil respiration in cleared pastures will increase at a faster rate than that in <b>uncleared</b> pastures...|$|R

5|$|Foliot {{was later}} named Archdeacon of Oxford in the Lincoln diocese, {{sometime}} before 1 October 1151, owing the appointment to Chesney.

Foliot served as a clerk for Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury, witnessing three documents for Becket during the period 1162–1164.|$|E

40|$|Credit Default Swaps (CDS) {{have been}} widely criticized for {{exacerbating}} losses during the recent financial crisis. Accordingly, a reorganization of the CDS market is a primary goal of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act seeks to mitigate systemic risk by moving more trades onto central clearinghouses. In this Comment, I argue that the various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act related to central clearing might actually undermine the law 2 ̆ 7 s objectives. I focus on the penal rules governing <b>uncleared</b> CDS. These regulations are meant {{to account for the}} supposedly greater risk of <b>uncleared</b> trades and to encourage the use of clearinghouses. In actuality, the bifurcated treatment of cleared versus <b>uncleared</b> CDS creates incentives for banks to clear as many types of CDS as possible, including instruments with features that render them unsuitable for central clearing. As an alternative policy, I recommend that regulators require banks to move all CDS dealing activities to separately capitalized affiliates. Regulators should recognize that CDS, cleared or <b>uncleared,</b> generate significant systemic risk. By eliminating the implied government backstop, banks will internalize the full social costs of CDS trading. Insofar as clearinghouses effectively reduce counterparty risk for certain transactions, participants will be motivated to clear, rather than simply shifting activities to the trading venue with the most advantageous regulatory treatment...|$|R
