60|$|Upon the {{departure}} of the enemy our magnanimous ancestors took full six months to recover their wind, having been exceedingly discomposed by the consternation and hurry of affairs. They then called a council of safety to smoke over the state of the provinces. At this council presided one Oloffe Van Kortlandt, who had originally been one of a set of peripatetic philosophers who passed much of their time sunning themselves {{on the side of the}} great canal of Amsterdam in Holland; enjoying, like Diogenes, a free and <b>unencumbered</b> <b>estate</b> in sunshine. His name Kortlandt (Shortland or Lackland) was supposed, like that of the illustrious Jean Sansterre, to indicate that he had no land; but he insisted, on the contrary, that he had great landed estates somewhere in Terra Incognita; and he had come out to the new world to look after them.|$|E

50|$|Rai Sarabjit Singh (1853-1910) was {{the ruler}} of Bhadri state of Oudh, belongs from Bisen family, succeeded on 15 February 1878 {{after the death of}} the late Rai Jagat Bahadur Singh.He {{received}} the hereditary title of Rai from the British government in November 1879. His property was taken under the management of the Court of Wards in 1867, on account of minority and indebtedness of the owner, and released in 1878.

50|$|Rai Daljit Singh (around 1798) was {{ruler of}} Bhadri of Bisen clan of Rajput, succeeded his father Rai Jit Singh. In 1798 the Nazim Mirza Jan visited Bhadri; he {{questioned}} the Rai Daljit Singh about his revenue, {{with a view}} to revision, and a quarrel ensued, in which the Rai Daljit Singh was killed. Later his son, Rai Zalim Singh, was thrown into prison in 1810 at Lucknow for non payment of the revenue and the property was taken under direct management The Bhadri taluqa was well managed by Sarabjit Singh, who left it practically <b>unencumbered.</b> Later <b>estate</b> was ruled by Rai Krishna Pratap Singh.|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{interest}} {{to be used for}} calculations in forestry under Danish conditions (3 per cent) has beeen determined as the long-term effective first mortgage rate (4 $ per cent) less the long-term average inflation (1 per cent) and the average annual relative rise in prices of forest products (J per cent). A comparison shows that agriculture pays a real net return of about 3 per cent (about 3 ^ per cent for larger farms). A comparison with the profit on shares seems to show that, according to Danish investigations, these yield a real profit of about 4 per cent. The rate {{of interest}} in forestry—a very safe type of investment—which we have estimated to be about 3 per cent of the market value, seems on the whole to fit well into the general real return level in this country. Similarly the average real interest cost of second mortgage loans has been investigated and proved to be about 4 per cent. For forest owners having bank loans secured by third mortgage, the real interest cost of these is presumably 5 per cent or more, but varies from person to person. A figure shows real interest costs at various degrees of indebtedness. The majority of Danish forests have a {{rate of interest}} of about 3 per cent, or some-times less (this applies to some <b>unencumbered</b> <b>estates).</b> So far, only few larger forests have a rate of interest of about 4 per cent. A rate of 5 per cent or more is mainly seen in very small forests...|$|R

Rai Jagat Bahadur Singh also died without issue, and adopted Rai Sarabjit Singh, who {{received}} the hereditary title of Rai from the British government in November 1879. His property was taken under {{the management of the}} Court of Wards in 1867, on account of minority and indebtedness of the owner, and released in 1878.

5000|$|The City of Sullivan {{has three}} TIFs (Tax Increment Financing Districts)." [...] TIF funds are {{reserved}} for areas that are [...] "blighted" [...] or {{in danger of becoming}} blighted. In 2010, the City of Sullivan issued $8.3 million in bonds by pledging previously <b>unencumbered</b> real <b>estate</b> increment generated annually by the City's three TIF districts. Recipients of TIF funds in 2013 were reported in the City of Sullivan's Resolution 13-E, which is available online. An auditor from West & Company, L.L.C. stated before the Sullivan City Council on January 28, 2013 that revenue that the City of Sullivan receives from the State of Illinois that is designated as TIF sales tax will be used to pay off these (Build America) bonds. The audit evaluated the City of Sullivan's current financial condition as [...] "stable to sound," [...] meaning that it is able to meet its obligations on a daily basis, but that it does not have much room for error in financial decisions. An auditor addressing the Sullivan City Council on January 7, 2014, noted that the City received its final quarterly TIF District 1 Sales Tax Payment from the State of Illinois, in June 2013; this means that the $400,000 to $500,000 in TIF funds that the Sullivan was receiving annually for TIF Funds will no longer be available for TIF projects, and now must go directly into the city's general fund.|$|R
6000|$|The {{reader will}} be {{surprised}} to hear two things. My engagement with {{the daughter of a}} poor clergyman has produced great scandal among the anti-renters, they who so loudly decry aristocracy! The objection is that the match is not equal! That equality which is the consequence of social position, connections, education and similarity of habits, thoughts, and, if you will, prejudices, is all thrown away on these persons. They have no notion of its existence; but they can very well understand that the owner of an <b>unencumbered</b> and handsome <b>estate</b> is richer than the heiress of a poor divine, who can just make the year meet on $500 per annum. I let them grumble, as I know they must and will find fault with something connected with myself, until they have got away my land, or are satisfied it is not to be had. As for Opportunity, I have been assured that she threatens to sue me for a [...] "breach of promise;" [...] nor should I be at all surprised were she actually to make the attempt. It is by no means unusual, when a person sets his or her whole soul on a particular object, to imagine circumstances favorable to his or her views, which never had an existence; and Opportunity may fancy that what I have heard has been [...] "the buzzing in her own ear." [...] Then the quackery of Legislatures has set the ladies at work in earnest, and he will soon be a fortunate youth who can pass through his days of celibacy without some desperate assault, legal or moral, from the other sex. Besides, nothing can be out of the way, when it is found that the more popular and most numerous branch of the Legislature of New York really believes it can evade that solemn provision of the Constitution of the United States, which says [...] "no State shall pass any law impairing the obligations of contracts," [...] by enacting, as they can regulate the statute of descent, that whenever a landlord dies, the tenant, by applying to the chancellor, can have his leasehold tenure converted into a mortgage, on discharging which the land will be his, unencumbered! We have heard of a [...] "thimble-rig administration" [...] in England, and really that industrious nation seems to have exported the breed to this country. How many of those who voted for such a law will like to see the ayes and noes on the journals of the Assembly ten years hence? If there should be one such man left in the State, he will be an object of humane commiseration. We have had many efforts at legislative chicanery, and some that have been tolerably clever, but this is a palpable experiment in the same way, made for a reason that everybody understands, that has not even the negative merit of ingenuity. Our own courts will probably disregard it, should the Senate even concur; and as for those of the United States, they will, out of all doubt, treat it as it ought to be treated, and brand it with ignominy. The next step will be to pass a law regulating descents, as it is called, under the provisions of which the debtors of the deceased can meet his obligations with a coin technically called [...] "puppies." ...|$|R
