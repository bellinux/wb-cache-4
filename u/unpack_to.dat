6000|$|Mother took {{a week to}} pack, and <b>unpack,</b> <b>to</b> go panting down-stairs to {{the corner}} drug-store for new tubes of tooth-paste and a presentable sponge, to remend all that was remendable, to press Father's flappy, shapeless little {{trousers}} with the family flat-iron, to worry over whether she should take the rose-pink or the daffodil-yellow wrapper--which had both faded to approximately the same shade of gray, but which were to her trusting mind still interestingly different. Each year she had to impress Mrs. Tubbs of West Skipsit with new metropolitan finery, and this year Father had no peace nor comfort in the ménage till she had selected a smart new hat, incredibly small and close and sinking coyly down over her ear. He was only a man folk, {{he was in the}} way, incapable of understanding this problem of fashion, and Mother almost slapped him one evening for suggesting that it [...] "wouldn't make such a gosh-awful lot of difference if she didn't find some new fad to impress Sister Tubbs." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explore how film {{directors}} comprehend an actor’s performance while it is being created by the actor on set, as the camera is rolling. The position of screen acting within film scholarship is discussed {{to draw attention to}} just how recently film scholars have shifted their position regarding the actor’s contribution to the film. This is followed by an examination of the valuable insights into comprehending actor performance that new discoveries in neuroscience and cognitive science are uncovering, along with first-hand research obtained from interviews with Australian directors and actors. By seeking to <b>unpack</b> <b>to</b> a more conscious level what many people (including highly regarded directors), believe to be predominantly an intuitive activity, we may better understand what is actually taking place during that moment on a film set when the director is comprehending the work of the actor as it is being created. This paper argues that it is largely through acute perception, which is linked to an ever-expanding body of both conscious and tacit knowledge regarding actor performance, rather than merely instinct or intuition, that the director is able to comprehend the actor’s performance...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{approach}} which can detect packed malware variants without <b>unpacking.</b> <b>To</b> achieve our approach, we propose a sensitive system call based principal component initialized multi-layers neural networks, which can highly perform well in terms of classification accuracy and speed. Theoretical analysis and real-life experimental results show that our packed malware variants detection technique is comparable with the the state-of-art methods.|$|R

50|$|Several {{microprocessor}} families offer limited decimal support. For example, the 80x86 {{family of}} microprocessors provide instructions to convert one-byte BCD numbers (packed and <b>unpacked)</b> <b>to</b> binary format {{before or after}} arithmetic operations. These operations were not extended to wider formats and hence are now slower than using 32-bit or wider BCD 'tricks' to compute in BCD (see http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~jones/bcd/bcd.html). The x87 FPU has instructions to convert 10-byte (18 decimal digits) packed decimal data, although it then operates on them as floating-point numbers.|$|R

50|$|Since {{digital signals}} that are {{broadcast}} {{over the air}} are compressed (packed smaller), once they are received by the ATSC tuner, these compressed packets of digital data are then decompressed (<b>unpacked</b> <b>to</b> their original size). The ATSC system uses lossy compression, so while the decompressed data size {{is the same as}} the original compressed data size, the data produced is not exactly the same as the original data fed into the system at the transmitting site, but it is close enough that most people don't notice the difference.|$|R
40|$|Recognising the {{limitations}} of existing conceptualisations of path dependence, this article advances a ‘path-interdependent’ approach to account for endogenous policy change by incorporating a more central role for agency through learning and problem-solving mechanisms. Additionally, it argues that monolithic conceptualisations of institutions should be <b>unpacked</b> <b>to</b> reveal their configurative elements. In doing so, attention is drawn {{to the way in}} which intra-policy dynamics may generate pressures for change and to the possibility for the mutual existence and co-evolution of continuity and change. These arguments are illustrated empirically through two cases of radical reform in European Union (EU)) cohesion policy...|$|R

40|$|Learning {{analytics}} (LA) are summaries, visualizations, {{and analyses}} of student data that could improve learning in multiple ways, for example by supporting teachers. However, not much research is available yet concerning how LA may support teachers to diagnose student progress and to intervene during student learning activities. There is evidence for two mechanisms, namely that LA tools can 1) aggregate {{information to a}} manageable level and thereby lower information load, and 2) increase the teacher’s confidence and specificity concerning the diagnosis of the situation. By means of micro-analytic study of teachers’ real-time use of LA tools, these mechanisms are further <b>unpacked</b> <b>to</b> answer the question how the mechanism...|$|R

50|$|Silent {{mutations}} {{alter the}} secondary structure of mRNA. mRNA has a secondary structure {{that is not}} necessarily linear like that of DNA, thus the shape that accompanies complementary bonding in the structure can have significant effects. For example, if the mRNA molecule is relatively unstable, then it can be rapidly degraded by enzymes in the cytoplasm. If the RNA molecule is highly stable, and the complementary bonds are strong and resistant <b>to</b> <b>unpacking</b> prior <b>to</b> translation, then the gene may be underexpressed.

40|$|Our paper {{examines}} the representational nature of number lines {{as they are}} used in instructional tasks. The examination is informed by a so-called mathedidactical analysis of the number line as a tool used in teaching students mathematics. This analysis led to the identification {{of a family of}} number line models, based on visual aspects of number lines each reflecting different forms and functions. In the article, number line tasks are <b>unpacked</b> <b>to</b> illustrate the visual representational components of particular number line models. We illuminate how these components of the models provide tools to locate whole numbers and integers, operate with them, and facilitate reasoning and understanding of underlying mathematical concepts. © 2013 FIZ Karlsruhe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMalware writers {{often use}} packing {{technique}} to hide malicious payload. A number of dynamic unpacking tools are. designed {{in order to}} identify and extract the hidden code in the packed malware. However, such unpacking methods. are all based on a highly controlled environment that is vulnerable to various anti-unpacking techniques. If execution. environment is suspicious, malwares may stay inactive for a long time or stop execution immediately to evade. detection. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach that automatically reasons about the environment requirements. imposed by malware, then directs a <b>unpacking</b> tool <b>to</b> change the controlled environment to extract the hide code at. the new environment. The experimental results show that our approach significantly increases the resilience of the. traditional <b>unpacking</b> tools <b>to</b> environment-sensitive malware...|$|R

Then we give concise definitions of semistrict monoidal 2 -categories and braided monoidal 2 -categories and show how these may be <b>unpacked</b> <b>to</b> give long explicit definitions similar to, but not quite the same as, those given by previously Kapranov and Voevodsky. Finally, we describe how to construct a semistrict braided monoidal 2 -category Z(C) as the “center” of a semistrict monoidal category C, in a manner analogous to the construction of a braided monoidal category as the center of a monoidal category. As a corollary this yields a strictification theorem for braided monoidal 2 -categories...|$|R

The passive counting of connective tissue boundaries is g 1 ven as an example to show that enumerative data may be biassed by {{the ratio of the}} width of the subject of measurement to the projected diameter of the photometer aperture. In a second example, the scanning stage is actively directed by the observer and is used to map the radial distribution of succinate dehydrogenase (SOH) activity in different histochemical types of muscle fibers. This is accomplished by the arbitrary fitting by the microcomputer of reference features (plumb line and corners) to the muscle fiber perimeter.
