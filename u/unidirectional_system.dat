40|$|Within the German energy transition, several {{challenges}} arise. Shifting {{electricity supply}} from a centralistic, <b>unidirectional</b> <b>system</b> towards a decentralized, bi-directional {{system with a}} significantly increased number of stakeholders and thus conflicting interests leads {{to a number of}} technical, political, social and economic debates. However, there is an overall agreement that the importance of distribution grid operation, decentralised energy generation and flexible generation technologies will be essential elements of future energy systems. This paper presents the concept of a new market role, the 9 ̆ 3 Decentralised Market Agent 9 ̆ 4 (DMA), which optimizes the system operation and expansion on distribution grid level. To do so, one of the potential flexibility technologies is Demand Side Management (DSM), which is analysed in more detail in this paper. With regard to the tasks and objective of the DMA, the requirements and potentials of DSM are discussed and evaluated qualitatively. Based on this, an analysis of applicable DSM measures in households as well as for an industrial consumer is conducted.

This type of communications between devices with minimal human intervention is referred to as Machine-to-machine (M 2 M) communications that can be applied to optimize resources and improve service delivery applications. Smart Grid is one of the M 2 M communications applications that is attaining more attention during recent years, because of its potential to change the complete energy ecosystem; going from a <b>unidirectional</b> <b>system</b> to a bidirectional one where customers will have {{an important role in the}} ecosystem. Depending on the country and its characteristics and situation, Smart Grid development can be very different. This article identifies commonalities and differences in Smart Grid communication development considering the current status in developed and developing countries. The process is done by evaluating the following techno-economic aspects: Technology development, Public initiatives, Regulator policies and Economic situation/Business perspective of the country. The article is concluded by showing that regulator policies regarding the level of liberalization in the energy market are a key element when defining business strategies and different stages of Smart Grid communications development has a critical influence in the definition of business models, as it defines the key activities, partners and value proposition for the business.

40|$|Living organisms, ecosystems, {{and social}} systems are {{examples}} of complex systems in which robustness against inclusion of new elements is an essential feature. A recently proposed simple model has revealed a general mechanism by which such systems can become robust against inclusion of elements with random interactions when the elements have a moderate number of links. This happens {{as a result of}} two opposing effects such that while the inclusion of elements with more interactions makes each individual element more robust against disturbances, it also increases the net impact of the loss of any element in the system. The interaction is, however, in many systems often intrinsically bidirectional like for mutual symbiosis, competition in ecology, and the action-reaction law of Newtonian mechanics, etc. This study reports the strong reinforcement effect of the bidirectionality of the interactions on the robustness of evolving systems. We show that the system with purely bidirectional interactions can grow with two-fold average degree, in comparison with the purely <b>unidirectional</b> <b>system.</b> This drastic shift of the transition point comes from the reinforcement of each node, not from a change in structure of the emergent system. For systems with partially bidirectional interactions we find that the area of the growing phase gets expanded. In the dense interaction regime, there exists an optimum proportion of bidirectional interactions for the growth rate at around $ 1 / 3 $. In the sparsely connected systems, small but finite fraction of bidirectional links can change the system's behaviour from non-growing to growing behaviour...|$|E

Retrospectively, patients with distal radius fractures were registered from the years 01 / 01 / 2005 to 31 / 12 / 2006 and then followed up 2 years after the procedure. 53 patients with multidirectional plates {{were found in the}} Ostalb University Hospital in Aalen and 31 patients with unidirectional plates in the Crailsheim Hospital. The patient sample of both hospitals was comparable. Fractures were classified according to the AO classification. The most common ones were found in both Hospitals C-type fractures. Results were evaluated using the DASH score as well as the Castaing score system. The average DASH value was 15 in the multidirectional group and 19. 5 points in the unidirectional group. 84. 9 % patients treated with multidirectional plates and 93. 5 % with unidirectional plates attained perfect to good results according to Castaing. The postoperative ROM range of motion of the wrist was very good in both groups. Even the evaluation of the control X-rays showed no major differences between the two groups. Complications after angular stable plate fixation were found to be higher in the multidirectional group with 27. 3 %, compared to 25. 8 % in the unidirectional group. All in all, the multidirectionality offered no significant advantages compared to the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>system.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} clinical outcome between the two plates.

40|$|Short range {{wireless}} {{data communication}} networks {{that are used}} for sport and health care are sometimes called Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) and they are located more or less on a person. Sole Integrated Gait Sensor (SIGS) is a research project in WBAN, where wireless pressure sensors are placed like soles in the shoes of persons with different kinds of deceases. The sensors can measure {{the pressure of the}} foot relative to the shoe i. e. the load of the two legs is measured. This information can be useful e. g. to not over or under load a leg after joint replacement or as a bio feedback system to help e. g. post stroke patients to avoid falling. The SIGS uses the ANT Protocol and radio specification. ANT uses the 2. 4 GHz ISM band and TDMA is used to share a single frequency. The scheduling of time slots is adaptive isochronous co-existence i. e. the scheduling is not static and each transmitter sends periodically but checks for interference with other traffic on the radio channel. In this <b>unidirectional</b> <b>system</b> sole sensors are masters (transmitters) and the WBAN server is the slave in ANT sense. The message rate is chosen as 8 Hz which is suitable for low power consumption. Hence in the SIGS system, it is necessary to synchronize {{the left and the right}} foot sensors because of low message rate. In our thesis, we found a method and developed a prototype to receive the time synchronized data in WBAN server from ANT wireless sensor nodes in SIGS system. For this thesis work, a hardware prototype design was developed. The USB and USART communication protocols were also implemented in the hardware prototype. The suitable method for time synchronization was implemented on the hardware prototype. The implemented method receives the sensor data, checks for the correct stream of data; add timestamp to the sensor data and transmit the data to the Linux WBAN server. The time slots allocation in the ANT protocol was found. Alternative solution for the time synchronization in ANT protocol was also provided.

40|$|The article {{investigates the}} effects of the main manifestations of the genetic system {{controlling}} the type and rate of wheat development – VRN (vernalization) at the level of an integrated system of plant organism in vivo and callus certain population of cells in vitro. The paper studies the system of allelic VRN genes, which determine the need or insensitivity Triticum aestivum L. to vernalization and predetermination process of callusogenesis by the present system in vitro. In the experiments the modern model system of nearly isogenic lines (NILs) of spring type was used. The NILs were created in genotypes of the winter varieties Myronivska 808 and Olvia. Molecular genetic analysis of allelic loci of VRN genes was carried out by PCR analysis on grains and secondary callus culture using five pairs of specific primers (Grain Gene Mass Wheat). In the course of the experiments, {{it was found that the}} genetic system controlling the wheat rate determined the frequency of callusogenesis. However, the studied genetic system did not affect the morphological characteristics of primary and secondary callus tissue. In both hexaploid wheat cultivars the maximum frequency of callusogenesis appeared to be characterized in the Vrn 2 isogenic line and the original variety, slowly developing and intensely accumulating vegetative mass in vivo. The minimal frequency of callusogenesis was determined in the VRN 1 and VRN 3 isogenic lines, characterized by the rapid development of vegetation. The callus was derived from immature wheat embryos by morphological features analysis. Calluses with low water content, mainly, amorphous, compact, transparent, white or with yellowish tint were identified. Using PCR analysis, in grains in vivo and in the callus culture in vitro the almost identical allelic status of VRN genes was revealed. In grains and callus of Vrn 1 isogenic lines of both wheat varieties the presence of a dominant gene VRN A 1 and recessive VRN B 1 and VRN D 1 was detected, whereas in VRN 2 – a dominant gene VRN B 1 and recessive VRN A 1 and VRN D 1. However, the dominant allele VRN D 1 in the studied NILs was detected. Therefore, in varieties of grains and callus cultures all genes are represented only by recessive alleles VRN A 1, VRN B 1 and VRN D 1. Differences were found in the callus culture of VRN 3 isogenic line of Myronivska 808 on the allelic state of theVRN B 1 gene. The obtained results could be associated with genomic reconstructions during callusogenesis induction. Our studies indicate the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>system</b> of VRN genes functioning, which appears to be the main control system of type and rate of soft wheat development in the system in vivo and in vitro. This allows us to assume the role of the VRN genetic system in the determination of callusogenesis, and also the adequacy of the functioning of the system in vitro processes, determining the system of integration of plants. Thus, our study confirms that the callus tissues cells of higher plants are able to preserve the cells properties of the whole organism along with the acquisition of new specific properties. Moreover, the culture in vitro is an adequate system for the study of the plant organism properties as a system...|$|E

In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I examine the effect of inflammation directly on the barrier properties of the initial lymphatics in the rat spinotrapezius muscle. I hypothesize that fluid that travels from the interstitium into the initial lymphatics must travel through the primary valves, a <b>unidirectional</b> valve <b>system</b> that allows fluid to flow into the lymphatics, but not back out. I determine that a particle with diameter 0. 5 [mu]m is able to pass through the primary valves, but particles with diameter 0. 8 [mu]m and larger are unable to. Acute inflammation does not change this property, although it does allow fluid to escape back into the interstitium at a rate greater than that in healthy animals. This suggests that during inflammation the initial lymphatics are compromised and the primary valves do not function as a <b>unidirectional</b> valve <b>system.</b> In addition, I hypothesize that the lymphatic system is responsible for removing toxic peptides and lipids from the interstitium to limit their damage to the tissue.
