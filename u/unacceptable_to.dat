5|$|Because of the {{destruction}} required and cost involved in the proposed plans {{the majority of the}} Ringway Plans had stagnated by 1973. However, local Members of Parliament (MPs), including Toby Jessel, MP for Twickenham, complained the project should not be cancelled, as the existing South Circular was completely <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> traffic. The plans were scrapped after Labour won the GLC election that year.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{publication}} of a 2016 interdepartmental report into the issue of mental health in the justice system, McEntee stated her belief that it is <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> send people with mental health issues to prison, and that {{this is an issue that}} must be tackled by the government. She also believes the government should address concerns about the mental health of unemployed young people.|$|E

5|$|Frequent {{and often}} {{contradictory}} directives were issued by Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, Bernhard Rust of the Reichserziehungsministerium (Ministry of Education) {{and various other}} agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools. Books deemed <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> the regime were removed from school libraries. Indoctrination in National Socialist thought was made compulsory in January 1934. Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated {{from the age of}} 12 at Adolf Hitler Schools for primary education and National Political Institutes of Education for secondary education. Detailed National Socialist indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at Order Castles.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{spent the}} 1954–1955 {{academic}} {{year as a}} Fulbright Visiting Fellow at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. At the time, the Cambridge economics faculty was divided into a Keynesian majority (including Joan Robinson and Richard Kahn) and an anti-Keynesian minority (headed by Dennis Robertson). Friedman speculated that {{he was invited to}} the fellowship, because his views were <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> both of the Cambridge factions. Later his weekly columns for Newsweek magazine (1966–84) were well read and increasingly influential among political and business people. From 1968 to 1978, he and Paul Samuelson participated in the Economics Cassette Series, a biweekly subscription series where the economist would discuss the days' issues for about a half-hour at a time.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the {{political}} climate in Italy (under Mussolini) became <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> Escher. He {{had no interest in}} politics, finding it impossible to involve himself with any ideals other than the expressions of his own concepts through his own particular medium, but he was averse to fanaticism and hypocrisy. When his eldest son, George, was forced at the age of nine to wear a Ballila uniform in school, the family left Italy and moved to Château-d'Œx, Switzerland, where they remained for two years.|$|E

5|$|In 1960 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, {{insisted on}} retiring. Macmillan agreed with Heathcoat-Amory {{that the best}} {{successor}} at the Treasury would be the current Foreign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd. In terms of ability and experience the obvious candidate to take over from Lloyd at the Foreign Office was Home, but by 1960 there was an expectation that the Foreign Secretary would {{be a member of}} the House of Commons. The post had not been held by a peer since Lord Halifax in 1938–40; Eden had wished to appoint Salisbury in 1955, but concluded that it would be <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> the Commons.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, war-weariness had set {{in among}} the Venetians, who {{suffered}} from the disruption in trade. Peace feelers {{were sent to the}} Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> the Republic. With {{the end of the war}} between France and Spain however, the Venetians became encouraged, hoping to receive increased assistance in money and men, especially from the French, whose traditionally good relations with the Porte had soured of late.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Commissioner Perry had {{put forward}} three {{options for the}} future of the mounted police: the force could be absorbed into the Canadian military; the remit of the force could be reduced to simply {{policing}} the far north; or the force could be assigned a much wider role in public and secret policing across the whole of Canada. Perry promoted the third option and Arthur Meighen, the acting Minister for Justice, therefore proposed merging the mounted police and the Dominion Police, placing them under Perry's command. This idea was turned down by Borden, who believed, incorrectly, that the merger would be <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> Perry, whom he thought still wanted a military future for the force.|$|E

5|$|On 28 June 1914, Bosnian Serb student Gavrilo Princip assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. The {{assassination}} {{precipitated the}} July Crisis, which led Austria-Hungary {{to issue an}} ultimatum to Serbia on 23 July on suspicion that the assassination had been planned in Belgrade. The Austro-Hungarian government made the ultimatum intentionally <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> Serbia, and it was indeed rejected. The Austro-Hungarians declared war on Serbia on 28 July and that same day the Serbs destroyed all bridges on the Sava and Danube rivers {{in order to prevent}} the Austro-Hungarians from using them during any future invasion. Belgrade was shelled the following day, marking the beginning of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Patients {{and their}} guardians must be apprised of any serious risks {{and the common}} side effects of pain treatments. What {{appears to be an}} {{obviously}} acceptable risk or harm to a professional may be <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> the person who has to undertake that risk or experience the side effect. For instance, people who experience pain on movement may be willing to forgo strong opioids in order to enjoy alertness during their painless periods, whereas others would choose around-the-clock sedation so as to remain pain-free. The care provider should not insist on treatment that someone rejects, and must not provide treatment that the provider believes is more harmful or riskier than the possible benefits can justify.|$|E
5|$|Richard's posthumous {{reputation}} {{has been}} shaped {{to a large extent}} by William Shakespeare, whose play Richard II portrayed Richard's misrule and his deposition by Bolingbroke as responsible for the 15th-century Wars of the Roses. Modern historians do not accept this interpretation, while not exonerating Richard from responsibility for his own deposition. While probably not insane, as historians of the 19th and 20th centuries believed, he may have had what psychologists today identify as a personality disorder, particularly manifesting itself towards the end of his reign. Most authorities agree that, even though his policies were not unprecedented or entirely unrealistic, the way in which he carried them out was <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> the political establishment, and this led to his downfall.|$|E
30|$|As {{part of the}} {{requirements}} under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), an environmental risk assessment was conducted using EUSES software {{to determine if the}} proposed uses of PSOA posed an <b>unacceptable</b> risk <b>to</b> aqueous environments. All risk characterization ratios (RCRs), which are ratios of the PNEC to the estimated environmental concentration (i.e., estimated environmental concentration/PNEC), were < 0.01, indicating no <b>unacceptable</b> risk <b>to</b> the environment [4]. Therefore, despite notable acute aquatic hazards for PSOA when considering the acute toxicity values, no <b>unacceptable</b> risk <b>to</b> the aqueous environment is anticipated based on its use and other factors. This aligns with the qualitative assessment that PSOA in industry wastewater effluent would be further treated and diluted via a municipal waste water treatment facility prior to release to aquatic environments. Such treatment and dilution is anticipated to render PSOA below concentrations that pose a risk to native fauna or flora.|$|R

5|$|Unlike Love's Last Shift, {{which never}} again {{performed}} after the 1690s, The Relapse has retained its audience appeal. In the 18th century, however, its tolerant attitude towards actual and attempted adultery gradually became <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> public opinion, {{and the original}} play was for a century replaced on the stage by Sheridan's moralised version A Trip to Scarborough (1777). On the modern stage, The Relapse has been established {{as one of the}} most popular Restoration comedies, valued for Vanbrugh's light, throwaway wit and the consummate acting part of Lord Foppington, a burlesque character with a dark side.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the tally}} of Cardinal Charles de Lorraine-Guise {{in his letter}} to Henry II, once the twelve {{participating}} French cardinals reached Rome, twenty-three cardinals were aligned in the French faction, twenty-two in the Imperial faction, and four neutral; thus Guise judged it impossible for either faction to garner the necessary two-thirds simply by persuading neutral cardinals. In addition, eleven Italian cardinals whom Guise counted among the French faction were only likely to vote for a fellow Italian, making the three favorites of Henry IILouis de Bourbon de Vendôme, Jean de Lorraine, and Georges d'Amboiseunfeasible. The non-French cardinal protector of France, d'Este, would then have been the choice of Henry II; Catherine de' Medici preferred her cousin Giovanni Salviati, who was extremely <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> the Imperial faction and the Farnese.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1936, the {{management}} of the New York Philharmonic was confronted with a problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. Wilhelm Furtwängler had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the Nazi government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame {{the management of the}} orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors Igor Stravinsky, Georges Enescu and Carlos Chávez, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by Artur Rodziński of the Cleveland Orchestra, for eight weeks.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{attended}} the local Cap Coch school, leaving {{at the age}} of 12, as was usual at that time, to begin work in the Cwmpennar coal mine. He remained there until the mine was exhausted in 1905, when he moved to Mountain Ash to work at Nixon's Navigation Colliery. His ambition and intelligence were quickly recognised by his superiors, and he was encouraged to study mining engineering, at first locally in Aberdare and, in 1907, at the Royal College of Science in London. In 1908, with sponsorship from the Brecon Memorial College, he passed his matriculation and began studying for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree at University College, Cardiff, with a view thereafter to entering the nonconformist ministry. However, Davies's religious beliefs were influenced by R. J. Campbell, a noted preacher who rejected much traditional Christian teaching and asserted that socialism was the practical expression of Christianity. Davies's association with such supposed heresies was <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> the Brecon college, which withdrew its financial support.|$|E
5|$|Following Desai's {{resignation}} {{and the fall}} of the Janata government headed by him, Reddy appointed Charan Singh as Prime Minister. This was on the condition that he should prove his majority {{on the floor of the}} House before the end of August. Singh was sworn in on 28 July 1979 but never faced Parliament to prove his majority when Reddy convened it on 20 August. Reddy had appointed him Prime Minister since he had produced a letter claiming to have a parliamentary majority with the support of the opposition Congress Party led by his rival, the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In return for her support, Gandhi demanded that a law establishing special courts to try her and her son Sanjay Gandhi be repealed – a proposition that was <b>unacceptable</b> <b>to</b> Charan Singh. Gandhi therefore withdrew her support, forcing Singh to resign. His government lasted 24 days and he never faced Parliament. The convention of appointing a Prime Minister in a hung House but with conditions on time to prove majority was later adopted by President R Venkataraman.|$|E
