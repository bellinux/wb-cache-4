5|$|During its evolution, {{the metric}} system has adopted many <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure. The {{introduction}} of SI rationalised both {{the way in}} which <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure were defined and also the list of units in use. These are now catalogued in the official SI Brochure. The table below lists the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure in this catalogue and shows the conversion factors connecting them with the equivalent units that were in use {{on the eve of the}} adoption of SI.|$|E
5|$|In 1881 first International Electrical Congress {{adopted the}} BAAS {{recommendations}} on electrical units, {{followed by a}} series of congresses in which further <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure were defined and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) was set up with the specific task of overseeing electrical <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure. This was followed by the International Congress of Radiology (ISR) who, at their inaugural meeting in 1926, initiated the definition of radiological-related <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure.|$|E
5|$|Non-SI units whose {{values in}} SI units must be {{obtained}} experimentally (Table 7).

5000|$|In some contexts, {{the term}} [...] "pound" [...] is used almost {{exclusively}} {{to refer to the}} <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> force and not the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> mass. In those applications, the preferred <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> mass is the slug, i.e. lbf·s2/ft. In other contexts, the unit [...] "pound" [...] refers to a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> mass. The international standard symbol for the pound as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> mass is lb.|$|R
50|$|Benchmarking is used {{to measure}} {{performance}} using a specific indicator (cost per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> measure, productivity per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> measure, cycle time <b>of</b> x per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> measure or defects per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> measure) resulting in a metric of performance that is then compared to others.|$|R

50|$|The natural {{relation}} between these units are clearly, that a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> electromotive force between two points of a conductor {{separated by a}} <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> resistance shall produce unit current, and that this current in a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> time convey a <b>unit</b> quantity <b>of</b> electricity.|$|R

5|$|After this, the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> I Anzac Corps {{returned}} to the Somme, to relieve <b>units</b> <b>of</b> the Fourth Army, which had managed to push their lines to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion {{was not involved in}} any major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade—specifically the 1st Battalion with support from the 3rd—put in an attack on a salient that had developed in the front line north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid exceptionally muddy conditions.|$|E
50|$|Skojec was {{a medieval}} central European <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> account {{as well as}} a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> mass. It was also used as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> currency. 1 skojec was equal to 1/24 of a grzywna.|$|R

5|$|Among the American {{units that}} {{reinforced}} the Pusan Perimeter {{as soon as}} they could arrive were the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, the 7th Infantry Division, and the 25th Infantry Divisions, along with other <b>units</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. Eighth Army that provided logistical, medical, and intelligence support. Advance <b>units</b> <b>of</b> the 24th Infantry Division were badly defeated in the Battle of Osan on July 5 in the first encounter between American and North Korean troops.

5|$|Areas annexed by France {{during the}} Napoleonic era {{were the first}} to inherit the metric system. In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure, but defined them in terms of metric units – for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary <b>units</b> <b>of</b> measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact.|$|E
5|$|Assume {{that there}} are c <b>units</b> <b>of</b> coconut and f <b>units</b> <b>of</b> fish {{available}} for consumption in the Crusoe Friday economy. Given this endowment bundle (c,f), the Pareto efficient bundle can be determined at the mutual tangency of Crusoe's and Friday's indifference curves in the Edgeworth box along the Pareto Set (Contract curve). These are the bundles at which Crusoe's and Friday's Marginal rate of substitution are equal.|$|E
50|$|The SI <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> {{velocity}} is m/s, and the SI <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> {{electric field}} is V/m. Therefore the SI <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> mobility is (m/s)/(V/m) = m2/(V·s). However, mobility {{is much more}} commonly expressed in cm2/(V·s) = 10−4 m2/(V·s).|$|R

5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions.

Since the SI <b>units</b> <b>of</b> mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the <b>units</b> <b>of</b> force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2.
