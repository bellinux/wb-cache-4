5|$|The Americans {{were still}} <b>unaware</b> <b>that</b> {{this was not}} the main British attack, in part due to the ferocity of the {{fighting}} and the number of British troops engaged.|$|E

5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are <b>unaware</b> <b>that</b> a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, <b>unaware</b> <b>that</b> the plants are illegal, they have not engaged in a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E
