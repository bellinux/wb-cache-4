40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) {{is a major}} {{etiologic}} agent of acute and chronic hepatitis, and end-stage liver disease. Establishment of HBV infection, progression to persistency and pathogenesis are determined by viral and cellular factors, some of which remain still <b>undefined.</b> <b>Key</b> steps of HBV life cycle e. g., transformation of genomic viral DNA into transcriptionally active episomal DNA (cccDNA) or transcription of viral mRNAs from cccDNA, {{take place in the}} nucleus of infected cells and strongly depend on enzymatic activities provided by cellular proteins. In this regard, DNA damage response (DDR) pathways and some DDR proteins are being recognized as important factors regulating the infection. On one hand, HBV highjacks specific DDR proteins to successfully complete some of the steps of its life cycle. On the other hand, HBV subverts DDR pathways to presumably create a cellular environment that favours its replication. Direct consequences of these interactions are: HBV DNA integration into host chromosomal DNA, and accumulation of mutations in host chromosomal DNA that could eventually trigger carcinogenic processes, which would explain in part the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronically infected patients. Unravelling the interactions that HBV establishes with DDR pathways might help identify new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{inhibitory}} receptor CTLA 4 has a {{key role}} in peripheral tolerance of T cells for both normal and tumor-associated antigens. Murine experiments suggested that block-ade of CTLA 4 might have antitumor activity and a clinical experience with the blocking antibody ipilimumab in patients with metastatic melanoma did show durable tumor regressions in some patients. Therefore, a phase II study of ipilimumab was conducted in patients with metastatic renal cell cancer with a primary end point of response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Two sequential cohorts received either 3 mg/kg followed by 1 mg/kg or all doses at 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks (with no intention of comparing cohort response rates). Major toxicities were enteritis and endocrine deficiencies of presumed autoimmune origin. One of 21 patients receiving the lower dose had a partial response. Five of 40 patients at the higher dose had partial responses (95 % confidence interval for cohort response rate 4 % to 27 %) and responses were seen in patients who had previously not responded to IL- 2. Thirty-three percent of patients experienced a grade III or IV immune-mediated toxicity. There was a highly significant association between autoimmune events (AEs) and tumor regression (response rate= 30 % with AE, 0 % without AE). CTLA 4 blockade with ipilimumab induces cancer regres-sion in some patients with metastatic clear cell renal cancer, even if they have not responded to other immunotherapies. These regressions are highly associated with other immune-mediated events of presumed autoimmune origin by mechanisms as yet <b>undefined.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: renal cancer, immunotherapy, CTLA- 4, ipilimumab, costimulatio...|$|E
40|$|Data {{sources for}} data {{integration}} often come with spurious schema definitions such as <b>undefined</b> foreign <b>key</b> constraints. Such metadata {{are important for}} querying the database and for database integration. We present our algorithm SPIDER (Single Pass Inclusion DEpendency Recognition) for detecting inclusion dependencies, as these are the automatically testable part of a foreign key constraint. For IND detection all pairs of attributes must be tested. SPIDER solves this task very efficiently by testing all attribute pairs in parallel. It analyzes a 2 GB database in ∼ 20 min and a 21 GB database in ∼ 4 h. 1. Schema Discovery for Data Integration In large integration projects one is often confronted with undocumented data sources. One important schema informatio...|$|R
40|$|The roles {{played by}} {{specific}} transcription factors during {{the regulation of}} early T cell development remain largely <b>undefined.</b> Several <b>key</b> genes induced during the primary checkpoint of T cell development, beta-selection, contain cAMP response element sites within their enhancer-promoter region that are regulated by CREB activation. In this study, we show that CREB is constitutively phosphorylated in the thymus, but not the spleen. We also show that CREB is activated downstream of the pre-TCR complex, and that the induction of CREB activity is regulated by protein kinase Calpha- and ERK-MAPK-mediated signals. We addressed {{the importance of this}} activation by expressing a naturally occurring inhibitor of CREB, inducible cAMP early repressor in wild-type fetal liver-derived lymphoid progenitor cells, and assessed their developmental potential. Fetal thymic organ cultures reconstituted with cells constitutively expressing inducible cAMP early repressor displayed a delay in generating CD 4 (+) CD 8 (+) thymocytes and a decrease in cellularity compared with control fetal thymic organ cultures. Taken together, our studies establish that CREB plays a central role in relaying proliferation and differentiation signals from the pre-TCR complex into the nucleus in developing thymocytes...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} {{multiplexing}} technologies {{has raised the}} possibility that disease states can be defined using discrete genomic and proteomic patterns or signatures. However this emerging area has been limited by the 'content problem', arising from the uncertainty of which molecules to focus on. The human cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens are expressed on cells of the human immune system (leukocytes) and on other cell types. These heterogeneous molecules perform a host of roles essential to immune function and to the physiology of other lineages. The 339 defined CD antigens and their as yet, <b>undefined</b> counterparts constitute <b>key</b> components of the expressed human cell surface proteome. We propose that CD antigen expression patterns will {{form the basis of}} a rational, discrete and generalized diagnostic and prognostic system. Furthermore, disease-specific CD antigen proteomic signatures {{are likely to be more}} robust than corresponding genomic signatures and will also help to identify molecular targets for therapeutic intervention...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{extensive}} testing, deployed software still crashes. Other than a stack trace, these crashes {{offer little}} guidance to developers, making them hard to reproduce and fix. This work seeks to ease error correction by providing diagnostic {{information about the}} origins of null pointer exceptions and <b>undefined</b> variables. The <b>key</b> idea is to use value piggybacking to record and report useful debugging information in undefined memory. For example, instead of storing zero at a null store, store the origin program location, then correctly propagate this value through assignment statements and comparisons. If the program dereferences this value, report the origin. We describe, implement, and evaluate low-overhead value piggybacking for origin tracking of null pointer exceptions in deployed Java programs. We show that the reported origins add useful debugging information over a stack trace. We also describe, implement, and evaluate origin tracking of undefined values in C, C++, and Fortran programs in a memory error testing tool built with Valgrind. Together these implementations demonstrate that value piggybacking yields useful debugging information that can ease bug diagnosis and repair...|$|R
40|$|The Learning Event brought {{together}} colleagues from DFID, IDS, and the BRICS, and aimed {{to facilitate the}} sharing and learning of experiences in international development and policy, from and amongst the BRICS, and to set out a framework and broad parameters for engaging with the Rising Powers in the future. Presentations from DFID colleagues in the BRICS countries and London office showed that DFID policymakers are concerned with finding structures that allow the UK to address the challenges of working with new development actors – e. g. non-DAC donors and the BRICS countries – particularly in the post-Busan context, where the OECD Development Assistance Committee is seen to no longer hold the same sway. At the same time, DFID seeks to share its extensive experience and expertise as a donor and partner in technical development cooperation. How do we capitalise on the good relationships the UK has with other nations to implement development processes and action {{in a new and}} as yet <b>undefined</b> space? Two <b>key</b> points emerged during the week-long RPID workshop; and in particular during the DFID Learning Event: the need for the BRICS and other Rising Powers to manage inequality, and the need to systematise learning from their experiences in development and poverty reduction.
