5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally <b>upsetting</b> shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised {{to get out of bed}} and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{not fully}} {{fit for the}} final against Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after pulling his {{hamstring}} during the semi-final and playing {{with the aid of}} a painkiller injection.

The match ended 0–0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shootout, but his kick went over the cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title in one of the most <b>upsetting</b> moments in World Cup history.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} element of timber auctions is the upset—the minimum acceptable price, often called the reserve price in other auction environments. The <b>upset</b> has three main purposes: (1) to guarantee substantial revenue in auctions where competition is weak but the <b>upset</b> is met, (2) to limit the incentive for—and the impact of—collusive bidding, and (3) to provide useful information to bidders. We analyze {{the determination of the}} <b>upset</b> in British Columbia timber auctions. Setting the <b>upset</b> too high results in unsold stands and produces an upward bias in price if the competitive auctions are used to determine stumpage rates for non-auctioned timber. Setting the <b>upset</b> too low will reduce auction revenue and can create downward bias when the auction prices are used to calculate timber prices for non-auctioned stands. It is therefore important to set the <b>upset</b> at or near the optimal level. We present the theory of <b>upset</b> pricing and then apply that theory to the data available from historical timber auction sales in the BC Interior from 1999 to 2000. We find that an <b>upset</b> of about 70 percent (a rollback of 30 percent) maximizes auction revenues if the Ministry values timber at about 52 to 56 percent of its appraised value. This <b>upset</b> strikes the right balance between enhanced revenues and unsold timber stands. Given its importance, this <b>upset</b> calibration should be refined as additional data becomes available to assure that the <b>upset</b> is not set too high or too low...|$|R

40|$|Several histone methyltransferases are {{products}} of the MLL (Mixed Lineage Leukemia) family of genes. Although their mechanisms of action remain elusive, these genes are important because they are often deleted in patients with certain types of leukemia. In most cases, MLLs function catalytically via their SET domains, and their modifications of histones are important for chromatin structure and gene regulation. Here I report my analysis of the fly orthologue of MLL 5, <b>upSET.</b> In contrast to an earlier study, RNAi inhibition of <b>upSET</b> gene expression {{did not result in}} female sterility but was instead lethal. Although <b>UpSET</b> has a SET domain, down-regulation of <b>upSET</b> does not affect global H 3 K 4 -methyl levels. Unlike human MLL 5, the SET domain of <b>UpSET</b> {{does not appear to be}} an OGT substrate.
