5|$|The {{reality of}} defeat for Austria caused a reevaluation of {{internal}} divisions, local autonomy, and liberalism. The new North German Confederation {{had its own}} constitution, flag, and governmental and administrative structures. Through military victory, Prussia under Bismarck's influence had overcome Austria's active resistance {{to the idea of}} a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany.</b> Austria's influence over the German states may have been broken, but the war also splintered the spirit of pan-German unity: most of the German states resented Prussian power politics.|$|E
5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and elsewhere in Europe. In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E
5|$|Russia's western borders needed support, and fortresses existed or {{were being}} built in Latvia, Ukraine, and Belarus. The concept of {{building}} a fortress in Lithuania was discussed without result in 1796, but became a critical concern after the French invasion of Russia in 1812 led by Napoleon. The Grande Armée managed to cross the Nemunas near Kaunas on its drive towards Moscow without major difficulties. An increasingly <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> troubled the Empire {{during the second half}} of the century. A fortress in Kaunas would present an obstacle to attacks from the west, preventing further incursions towards Riga and Vilnius. In order to control the region, attackers would need to first neutralize Kaunas. Facing this possibility and evaluating the natural advantages of the city, Russian officials decided to construct a fortress there. After several delays, on July 7, 1879 Tsar Alexander II issued an edict ordering its construction.|$|E
5000|$|In Dorpat (Tartu), Wagner [...] "became a {{follower}} of Bismarck’s policy for <b>unifying</b> <b>Germany</b> under Prussian guidance. [...] Thus when German unification became realistic, Wagner {{wanted to go back}} to Germany proper - a general attitude of Baltic Germans.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph Maria Ernst Christian Wilhelm von Radowitz (February 6, 1797 [...] - [...] 25 December 1853) was a {{conservative}} Prussian statesman and general {{famous for his}} proposal to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany</b> under Prussian leadership {{by means of a}} negotiated agreement among the reigning German princes.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} {{the book}} it is {{revealed}} that the scheme's real intent was to discredit Remoziva and, by association, his siblings; his sister was playing a crucial part in talks to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany</b> and is forced to step down, causing the talks to collapse.|$|R
5|$|The widespread—mainly German—revolutions of 1848–49 sought {{unification}} of Germany {{under a single}} constitution. The revolutionaries pressured various state governments, particularly those in the Rhineland, for a parliamentary assembly that would {{have the responsibility to}} draft a constitution. Ultimately, many of the left-wing revolutionaries hoped this constitution would establish universal male suffrage, a permanent national parliament, and a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany,</b> possibly under the leadership of the Prussian king. This seemed to be the most logical course since Prussia was the strongest of the German states, as well as the largest in geographic size. Generally, center-right revolutionaries sought some kind of expanded suffrage within their states and potentially, a form of loose unification. Their pressure resulted in a variety of elections, based on different voting qualifications, such as the Prussian three-class franchise, which granted to some electoral groups—chiefly the wealthier, landed ones—greater representative power.|$|E
5|$|Victory in the Franco-Prussian War {{proved the}} {{capstone}} of the nationalist issue. In {{the first half}} of the 1860s, Austria and Prussia both contended to speak for the German states; both maintained they could support German interests abroad and protect German interests at home. In responding to the Schleswig-Holstein Question, they both proved equally diligent in doing so. After the victory over Austria in 1866, Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests, while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans. The victory over France in 1871 expanded Prussian hegemony in the German states to the international level. With the proclamation of Wilhelm as Kaiser, Prussia assumed the leadership of the new empire. The southern states became officially incorporated into a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> at the Treaty of Versailles of 1871 (signed 26 February 1871; later ratified in the Treaty of Frankfurt of 10 May 1871), which formally ended the war. Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state, he had not done it alone. Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein. The difficulties of the Vormärz, the impact of the 1848 liberals, the importance of von Roon's military reorganization, and von Moltke's strategic brilliance all played a part in political unification.|$|E
25|$|Subsequently, the Catholic {{states of}} South Germany that were {{previously}} bound to Prussia by a Zollverein (Customs Union), were officially incorporated the <b>Unified</b> <b>Germany</b> by the treaties of Versailles (26 February 1871) and Frankfurt (10 May 1871).|$|E
50|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Prussian Army fought {{successful}} wars against Denmark, Austria and France, allowing Prussia to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany</b> {{and to establish}} the German Empire in 1871. The Prussian Army formed {{the core of the}} Imperial German Army, which was replaced by the Reichswehr after World War I.|$|R

50|$|Otto von Bismarck {{utilized}} diversionary {{foreign policy}} often during {{his quest to}} <b>unify</b> <b>Germany.</b> These wars distracted the German people from the cultural difference that previously had prevented them from forming a single country. Bismarck used {{the success of the}} Franco-Prussian War in a similar fashion, officially establishing a German Empire following the siege of Paris.|$|R
25|$|Kiessling was {{a three-time}} East German {{champion}} and eight-time <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> national champion.

25|$|During {{the events}} leading up to the reunification of Germany in 1989–90, Grass argued for the {{continued}} separation of the two German states. He asserted that a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> would be likely to resume its role as belligerent nation-state. This argument estranged many Germans, who came to see him as too much of a moralizing figure.|$|E
25|$|Greece, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia {{qualified}} for the World Cup finals {{for the first time}}. Russia, competing independently for the first time after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, also qualified.

50|$|Game 2 is {{currently}} set in 1737 and Prussia and Great Britain {{are the main}} protagonists. Prussia holds the crown of the Holy Roman Empire and having defeated the Habpsburgs is attempting to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany.</b> Great Britain is allied to Prussia and is providing substantial subsidies. Prussia and France have clashed in the Rhineland and are at war.|$|R
5000|$|In Nazi Germany, the {{extremely}} large and spacious Fascist architecture was one way envisioned by Hitler to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany</b> by designing structures {{for what he}} described as [...] "mass experiences" [...] in which thousands of citizens could gather and take part in the patriotism of community events and listen to speeches made by Adolf Hitler and other Nazi party leaders.|$|R
50|$|Every Bismarck {{tower was}} {{intended}} as a beacon. Their braziers were to be lit on specified days in honour of the former chancellor to commemorate his achievement in <b>unifying</b> <b>Germany</b> in 1871. Though most towers included firing installations, plans for a nationwide beaconing failed and many local initiatives chose deviating designs. The architects of these towers included Wilhelm Kreis himself, who built 58 (47 to the Götterdämmerung design), and Bruno Schmitz.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the 1860s, Germany {{consisted}} of a multitude of principalities loosely bound together {{as members of the}} German Confederation. Bismarck used both diplomacy and the Prussian military to achieve unification, excluding Austria from a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany.</b> This made Prussia the most powerful and dominant component of the new Germany but also ensured that it remained authoritarian, rather than a liberal parliamentary regime.|$|E
25|$|Klinsmann also {{competed for}} the <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> {{team at the}} 1994 (five goals), and 1998 (three goals), World Cups. He became {{the first player to}} score at least three goals in three {{consecutive}} World Cups, later joined by Ronaldo of Brazil and compatriot Miroslav Klose. Klinsmann is currently the sixth-highest goalscorer at World Cups overall and the third-highest goalscorer for Germany in this competition, behind Klose (16 goals) and Gerd Müller (14).|$|E
25|$|Grimm was {{not made}} to be a politician, and also soon {{realized}} that the National Assembly was not getting anywhere (it was eventually dissolved without establishing a constitution), and so asked {{to be released from}} his duties and returned with relief to his former studies. His political career did not bloom into anything great, but it does illustrate his characteristics—his nationalism and his moralism. He believed that good would triumph in the Parliament, and pushed for human rights legislation just as he wished for a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the decades}} since {{the life of}} Bismarck, {{it has become an}} article of faith among German historians that Bismarck, himself, was the agent most {{responsible}} for the unification of Germany under the Prussian throne. This proposition, based on the [...] "Great Man Theory" [...] of history has been effectively challenged by recent historians. Importantly, German economic historian Helmut Böhme argued that the Zollverein customs union of northern Germany, not Bismarck, was the most important agent in <b>unifying</b> <b>Germany.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Prussian king {{refused to}} accept the {{imperial}} crown in April. But immediately, he tried to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany</b> by himself with a project that was later called 'Erfurt Union'. Austria was not supposed to become part of this version of Lesser Germany. Joseph von Radowitz, adviser to the Prussian king and actual leader of the project, tried to bind Austria and the Union together in a confederation. Austria rejected these attempts and made Prussia to give up its union plans in late 1850.|$|R

25|$|UEFA Euro 1992 {{was held}} in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who were only in the finals because UEFA did not allow Yugoslavia to {{participate}} {{as some of the}} states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other. The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals, then defeated world champion Germany 2–0. This was the first tournament in which a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> took part and also the first major tournament to have the players' names printed on their backs.|$|E
25|$|The Final Settlement Treaty ended Berlin's {{special status}} as a {{separate}} area under Four Power control. Under {{the terms of the}} treaty between West and East Germany, Berlin became the capital of a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany.</b> The Bundestag voted in June 1991 to make Berlin the seat of government. The Government of Germany asked the Allies to maintain a military presence in Berlin until the complete withdrawal of the Western Group of Forces (ex-Soviet) from the territory of the former East Germany. The Russian withdrawal was completed 31 August 1994. Ceremonies were held on 8 September 1994, to mark the final departure of Western Allied troops from Berlin.|$|E
25|$|In early February 1990, the Modrow government's {{proposal}} for a unified, neutral German state was rejected by Chancellor Kohl, who affirmed that a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> must {{be a member of}} NATO. Finally, on 18 March, the first free elections were held in East Germany, and a government led by Lothar de Maizière (CDU) was formed under a policy of expeditious unification with West Germany. The freely elected representatives of the Volkskammer held their first session on 5 April, and East Germany peacefully evolved from a communist to a democratically elected government. Free and secret communal (local) elections were held in the GDR on 6 May, and the CDU again won most of the available seats. On 1 July, the two German states entered into an economic and monetary union.|$|E
50|$|The War of Austrian Succession {{concluded}} with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). Maria Theresa and Austria survived nearly status quo ante bellum, sacrificing only {{the territory of}} Silesia, which Austria conceded to Prussia, and a few minor territorial losses to Spain in northern Italy. The loss of Silesia was, in great measure, a humiliating defeat for Austria's leadership of the German states within the Holy Roman Empire. This {{marked the beginning of}} the German dualism between Prussia and Austria, which would ultimately fuel German nationalism and the drive to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany</b> as a single entity.|$|R
50|$|In every speech {{given and}} shown in Triumph of the Will, pride {{is one of}} the major focuses. Hitler advocates to the people that they should not be {{satisfied}} with their current state and they should not be satisfied with the descent from power and greatness Germany has endured since World War I. The German people should believe in themselves and the movement that is occurring in Germany. Hitler promotes pride in Germany through the unification of it. <b>Unifying</b> <b>Germany</b> would force the elimination of what does not amount to the standards of the Nazi regime.|$|R
5000|$|Germany {{established}} a truth commission {{as a result}} of ongoing social tensions and problems affecting the country, in hopes {{that it would be a}} solution. Additionally, many Germans wanted answers about the SED dictatorship and the effects it had on [...] "the possibilities of political and moral rehabilitation of the victims." [...] The German government and parliament also felt strongly about the commission, believing that it was essential to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany.</b> Instead of retributive justice, the German Parliament opted for a focus on restorative justice because of ongoing social problems, aiming at non-violent reconciliation of those problems.|$|R
25|$|Bismarck's {{eight years}} in Frankfurt were marked by changes in his {{political}} opinions, detailed in the numerous lengthy memoranda, which he sent to his ministerial superiors in Berlin. No longer {{under the influence of}} his ultraconservative Prussian friends, Bismarck became less reactionary and more pragmatic. He became convinced that to countervail Austria's newly restored influence, Prussia would have to ally herself with other German states. As a result, he grew to be more accepting of the notion of a united German nation. He gradually came to believe that he and his fellow conservatives had {{to take the lead in}} the drive toward creating a unified nation in order to keep from being eclipsed. He also believed that the middle-class liberals wanted a <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> more than they wanted to break the grip of the traditional forces over society.|$|E
25|$|The {{demarcation}} line {{was based on}} a British proposal of 15January 1944. It envisaged a line of control along the borders of the old states or provinces of Mecklenburg, Saxony, Anhalt and Thuringia, which had ceased to exist as separate entities when the Prussians <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> in 1871; minor adjustments were made for practical reasons. The British would occupy the north-west of Germany, the United States the south, and the Soviet Union the east. Berlin was to be a separate joint zone of occupation deep inside the Soviet zone. The rationale was to give the Soviets a powerful incentive to see the war through to the end. It would give the British an occupation zone that was physically close to the UK and on the coast, making it easier to resupply it from the UK. It was also hoped that the old domination of Prussia would be undermined.|$|E
25|$|England's first {{match against}} the <b>unified</b> <b>Germany</b> since 1938 was a {{friendly}} in 1991 at Wembley, which the Germans won 1–0. Five years later, at the 1996 European Championships, England played a unified German {{team for the}} first time in a competitive fixture, when they met in the semi-finals. Like the 1966 World Cup, the tournament was being held in England, and the semi-final was played at Wembley Stadium. England's fans and team were confident, particularly after wins in the group stage over Scotland (2–0) and the Netherlands (4–1) and their first ever penalty shoot-out victory, over Spain, in the quarter-finals. So vivid were the memories of 1966 for England fans that a media clamour ensued for England to wear red jerseys, instead of the unfamiliar-looking grey away kit that had been launched earlier that year (as England had not submitted details of any red kit to UEFA before the tournament, this was never going to be permitted, and England did wear grey).|$|E
50|$|The Corps soon saw {{themselves}} heavily {{confronted by the}} Burschenschaft, which was first founded in 1815. Sparked by the nationalist sentiment after the Napoleonic wars, {{the members of the}} latter perceived the traditional forms of fraternities, who were still heavily affiliated with their state of origin, to be reactionary and elitist. Thus, they organized themselves into what was pictured as a single fraternity spanning all states of German language, allowing the students to coordinate a nationalist revolution; i.e. a revolution to <b>unify</b> <b>Germany</b> and to abolish all princedoms. From the beginning, they were a dedicated political organization, in contrast to the Corps.|$|R
