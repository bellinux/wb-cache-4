50|$|For banking, a {{loss ratio}} {{is the total}} amount of <b>unrecoverable</b> <b>debt</b> when {{compared}} to total outstanding debt. For example, if $100 was loaned, but only $90 was repaid, the bank has a loss ratio of 10%. These calculations are applied class-wide and used to determine financing fees for loans. If the average loss ratio on a class of loans is 2%, then the financing fees for loans of that class must be greater than 2% to recover the normal loss and return a profit.|$|E
50|$|Gaines was {{depicted}} {{by the national}} media as America's most amoral publisher. By 1955, EC was effectively driven out of business by the backlash, and by the Comics Magazine Association of America. This was an industry group that Gaines himself had suggested to the industry in order to insulate themselves from outside censorship, but he soon {{lost control of the}} organization to John Goldwater, publisher of the innocuous Archie teenage comics. The Comics Code that was approved and adopted by most of the country's prominent publishers contained restrictions specifically targeted at Gaines' line of horror and crime comic books. Although he had already ceased publishing his line of horror comics, Gaines refused to subscribe to the Code, considering it hypocritical and not applicable to the new, clean line of realistic comics that he was promoting by then. This refusal, together with his already tarnished reputation, put EC on the verge of bankruptcy. Although Gaines relented and accepted the code, distributors refused to pass his titles along to newsstands. The damage was done, and Gaines abandoned comic books completely. He chose to concentrate his business on EC's only profitable title, Mad, which had recently changed to a magazine format. After distributor Leader News went bankrupt in 1956, EC was left with over $100,000 in <b>unrecoverable</b> <b>debt.</b> Gaines invested a considerable portion of his personal fortune to keep the company alive until a deal could be made with a new distributor.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} of King John, the Pipe rolls were growing unwieldy, as too many fines and fees were being recorded, making the finding of {{information}} in the rolls difficult. Eventually, after some experimentation, by 1206 a system whereby the actual detailed receipts were recorded {{in a set of}} receipt rolls and only aggregates were entered in the Pipe rolls was settled on. A further reform in 1236 resulted in debts being recorded in separate Estreat rolls, and only the totals entered into the Pipe rolls. In 1284 the Statutes of Rhuddlan were issued, which further reformed the accounting systems, and further reduced the detail contained on the Pipe rolls. At this time, a large number of <b>unrecoverable</b> <b>debts</b> were also removed from the rolls, a process that had also been attempted in 1270. The attempt in 1270 had marked old debts with a [...] "d" [...] and stipulated that they were not to be re-entered into future Pipe rolls unless they were paid off. But this had not worked, and so in 1284 old debts were to be recorded on a separate roll. The statutes in 1284 also laid out a procedure where debtors whose documentation of payment of debt that hadn't been accepted in the past would have that documentation accepted, thus helping to clear out some of the backlogged debts on the books.|$|R
