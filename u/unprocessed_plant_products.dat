40|$|The Mediterranean diet is upheld in the 2015 – 2020 Dietary Guidelines as {{an example}} of an eating pattern that {{promotes}} good health, a healthy body weight, and disease prevention throughout the lifespan. The Mediterranean eating pattern is based on a variety of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>plant</b> foods including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds that are high in polyphenols. The majority of polyphenols arrive in the colon where bacteria degrade them into smaller phenolics that can be translocated via the portal vein to the liver. In the liver, the phenolics undergo additional biotransformation prior to release into the circulation and transport to specific tissues where bioactive effects take place before removal in the urine. Recent epidemiologic studies using improved assessment techniques support that high versus low dietary polyphenol intake predicts reduced risk for neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, obesity, and early death from all causes. Emerging science reveals that many of these health-related benefits {{can be traced to the}} biotransformed, gut-derived phenolics. In conclusion, the high consumption of <b>unprocessed</b> <b>plant</b> foods by inhabitants of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea has been linked to multiple health and disease prevention benefits that are in large part due to a varied intake of polyphenols...|$|R

50|$|These results {{imply that}} the archaeological {{evidence}} for pickleweed at the cave may over estimate its actual contribution to the diet. If foragers choose to reside closer to pickleweed patches and bring back largely <b>unprocessed</b> <b>plants,</b> a high density of pickleweed macrofossils will be incorporated into site deposits. However, {{the opposite is true}} for piñon, which is largely processed in the field. Thus, most sites will contain little macrofossil evidence of the inedible portions of piñon that could later be recovered by archaeologists. As such, the relative abundance of macrofossils in most cases does not directly translate into the relative contribution of those resources to the diet of central place foragers.|$|R

40|$|The insecticidal {{properties}} of natural <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> {{have been known}} since ancient times. It is estimated that over 2, 000 plant species possess biological activity against insects, and the principal chemicals that impart such activity include alkaloids, terpenoids, acetogenins and flavonoids. Among the various <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> used as insecticides, nicotine from Nicotiana tabacum and pyrithrins from Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium are the most prominent. Pesticide formulations developed from neem (Azadirachta indica), karanja (Pongamia glabra), and custard apple (Annona squamosa) have also shown promise for pest management. Despite voluminous information on the usefulness of these products as pest control chemicals, their exploitation in practical agriculture is limited due to low toxicity, latent period of action, short shelf-life, rapid degradation, and limited spectrum of activity. However, {{there is a general}} prevailing belief that natural <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> are easily biodegradable, and thus, are considered safer as compared to synthetic pesticides. However, there is little information on their metabolism in soil, water and plants. Although considered safe to nontarget natural enemies of crop pests, <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> might still have the same toxic and anti-molting effects on these organisms as on the target arthropods, in addition to their indirect effects through sub-optimal prey. There is very little information on the effects of these products on the activity of microbes in the soil, and on the aquatic organisms. Large-scale use of natural <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> may also have disorienting effects on the foraging behavior of honeybees and other pollinators. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} generate information on natural <b>plant</b> <b>products</b> relative to their metabolic products, acute and chronic toxicity, mutagenesis, allergenicity, and teratogenicity as in the case of syntheti...|$|R
