25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 18th century witnessed a significant growth in Marian confraternities, such as the Confraternities of the Rosary. A small number of such confraternities had started sometime in the 15th century, through the preaching of Alan de Rupe. Their numbers began to grow {{under the supervision of}} the Dominicans, which also helped create a more <b>uniform</b> <b>format</b> for the Rosary.

If a Schengen state wishes to allow the holder of a long-stay visa to remain there for longer than a year, the state must issue him or her with a residence permit.|$|E
500|$|Before 928 {{charters}} {{had been}} produced in various ways, sometimes by royal priests, sometimes by other priests {{on behalf of}} the beneficiaries. [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] was solely responsible for the production of charters between 928 and 934. King Æthelstan thus took unprecedented control over an important part of his functions. In 935 [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] shared the work with other scribes, and he then apparently retired. His charters have exceptionally long witness lists, with 101 names for a grant by the king to his thegn Wulfgar at Lifton in Devon in 931, and 92 for a grant to Ælfgar at Winchester in 934. The witness lists of King Æthelstan's father and grandfather were much shorter, with the longest in Alfred the Great's reign having only 19 names. In John Maddicott's view the long lists in Æthelstan's reign reflect a change of direction to larger assemblies. The king established a novel system, with his scribe travelling with him from meeting to meeting, and a <b>uniform</b> <b>format</b> of charters. The dating clause showed the regnal year, the indiction, the epact, and the age of the moon. In Keynes's view: [...] "Nothing quite like them had been seen before; and they must have seemed magnificent, even intimidating, in their formality and their grandeur." [...] A unique feature is that three charters in favour of a religious community require it to sing a specified number of psalms for the king, indicating a particular interest in psalmody by the king or scribe.|$|E

The concluding section discusses our findings, emphasising that while the examined involvement projects bring forth a shared European citizen desire for wide-ranging societal development with an emphasis on education, we also observe a connection between the foci of the involvement projects and the topics that emerge in them. The results imply that open-ended, deliberative citizen involvement should strive to address issues also beyond the most general and apparent topics.|$|R

40|$|A repo auction is a multi-unit common value {{auction in}} which bidders submit demand functions. Such auctions {{are used by}} the Bundesbank {{as well as the}} European Central Bank as the {{principal}} instrument for implementing monetary policy. In this paper, we analyze a repo auction with a uniform pricing rule. We show that under a uniform pricing rule, the usual intuition about the value of exclusive information can be violated, and implies free riding by uninformed bidders on the information of the informed bidders, lowering payoff of the latter. Further, free riding can distort the information content of auction prices, in turn distorting the policy signals, hindering the conduct of monetary policy. The results agree with evidence from repo auctions, and clarifies the reason behind the Bundesbank’s decision to switch away from the <b>uniform</b> price <b>format.</b> Our results also shed some light on the rationale behind the contrasting switch to the <b>uniform</b> price <b>format</b> in US Treasury auctions.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} purposes of introducing automation into libraries according to uniform principles and by using <b>uniform</b> <b>formats</b> is an easy exchange of information of library's documents on computer readable media. Introducing computers to documentation services has as its major purpose transmission of SDI and retrospective information to the users, especially through articles as a primary source of scientific and technica I information. In Yugoslavia there exists a plan to establish a cooperative library information system 1), which would interconnect each library with others, including those with documentation services, by terminal and computers. The aim of such a system is the exchange of information on library documents. FJr this purpose automation has gradually been introduced to libraries and documentation services. However, it has already become obvious that library automated networks are being formed at the level of republics. The vi sits and recommendations of two UNISIST experts, Mr. B. Teil and Mr. F.
