5|$|Leftist {{literary}} critic Bakri Siregar condemned Poedjangga Baroe neutral political stance, arguing that {{its inability to}} objectively understand {{the needs of the}} people made it <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> truly reflect the struggle for independence.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Steve Rogers {{is deemed}} {{physically}} <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> {{enlist in the}} U.S. Army and fight the Nazis in World War II. Recruited for a secret military operation, he is physically transformed into a super-soldier dubbed Captain America and must battle the Red Skull, head of a Nazi weaponry division known as Hydra.|$|E
5|$|Miller was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> bowl {{during the}} Second Test at Lord's. During England's first innings, Bradman threw Miller the ball, {{hoping that he}} would reverse his {{decision}} not to bowl. Miller refused and returned the ball, citing his back. Miller's action generated news headlines, with journalists believing that he had disobeyed Bradman.|$|E

6000|$|... "He is, in reality, {{no longer}} a bear," [...] said one; [...] "nor can he justly be called a bird. But he is half bird and half bear, and so <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> remain our king." ...|$|R
5|$|On 7 October 1966, {{at the age}} of 59, Horne {{suffered}} a major heart attack. He was much weakened, and was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> work for three months. As a result, he did not appear in the Round the Horne Christmas special. He returned to work in January 1967 to record the third series.|$|E
5|$|As {{the party}} recuperated, Shackleton {{realised}} that {{the boat was}} not capable of making a further voyage to reach the whaling stations, and that Vincent and McNish were <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> travel further. He decided to move the boat to a safer location within King Haakon Bay, from which point he, Worsley and Crean would cross the island on foot, aiming for the station at Stromness.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{opted to}} field an {{unchanged}} lineup for the Second Test, which started on 24 June at Lord's. Following his {{injury in the}} previous Test, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to gamble on his inclusion. Bradman won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover. Miller played, but was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> bowl.|$|E
6000|$|... "All but the second; indeed, {{they write}} me fearful things {{concerning}} this European education of mine; some even {{go so far}} as to assure me I shall be quite <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> live in the society to which I properly belong!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Gordon (politician), Parliamentary and Financial Secretary at the Ministry of Finance (i.e. Chief Whip), {{resigned}} on 13 June 1940, {{explaining to}} the Commons {{that the government}} was [...] "quite <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> sustain the people in the ordeal we have to face." ...|$|R
60|$|Liturgies are but {{temporary}} {{expressions of}} the Church's heart. The Bible is the immutable story of her husband's love. She must go on from grace to grace, and her song must vary from age to age, and her ancient melodies become <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> express her feelings; but He {{is the same for}} ever.|$|R
5|$|Diệm {{used the}} Ministry of Information's electoral {{education}} campaign as a partisan political tool. Instead of using it purely {{to explain the}} democratic process, the campaign was used to extol Diệm and his allies. After explaining what democracy was, a pamphlet outlined why Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act. After elaborating on {{the powers of the}} head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> lead, saying {{that he did not have}} respect among the international community.|$|E
5|$|Generals Pavle Strugar and Miodrag Jokić {{were sentenced}} by the ICTY to eight and seven years, respectively, for {{shelling}} Dubrovnik. A third indictee, Vladimir Kovačević, was declared mentally <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> stand trial. The Yugoslav Army's Chief of the General Staff, Momčilo Perišić, {{was charged with}} aiding and abetting war crimes but eventually acquitted on all charges. The trials of Jovica Stanišić, Franko Simatović, Vojislav Šešelj and Goran Hadžić are still pending.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} centuries, Zoroastrians faced much religious discrimination and persecution, harassments, {{as well as}} being identified as najis (polluted) and impure to Muslims, making them <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> live alongside Muslims, and therefore forcing them to evacuate from cities and face major sanctions in all spheres of life. Zoroastrians have been subject to public humiliation through dress regulations, to being labeled as najis and to exclusion in the fields of society, education and work.|$|E

"I might retort on thee, honest Niño, with thine own words," [...] {{answered}} Columbus, [...] "and bid thee {{confide in}} those whose knowledge thou canst never equal, and to follow submissively where thou art totally <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> lead.

5|$|Sporadic privately {{operated}} ferry services between Adolphustown and Stone Mills (Glenora) {{were initially}} a primitive affair. In October 1835 a Mr. Clark from Cobourg tipped {{out of the}} bark canoe ferrying him to Glenora and was buried without an inquest; a year earlier, a Rev. Mathew Miller from Cobourg had drowned after falling through the February ice. The road itself was no better, barely adequate for horse and rider but <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> run stagecoach lines.|$|E
5|$|The GDR's {{government}} nonetheless remained {{opposed to}} emigration {{and sought to}} dissuade would-be émigrés. The process of applying for an exit permit was deliberately made slow, demeaning, frustrating and often fruitless. Applicants were marginalised, demoted or sacked from their jobs, excluded from universities and subjected to ostracism. They faced the threat of having their children taken into state custody {{on the grounds that}} they were <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> bring up children. The law was used to punish those who continued to apply for emigration; over 10,000applicants were arrested by the Stasi between the 1970s and 1989.|$|E
5|$|The senator {{alleged that}} Stevenson had downplayed {{the threat of}} communism, and was thus <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> be president. He affirmed that Eisenhower was the only man fit {{to lead the country}} in ridding the {{government}} of corruption and communism. Reading parts of a letter from the wife of a serviceman fighting in the Korean War, who, despite her financial woes, had scraped together $10 to donate to the campaign, Nixon promised that he would never cash that check.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{fortnight}} of argument Robertson's [...] "resignation" [...] was announced. Lloyd George, possibly aware that Robertson {{was dependent on}} his army pay, suggested he be given command of an Army in France, but Haig said he “was quite <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> command troops”. Robertson wrote notes thanking Maurice, Macdonogh and Whigham, ending “now {{get on with the}} war”.|$|R

30|$|We {{focus on}} the {{cross-sectional}} information of the years 2007 - 201119. We restrict the sample to women aged 26 - 54 years to avoid the modeling of schooling and retirement decisions. Moreover, we exclude self-employed {{men and women and}} individuals that are coded as disabled or <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> work. Descriptive statistics are in Table 13, Additional file 1 : Appendix B.|$|R
5|$|According to the Constitution of 1831, the Belgian {{government}} {{was allowed to}} override {{the wishes of the}} King if he had been declared incompetent to reign. On 28 May 1940, under pressure from the French government, the Pierlot government in France declared the King to be under the power of the invaders and <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> reign according to article 82, providing strong legal foundations and making itself the only official source of government. The government, however, refused to declare a republic. Although the King technically remained the only person able to receive diplomatic legations and conclude treaties, the government in exile was able to do both during the war independently.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{retained}} the same XI from the First Test at Trent Bridge. On the other hand, England made three changes; the leg spinner Wright had regained fitness and replaced {{the left arm}} orthodox of Young, all rounder Coxon made his Test debut in place of Barnett and Dollery replaced Hardstaff as the No. 5. batsman. Following his injury in the previous Test, Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning and was only included after protesting to Bradman, who gambled on his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat. Miller played, but was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> bowl.|$|E
5|$|Australia's success {{came at a}} cost, with Lindwall {{injured and}} unable to bowl in the lead-up to the Second Test, missing the {{intervening}} matches against Northamptonshire and Yorkshire. The heavy workload on Miller caused by Lindwall's breaking down mid-Test generated severe back pain, {{and he was still}} not fully recovered by the start of the Second Test at Lord's. Lindwall was subjected to a thorough fitness test on the first morning of the Lord's Test. Bradman was not convinced of Lindwall's fitness, but the bowler's protestations were sufficient to convince his captain to risk his inclusion. Australia won the toss and elected to bat, allowing Lindwall further time to recover from his injury. Miller also played, but still nursing his back, was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> bowl.|$|E
60|$|As {{the little}} darling {{was only two}} years and a {{fraction}} of age it is tolerably impossible to divine upon what authority she sought to throw discredit upon the joys of earth: her observation having been limited to mother's milk and treacle toffy. But that's just the way with professing Christians; they are always disparaging the delights which they are <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> enjoy.|$|R

5|$|By far {{the largest}} single cost was the {{purchase}} of the ship Terra Nova, for £12,500. Terra Nova had been in Antarctica before, as part of the second Discovery relief operation. Scott wanted to sail her as a Naval vessel under the White Ensign; to enable this, he obtained membership of the Royal Yacht Squadron for the sum of £100. He was thus able to impose Naval discipline on the expedition, and as a registered yacht of the Squadron, Terra Nova became exempt from Board of Trade regulations which might otherwise have deemed her <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> sail.|$|E
5|$|Claire Clairmont {{gave birth}} to a baby girl on 13 January, at first called Alba, later Allegra. In March of that year, the Chancery Court ruled Percy Shelley morally <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> assume custody of his {{children}} and later placed them with a clergyman's family. Also in March, the Shelleys moved with Claire and Alba to Albion House at Marlow, Buckinghamshire, a large, damp building on the river Thames. There Mary Shelley {{gave birth to}} her third child, Clara, on 2 September. At Marlow, they entertained their new friends Marianne and Leigh Hunt, worked hard at their writing, and often discussed politics.|$|E
5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof that George W. Bush was <b>unfit</b> <b>to</b> be president.|$|E

5000|$|Terry {{has been}} called [...] "our most {{controversial}} architect - precisely because he is so uncontroversial" [...] and his work has attracted much criticism even from conservative quarters. Gavin Stamp remarked that {{after the death of}} Raymond Erith, Terry was left [...] "to hold aloft the torch of classicism—something he was, I fear, quite <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> sustain" [...] and he has also been called [...] "exquisite but impractical." ...|$|R
60|$|Lewis opposed him no longer. He rose, {{and they}} both stood up to stamp their feet and belabour their chests for some time--the cold at such a height being intense, while their wet {{garments}} and want of covering rendered them peculiarly <b>unfitted</b> <b>to</b> withstand it. The effort was not very successful. The darkness of the night, the narrowness of their ledge, and the sleepiness of their spirits rendering extreme caution necessary.|$|R
