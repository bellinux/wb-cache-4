40|$|The {{demonstration}} {{of a specific}} quantitative effect of measures aiming at the prevention of <b>unintended</b> child <b>injuries</b> is scientifically a hitherto insufficiently explored question. Knowledge of the likely effect of preventive measures, however, forms an essential prerequisite for {{the development and implementation}} of targeted actions in practice. The present study examined this question using the example of a standardized training program for parents on the prevention of domestic <b>unintended</b> <b>injuries</b> in infancy and early childhood and explores the quantitative impact of counselling on the prevalence of injuries in the context of personal and social factors. The injury-prevention-counselling was conducted to parents of 256 children in an outpatient paediatric practice. A prevention-guide-line was developed to insure a standardised content and timing (20 min.). Subject of counselling was the explanation of specific risks and possible measures to prevent <b>unintended</b> child <b>injuries</b> with respect to personal circumstances of the children and families. Parents of 256 children formed the control group without counselling. Subject of the study were 792 incidents of <b>unintended</b> child <b>injuries</b> of the 512 children aged 0 to 5 years. It could be demonstrated that the counselling results in a reduction in the prevalence of <b>unintended</b> child <b>injuries.</b> The average effect of counselling on the prevalence of injuries was - 22 % (p ≤ 0. 066). The most important factor influencing the effectiveness of the counselling proved to be the general education status of parents. In the group of the high-educated there was an effect of - 42 % (p = 0. 014). At 80 % of study participants with counselling, the training resulted in a positive effect on risk awareness and preventive behaviour. Assuming that the sample of the study are representative of the population of children aged 0 - 5 years in Germany and based on the average preventive effect of - 22 % it was possible to estimate the potential impact of a Germany-wide implementation of a standardized child injury prevention program. According to this extrapolation the death of 21 children aged 0 - 5 years could be avoided annually. Furthermore, the analysis of health economic effects through avoidable outpatient and inpatient treatments of child injuries leads to the conclusion that health care costs of at least € 63 million could be saved annually. The study results thus suggest that a standardized parental training to prevent <b>unintended</b> child <b>injuries</b> is both medically necessary and sensible in terms of health economics...|$|R

This study retrospectively assessed all reported general surgery-related AEs in a district general hospital in the south-east of England. MethodsAll general surgical AEs arising from adult inpatient admissions between 2002 and 2007, that had been reported to the risk management team, following completion of the standard ‘Adverse Incident Report Form’, were retrospectively reviewed. ResultsThere were 24, 185 general surgical admissions over {{the period of the}} study; 461 AEs were reported (1. 9 % mean annual incident rate; 95 % CI, 1. 3 %– 2. 5 %). The majority (85 %) were near miss or no injury events (category I and II) while serious/serious near-miss incidents accounted for just 2 % of events. Communicative or administrative problems were implicated in 54 % of cases while 12 % arose from theatre/surgery-related failure. Of 58 medico-legal claims (0. 24 % of admissions) that were made, 16 (27. 5 %) progressed to the law courts for formal settlement. ConclusionThe reported annual AE incident rate of approximately 2 % is well below the national average: {{this may be due to}} pre-selection of general surgery-related AEs or represent under-reporting of incidents. The vast majority of AEs were related to administrative and communicative error. These areas must be addressed if patient safety and outcome is to be significantly improved...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{patient safety}} factors in pre-hospital and hospital management of critically ill children {{dying in a}} paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). DESIGN: Retrospective case notes review. SETTING: Single tertiary regional PICU in London. PARTICIPANTS: 47 patients (7 %) who died from a total of 679 children admitted during 2007 and 2008. Median age was 1. 1 years and median predicted mortality from the Paediatric Index of Mortality 2 score was 39 %. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adverse events contributing to death (AEds) and critical incidents (CIs). AEd was defined as an <b>unintended</b> <b>injury</b> or complication caused by health care management, contributing to death. CI was defined as an undesirable event in healthcare management, which could have led to harm or did lead to harm of the patient but did {{not contribute to the}} patient's death. RESULTS: 22 AEds occurred in 17 of 47 (36 %) cases. Two AEds occurred in primary care, 20 in pre-PICU hospital care, and none in PICU. AEds were mainly problems in diagnosis and management of critical illness. 37 CIs occurred in 28 of 47 (60 %) cases. Two CIs occurred prior to hospital admission, 17 occurred in pre-PICU hospital care, 1 during inter-hospital transport and 17 in PICU. CIs were predominantly medical management and procedure related. Individual, team and organisational factors caused the majority of AEds and CIs. CONCLUSION: Adverse events in pre-PICU hospital care were common in children who subsequently died in PICU. CIs occurred throughout the patient journey. Interventional studies of healthcare organisation and delivery are necessary to identify appropriate strategies to improve patient safety...|$|E
40|$|Prolific {{generation}} of NO by inducible {{nitric oxide synthase}} (iNOS) can cause <b>unintended</b> <b>injury</b> to host cells during glomerulonephritis and other inflammatory diseases. While much {{is known about the}} mechanisms of iNOS induction, few transcriptional repressors have been found. We explored the role of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT 3) proteins in interleukin (IL) - 1 beta- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) +interferon (IFN) -gamma-mediated iNOS induction in murine mesangial cells. Both stimuli induced rapid phosphorylation of STAT 3 and sequence-specific STAT 3 DNA-binding activity. Supershift assays with a STAT 3 element probe demonstrated that nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p 65 and p 50 complexed with STAT 3 in the DNA-protein complex. The direct interaction of STAT 3 and NF-kappaB p 65 was verified in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro by pull-down assays with glutathione S-transferase-NF-kappaB p 65 fusion protein and in vitro -translated STAT 3 alpha. Overexpression of STAT 3 dramatically inhibited IL- 1 beta- or LPS+IFN-gamma-mediated induction of iNOS promoter-luciferase constructs that contained the wild-type iNOS promoter or ones harbouring mutated STAT-binding elements. In tests of indirect inhibitory effects of STAT 3, overexpression of STAT 3 dramatically inhibited the activity of an NF-kappaB-dependent promoter devoid of STAT-binding elements without affecting NF-kappaB DNA-binding activity. Thus STAT 3, via direct interactions with NF-kappaB p 65, serves as a dominant-negative inhibitor of NF-kappaB activity to suppress indirectly cytokine induction of the iNOS promoter in mesangial cells. These results provide a new model for the termination of NO production by activated iNOS following exposure to pro-inflammatory stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Observations {{in studies}} of {{estimation}} compared to actual performance in motor skills revealed that children are not always accurate and {{have a tendency to}} overestimate the maximum distance at which an action can be performed. The relationship between estimated and real motor competences was analyzed for several tasks: standing long jump (SLJ), throwing and kicking, and walking backwards (WB) on a balance beam. Children were asked to predict their maximum distance prior to performing those tasks. Participants were 303 children (160 boys), which were between 6 and 10 years of age (M= 8. 63, SD= 1. 16). Children’s estimations were compared with their real performance to determine their accuracy. Absolute error (|real performance − estimation|) and error tendency, that is, the direction of the error (overestimation, accuracy, and underestimation bias), were calculated. Children had a tendency to overestimate their performance and were more conservative in the WB task, a noncommon action. In general, it is possible to conclude that children, in the studied age span, tend to overestimate their performance, particularly in familiar skills. This fact may be determinant to the development of their motor competences, since {{they are more likely to}} engage and persist in motor tasks, but it might also be a problem in terms of child safety because it could increase the occurrence of <b>unintended</b> <b>injuries...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Radiotherapy is {{a common}} cancer treatment, but often results in <b>unintended</b> <b>injury</b> to {{overlying}} skin and contributes to poor wound healing. The mechanisms underlying these changes are complex, and existing treatment is limited. We aimed to systematically review {{the literature on the}} pathogenesis, management, and experimental treatment of delayed wound healing following radiation therapy. Study Design/Methods: A literature search was performed following PRISMA-P guidelines. PubMed and the Cochrane Library were queried for full-text English articles published up to 2016 by using key search terms including “radiotherapy” and “wound healing. ” Additional resources were retrieved from reference lists. The selected articles discussed mechanisms of pathogenesis, current management, and experimental treatment of radiation-induced skin injury. These are reported as a qualitative synthesis of the literature from the authors' perspective. Results: The literature search yielded 442 articles, of which 93 were included in this review. Ionizing radiation causes DNA damage by direct strand breaks and oxygen-derived free radicals. This insult results in cellular alterations that underlie mechanisms of delayed wound healing. Prominent theories underlying pathogenesis include cellular depletion, stromal cell dysfunction, aberrant collagen deposition, and microvascular damage. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and free radical cascades contribute to chronic radiation damage, with transforming growth factor beta- 1 (TGF-β 1) implicated as a key player in the process of fibrosis. At present, radiation injury is managed medically with conventional wound care with minimal success and limited evidence-based data. Surgical management with local or free flap transfer is often compromised by poor surrounding tissue and recipient vasculature. Experimental treatment models are emerging that target mechanisms of pathogenesis. These modalities include stem cell repletion, antioxidant therapy, TGF-β 1 modulation, and implantable biomaterials. Conclusion: Pathogenesis of delayed wound healing and fibrosis following radiotherapy is a complex, interdependent process involving cellular depletion, extracellular matrix changes, microvascular damage, and altered pro-inflammatory mediators. Current treatment is limited, and more Level I studies are needed to develop best-practice recommendations. Investigatory treatment options targeting specific mechanisms of injury may offer potential solutions to this significant clinical and surgical problem...|$|E
40|$|Medicine {{continues}} {{to move towards}} less invasive techniques for many cardiac conditions, especially for high-risk patients that may not tolerate the alternative, more invasive approach. For instance, patients born with the congenital heart defect hypoplastic left heart syndrome often require emergent creation of a perforation through the atrial septum for survival prior to palliative surgery. However, most approaches are catheter based, still invasive, and continue to have significant challenges, limitations, and complications. A completely non-invasive technique such as histotripsy may provide the same result in a faster, safer, and more efficient manner. Using high-pressure ultrasound pulses applied outside the body and focused to the targeted tissue, histotripsy generates a cluster of cavitating micro-bubbles that fractionate the target tissue. The goal of this work is to investigate the safety and efficacy of histotripsy for neonatal cardiac applications. To aid in this goal, therapy guidance and monitoring techniques are developed, and an integrated histotripsy therapy system, optimized for the human neonate with congenital heart disease, was designed and constructed. In this dissertation, histotripsy is first demonstrated {{to be capable of}} generating targeted intra-cardiac communications when positioned outside the body in an intact neonatal animal model with minimal collateral damage or systemic side-effects. Second, to mitigate the possibility of <b>unintended</b> <b>injury</b> due to heart motion, real-time motion correction using ultrasound imaging is developed and integrated into a histotripsy therapy system. The performance of the motion correction is quantified in vitro and a validated in a single in vivo experiment. Third, to maximize therapy efficacy, novel bubble-induced color Doppler feedback to monitor the degree of tissue damage during histotripsy treatment is developed and validated in vitro. Finally, a histotripsy therapy transducer with appropriate physical dimensions and acoustic parameters to precisely ablate cardiac tissue non-invasively in a human neonate is developed and integrated into an ultrasound guided histotripsy therapy system. The data and the integrated system accomplished from this dissertation form the essential foundation to a pioneering clinical trial for histotripsy cardiac therapy in infants, which will position histotripsy for application on a broad range of cardiac disorders in patients of all ages...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND - It {{has long}} been {{recognised}} that patients have many concerns during illness (Tuckett et al 1985). Macmillan Cancer Support (2013) has drawn attention to the financial impact of cancer whilst research on injury (Kendrick et al 2012) has shown that self-employed patients may return to work sooner and less successfully than the employed. Notwithstanding these examples, there is comparatively little research examining financial, occupational or relational aspects of recovery. AIMS - This paper explores patients’ concerns about money, work and personal relationships during recovery from serious physical illness or injury. The analysis is drawn from an ESRC funded project ([URL] METHODS - Secondary analysis was carried out on 165 qualitative interviews collected by the Health Experiences Research Group, University of Oxford, and the UK Burden of Injury Study between 2003 and 2012. The maximum variation samples comprised 44 heart attack patients, 39 leukaemia patients, 37 patients admitted to intensive care and 45 patients hospitalised following <b>unintended</b> <b>injury.</b> Participants were interviewed between one and 23 years after the event. RESULTS - The financial impact of serious illness and injury was significant for most interviewees. Whilst some reported excellent support from employers, many found this to be short-lived and a third changed job, reduced working hours or took early retirement {{as a consequence of}} illness. Some younger patients received financial support from parents but older patients were reluctant to ask others for money and awareness of entitlement to benefits varied by health event. Serious illness or injury placed a strain on relationships and patients proactively managed reliance on others. DISCUSSION - The financial, occupational and relational impacts of serious illness and injury are significant and continue throughout recovery. Effects vary by socio-economic background, occupation and life stage. CONCLUSIONS - Patients’ concerns during recovery are rooted in the roles, responsibilities and resources that frame their everyday lives.

40|$|When {{speaking}} about ageing in place, risk of accidents and subsequent injuries {{is an important}} part of individual worries, and risk avoidance or risk minimisation are main concerns of older people and their caregivers. Findings show that older people are more at risk of <b>unintended</b> <b>injuries</b> than younger people (i. e. falls, foodborne diseases). Moreover, individual concerns and associated worries to avoid specific risks may even lead to the decision to move to an institution. In this context it is important to consider that being “as safe as possible” with respect to objective parameters does not necessarily indicate the subjective feeling of being safe. The feeling of safety and the objective degree of safety are not linearly related in a way that increasing one factor will increase the other and conversely. Furthermore, some factors that can contribute to objectively enhance safety may even lead to greater feeling of unsafety. Our review aims to investigate the relationship between objective and subjective safety in the context of ageing in place as well as the underlying mechanisms that help to explain the different links between objective and subjective safety. A further goal is offer a heuristic model presenting factors that may help to enhance older people’s consciousness of safety and thus quality of life. These include individual as well as social and macro-social factors.

Both cooperation and conflict between kin are investigated. We use an evolutionary family sociological framework for analysing kin relations in present day Finland and the UK. Cooperation {{is measured by}} kin support, emotional closeness, and contact frequency, while the outcome of sibling conflict is measured by toddlers’ <b>unintended</b> <b>injuries,</b> young adolescents’ reports of how much siblings picked and hurt each other, and adults’ self-reported disagreements with siblings. The study includes seven original articles and an introductory chapter. Article I shows that 3 -year-old British children {{who live in the}} same household with their full siblings have a lower risk of <b>unintended</b> home <b>injuries</b> than do children who live with their full and half siblings or only with their half siblings. Article II finds that 11 -year-old British children living with their full siblings only {{were more likely to report}} hurting or picking between siblings compared with children who live with their half siblings only. Article III describes two generations of adult Finns and shows that both younger (mean age 36 years old) and older (mean age 65 years) generations have more contacts with full than half siblings and more contacts with the children of full siblings than with children of half siblings. Based on article IV, older and younger Finns have more contact with their sisters’ children compared to their brothers’ children. Article V finds that childless younger women in Finland provide more childcare to their siblings’ children than do younger mothers. However, mothers and childless women provide equal amounts of support to their aunts and uncles. According to article VI, younger Finnish adults who have half siblings are more likely to have encountered unequal maternal treatment than younger adults who have full siblings only. Article VII shows that younger and older Finns are more likely to have conflicts with their full siblings than with their half siblings. Combined, these results show that kin relations tend to differ both between maternal and paternal kin and between full and half siblings. Moreover, kin support is more likely to flow from older individuals to younger ones than vice versa. Finally, parental unequal treatment seems to shape relations between siblings. At the end of the introduction chapter, policy and practical implications of the results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|CSC) {{has become}} an {{integral}} part of dermatologic laser surgery because of its ability to remove selectively large amounts of heat from human skin in short periods of time, thereby protecting the epidermis from <b>unintended</b> thermal <b>injury.</b> The objective of the present study is to investigate the extent of lateral epidermal protection afforded by a cryogen spray during laser irradiation. Materials and Methods: CSC experiments on skin phantoms are conducted using a commercial nozzle (GentleLase, Candela) to characterize epidermal cooling in time and space; namely, surface temperatures and heat fluxes during a 60 milliseconds spurt and 30 milliseconds delay. Numerical methods are used to model the light distribution (755 nm), heat diffusion and thermal injury within the epidermis and dermis. A 755 nm lase...|$|R
