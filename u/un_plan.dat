This was implemented by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), supported by a number of other UN agencies and programmes. In Namibia, the Council of Churches in Namibia (CCN) was UNHCR's implementing partner. Most returning Namibians returned from Angola; many came from Zambia, and a small number came from 46 other countries after the proclamation of a general amnesty. The logistics of managing the returnees was largely delegated to the Australian contingent.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1962 that Australia voted for a UN {{resolution}} condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister Garfield Barwick. Initially in opposition, until he was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was a vocal advocate of independence for Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting Namibian independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, were active internationally in their support of independence for Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia {{was involved in the}} UN process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, and two years later it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia. Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the <b>UN</b> <b>plan</b> for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978, and made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.|$|E

In mid-April Najibullah accepted a <b>UN</b> <b>plan</b> to hand power to a seven-man council, and several days later on 14 April, Najibullah was forced to resign on the orders of the Watan Party because of the loss of Bagram Airbase and the town of Charikar. Abdul Rahim Hatef became acting head of state following Najibullah's resignation. Not long before Kabul's fall, Najibullah appealed to the UN for amnesty, which he was granted. But his attempt to flee to the airport was thwarted by Abdul Rashid Dostum, and Najibullah instead sought haven in the local UN headquarters in Kabul. The Afghan civil war did not end with Najibullah's ouster, and continued. In 1996 the Taliban took power. The Taliban never took complete control of the country. The civil war continues to this day.|$|E

Up until the 1970s, considerably more boys than girls participated in education in Nigeria. According to one Nigerian Historian Kitetu, the native traditions' philosophy was that a woman’s place is at home and this kept many girls away from education. However, with the government’s intervention and public awakening, parents began to send and keep their girl children in school. Consequently, women’s involvement became more visible.|$|E
2500|$|By 14 May 1948, {{the only}} British forces {{remaining}} in Palestine {{were in the}} Haifa area and in Jerusalem. On that same day, the British garrison in Jerusalem withdrew, and High Commissioner Alan Cunningham left the city for Haifa, where he was {{to leave the country}} by sea. The Jewish Leadership, led by future Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, declared the establishment of a Jewish State in Eretz-Israel, {{to be known as the}} State of Israel, on the afternoon of 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708 in the Hebrew calendar), to come into force at midnight of that day.

Judge Abdul Koroma explained the majority opinion: [...] "The Court has also held that the right of self-determination as an established and recognized right under international law applies to the territory and to the Palestinian people. Accordingly, the exercise of such right entitles the Palestinian people to a State of their own as originally envisaged in resolution 181 (II) and subsequently confirmed."

After facing ten years of drought “CIDA focused {{development}} on getting wadis, karezes, canals, and more modern pipelines into the older fields so that farmers could radically increase crop production." [...] The next step was then teaching the Afghan farmers how to [...] "improve crop yields" [...] which they were receptive too wanting to improve their way of life. The difficulty with farmers in this region is the fact that their interests coincide with the Taliban and local drug lords. Both these groups, [...] "depend on a climate of fear and dependency in the countryside to support their lifestyles and their wars." [...] By 2007 the work of the PRT was gaining considerable ground. This was evident as [...] "Kandaharis took on much of the rebuilding process themselves."

2500|$|The Persian Gulf is {{also home}} to many migratory and local birds. There is great {{variation}} in color, size, and type of the bird species that call the gulf home. One bird in particular, the kalbaensis subspecies of the collared kingfishers is at the brink of extinction due to real state development by cities such as Dubai and countries such as Oman. Estimates from 2006 showed that only three viable nesting sites were available for this ancient bird, one located [...] from Dubai, and two smaller sites in Oman, all of which {{are in the process of}} becoming real estate developments. Such expansion would prove devastating and could cause this species to become extinct. Unfortunately for the kingfisher, a <b>U.N.</b> <b>plan</b> to protect the mangroves as a biological reserve was blatantly ignored by the emirate of Sharjah, which allowed the dredging of a channel that bisects the wetland and construction of an adjacent concrete walkway. Environmental watchdogs in Arabia are few, and those that do advocate the wildlife are often silenced or ignored by developers of real estate, most of whom have royal family connections and huge energy profits to invest. The end result has been sacrifice of a beautiful yet delicate ecology that has been in harmony for hundreds of years, for structures that are erected only a few years, yet will have a lasting detrimental effect.|$|E

The Arab invasion was denounced by the United States, the Soviet Union, and UN secretary-general Trygve Lie, although it found support from Taiwan and other UN member states. The Arab states proclaimed their aim of a [...] "United State of Palestine" [...] in place of Israel and an Arab state. The Arab Higher Committee said, {{that in the future}} Palestine, the Jews will be no more than 1/7 of the population. i.e. only Jews that lived in Palestine before the British mandate. They did not specify {{what will happen to the}} other Jews. They considered the <b>UN</b> <b>Plan</b> to be invalid because it was opposed by Palestine's Arab majority, and claimed that the British withdrawal led to an absence of legal authority, making it necessary for them to protect Arab lives and property. About two thirds of Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled from the territories which came under Jewish control; the rest became Arab citizens of Israel. All of the much smaller number of Jews in the territories captured by the Arabs, for example the Old City of Jerusalem, also fled or were expelled. The official United Nations estimate was that 711,000 Arabs became refugees during the fighting.|$|E
