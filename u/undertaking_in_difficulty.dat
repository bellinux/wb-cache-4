40|$|International audienceThe new {{guidelines}} {{on state aid}} for rescuing and restructuring give a new definition {{of the concept of}} <b>undertaking</b> <b>in</b> <b>difficulty</b> making this concept more complex in its comprehension. The general idea remains that an undertaking is considered to be in difficulty when, without intervention of the State, it will almost certainly be condemned to going out of business in the short or medium term. But, more precisely, the {{new guidelines}} refer to four situations in which an undertaking will be considered to be in difficulty. These four scenarios, which use quite technical concepts, should be explained in their content and their meaning...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the CNS {{involvement}} in some hematopoietic malignancies such as ALL, AML and high grade malignant NHL. The study concerns adult patients. Attention is focused upon prevention of this complication and also upon the treatment possibilities, once dissemination has occurred. For better understanding an overview of historic facts, pathogenesis and subsequent clinical findings is given in the first chapter. Early meningeal dissemination can go undetected, certainly if no thorough surveillance of the CSF is <b>undertaken.</b> The <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> diagnosing ML and MenLy, the options available for CNS prophylaxis and treatment of meningeal disease along with the attached neurotoxicities are described.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of several diorganotin(IV) dicarboxylate compounds, including acetates and nicotinates {{as well as}} diorganotin(IV) dichloride complexes of the ligands phen, dione and dppz were <b>undertaken.</b> Several <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> either the syntheses or complexation reactions with the organic ligands were encountered. The diorganotin(IV) dichloride complexes of the ligands (R 2 SnCl 2 L where R = Me, n-Bu or Ph and L = phen, dione or dppz) were tested against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The dibutyltin(IV) derivatives exhibited the broadest range of activity {{in comparison to the}} dimethyltin(IV) or diphenyltin(IV) derivatives. The addition of the nicotinate group did not promote activity against any of the bacteria. Furthermore, only in the case of Ph 2 SnCl 2 dione was there improved activity compared to the organic ligand itself...|$|R

One also had mitral regurgitation from a 'jet lesion' of the anterior cusp of the mitral valve. Surgical treatment of all abnormalities with aortic valve repair or replacement was <b>undertaken</b> <b>in</b> each patient and was successful <b>in</b> two. <b>Difficulties</b> <b>in</b> diagnosis and surgical treatment are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Anorexia nervosa is a {{prevalent}} {{and serious}} condition of weight losing occuring most commonly in female adolescents and characterised by distinctive psychological, behavioural and medical features {{some of which}} contribute to its selfperpetuating nature. Difficulty with decision-making is usually apparent in emaciated patients who are often as unable to decide to eat a mouthful of food {{as they are to}} accept treatment or to embark on recovery. Earlier studies have shown changes in white and grey matter volumes of varying reversibility, reduction in myoinositol, autocannabalisation of myelin for energy requirements and most recently, neuronal loss with associated cognitive changes. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T was performed in 20 female anorexia nervosa patients and repeated after a 5 kg weight gain. Matched controls were studied and cognitive testing of executive function was <b>undertaken</b> <b>in</b> all subjects. <b>Difficulties</b> with concentration and set shifting were shown in an earlier study of a group of low and normal weight eating disorder patients on admission to an eating disorders treatment program. Following treatment, cognitive function had improved and was indistinguishable from that of matched healthy university student controls. The effect of anorexia nervosa on the brain will be discussed with reference to these two studies...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSingle-well and group-well pumping {{tests were}} <b>undertaken</b> <b>in</b> a deep gravel {{formation}} of the Taipei basin to determine the hydraulic parameters and better understand the drawdown characteristics across the basin. The periodic drawdown fluctuation due to tidal loading from the overlying river resulted <b>in</b> a <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> determining the hydraulic parameters by those conventionally used graphic techniques. In addition, many other site-specific influencing factors, such as the partial penetration effect and the large diameter of the wells, had to be considered. In this paper, a simple data reduction method was presented to resolve the above-mentioned complications. It was demonstrated that the drawdown data induced by group-well pumping were well predicted using the shifted drawdown curve deduced by the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{autoimmune}} disease {{is the result}} of activation of the immune system that subsequently leads to tissue destruction. Although the clinical outcome significantly differs between {{autoimmune disease}}s, some pathogenic pathways could be shared. During the recent years, intense efforts to find the genetic factors behind development of the complex and polygenic autoimmune diseases have been <b>undertaken.</b> The <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> addressing what genetic factors predispose for autoimmunity in humans underline the importance of animal models in the understanding of the general mechanisms behind the initiation of disease. Interestingly, it has been observed in studies of experimental models of autoimmune diseases, that many of the genetic linkages to disease development are located in the same genetic regions and potentially could be controlled by the same gene. Furthermore, comparison of the mouse/rat genetic regions with regions of association to human inflammatory diseases, also demonstrates some homologous loci between species. Some mouse strains can develop disease in more than one model for autoimmunity. This not only argues for some general mechanisms, but it also supports mechanisms related to the specific tissues attacked in the various autoimmune diseases. Here, we will discuss some aspects of shared autoimmunity in mouse models from a genetic point of view...|$|R

The nature, causes and consequences of this distinction are discussed.
