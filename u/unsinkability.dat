60|$|The {{loss of the}} Empress of Ireland awakens {{feelings}} {{somewhat different}} from those {{the sinking of the}} Titanic had called up on two continents. The grief for the lost and the sympathy for the survivors and the bereaved are the same; but there is not, and there cannot be, the same undercurrent of indignation. The good ship that is gone (I remember reading of her launch something like eight years ago) had not been ushered in with beat of drum as the chief wonder of the world of waters. The company who owned her had no agents, authorised or unauthorised, giving boastful interviews about her <b>unsinkability</b> to newspaper reporters ready to swallow any sort of trade statement if only sensational enough for their readers--readers as ignorant as themselves of the nature of all things outside the commonest experience of the man in the street.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{unqualified}} {{assertion of}} Titanic <b>unsinkability</b> appeared in The New York Times on 16 April 1912, {{a day after}} the tragedy. Philip A. S. Franklin, vice president of the International Mercantile Marine Company (White Star Line's holding company) stated after being told of the sinking, [...] "I thought her unsinkable, and I based my opinion on the best expert advice available. I do not understand it." [...] This comment was seized upon by the press, and the idea that the White Star Line had previously declared Titanic unsinkable (without qualification) gained immediate and widespread currency.|$|E
5000|$|The captain Vadim Demchenkov reminisced: [...] "Watch {{of three}} men {{ran from the}} engine room up the ladders due to they were already knee-deep or waist-deep into the water. Due to alarm the second {{engineer}} arrived at own place in the engine room and immediately he blocked clinkety door by the actuator from the main deck. The capacity of the tunnel of the ship was not less than 1500 tons. If {{it was filled with}} sea water, the loss of the vessel would have been inevitable. This ship had single-compartment <b>unsinkability,</b> but she was still afloat! Apparently, the grain coefficient of permeability was very small actually and the grain was not so actively washed away at sea due to was not big waves and the ship was not heavily pitching and rolling".|$|E
5000|$|Contrary {{to popular}} mythology, Titanic was never {{described}} as [...] "unsinkable", without qualification, until after she sank. Three trade publications (one {{of which was}} probably never published) described Titanic as practically unsinkable prior to her sinking, {{but there is no}} evidence that the notion of Titanic <b>unsinkability</b> had entered public consciousness until after the sinking. Harland and Wolff did not claim she was unsinkable, but a promotional item from the White Star Line stressed the safety of Olympic and Titanic, claiming that [...] "as far as it is possible to do so, these two wonderful vessels are designed to be unsinkable". Claims by trade publications that vessels were unsinkable or being practically unsinkable were not unique to the Olympic class liners or other White Star ships. Similar claims were made about the Cunarders Lusitania and Mauretania, and German liners Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and Kaiser Wilhelm II. Advanced safety features on these liners were heavily publicized, de-emphasizing the likelihood of these ships' sinking in a serious accident.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hull of the}} destroyer, {{like all}} ships in those days, was riveted. The {{greatest}} length is 92.75 m and width 9.07 m. Index extension was (L:B) = 10,23 (higher index ratio of length to width of the shell shows its degree of longitudinal flexibility). This allowed destroyers to withstand severe wave activity (five-meter wavelength of 100 meters). It also provided vysokohnuchkoyu steel (with a time fracture resistance of 55 kg / mm 2 [...] ).Strength and flexibility provided hull {{of a set of}} longitudinal and transverse ribs. Calculation of the frames was carried out from the stern to the bow of the ship. The main feature of the design of the shell was the use of a set of longitudinal ribs (41 - 139 units) in the boiler and engine room. The body is composed of 8-mm vertical stakes height 1050 mm, with double steel angles at the upper and lower edges, two dnyschevyh and other airborne stringer on each side, and one carling (350 × 1-1,5 mm [...] ) on each side.The whole design with 4 mm steel deck of the second floor and upper deck with longitudinal septa, 6-9 millimeter siding and 11.5 mm deck Stringer, were sufficiently strong and rigid structure, which was opposed longitudinal bending moment at different operating conditions.Since the construction of the ship included a double bottom mizhdonnyy space divided flora (peredilkamy) into compartments where fuel is stored. For machine and boiler compartment vertical keel gradually declined and proceeded to a vertical stem shaped and molded sternpost.Cross set consisting of frames (double angles 6 mm interconnected cakes - 4.5 mm sheets) and Bims upper and residential decks (5 mm angles). Nine metal main transverse bulkheads provided <b>unsinkability</b> ship.|$|E
40|$|Research on damage {{stability}} and <b>unsinkability</b> establishes {{the source of}} the knowledge according to a ship reaction after flooding the compartment. The flooding time of the damaged com-partment is one of the basic parameters which has influence on the rescue action. Knowledge of the flooding time compartment is very important for the commanding officer making decisions while fighting for <b>unsinkability</b> and survival of the ship. The computational method was designed to provide information about possibility of calculation a flooding time of damaged the auxiliary power plant. On the basic of the built computer program, a simulation of the flooding process of the damaged com-partment ship’s type 888 was shown. Results received from research can be basic information to make a decision to carry out a proper action of damage control.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{research on}} damage stability and <b>unsinkability.</b> The result {{of it is}} a valuable source of knowledge of behaving a ship while flooding its compartments. In the paper, a short description of accidents and damages of Polish warships taking place in 1985 - 2004 is presented. The time when compartments are flooded (tf) and stability parameters are one of the key elements which have influence on a rescue action. The knowledge of the time mentioned and a metacentric height (GM) are very important for a commanding officer making decisions while damage of the ship. To provide the information about the time tf a new method was designed. Firstly, volume of damaged compartments was calculated. To estimate a real quantity of the water, the permeability of flooding compartment ȝ is used. Permeability of the main engine and auxiliary power plant was estimated on the basis of preliminary research presented in the paper. Its value, shown in the article, is dependent on the water level inside compartments. The metacentric height (GM), while flooding process of damage compartments, was calculated in the next step. On the basic of the built computer program, a simulation of the flooding process and value of metacentric height (GM) of the damaged main engine and auxiliary power plant ship’s type 888 was shown. The developed method was tested experimentally and results of the tests are presented in the paper. The results of the experiments can be a base to define general rules to make proper decisions during the process of damage control...|$|E
