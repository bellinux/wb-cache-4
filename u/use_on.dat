5|$|The LSWR M7 {{class is}} {{a class of}} 0-4-4 {{passenger}} tank locomotive built between 1897 and 1911.

Because of their utility, 105 were built and the class went through several modifications over five production batches. For this reason there were detail variations such as frame length.

The tunnel cost 625million Norwegian krone(NOK), of which Oslo Municipality had paid NOK170million. At first, the tunnel was used by commuter trains from Lillestrøm to Drammen and Spikkestad, and trains from Eidsvoll and Årnes used the tunnel and turned at Skøyen.

The Carlsberg horses also compete and put on demonstrations at many shows, promoting the brewery and the breed.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{is silent}} about archers on the Alamanni side. The Germans almost {{certainly}} did not have mounted archers, as this was an arm that evolved in the East and in any case, their longbows are unsuitable for <b>use</b> <b>on</b> horseback.

But this is contradicted by the archaeological record and by Ammianus himself in other parts of his account. It is virtually certain that there were a significant number of Alamanni foot archers at Strasbourg.|$|E

5|$|Analogue filters {{have played}} an {{important}} part in the development of electronics. Especially in the field of telecommunications, filters have been of crucial importance in a number of technological breakthroughs and have been the source of enormous profits for telecommunications companies. It should come as no surprise, therefore, that the early development of filters was intimately connected with transmission lines. Transmission line theory gave rise to filter theory, which initially took a very similar form, and the main application of filters was for <b>use</b> <b>on</b> telecommunication transmission lines. However, the arrival of network synthesis techniques greatly enhanced the degree of control of the designer.|$|E
