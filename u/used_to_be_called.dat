However due to their personnel having been reduced considerably in order to reach compatibility with NATO standards they were renamed and reorganized as divisions. In 2010, the Joint HQ command was renamed as 2nd Infantry Division Getica and received units from the 1st and the 4th Infantry divisions.|$|E

25|$|The {{commonly}} held view {{today is that}} the earliest settlement of the Norwegian coast belongs to one cultural continuum comprising the Fosna culture in southern and central Norway and what <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>called</b> the Komsa culture in the north.

The rapidity of this expansion is underlined by the fact that some of the earliest radiocarbon dates are actually from the north.|$|E

When a karakondžula found someone outdoors during the night of an unbaptized day, it would jump on his back, and make him carry it wherever it wanted. This torture would end only when roosters announced the dawn; at that moment the creature would release its victim and run away.|$|E
