5|$|Icos {{developed}} several drugs {{whose purpose}} was to disrupt the process of inflammation in the body. The research program focused on the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> inflammation rather than specific disorders. The compounds developed by Icos were tested in clinical trials {{in the areas of}} sepsis, multiple sclerosis, ischemic stroke, heart attack, pancreatitis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial cystitis, psoriasis, hemorrhagic shock, sexual dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome.|$|E
5|$|This {{classification}} {{was widely}} accepted but {{has also been}} criticized mainly because the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> epilepsy (which are {{a major determinant of}} clinical course and prognosis) were not covered in detail. In 2010 the ILAE Commission for Classification of the Epilepsies addressed this issue and divided epilepsies into three categories (genetic, structural/metabolic, unknown cause) that were refined in their 2011 recommendation into four categories and a number of subcategories reflecting recent technologic and scientific advances.|$|E
5|$|Icos {{was founded}} in 1989 by George Rathmann, Robert Nowinski, and Christopher Henney, each of whom had {{previously}} started another biotechnology company: Rathmann had created Amgen; Nowinski had launched Genetic Systems, later sold to Bristol-Myers Squibb; and Henney co-founded Immunex, later sold to Amgen. Icos was formed {{with the goal of}} developing new drugs to treat the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> inflammatory diseases and halt the disease process in the early stages. The name Icos comes from icosahedron, a 20-sided polyhedron, which is the shape of many viruses, and was chosen because the founders originally thought retroviruses might be involved in inflammation. The founders raised $33million in July1990 from many investors, including Bill Gates– who at the time was the largest shareholder, with 10% of the equity. The company initially had temporary offices in downtown Seattle, but moved to Bothell in September1990. Icos went public on June6, 1991, raising $36million. George Rathmann, seen as a guiding father to Icos, left the company in February2000, and was replaced as CEO and chairman by Paul Clark, a former executive at Abbott Laboratories. A former Icos manager named short-sighted leadership by Clark as a factor in the failure of the company to develop any other successful drugs apart from Cialis.|$|E

25|$|Denouncing {{the concept}} of saviors, spiritual leaders, and any other {{intermediaries}} to reality, Krishnamurti {{stressed the need for}} a revolution in the psyche of every human being.

25|$|The Panic of 1873 and the {{subsequent}} depression had several <b>underlying</b> <b>causes,</b> <b>of</b> which economic historians debate the relative importance. American post-Civil War inflation, rampant speculative investments (overwhelmingly in railroads), the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US, a large trade deficit, ripples from economic dislocation in Europe resulting from the Franco-Prussian War (1870–71), property losses in the Chicago (1871) and Boston (1872) fires, and other factors put a massive strain on bank reserves, which plummeted in New York City during September and October 1873 from US$50 million to $17 million.|$|E
25|$|Trait {{models have}} been criticized as being purely {{descriptive}} and offering little explanation of the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> personality. Eysenck's theory, however, proposes biological mechanisms as driving traits, and modern behavior genetics researchers have shown a clear genetic substrate to them. Another potential weakness of trait theories is that they may lead some people to accept oversimplified classifications—or worse, offer advice—based on a superficial analysis of personality. Finally, trait models often underestimate the effect of specific situations on people's behavior. Traits {{are considered to be}} statistical generalizations that do not always correspond to an individual's behavior.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} the frequency that diabetes is reported on death certificates of decedents with known diabetes and describe trends in reporting over 8 years. RESEARCH DESIGN ANDMETHODS—Data {{were obtained from}} 11, 927 participants with diabetes who were enrolled in Translating Research into Action for Diabetes, a multicenter prospective observational study of diabetes care in managed care. Data on decedents (N = 2, 261) {{were obtained from the}} National Death Index from 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2007. The primary dependent variables were the presence of the ICD- 10 codes for diabetes listed anywhere on the death certificate or as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death. RESULTS—Diabetes was recorded on 41 % of death certificates and as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death for 13 % of decedents with diabetes. Diabetes was significantly more likely to be reported on the death certificate of decedents dying of cardiovascular disease than all other causes. There was a statistically significant trend of increased reporting of diabetes as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death over time (P, 0. 001), which persisted after controlling for duration of diabetes at death. The increase in reporting of diabetes as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death was associated with a decrease in the reporting of cardiovascular disease as the <b>underlying</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> death (P, 0. 001) ...|$|R

25|$|Although many of peacebuilding's aims {{overlap with}} those of peacemaking, {{peacekeeping}} and conflict resolution, it is a distinct idea. Peacemaking involves stopping an ongoing conflict, whereas peacebuilding happens before a conflict starts or once it ends. Peacekeeping prevents the resumption of fighting following a conflict; it {{does not address the}} <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> violence or work to create societal change, as peacebuiding does. It also differs from peacebuilding in that it only occurs after conflict ends, not before it begins. Conflict resolution does not include some components of peacebuilding, such as state building and socioeconomic development.|$|E
25|$|Hahnemann {{believed}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> disease were phenomena that he termed miasms, and that homeopathic preparations addressed these. The preparations are manufactured using {{a process of}} homeopathic dilution, in which a chosen substance is repeatedly diluted in alcohol or distilled water, each time with the containing vessel being bashed against an elastic material, commonly a leather-bound book. Dilution typically continues well past the point where no molecules of the original substance remain. Homeopaths select homeopathics by consulting reference books known as repertories, and by considering {{the totality of the}} patient's symptoms, personal traits, physical and psychological state, and life history.|$|E
25|$|Many {{opinions}} and explanations appeared as other sources attempted {{to explain the}} causes. Public opinion polls have shown that an equal percentage of people believed that the riots were linked to communist groups versus those that blamed social problems like unemployment and prejudice. Those opinions concerning racism and discrimination emerged only three years after hearings conducted by a committee of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights took place in Los Angeles to assess the condition of relations between the police force and minorities. These hearings were also intended to make a ruling on the discrimination case against the police for their alleged mistreatment {{of members of the}} Nation of Islam. These different arguments and opinions still prompt debates over the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> the Watts riots.|$|E

25|$|Much {{recent work}} has been done to {{identify}} the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> conversion and related disorders and to better understand why conversion and hysteria appear more commonly in women. Current theoreticians tend to believe that there is no single cause for these disorders. Instead, the emphasis tends to be on the individual understanding of the patient and a variety of therapeutic techniques. In some cases, the onset of conversion disorder correlates to a traumatic or stressful event. There are also certain populations that are considered at risk for conversion disorder, including people suffering from a medical illness or condition, people with personality disorder, and individuals with dissociative identity disorder. However, no biomarkers have yet been found to support the idea that conversion disorder is caused by a psychiatric condition.|$|E
25|$|Addams {{was a major}} synthesizing {{figure in}} the {{domestic}} and international peace movements, serving as both a figurehead and leading theoretician; she was influenced especially by Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy and by the pragmatism of philosophers John Dewey and George Herbert Mead. She envisioned democracy, social justice and peace as mutually reinforcing; they all had to advance together to achieve any one. Addams became an anti-war activist from 1899, {{as part of the}} anti-imperialist movement that followed the Spanish–American War. Her book Newer Ideals of Peace (1907) reshaped the peace movement worldwide to include ideals of social justice. She recruited social justice reformers like Alice Hamilton, Lillian Wald, Florence Kelley, and Emily Greene Balch to join her in the new international women's peace movement after 1914. Addams's work came to fruition after World War I, when major institutional bodies began to link peace with social justice and probe the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> war and conflict.|$|E
25|$|After the 1948–49 Arab-Israeli War, the Golan Heights were partly demilitarised by the Israel-Syria Armistice Agreement. During the {{following}} years, the area {{along the border}} witnessed thousands of violent incidents; the armistice agreement was being violated by both sides. The <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> the conflict were a disagreement over {{the legal status of}} the demilitarised zone (DMZ), cultivation of land within it and competition over water resources. Syria claimed that neither party had sovereignty over the DMZ. Israel contended that the Armistice Agreement dealt solely with military concerns and that she had political and legal rights over the DMZ. Israel wanted to assert control up till the 1923 boundary in order to reclaim the Hula swamp, gain exclusive rights to Lake Galilee and divert water from the Jordan for its National Water Carrier. During the 1950s, Syria registered two principal territorial accomplishments: it took over Al-Hammah enclosure south of Lake Tiberias and established a de facto presence on and control of eastern shore of the lake.|$|E

25|$|School meals {{have been}} shown to {{increase}} the nutritional status of school-age children in a variety of ways. For example, there is a notable reduction in malnutrition via diet diversification and an increased absorption of micronutrients. Overall, the amount of kilocalories in a child's diet is expanded when they are given nutritional resources that they would otherwise have little to no access to. By increasing the amount of nutrition a child receives at school, that child's family's nutrition status also increases as their familial demand and requirement for food is decreased. Targeted take-home rations therefore increase the nutrition of the family as a whole, and not just the members of a given family that are of primary-school age. However, criticisms of school meals' impacts on nutrition stem from the idea that increased nutrition through school meals is only a temporary fix and does not target the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> malnutrition, such as high food prices and poor food distribution systems that prevent food security.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} {{detailed}} analyses of the unrest was a study produced shortly after the riots by a Special Committee of the California Legislature, entitled To Rebuild is Not Enough. After extensive research, the Committee concluded that the inner-city conditions of poverty, segregation, lack of educational and employment opportunities, police abuse and unequal consumer services created the <b>underlying</b> <b>causes</b> <b>of</b> the riots. It also pointed {{to changes in the}} American economy and the growing ethnic diversity of Los Angeles as important sources of urban discontent, which eventually exploded on the streets following the King verdicts. Another official report, The City in Crisis, was initiated by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners and made many of the same observations as the Assembly Special Committee about the growth of popular urban dissatisfaction leading up to the unrest. In their study Farrell and Johnson found similar factors which included the diversification of the L.A. population, tension between the successful Korean businesses and other minorities, use of excessive force on minorities by LAPD, and the effect of laissez-faire business on urban employment opportunities.|$|E
