5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins to prop <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations {{of the body and}} tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E

When the double album gatefold sleeve was opened <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and back cover photographs were mirrored symmetrically in a style reminiscent {{of the work of}} graphic artist M.

25|$|Despite {{the distractions}} of Operation Strength in their rear, the North Vietnamese still had {{portions}} of six combat-ready regiments from two divisions in offensive positions {{southwest of the}} Plain of Jars. Both divisional headquarters had been moved forward; the Communists set <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> 74B command post northeast of Long Tieng to manage them. On 2 March, a contingent of Thai artillery arrived and shifted to a forward fire base on Skyline Ridge. At about this time, the PAVN finished constructing a new infiltration road, Route 54; they began to move infantry and artillery toward Sam Thong.|$|E
25|$|Termites are detritivores and {{therefore}} do not exhibit pursuit behaviors, however ants and wasps {{can be highly}} predatory and are known to pursue prey in groups. For example, termite-hunting ants of the genus Pachycondyla, also known as Matabele ants, form raiding parties consisting of ants of different castes, such as soldier ants and worker ants. Soldier ants are much larger than worker ants, with more powerful mandibles and more robust exoskeletons, and so they make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> lines of raiding parties and are responsible for killing prey. Workers usually butcher and carry off the killed prey, while supporting the soldiers. The raiding parties are highly mobile and move aggressively into the colonies of termites, often breaking through their outer defenses and entering their mounds. The ants do not completely empty the mound of termites, instead they only take a few, allowing the termites to recover their numbers so that the ants have {{a steady stream of}} prey.|$|E

500|$|The G-spot, {{also called}} the Gräfenberg spot (for German {{gynecologist}} Ernst Gräfenberg), is characterized as an erogenous area of the vagina that, when stimulated, may lead to strong sexual arousal, powerful orgasms and potential female ejaculation.

500|$|In 1956, Holloway revived his {{flagging}} career, {{creating the}} role of Alfred P. Doolittle in the extraordinarily successful original Broadway production of My Fair Lady, which {{was made into a}} hit film in 1964 with Holloway in the same role. Owing to the film's success, he was able to get good roles in more films, including Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter alongside Herman's Hermits. His films in the early 1970s included The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Flight of the Doves and <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front.</b> [...] His final film was Journey into Fear, released in 1976.|$|E
500|$|Holloway {{appeared}} for {{the first}} time in a major British television series in the BBC's 1967 adaptation of P. G. Wodehouse's Blandings Castle stories, playing Beach, the butler, to Ralph Richardson's Lord Emsworth. His portrayal of Beach was received with critical reservation, but the series was a popular success. After My Fair Lady, Holloway was able to get film roles in Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter (1968), which starred the 1960s British pop group Herman's Hermits, The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Flight of the Doves and <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front,</b> all in the early 1970s.

500|$|Marco's {{realization}} that Mulberry Street intersects with Bliss Street {{leads him to}} imagine a group of police escorts. The scene becomes a parade, as he then imagines a grand stand filled with the mayor and aldermen; an airplane dropping confetti; and, in the final incarnation of the scene, a Chinese man, a magician pulling rabbits out of a hat, and {{a man with a}} ten-foot beard. Now almost home, he snaps back to reality and rushes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> steps, eager to tell his father his imagined story. However, when his father questions him about what he saw on his way home, his face turns red and he says, [...] "Nothing...but a plain horse and wagon on Mulberry Street." ...|$|E

We couldn't play music on the street so I was wearing an ear piece with my track playing.

Everyone worked so hard in getting the video together considering the conditions, I was really grateful! ...|$|E

Meanwhile, Mulder {{believes}} the creature that kills the homeowners moves through the yard, under the grass. Scully shares her lab results: the [...] "blood" [...] on the ceiling fan and on the dog is actually grime, as the neighborhood is built {{on top of an}} old landfill. Mulder believes the Klines were buried in their yard, so the next day he gets a backhoe to dig <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> yard, telling the neighbors he's putting in a reflecting pool, which is not against the community rules. They don't find the Klines, but they do find the tacky windmill that had been mysteriously delivered to the Klines before they died. The windmill bears a label from Gogolak's company.|$|E
500|$|The handle {{material}} of the CQC-6 {{is composed of}} two titanium liners utilizing a Walker linerlock and a single or double detent as the locking mechanism, although one experimental model exists with a ratchet lock. [...] Titanium bolsters make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> half of the knife with the back half represented by linen micarta scales. The reasons for using titanium as a linerlock material were due to its memory characteristics and corrosion resistance. [...] The screws in the handle, and pivot are traditional straight-head screws to accommodate easy disassembly in the field with an improvised tool, if needed. [...] Most models feature traction grooves for a more secure grip in a wet environment and a chamfered lockface. Early knives were made with black linen micarta and later models featured a proprietary green color made exclusively for Emerson. [...] A pocket clip {{held in place by}} three screws allows the knife to be clipped to a pocket, web-gear, or MOLLE.|$|E
500|$|During the summer, the {{subtropical}} ridge in the Atlantic Ocean strengthens, bringing in increasingly humid {{air from the}} warm Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico. [...] Once precipitable water values exceed , afternoon and evening thunderstorms break out at the western periphery of the {{subtropical ridge}} across the Southeast on a daily basis. [...] Summer {{is the time of}} the second rainfall maximum during the year across Georgia, and the time of the main rainfall maximum in Florida. [...] Evidence shows that increased air pollution is causing rainfall to reach a maximum in intensity {{during the middle of the}} week. [...] During the late summer and fall, tropical cyclones move into the region from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, supplying portions of the area with one-quarter of their annual rainfall, on average. [...] Fall is the time of the rainfall minimum across Louisiana. [...] Sometimes, Gulf moisture sneaks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Front</b> Range of Rockies as far north as the northern High Plains, bringing higher dewpoint air into states such as Wyoming and Montana.|$|E

500|$|Males find females by {{following}} their scent trails, sometimes tracking them {{for hundreds of}} meters a day. If a female is found and flees, the male follows. Courtship involves side-by-side parallel [...] "flowing" [...] behavior, tongue flicking along the back and excited lashing of the tail. Pairs stay together {{for one or two}} days after mating. Males chase away their rivals and engage in combat. Often, this also starts with the aforementioned flowing behavior before culminating in the dramatic [...] "adder dance." [...] In this act, the males confront each other, raise <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> part of the body vertically, make swaying movements and attempt to push each other to the ground. This is repeated until one of the two becomes exhausted and crawls off to find another mate. Interestingly, Appleby (1971) notes that he has never seen an intruder win one of these contests, as if the frustrated defender is so aroused by courtship that he refuses to lose his chance to mate. There are no records of any biting taking place during these bouts.|$|E
500|$|On 26 August 1914, {{during the}} first month of World War I, the German light cruiser Magdeburg ran aground near the island of Odensholm in the Gulf of Finland. Her escort, the V25-class torpedo boat SMS V-26, failed to pull her off and rescued part of the crew before Pallada and the {{protected}} cruiser [...] appeared and opened fire. The Germans blew <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> part of the ship, but failed to demolish the rest of the ship. They failed to destroy their naval codebooks, which were discovered by the Russians. A copy was later given to the British where it proved enormously helpful to Room 40 in reading German wireless traffic for much of the war. Together with the armoured cruiser , Pallada unsuccessfully searched for German ships between Bornholm and Danzig on the night of 27 August. Less than two months later, on 11 October, Pallada was torpedoed by the German submarine U-26 and blew up with the loss of all hands, the first Russian warship sunk during the war.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot {{at the base of}} the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for conformation shows. Blue dogs can have tan midway up the legs and extending <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows. Both colour forms can have a white [...] "star" [...] on the forehead called the [...] "Bentley Mark", after a legendary dog owned by Tom Bentley. Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called [...] "creeping tan". The Cattle Dog has a double coat—the short, straight outer guard hairs are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog's skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.|$|E
