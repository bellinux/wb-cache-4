40|$|Thesis (MBA) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2013 The North West Province {{like any}} other {{province}} in South Africa receives transfers from national government, which get distributed accordingly to provincial departments. However, some provincial departments in the North West {{over the years have}} not been spending all the monies allocated to them by the provincial treasury. These monies are meant {{for the development of the}} province and consequently addressing of socioeconomic ills that confronts the province. This study recognised this as a critical concern that warranted inquisitiveness. Whether this behaviour, namely, underspending could be predicted and consequently prevented was not clear and thus gave rise to this study. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to establish whether <b>under-spending</b> provincial departments and fully-spending departments, respectively, displayed a specific spending pattern throughout the financial year. Data necessary to conduct this study was collected from Quarterly Provincial Expenditure Reports and Annual Reports of provincial departments of the North-West Provincial Government. The collected data was analysed by means of ratio analysis. The research results revealed that <b>under-spending</b> provincial departments and fully-spending departments, respectively, displayed spending patterns throughout the financial year. that are distinct to that of each other. The study further revealed that <b>under-spending</b> departments followed a slow pattern of spending. The converse was revealed for full y-spending departments. The study went on to suggest a blueprint pattern of spending that could be followed by depa 11 ments throughout the financial year. Master...|$|E
40|$|South Africa’s provincial {{governments were}} {{the subject of}} {{vigorous}} debate during 2007. This culminated in an official policy review, that included potentially far-reaching questions about their status, role and future existence. The review was initiated during a period marked by serious concerns about the capacity of provincial governments to implement programmes and services through budgeted expenditure. It focused {{on the ability of}} provinces to spend allocated revenues on activities adequately with a direct bearing on social and economic development. This debate was revisited by this research in focusing specifically on the question of provincial <b>under-spending.</b> the purpose was to investigate provincial expenditure preceding the 2007 policy review, with the objective to empirically observe the general shape, extent and pattern of provincial incapacity to spend revenues. Based on this, the idea was to consider how expenditure performance might rationally influence subsequent and continuing policy debate pertaining to the future configuration of provincial government. The research presents an analysis of provincial expenditure for a four-year timeframe (2002 – 2006), indicating that <b>under-spending</b> seems to be secondary to the more significant problem of spending volatility, or rapid shifts between under- and over-spending. the complexity of expenditure performance suggests that past and continuing debate about the wholesale or even partial restructuring of the provincial system of government needs to be moderated by a more incremental and escalatory series of responses...|$|E

40|$|This project {{investigates the}} {{consequences}} of the recent cuts in federal budget allocations for education.

A majority of those surveyed believe that budget cuts do affect the quality of education at the university, for example through deteriorating quality of faculty (specifically classes being taught by TA???s), higher student to teacher ratios, student services, crowded classes, fewer opportunities, tech support for classrooms, and cutting programs as examples of decreasing quality.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{consequences}} of accounting intervention into institutionalized organizations in transition. The context for the study was the implementation of the 1988 Education Reform Act in England and Wales, known as the Local Management of Schools (LMS) Initiative, which devolved budgets from Local Education Authorities (LEAs) to individual schools. We develop the argument that the emergence of new accounting practices in institutions and the accompanying process of re-institutionalization is not inconsequential, but detail rather the accounting’s re-presentation of teachers as costs does accompany a re-distribution of the authority and resources in schools and LEAs, thus implying that administrative changes and organizational actions are not decoupled. Our case study of institutional change focuses as an illustration on the example of school ‘carry forwards’ (budget <b>under-spends)</b> as we analyze the ability of accounting practices to influence legitimacy and cognition by stimulating new debates, according them increased visibility and endowing them with significance.

40|$|The present paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} fuel poverty {{taking into account the}} arbitrages made by households when they are facing economic constraints. Fuel poverty is still lacking a common definition throughout Europe: while the UK and France have (different) official definitions, there is still no definition in a country like Germany, or at the European level. Where definitions exist, they often consider that fuel poor households have high energy needs. The possibility of being fuel poor even without having high energy needs and the various arbitrage possibilities of households - i. e. to <b>under-spend</b> and use too little energy - are not systematically discussed. Our paper tries to fill that gap by putting fuel poverty into the larger context of constraints faced by households. Based on a graphical analysis, it shows that different situations of fuel poverty might occur. It results in the identification of two distinct fuel poverty problems: an 'energy inequality' problem, reflected by the fact that some households pay disproportionately high energy bills, and an 'energy affordability' problem that can affect a larger share of the population. It finally explores the two types of fuel poverty for European countries and discusses policy implications...|$|R
40|$|We use a {{quadratic}} {{form in the}} key spending variables to estimate optimal government spending, using World Value Survey data covering 78 countries.

An alternative, “iterative” approach to estimating optimal government spending found similar optimal spending levels, lending credibility to the results.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{stochastic}} oil demand on optimal oil extraction paths and tax, spending and government debt policies are analyzed when the oil demand schedule is linear and preferences quadratic. Without prudence, optimal oil extraction {{is governed by}} the Hotelling rule and optimal budgetary policies by the tax and consumption smoothing principle. Volatile oil demand brings forward oil extraction and induces a bigger government surplus. With prudence, the government depletes oil reserves even more aggressively and engages in additional precautionary saving financed by postponing spending and bringing taxes forward, especially if it has substantial monopoly power on the oil market, gives high priority to the public spending target, is very prudent, and future oil demand has high variance. Uncertain economic prospects induce even higher precautionary saving and, if non]oil revenue shocks and oil revenue shocks are positively correlated, even more aggressive oil extraction. In contrast, prudent governments deliberately underestimate oil reserves which induce less aggressive oil depletion and less government saving, but less so if uncertainty about reserves and oil demand are positively correlated.

5000|$|Although details vary across regimes, {{the most}} common {{approach}} to creating incentives to reduce expenditure {{is to use a}} regulatory period consisting of many years. The allowed revenue is set once {{at the beginning of the}} regulatory period and there is no clawback of over-spend or <b>under-spend</b> at the end of the regulatory period - thereby allowing the regulated firm to keep some or all of the cost savings it makes during the regulatory period. The operating expenditure input to the building block model is usually based closely on the observed operating expenditure at the end of the previous regulatory period. This approach ensures reasonably strong incentives to reduce operating expenditure in the early years of a regulatory period but can, in principle, lead to weak incentives to reduce operating expenditure in the later years of a regulatory period. One way to solve this problem is to base the operating expenditure not just on a single [...] "test year" [...] of the previous regulatory period but on the average of the previous years. In practice this problem is, instead, often addressed with some form of [...] "efficiency carry-over" [...] or [...] "efficiency benefit sharing" [...] scheme.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a study {{within the field of}} public budgeting. It focuses on the capital budget, and it {{attempts}} to model and analyze the capital budgeting process using a framework previously developed in the literature of incremental budgeting. Within this framework the paper seeks to determine empirically whether the movement of capital expenditure budgets can be represented as the routine application of incremental adjustments over an existing base of allocations and whether further, forward-looking adjustments can be found. Its setting is a British publicly-owned corporation. The paper proposes an extended model of incremental budgeting which explains absolute change in budget allocations by introducing variables expressing: current expenditure outturn, over- or <b>under-spend</b> of previous allocations, previous budgetary cuts, and wider financial pressures in the corporation's environment. Planning variables are then included in an attempt to uncover purposive behavior. The analysis reveals different patterns of allocation for peripheral and for mainstream investments. The former appear to grow in an incremental fashion with no response to leading planning variables. The latter exhibit responsiveness to planning variables, and allocations do not take the form of routine incremental adjustments to the existing base. An interpretation of the results is undertaken. The analysis points to revisions of existing theory and suggests fresh ways of looking at, and systematically modeling, the organizational system of resource allocation. decision process, resource allocation, incrementalism-expanded model, planning, public capital budgeting...|$|R
5000|$|Historically much {{interest}} has focussed on the incentives on the regulated firm to enhance efficiency - that is, incentives {{to reduce its}} expenditure while maintaining a given {{quantity and quality of}} output. In principle, the building block model can be designed so as to yield either very low-powered incentives to minimise expenditure (which is sometimes known as cost-of-service or rate-of-return regulation) or very high-powered incentives. The building block model can be implemented {{in such a way as}} to yield very high-powered incentives to reduce expenditure by (a) setting the operating and capital expenditure inputs in the building block model on the basis of forecasts which are independent of the regulated firm's own actions, and (b) not [...] "clawing back" [...] any over-spend or <b>under-spend</b> at the end of the regulatory period. However, very high-powered incentives create their own problems - they create strong incentives on the firm to cut expenditure or defer capital expenditure - even at the expense of reducing service quality. In addition, high powered incentives expose the regulated firm to higher levels of risk and give rise to strong incentives to lobby the regulator for a higher target level of revenue. Economic theory does not support the use of very high-powered incentives and, in practice, almost all practical regulatory regimes tend to involve medium-powered incentives.|$|R

30|$|Our results {{indicate}} that, first of all, the decision {{whether or not}} to combat corruption is an economic one, meaning that under certain conditions, public administrations will tolerate certain levels of corruption. Second, the results suggest that, compared with the decentralized provision of public goods, the centralized provision might be more efficient under very restrictive conditions, such as when there are uniform initial levels of corruption across regions, and also assuming that the central government’s staff recruitment procedures are efficient in weeding out potential corrupt public workers. Third, the results seem to show that decentralization is more efficient, compared to centralization, when heterogeneity among jurisdictional units is taken into account. In such a scenario, the decentralized provision of public goods would be more efficient because regional governments would spend optimal amounts of finance on fighting corruption while the centralized provision of public goods might lead to over-spending on combating corruption (denoting a waste of public resources) or <b>under-spending</b> (which would imply a tolerance of corruption). Lastly, this result is not robust in the event of regional heterogeneity when the central administration that provides public goods takes into account regional specificities, which means that a deconcentrated provision of public goods might be more efficient that a decentralized one.|$|E

With prudence, the government depletes oil reserves more aggressively and engages in precautionary saving financed by postponing spending and bringing taxes forward, especially if it has substantial monopoly power on the oil market, gives high priority to the public spending target and is very prudent, and future oil demand has high variance. If the oil market is fairly competitive, prudent governments deliberately under-estimate oil reserves and under-predict future oil prices. This leads to less aggressive oil depletion and less government saving. However, if the government attaches high priority to raising public spending to its bliss level, prudence implies a tendency to over-predict future oil prices and reserves which induces more aggressive oil depletion and more government saving.

40|$|Why do {{politicians}} distort public investments? And {{given that}} public investments are poor because presumably {{that is what}} is politically rational, what types of reforms are likely to be both efficiency improving and compatible with the interests of politicians? This paper explores these two questions in the context of Mongolia. It argues that Mongolian members of parliament have an incentive to over-spend on smaller projects that bring benefits to specific geographical localities and to <b>under-spend</b> on large infrastructure that would bring economic benefits to Mongolia on the whole. The incentive for the former is that members of parliament internalize the political benefits from the provision of particular, targeted benefits to specific communities. The disincentive for the latter is that large infrastructure carries a political risk because the political faction in control of that particular ministry would have access to huge rents and become politically too powerful. The identity of these"winners"is uncertain ex ante, given the relatively egalitarian and ethnically homogenous nature of Mongolia's society and polity. Anticipating this risk, members of parliament are reluctant to fund these projects. Since these large infrastructure projects are crucial for national growth, neglecting them hurts all members of parliament. Members of parliament will therefore support reforms that collectively tie their hands by safeguarding large, strategic investment projects from political interference thereby ensuring that no political faction becomes too powerful. This protection of mega-projects would need {{to be part of a}} bargain that also allows geographical targeting of some percentage of the capital budget.

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} {{perspective}} on why majority-poor democracies might fail to pursue pro-poor policies. In particular, it discusses why in Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) party led by Lalu Prasad Yadav, which claimed to represent the poor and under-privileged, did not claim and spend large amounts of centre–state fiscal transfers that could have reduced poverty, provided employment and benefitted core supporters. Despite this failure, the RJD and Yadav enjoyed repeated electoral success between 1990 and 2005, {{in a context of}} credible elections and a majority of poor voters. I have called this combination of events the ‘Bihar paradox’. I explore this paradox by: 1. Creating two panel data sets on fiscal transfers in the form of Centrally Sponsored Schemes and State Plan Allocations made from the Government of India to sixteen main states over an eight-year period from 1997 - 98 to 2004 - 05. 2. Using the panel data sets to show that, during this period: a) Poor states in India claimed and spent less of the centre–state fiscal transfers available to them than wealthier states b) Relative to other states, the Government of Bihar claimed and spent less fiscal transfers than expected of a state at its level of poverty. 3. Explaining how Yadav’s electoral strategy contributed to this under-claiming and <b>under-spending.</b> For Yadav, the political imperative was to marginalize the upper castes and provide selective benefits to key supporters. This led to large numbers of public sector vacancies which eroded state administrative capacity in all but a few ‘pockets of productivity’, which in turn led to poor results for general development outcomes. The Bihar story is relevant to areas of research variously labelled as ‘state-building’, ‘capacity development’ and ‘public sector reform’. It is another warning about {{how easy it is to}} foster pessimism by attributing governance problems in poor countries to deeply embedded historical or cultural factors, when they may have more immediate, political and tractable causes...|$|E
40|$|This paper quantifies {{the impact}} of {{terrorism}} and conflicts on income per capita growth in Asia for 1970 - 2004. Our panel estimations show that transnational terrorist attacks had a significant growth-limiting effect. An additional terrorist incident per million persons reduces gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth by about 1. 5 %. In populous countries, many additional attacks are needed to achieve such a large impact. Transnational terrorism reduces growth by crowding in government expenditures. Unlike developing countries, developed countries are able to absorb terrorism without displaying adverse economic consequences; an internal conflict has the greatest growth concern, about twice that of transnational terrorism. Conflict variables are associated with smaller investment shares and increased government spending, with the crowding in of government spending being the dominant influence. For developing Asian countries, intrastate and interstate wars have a much greater impact than terrorism does on the crowding-in of government spending. When regime types-democratic and autocratic-are taken into account, in our research, {{we found that the}} precision of the estimates increases with the increasing significance of transnational terrorist attacks. Policy recommendations indicate the need for rich Asian countries to assist their poorer neighbors in coping with the negative growth consequences of political violence. Failure to assist may result in region-wide repercussions. This is particularly relevant as production becomes fragmented in Asia in order to profit from comparative advantage and as regional infrastructure networks link Asia to exploit scale economies. In the latter case, conflict and terrorism in one country can create bottlenecks with region-wide economic consequences. Moreover, prime-target Western countries-e. g., the United States and the United Kingdom-have a responsibility to bolster Asian defenses against terrorism as attacks against Western interests have been shifted, in part, to Asian venues since the 9 / 11 attacks in the United States. The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and European Union link can assist with coordinating efforts to quell conflicts and eliminate terrorism, but this requires putting recent declarations into practice. The Asian Development Bank and the World Bank could play pivotal roles, especially after a conflict ends, to channel aid for reconstruction so that once-embattled countries can recover rapidly. Nongovernmental organizations and the United Nations could also assist in this post-conflict recovery. The Asian Development Band and ASEAN could coordinate and fund counterterrorism spending to curb overspending on defensive measures and bolster <b>under-spending</b> on proactive measures.

40|$|Summary Macroeconomic {{performance}} {{continued its}} steady improvement during 2007, with quite strong growth, moderate inflation, a reasonably stable exchange rate, and a strongly performing stock market. A promising sign has been rapid investment growth, although {{the global economic}} slow-down predicted for 2008 is likely to reduce Indonesia's exports, and therefore its growth rate. Moreover, rapid increases in food and energy prices on world markets seem likely to require some {{tightening of monetary policy}} to keep inflation in check. The 2008 budget finalised in November assumed a world oil price of $ 60 per barrel, even though the actual price was already closer to $ 90. By February it reached $ 100, and the government announced its intention to revise the budget further in light of this and of the likely impact of the coming global slow-down. While the impact of higher oil prices on the budget deficit can readily be accommodated, the subsidy cost of holding domestic energy prices constant will be enormous. <b>Under-spending</b> on infrastructure continues to be a problem-partly because so much revenue is being pre-empted for subsidies, but also because funding allocations are not being fully spent, and because coordination between different government jurisdictions is lacking. January 2008 saw the passing of former president Soeharto, whose 32 years in power dramatically reshaped the Indonesian economy. Despite the well-known human rights abuses and high level of corruption under his regime, the government observed a seven-day period of mourning, and there was a genuine display of grief on the part of many ordinary Indonesians. There have been worrying developments in relation to two institutions established as part of Indonesia's post-Soeharto democratisation, and in relation to the parliament (DPR) itself. The Business Competition Supervisory Commission's decisions on the mobile phone industry appear likely to do further damage to foreign investors' perceptions of Indonesia, and to be harmful to consumers' interests. The DPR's appointment of five new members of the Anti-Corruption Commission (KPK) followed a closed-door selection process, the outcome of which suggested that the commission faces capture and subversion by other public sector institutions seeking to block anti-corruption efforts. Finally, a case brought by the KPK against officials of the central bank, including the current governor, has provided strong evidence of the apparently widespread practice of government agencies bribing DPR members. ...|$|E

(Business Management) The {{media and}} the Auditor General have {{extensively}} reported on the ineffective and unethical conduct of public sector employees regarding the procurement of goods and services. The Auditor General’s report demonstrates that {{there is evidence that}} public sector procurement processes are less than adequate to achieve constitutional procurement goals, which are to conduct processes that are fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective The delivery of services through staff and the procurement of goods and services from suppliers should take place on the basis of proper strategic leadership and management processes. Inappropriate planning and budgeting, failure to identify priorities, <b>under-spending</b> of budgets and ineffective procurement form part of the root causes of poor service delivery to the public, as ineffective procurement leads to the misallocation of resources and restricts the movement of resources to the right places at the right time The impact of improper procurement practices on society is very serious, as it delays the delivery of basic services and development. The money that could have been used to build schools and hospitals, improve sanitation, and many other infrastructure projects is wasted as a result of ineffective and inefficient procurement and management practices. The objective of the study is to ascertain the extent to which public entities comply with leading procurement practices as identified through literature review. This study focused on public entities. Proper procurement management processes in public entities will lead to better public service delivery, reduction in public resources wastage and increased public wealth. The literature study consist of two components, firstly, the study identified leading procurement practices and procurement objectives in the public sector, secondly, the study further determined leading management practices from two recognised sources of authority to establish the comprehensiveness and robustness of the leading procurement practices. Furthermore, a survey questionnaire was used {{to determine the extent to}} which the public entities apply leading procurement practices. Procurement is not just the purchasing of an item but a multifaceted process that includes information technology, risk management, business strategy and operations and legal compliance. All these activities should be coordinated to deliver organisational needs and goals. The procurement function objectives and activities should be directly linked to organisational goals, management plans and stakeholders’ expectations. The leading public procurement objectives, as determined by the literature review, are value for money, ethics and values, competitiveness, transparency, accountability, equitable (unbiased and fair dealing) and preferential procurement. The eight leading procurement practices determined through a literature review are procurement strategy and leadership (which include customer focus), procurement processes and policies, human resource management, procurement information technology, supplier management and procurement performance management. The study made use of questionnaires seeking information on current procurement practices in the public entities. The questionnaire was based on leading practices identified through this study. Respondents were asked to assess the extent to which their public entities apply these leading procurement practices. The three most applied leading procurement practices were indicated as leadership, process management and strategic planning. The study has identified that the public entities possibly apply five out of the eight leading procurement practices to a “lesser extent”, implying that they are being applied but not nearly as often or consistently as best practices would dictate. The study thus indicated that, although some of the leading public procurement practices are applied in the entities under review, these practices are often applied inconsistently and frequently not to the extent that they should be applied.

The government’s demand that Defence find savings totalling 10 billion over the next decade came out of the blue last week after hand-on-heart pledges, before and after the federal election, that defence would be spared major funding cuts. The announcement by defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon also came only days after he said defence faced a funding shortfall of up to 6 billion over a decade for the net personnel and operating costs of its ships, tanks and aircraft. There is, of course, no reason why defence should be immune from cuts being demanded of other departments, and it should not be unduly onerous for defence to find substantial savings in a budget now running at 22 billion with guaranteed real annual growth of three per cent. But the duplicity arises from Labor’s silence on the proposed cuts before last week. Before the election Kevin Rudd said Labor was committed to the forward defence outlays of the Howard government and would maintain maintain the three per real annual budget growth, but wanted money spent “more efficiently. ” In January finance minister Lindsay Tanner, head of {{the government}}’s razor gang, said Defence would not be subjected to extra cuts. And the defence force chief, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, said efficiency savings would only affect a limited part of the defence organisation. Last week, only a day after Houston was reappointed for a second three-year term as defence force chief, the axe fell. Again hand-on-heart, Fitzgibbon pledged: “We won’t touch any area that affects operations or logisitics or capability. ” Instead, he told Sky News, “we’re talking about the business side of defence, the bureaucratic side, ensuring that it is running as leanly as possible. ” He said it was “pretty obvious to anyone who watches defence closely that on the non-uniform side there is a deal of fat. ” The obvious question is why Labor did not reveal the cuts before the election, especially if the fat on the non-uniform side was as obvious as Fitzgibbon now says it is. The standard political answer will, of course, be that the new government did not know the seriousness of the budget position and the extent of the fat in Defence until it assumed office and had access to the books. The more likely truth is that Labor kept planned cuts quiet because it knew the Howard government would use them to attack Labor for being soft on national security. As on so many other issues Rudd adopted a me-too approach on defence. Now the duplicity emerges. But does political duplicity matter? Perhaps the Rudd government is merely following the Howard government in practicing the politics of the disposable (and the core and non-core) promise. Perhaps, like the Howard government, it is not greatly worried about voter cynicism if it is retaining and building support on other issues - particularly while the coalition remains a shell-shocked rabble. Nor might the duplicity much matter if the government achieves cuts in defence bureaucratic spending that help it to overcome the likely shortfall in the net personnel and operating costs of front-line planes, warships and tanks. For years it has been an objective of defence to strengthen the so-called “teeth to tail” spending ratio. But that is a hope and not a promise. There are, in fact, four considerable potential dangers in the spending cuts ordered by Fitzgibbon. First, it has long been obvious that defence will require more, not less, money to meet currently planned capital investment levels and personnel and operating costs. It is not clear that administrative savings will deliver the funds or whether planned capability will have to take a hit to avoid what has been called the coming train wreck in defence funding. Second, to at least to some extent the announced cuts pre-empt the White Paper process now underway within defence. How and where to save money to protect military capabilities might have been left to the deeper and more analytical White Paper process. Third, while there is doubtless some fat, waste and mismanagement in defence, {{it is also true that}} the tempo of defence operations now is as high as it has been since the Vietnam war. Air Chief Marshal Houston has frequently stressed the role and the importance of the defence civilian bureaucracy in supporting troops on overseas deployments. It might be harder than Fitzgibbon thinks to sacrifice cvilians without affecting uniformed activities. Fourth, Defence is currently engaged in a rearmament and modernisation of the Australian defence force. It is acquiring new fighter jets and new warships and is planning to start preliminary work on new submarines. Something like 51 million in spending is planned under the current ten-year capability plan which is designed to overcome years of past <b>under-spending</b> on defence. Civilians play a major role in managing these acquisition projects. And, to adopt Kevin Rudd’s words: Guess what? Many other countries in the region - including China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia - are also modernising their military aircraft and ships. If this not an arms race, it certainly resembles an arms race very closely indeed. There is doubtless room for savings in the defence budget. But 1 billion a year for ten years seems a big ask in current circumstances. The suddenness, speed and scope of the cuts now being demanded by the Rudd government will require constant scrutiny to ensure that morale and capability are not compromised at a time when both need to be strong and steady. • Geoffrey Barker is a columnist with the Australian Financial Review and a frequent contributor to APO.
