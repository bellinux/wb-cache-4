5|$|On 26 October 1959, Vulcan B.1 XH498 {{participated in}} an airshow marking the opening of Wellington International Airport, {{formerly}} Rongotai Airport. After a ' touch-and-go landing' on Runway 34, it came around for a full stop landing. Turbulence and wind shear caused XH498 to land short of the runway threshold, the port <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> clipped the embankment at the Moa Point or southern end, damaging wing attachments, engine fuel lines and the main landing gear drag link, which was ruptured and unable to support the aircraft. The port wing tip nearly scraped the runway surface before {{it was able to}} lift off again, spilling fuel over the crowd. Pilot actions prevented a possible disaster as spectators were present on the western apron. XH498 flew to RNZAF Ohakea for a safe emergency landing on just the nose and starboard landing gear with little further damage. A UK repair team returned it to airworthiness; on 4 January 1960, XH498 departed, remaining in service until 19 October 1967.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{adopted a}} new {{philosophy}} for the attachment of the A350s main undercarriage {{as part of}} the switch to a composite wing structure. Each main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> is attached to the rear wing spar forward and to a gear beam aft, which itself is attached to the wing and the fuselage. To help reduce the loads further into the wing, a double side-stay configuration has been adopted. This solution resembles the design of the Vickers VC10.|$|E

25|$|On 23 August 2008, AIRES Flight 051 {{sustained}} substantial damage {{following the}} collapse of the right hand main landing gear on landing at Barranquilla-Ernesto Cortissoz Airport (BAQ), Colombia. None of the 31 occupants were injured. The Bombardier Dash 8-301, registered HK-3952, operated on an international flight from Curaçao-Hato International Airport (CUR). The approach and landing were normal, touching down about 770 metres past the threshold of runway 23. The crew noticed a vibration of the right hand main gear. The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> collapsed. There was no fire.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} had {{a square}} cross-section, parallel {{in the passenger}} cabin area and narrowing towards the tail. The passenger compartment had six rectangular windows on each side and the crew had an enclosed cabin forward of the wings. Each wing was braced to the lower fuselage with a parallel pair of struts; the forward of these was used to carry a main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> {{with the help of}} further robust strutting. The two and three-engined Viastras had their outer engines mounted just below the wings. The outer engines were enclosed by a narrow chord Townend ring, but the central engines of the tri-motored and single-engined Viastras were uncowled.|$|E
25|$|The first {{prototype}} {{proved to}} be overweight, while the new engines gave much less power than expected, delivering only 1,970hp compared with the expected 2,700hp. The Ki-93 made its first flight on 8 April 1945 from Tachikawa airfield; a successful 20 minute test of its low-speed handling characteristics, piloted by Lt. Moriya of the Koku Shinsa-bu (Air Examination Department) with 2nd Lt. Ikebayashi in the second seat. Unfortunately, the pilot undershot the runway and touched down in soft soil, ground-looping the aircraft and tearing off the port <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> and engine mount, also bending the six-blade propeller. Repairs were completed in four weeks but, {{the night before the}} scheduled second test flight, a B-29 bombing raid on Tachikawa destroyed the hangar housing the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|A BN-2A-20 {{fitted with}} floats. Twin floats were {{attached}} to the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs</b> and incorporated retractable landing gear.|$|R
50|$|The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs</b> {{were made}} of heavier-gauge metals and the wheels were fitted with the twin brake units of FB Mk VIs.|$|R
50|$|Mi-10GR: A single {{production}} Mi-10 {{fitted with}} Grebeshok (Comb) direction finding equipment, for ELINT (Electronic Intelligence) duties, in a pod slung between the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R
500|$|The second prototype, VX777, flew in September 1953. More {{representative}} of production aircraft, it was lengthened {{to accommodate a}} longer nose <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg,</b> featured a visual bomb-aiming blister under the cabin and was fitted with Bristol Olympus 100 engines of [...] thrust. At Falk's suggestion, a fighter-style control stick replaced the control wheel. Both prototypes had almost pure delta wings with straight leading edges. During trials in July 1954, VX777 was substantially damaged in a heavy landing at Farnborough. It was repaired and fitted with Olympus 101 engines of [...] thrust before resuming trials in October 1955. While exploring the high speed and high altitude flight envelope, mild buffeting and other undesirable flight characteristics were experienced while approaching the speed of sound, including an alarming tendency to enter an uncontrollable dive, unacceptable to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A) at Boscombe Down. The solution included the [...] "phase 2" [...] wing, featuring a kinked and drooped leading edge and vortex generators on the upper surface, first tested on 707A WD480. An auto-mach trimmer introduced a nose-up attitude when at high speeds; the control column had to be pushed rather than pulled to maintain level flight.|$|E
500|$|The {{loss of the}} {{prototype}} and {{some changes in the}} construction of the production model delayed the fulfilment of the contract. Further tests were conducted on the wing and it was found to withstand a g-force of 14. Modifications were made for the production model, including the use of flat plexiglass panels in the windscreen and the canopy to provide better visibility for the pilot. The instrument layout was improved and the upper rear fuselage behind the pilot's seat was re-shaped. The folding <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> covers were replaced by single plates. The main changes were the replacement of the engine with a modified version of the Hispano-Suiza 12Y engine made under licence by the Czechoslovak company Avia and the replacement of the cannon by a Swiss-made Oerlikon FF 20 mm cannon. The replacement engine was less powerful, generating [...] at [...] German-made Telefunken radios were to be installed but delays meant that only the first aircraft was delivered with a radio fitted. The production aircraft were numbered 2–13, as {{the prototype}} was number 1. The aircraft were built at the Rogožarski factory in Belgrade and the parts were assembled at the company hangar at Zemun. The first six aircraft were delivered by late March 1940 but delivery of the rest of the order was not completed until July due to delays by foreign suppliers. The first production aircraft was delivered to the VVKJ Test Group, where it was determined that the production aircraft were free of the faults in the prototype. The Test Group determined that the maximum speed, previously estimated at , was , at [...] By July 1940, a further series of 25 IK-3s had commenced construction at the Rogožarski factory.|$|E
2500|$|The final variant was the MS.345 which {{appeared}} in 1935. It had dihedral on the wings and a taller fin and rudder. The shock absorber mounting was simplified, with the four struts per side replaced with a Y-shaped strut between wing and <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg.</b> [...] The leg struts were now faired together and the wheels spatted. It was powered by a 100kW (140hp) Renault 4Pei engine.|$|E
50|$|The first {{prototype}} V-10 {{emerged with}} canted main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs</b> with single wheels {{on all four}} legs, {{as well as a}} retractable emergency escape chute extending below the cockpit and external auxiliary fuel tanks either side of the centre fuselage. As development progressed the main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs</b> were replaced with vertical units carrying twin wheels, twin nose undercarriage wheels after a period retaining the single wheels, an Auxiliary power unit (APU) installed behind the cockpit on the starboard side and emergency escape slide cables for use when the pallet is carried.|$|R
25|$|The Griffon engine drove an 11ft (3.35 m) {{diameter}} five-bladed propeller, some 7inches (17.8cm) {{larger than}} that fitted to the Mk XIV. To ensure sufficient ground clearance for the new propeller, the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs</b> were lengthened by 4.5". The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs</b> also had a 7.75inch (19.7cm) wider track to help improve ground handling. The designers then devised a system of levers to shorten the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs</b> by about eight inches as they retracted, because the longer legs {{did not have enough}} space in which to retract. These same levers extended the legs as they came down. The larger diameter four spoke mainwheels were strengthened to cope with the greater weights; post-war these were replaced by wider, reinforced three spoke wheels to allow Spitfires to operate from hard concrete or asphalt runways. When retracted the wheels were now fully enclosed by triangular doors which were hinged to {{the outer edge of the}} wheelwells.|$|R

2500|$|The {{undercarriage}} mountings were redesigned and the undercarriage {{doors were}} bowed {{in cross section}} allowing the legs to sit lower in the wells, eliminating the upper-wing blisters over the wheel wells and landing gear pivot points. Stronger undercarriage legs were raked 2inches (5.08cm) forward, making the Spitfire more stable {{on the ground and}} reducing the likelihood of the aircraft tipping onto its nose. During production of the Mk VIII and Mk IX a new <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> was introduced which had external v-shaped [...] "scissor-links" [...] fitted {{to the front of the}} leg; this also led to small changes in the shape of the undercarriage bay and leg fairings. Because the Spitfire was no longer to be used as a night fighter, the retractable landing lights were no longer fitted.|$|E
2500|$|The V3 {{differed}} from its predecessors in being powered by two DB 610 [...] "power system" [...] engines (using two DB 605s each, {{instead of the}} paired 601s) and room for two additional crew members. The first flight of the Me 261 V3 was in early 1943. This aircraft had the longest series of flight tests. On 16 April 1943, the Me 261 V3 was flown by Karl Baur over a distance of [...] in an elapsed time of 10 hours, setting an unofficial endurance record {{which could not be}} confirmed due to war conditions. In July 1943, the Me 261 V3's hydraulics failed on landing and the port <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> collapsed. The V3 was transported to Oranienburg for repairs, and after that used on a few long-range missions for the Luftwaffes reconnaissance division. Its ultimate fate is unknown.|$|E

50|$|The {{manually}} retractable {{main undercarriage}} {{is composed of}} a single 350 x 135mm diameter wheel retracting backwards into the wheel well, which is closed off by doors operated by the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs,</b> and a fixed 200 X 50mm tail-wheel.|$|R
2500|$|Long floats, {{each with}} a {{displacement}} of 5.2 m3 and a single step were mounted on pairs of very wide chord vertical members that joined the lift struts {{at the same point}} as those going upwards to the centre section. [...] Bracing was provided by a single, similar strut on each side from float to lower fuselage, leaning backwards at about 60°. [...] No tail float was necessary as the 440 sat at flight attitude on the water. Though designed for a floatplane role, the 440 could and did fly as a landplane. [...] In that configuration the main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> replaced the forward of the two float struts and the axle was linked to the lower fuselage by a V form pair of radius struts. In both configurations, the offensive armament of torpedoes or bombs was carried on the fuselage underside, between the undercarriage legs.|$|E
2500|$|The closely cowled {{radial engine}} set the {{diameter}} of the H.26's short nose and drove a two blade propeller behind a very large diameter domed spinner. [...] The Salmson was initially cooled with a semi-circular Botali radiator {{to the rear of the}} engine but this proved ineffective and was replaced with a pair of Chaussons, one on each forward <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg.</b> The H.26 had a fixed conventional undercarriage with mainwheels on a centrally hinged split axle, enclosed within a lift-contributing wing-like fairing and supported by N-form struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons on each side. Originally, these were reinforced by long vertical struts from the shock absorber attachments to the upper wing central section. [...] These were discarded when the interplane wires were replaced by the faired interplane struts, which extended downwards to the rear undercarriage structure; the tops of the shock absorber struts were relocated to mid-fuselage on the engine mounting.|$|E

Botanists who examined the weeds clinging to the <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> estimated that the aircraft itself lies not far from the island at a depth of approximately [...] The <b>undercarriage</b> <b>leg</b> is now on public display at the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia.|$|E
50|$|Two Lyul'ka AL-5 engines were {{fitted in}} long {{nacelles}} {{forward of the}} wings, exhausting through long jetpipes {{at the rear of}} the nacelles, aft of the wing trailing edge. The engines were mounted in this fashion to make room for the retracted main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs,</b> two on each side attached to the engine nacelles under the wings. The paired main <b>undercarriage</b> <b>legs,</b> side by side, retracted in opposite directions, inboard forwards and outboard rearwards, with the single mainwheels rotating 90 degrees to lie flat under the long jetpipes of the AL-5 engines. To boost takeoff performance, two JATO bottles could be attached to the rear fuselage. Performance was also improved when Lyulka AL-5F (forseerovannyy - afterburning) engines were fitted.|$|R
