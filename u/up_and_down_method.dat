The fatigue {{property}} tests {{have been carried}} out for the forging steel of grade E and the casting steel of grade E by using the <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method</b> and grouping method in the paper. The two kinds of steel’s fatigue limits have been obtained with the <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method.</b> With the grouping method, the P-S-N curve equations of high-cycle fatigue have been obtained. The confidence level is 90 % and the probabilities of failure are 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 %. The test results show that the fatigue property of the forging material are superior to the casting apparently. To some extent, the test results are valuable for fatigue reliability designating of train coupler...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – SF 6 (sulphur hexafluoride) is the gas most {{commonly}} used in high voltage power equipments. Due {{to the fact that}} SF 6 is a greenhouse gas with a very high global warming potential, alternatives have been searched for over the last years. This paper presents the fundamental insulation characteristics of SF 6 /N 2 mixtures(50 % SF 6 _ 50 %N 2, 20 %SF 6 _ 80 %N 2) in sphere-plane and rod-plane configurations. The electrode gap spacing and the relative gas pressure were varied within the range of 10 ~ 50 mm and of 3 ~ 7 bar respectively. To get the 50 % breakdown value under lightning impulse of both polarity and AC, the <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method</b> was applied.

In this paper, we propose the construction of an algorithm to extract the baseline from signature. Signatures are taken from twenty randomly selected individuals with different background. In order to validate the algorithm, the capture image of each signature is use as samples for a developed questionnaire to be given to human expert.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{critical}} breakdown voltage or U 50 - corresponding to the 50 % probability of breakdown for a single impulse application - of long air-gaps under positive and negative switching impulse voltages, using predictive dynamic models. The knowledge of this important parameter is of practical interest to the design engineer. The models previously developed by the authors are based on equivalent electrical network, gas discharge theories and physical laws. Various gap geometry and atmospheric conditions were considered. The U 50, determined using the <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method</b> along with other important parameters, were compared to experimental data. Good agreements were found between simulated and experimental results. The results obtained indicate that U 50 prediction is possible, using the proposed models.

These dynamic models might therefore be useful to estimate the required clearances of air gaps in the preliminary design phase over a wide range of geometry and some atmospheric factors; therefore reducing the required full-scale testing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Cryptography is an {{important}} tool for protecting and securing data. In public key cryptography, the key generation plays a vital role for strengthening the security. The random numbers are the seed values in key generation process {{in many of the}} public key cryptography algorithms, such as Elgamal, Rivest_Shamir_Adleman (RSA) algorithm etc. Much effort is dedicated to develop efficient Random Number Generators (RNG) with good statistical properties. In addition, many optimized functions are available for generating random numbers. Various RNG are compared against the performance of intelligent optimization algorithms. As an outcome, Intelligent optimization algorithms are very efficient to solve complex problems and also helpful for generating random numbers. The primary objective of the proposed algorithm (Artificial Bee Colony Random Number Generator- ABCRNG) is to provide quick and improved performance results having practical and feasible implementation of random number generators. To evaluate the randomness of the random numbers generated by ABCRNG, the Run test is carried out in <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method</b> and also in above and below mean method. Thus, pure random and non-repeating final keys are obtained by using ABCRNG which increases the key strength and security.

40|$|Communities are emergent, {{holistic}} living systems. Understanding {{the impact}} of social complex systems through spatial interactions via the lens of scalability requires {{the development of new}} methodological behavioural approaches. The evolution of social complex systems of cities and their regions can be investigated through the evolution of spatial structures. The clustering of entities within cities, regions and beyond presents behavioural elements for which methodological approaches need to be considered. The emergent aspect of complex entities by their very nature requires an understanding that can embrace unpredictability through emergence. Qualitative methodological approaches can be holistic with the ability to embrace bottom <b>up</b> <b>and</b> top <b>down</b> <b>methods</b> for analysis. Social complex systems develop structures by connecting "like minded" behaviour through scalability. How "mobile" these interactions are, is a concept that can be understood via "inter-organizational" and "interstructural" comparative approaches. How do we indeed convey this adequately or appropriately? Just as a geographical area may contain characteristics that can help to support the formation of an emergent industry cluster, similar behaviours occur through emergent characteristics of complex systems that underpin the sustainability of an organization. The idea that complex systems have tacit structures, capable of displaying emergent behaviour, is not a common concept. These tacit structures can in turn, impact the structural sustainability of physical entities. More often than not, there is a focus on how these concepts of complex systems work, but the "why" questions depends upon scalability. Until recently, social complex adaptive systems were largely over looked due to the tacit nature of these network structures...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of calculating joint forces and moments during a whole body truck cabin ingress/egress motion. For such a task, {{it is difficult to}} evaluate a future truck instep as the influences of the architecture parameters are complex over the motion and the discomfort feeling. In order to evaluate the future product at an early stage of the design process, Digital Human Models (DHMs) are interesting tools. However, most existing DHM simulation packages can only efficiently evaluate the kinematics of postures where the dynamics of the whole motion is necessary for such a task. The enhancement of DHMs towards a dynamic analysis and modeling is therefore necessary. In this study, the motions of subjects entering and exiting an adjustable truck cabin were measured by mean of an opto-electronic motion capture system and six load sensors. The joint angles were then calculated using an inverse kinematics method. And the joint loads were calculated using a classical Newton-Euler inverse dynamics method during the period when all the contact loads are measured. The comparison of the joint torques and forces at the spine L 5 /S 1 joint calculated from the going <b>up</b> <b>and</b> going <b>down</b> <b>methods</b> show a good consistency and validate the moments and forces calculated at the other joints. In order to evaluate the joint loads when a sensor is missing, two methods are also presented, the first one making no assumption on the missing contact force, and the second one assuming that the center of pressure is known. The results show that more consistent joint loads were obtained using the method with assumption. These results validate the dynamic motion reconstruction method and open the way for a discomfort evaluation of truck cabin ingress/egress based on joint moments and forces...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground of studyPlants {{used for}} {{traditional}} medicine contain {{a wide range}} of substances which can be used to treat various infectious diseases. AimThe study evaluated the in vitro antioxidant, antinociceptive, and anti-inflammatory activities of the methanolic extract of Justicia secunda Vahl leaf. MethodsThe acute toxicity was performed with <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method</b> and the highest dose used was 2 g/kg. The anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated using the carrageenan and formalin-induced paw edema models, and antinociceptive activity was evaluated using acetic acid-induced writhing reflex and tail flick test models while the antioxidant activity was evaluated using 2, 2 -diphenyl- 2 -picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) photometric assay. ResultsThe extract was well tolerated as no signs of toxicity or death were noticed during the period of observation. The extract produced a concentration dependent increase in antioxidant activities in both DPPH and FRAP models. The extract produced its optimum activity at 400 μg/ml in both DPPH (54. 07 %) assay and FRAP (1. 58 μM) assay. The extract produced significant (P< 0. 05) dose-dependent increase in both anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities. The antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of the extract (0. 4 g/kg) were comparable with the reference drugs (aspirin and pentazocine) used in the study. ConclusionThis study suggests that J. secunda possesses anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antioxidant activities and also provide the pharmacological basis for its uses in traditional medicine for these purposes...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{the high}} voltage power is very {{important}} to industries. Due to growing of technology, the power equipment also improves and innovates to have the best performance. The high voltage power equipment is mainly subjected to spark over voltage. Spark over can be useful in some cases and may give bad effect or damage the machine. Therefore the research on the behavior of spark over, breakdown voltage is signified in the electrical engineering designing process. The project is started with an experimental setup to get the standard impulse voltage. This lightning impulse voltage is ensuring to follow the standard of BS EN 60060 - 1 : 2010. The procedure of this experiment follows the TERCO catalogue documentation. In this project, the standard point-sphere gap is use to measurements of U 50 breakdown voltages. A metallic point electrode is separated by a certain distance form a sphere gap. Also, the gap length between the spheres will be varied from 1 cm to 3 cm. The procedure to get U 50 is followed to <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>Down</b> <b>method.</b> FEMM software is use for simulation and analysis of electric field distribution for point-sphere electrode. This software provides a wide range of simulation applications for controlling the complexity of both modelling and analysis of a system. The value of U 50 obtained is used in this simulation.

The main problem in high voltage power (HV) equipment is {{the degradation of}} insulation quality of high voltage power equipment. As the high voltage power equipments are mainly subjected with spark over voltage causes by the lightning strokes and switching action. A protective device is used for determine the safe clearance required for proper insulation level. In this project, the lightning impulse voltages setup is used the manual guide from TERCO to generate the air breakdown voltage in high voltage laboratory. Two different electrodes (rod-plane and sphere- plane configuration) will be tested to compare the U 50 and electric field (Emax) between the two electrodes with different gap. <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method</b> {{was used to determine}} the U 50 voltage.

40|$|Background and Aims: Insertion of {{laryngeal}} mask airway (LMA) requires adequate depth of anaesthesia, which provides jaw relaxation and suppression of upper airway reflexes. Propofol can provide these conditions especially {{when combined with}} narcotics. This study had been designed {{to find out the}} effect-site concentration (EC 50) of propofol using target controlled infusion (TCI) when fentanyl or morphine is added as an adjuvant. Methods: Patients satisfying inclusion criteria were divided into fentanyl and morphine groups. Intravenous glycopyrrolate 0. 2 mg was given 15 min before induction. Patients were given either intravenous fentanyl (1 μg/kg) or morphine (0. 1 mg/kg) before propofol infusion depending on the group. Patients in either groups were induced by continuous infusion of propofol at an EC of 6 μg/mL by TCI with Schneider pharmacokinetic model. The LMA supreme of appropriate size was inserted 1 min after achieving target concentration. Patient movement at LMA insertion or within 1 min of insertion was classified as failure. For subsequent patients, the target EC was increased/decreased depending on previous patients′ response. Dixons <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method</b> was used to determine the EC 50. The EC 50 is defined as the mean of crossover midpoints in each pair of failure to success. Results: The EC 50 of propofol in the fentanyl group for LMA insertion was 5. 95 ± 0. 6 μg/ml and morphine group was 5. 75 ± 0. 8 μg/ml. No significant difference in insertion conditions was noticed between the two groups (P = 0. 3). Conclusion: We conclude that {{there was no significant difference}} in propofol EC 50 for insertion of LMA and insertion conditions were similar when fentanyl or morphine was used as an adjuvant drug...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} the air breakdown characteristics in plane-plane and sphere gap electrode configuration under lightning impulse. The breakdown in air (spark breakdown) is {{the transition of}} a non-sustaining discharge into a selfsustaining discharge. In electrical power system, high voltage power equipments are mainly subjected with spark over voltage. This over voltage which may causes by the lightning strokes, switching action and so on. In this project, two different electrodes (plane-plane and sphere gap) are used to study the air breakdown characteristics. This two electrodes are tested by using different gap start with 0. 5 cm, 1. 0 cm until 2. 5 cm. Refer to British Standard BS EN 60060 that explained detail about the general definitions and test requirements for high voltage test techniques to construct in this project. In addition, TERCO lightning impulse circuit are use to obtain the lightning impulse waveform. To estimate U 50 during the experimental, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>method</b> are used with the value of n ≥ 20. Finite element method magnetic software (FEMM) is use to shows the potential higher electric field occurs around the electrodes. Vector and contour around the electrodes also can be viewed. From this project can conclude that electric field distribution between two conductors (or electrodes) depends on applied voltage (U 50), gap between electrodes, types and surface of electrodes. In {{the end of this}} project, the relationship between voltage (U 50) and gap, electric field (|Emax|) and gap, field utilization factor (η) and gap, U 50 and field utilization factor (η) and electric field (|Emax|) and field utilization factor (η) have been constructed with help of graph...|$|E
