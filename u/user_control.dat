5|$|Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II {{was well}} received. The game holds an {{aggregate}} score of 91 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews. The combination of puzzles and gameplay drew praise from critics, who {{indicated that the}} game builds upon the qualities found in Dark Forces. The <b>user</b> <b>control</b> of the game was praised, especially {{the control of the}} lightsaber. The game was compared positively with Doom, a significant game in the first-person shooter genre.|$|E

On October 31, 2017, Google's algorithms started flagging random documents for violating its terms of service.

25|$|Dynamic color {{convergence}} and purity {{are one of}} {{the main}} reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex raster geometry parameters through electronics under <b>user</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

25|$|Version 7 is {{intended}} to defend users from phishing as well as deceptive or malicious software, and it also features full <b>user</b> <b>control</b> of ActiveX and better security framework, including not being integrated as much with Windows as previous versions, thereby increasing security. Unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer ActiveX control is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather it runs in its own process. It also includes bug fixes, enhancements to its support for web standards, tabbed browsing with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine search box, a web feeds reader, Internationalized Domain Name support (IDN), and antiphishing filter. On October 5, 2007, Microsoft removed the 'genuine software' validation before install, which means that all versions of Windows, whether able to pass validation or not, are able to install the browser. The integrated search box supports OpenSearch.|$|E
25|$|New Plasma applets include applets {{for leaving}} {{messages}} on a locked screen, previewing files, switching desktop Activity, monitoring news feeds, and utilities like the pastebin applet, the calendar, timer, special character selector, a QuickLaunch widget, {{and a system}} monitor, among many others. The Plasma workspace can now load Google Gadgets. Plasma widgets can be written in Ruby and Python. Support for applets written in JavaScript and Mac OS X dashboard widgets has been further improved. Theming improvements in the Task Bar, Application Launcher, System Tray and most other Plasma components streamline {{the look and feel}} and increase consistency. A new System Settings module, Desktop Theme Details, gives the <b>user</b> <b>control</b> over each element of various Plasma themes. Wallpapers are now provided plugins, so developers can easily write custom wallpaper systems in KDE 4.2. Available wallpaper plugins in KDE 4.2 will be slideshows, Mandelbrot fractals, and regular static images.|$|E
25|$|JPEG uses a lossy form of {{compression}} {{based on}} the discrete cosine transform (DCT). This mathematical operation converts each frame/field of the video source from the spatial (2D) domain into the frequency domain (a.k.a. transform domain). A perceptual model based loosely on the human psychovisual system discards high-frequency information, i.e. sharp transitions in intensity, and color hue. In the transform domain, the process of reducing information is called quantization. In simpler terms, quantization is a method for optimally reducing a large number scale (with different occurrences of each number) into a smaller one, and the transform-domain is a convenient representation of the image because the high-frequency coefficients, which contribute less to the overall picture than other coefficients, are characteristically small-values with high compressibility. The quantized coefficients are then sequenced and losslessly packed into the output bitstream. Nearly all software implementations of JPEG permit <b>user</b> <b>control</b> over the compression-ratio (as well as other optional parameters), allowing the user to trade off picture-quality for smaller file size. In embedded applications (such as miniDV, which uses a similar DCT-compression scheme), the parameters are pre-selected and fixed for the application.|$|E

In earlier versions users could opt for updates {{to be installed}} automatically, or to be notified so they could update as and when they wished, {{or not to be}} notified; and they could choose which updates to install, using information about the updates. Windows10 Pro and Enterprise users may be configured by an administrator to defer updates, but only for a limited time.

Because of the physical nature of eyes, dōjutsu can be transplanted to another individual and still be functional, though if the user is not of the same family as the donor, they may have little control over the dōjutsu's activation or have their chakra taxed more than usual. In the Ninja World, there exists the [...] "Three Great Dōjutsu": the Byakugan that allows the user 360-degree view within a certain distance and an individual's chakra pathway system; the Sharingan that allows the user to copy others' jutsu and movements as well as a multitude of genjutsu and other abilities; and the Rinnegan, the most [...] "exalted" [...] of the three that gives the <b>user</b> <b>control</b> over the Six Paths. There is also the Rinne Sharingan, the primeval form of the Sharingan and the Rinnegan, and the Tenseigan, a heightened form of Byakugan which is very similar to the Rinnegan in power. There is only one individual who possesses all three of the Great Dōjutsu: Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, who possesses both the Byakugan and the Rinne Sharingan.|$|E
