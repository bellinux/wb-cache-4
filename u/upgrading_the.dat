5|$|Device Firmware Upgrade (DFU) is a vendor- and device-independent {{mechanism}} for <b>upgrading</b> <b>the</b> firmware of USB devices with improved versions provided by their manufacturers, offering (for example) {{a way for}} firmware bugfixes to be deployed. During the firmware upgrade operation, USB devices change their operating mode effectively becoming a PROM programmer. Any class of USB device can implement this capability by following the official DFU specifications.|$|E

Other <b>upgrades</b> included <b>the</b> changing of the N4/M50 to a free-flow layout and an <b>upgrade</b> of <b>the</b> motorway to three or four lanes in each direction between many junctions. Works to <b>upgrade</b> <b>the</b> N7/M50 and M1/M50 junctions to free-flow or near free-flow layouts, and to <b>upgrade</b> <b>the</b> rest of the route to three or four-lane motorway were completed in late 2009 and during 2010.|$|R
5|$|A major {{capital works}} program was also {{undertaken}} to prepare RAAF bases for the Hornets. Over $150 million was spent <b>upgrading</b> <b>the</b> runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, {{which has been}} the main F/A-18 base throughout the aircraft's service. The pre-existing airfield at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory was also developed into a major air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $215 million so that it could accommodate No.75 Squadron. Until this time the squadron had been stationed at RAAF Base Darwin which, due to its location on Australia's north coast, was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend during wartime.|$|E
5|$|Although an {{air-cooled}} {{design was}} chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized {{that this would be}} impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build. The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and <b>upgrading</b> <b>the</b> electricity, water and telephone lines.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} on simulcasting of harness and quarter horse races was reached in August allowing Rosecroft to reopen on August 25, 2011.

Rosecroft drew 400 to 500 patrons on its opening day. Penn National also announced its intent to spend $1 million in the coming year to renovate the property, which would include razing old horse barns, putting a new roof on the betting parlors, and <b>upgrading</b> <b>the</b> HVAC system.|$|E

5|$|At {{the western}} end of Highway3, two major traffic {{concerns}} have been the focus of controversy since the mid-1990s and early 2000s: the Essex Bypass and the approach to the Ambassador Bridge.

5|$|By 1955, talks began about <b>upgrading</b> <b>the</b> highway. After a {{proposition}} to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed widening of the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E

Castle House continued to be leased out by the Powis estate to wealthy individuals up until the Second World War.

5|$|Construction of {{the route}} from Brill to Oxford had not begun.

5|$|In {{order to}} address the {{shortcomings}} of the RNZAF's Skyhawk fleet, the New Zealand Government approved the Project Kahu program in May 1985.
