5|$|One of McCartney's first girlfriends, in 1959, {{was called}} Layla; a name he remembered as being unusual in Liverpool at the time. She was {{slightly}} older than McCartney and <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him to baby-sit with her. Julie Arthur, another girlfriend, was Ted Ray's niece.|$|E
5|$|Chakrapani {{decided to}} retain only the {{background}} of Gundamma's family from the original and rewrote the remaining script, taking inspiration from William Shakespeare comedy, The Taming of the Shrew. Chakrapani killed the character of Gundamma's cowardly husband because he felt that a husband who cannot answer his wife's questions is not eligible to be included. Kamalakara Kameswara Rao was chosen to direct the film. Chakrapani named the central character Gundamma in the remake {{after one of the}} characters in the original, despite a lack of nativity. Nagi Reddy's family members and the employees of the Vijaya Vauhini Studios <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him Gundamma Katha Entha varaku vachchindi? ("What is the progress in Gundamma's story?"), which prompted Nagi Reddy to title the film Gundamma Katha after considering various options.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible. A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding {{the population as a}} whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E

This entrance is closed after 21:00 and intercom is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> staff to unlock the gates at other times if necessary. The ticket office on that entrance is also no longer in use. There are 3 platforms, one side and one island platform.|$|E
25|$|Aracelio Azcuy, a {{politician}} of the Civil Damages Office and supporter of Prío Socarrás, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Cancel Miranda {{to campaign for}} him, to write his speeches. On March 10, 1952, Fulgencio Batista led a military coup overthrowing Prío Socarrás' government. After the coup, Batista's police arrested Cancel Miranda and Trilla. They {{were sent to the}} Tiscornia prison until August 1952, when they both were expelled from Cuba.|$|E

25|$|However, paper {{also had}} a sacred aspect and was used in rituals along with other items such as incense, copal, maguey thorns and rubber. For {{ceremonial}} and religious events, bark paper was used in various ways: as decorations used in fertility rituals, yiataztli, a kind of bag, and as an amatetéuitl, a badge used to symbolize a prisoner's soul after sacrifice. It was also used to dress idols, priests and sacrifice victims in forms of crowns, stoles, plumes, wigs, trusses and bracelets. Paper items such as flags, skeletons and very long papers, up {{to the length of}} a man, were used as offerings, often by burning them. Another important paper item for rituals was paper cut in the form of long flags or trapezoids and painted with black rubber spots to depict the characteristic of the god being honored. At a certain time of year, these were also <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for rain. At this time, the papers were colored blue with plumage at the spearhead.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditions and}} {{activities}} {{that take place in}} celebration of the Day of the Dead are not universal, often varying from town to town. For example, in the town of Pátzcuaro on the Lago de Pátzcuaro in Michoacán, the tradition is very different if the deceased is a child rather than an adult. On November 1 of the year after a child's death, the godparents set a table in the parents' home with sweets, fruits, pan de muerto, a cross, a rosary (<b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the Virgin Mary to pray for them) and candles. This is meant to celebrate the child's life, in respect and appreciation for the parents. There is also dancing with colorful costumes, often with skull-shaped masks and devil masks in the plaza or garden of the town. At midnight on November 2, the people light candles and ride winged boats called mariposas (butterflies) to Janitzio, an island {{in the middle of the}} lake where there is a cemetery, to honor and celebrate the lives of the dead there.|$|E
500|$|While in the army, Barbirolli {{adopted the}} anglicised form {{of his first}} name {{for the sake of}} simplicity: [...] "The sergeant-major had great {{difficulty}} in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> So I chose John." [...] After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Eli seated himself, {{and looked}} ponderingly into the fire. [...] "You're right, cap'n," [...] said he. [...] "We'd have to ship some woman {{to take care}} of her. Of course, it wouldn't be no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Mrs. Crumley?" ...|$|R

500|$|... "God with Us" [...] was {{the first}} song written for MercyMe's album All That Is Within Me, {{as well as the}} song the band based the rest of the album around. The song's lyrics were {{inspired}} by the question [...] "Why does God look our way?", which the band's lead singer Bart Millard's pastor <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> to his congregation. Millard could not get this idea out of his head, and wanted to create a song around this idea. [...] "God with Us" [...] was designed for the church, as well as to be used in worship.|$|E
2500|$|Cardi B is of Christian faith, {{believing in}} God and Jesus Christ; she has {{mentioned}} her [...] "strong relationship" [...] with God in interviews, often {{saying that she}} [...] "talks to him": [...] "If you know me, you know that I have this deep connection to God. Is it crazy {{for me to say}} that I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> God to please help me? The strip club really helped me. I can say that it saved me…God put that in my way." ...|$|E
2500|$|And lastly, the Satsugū dialect {{also makes}} use of an extra series that {{describes}} limits using the -shiko suffix, which is roughly {{the equivalent of the}} standard Japanese construction -re + -dake or -hodo. So sore dake [...] "only that much" [...] in standard Japanese would become soshiko in the dialect. To express approximation, as in [...] "only about that much", the particle ばっかい bakkai may be added to form soshiko bakkai. The interrogative form doshiko is commonly <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about prices: doshiko na? [...] "how much is it?" [...] (standard ikura desu ka?).|$|E

2500|$|During the 1970s American Arabs' {{concerns}} about negative media images promoted {{as a result}} of the Arab–Israeli conflict and Arab countries' defeat in the 1967 Arab–Israeli War grew. Founder James Abourezk initially was motivated by unfair stereotyping of Arabs in media, anti-Arabism in general and the Abscam sting where Federal Bureau of Investigation ("FBI") agents posed as Arabs. He brought together more than 60 Arab leaders from around the nation who agreed to form the committee. Abourezk has stated: [...] "When we started up people <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> us why we started. Now they ask us for our opinion on things.” ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{rival in}} {{dramatic}} art (and supposedly in the affections of Glycera) was Philemon, {{who appears to}} have been more popular. Menander, however, believed himself to be the better dramatist, and, according to Aulus Gellius, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Philemon: [...] "Don't you feel ashamed whenever you gain a victory over me?" [...] According to Caecilius of Calacte (Porphyry in Eusebius, Praeparatio evangelica) Menander was accused of plagiarism, as his The Superstitious Man was taken from The Augur of Antiphanes, but reworkings and variations on a theme of this sort were commonplace and so the charge is a complicated one.|$|E
2500|$|The public {{information}} campaign over the preceding two years helped, {{as did the}} trick of getting a rough conversion of new pence into old shillings and pence by simply doubling {{the number of new}} pence and placing a solidus, or slash, between the digits: 17p multiplied by 2=34, – approximately equal to 3/4 ("three and four", or three shillings and four pence), with a similar process for the reverse conversion. The willingness of a young population to embrace the change also helped. In general, elderly people had more difficulty adapting and the phrase [...] "How much is that in old money?" [...] or even [...] "How much is that in real money?" [...] became associated with those who struggled with the change. (This phrase is now often <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for conversion between metric and imperial weights and measures.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "correlatives" [...] are a {{paradigm}} of pro-forms, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{and answer the}} questions what, where, when, why, who, whose, how, how much, and what kind. They are constructed from set elements so that correlatives with similar meanings have similar forms: There are nine endings corresponding to the nine wh- questions, and five initial elements that perform the functions of asking, answering, denying, being inclusive, and being indefinite about these nine questions. For example, the words kiam (when) and kiu (who, which), with the initial ki- of questions, ask about time and individuals, whereas the words tiam (then) and tiu (this/that one), with the same endings but the initial ti- of demonstratives, answer those questions, and the words neniam (never) and neniu (no-one) deny those questions. Thus by learning these 14 elements the speaker acquires {{a paradigm}} of 45 adverbs and pronouns.|$|E
2500|$|R. Ḥisda, {{when he met}} Sheshet, used {{to tremble}} at the wealth of baraitot and maxims which the latter quoted (Er. 67a). Sheshet also {{transmitted}} many sayings of the older tannaim, especially of R. Eleazar b. Azariah (Mak. 23a; Pes. 118a). In his teaching he always took tradition as his basis, and for every question laid before him for decision he sought a mishnah or baraita from which he might deduce {{the solution of the}} problem, his extensive knowledge of these branches of literature always enabling him to find the passage he required (Zeb. 96b). His usual answer to a question was: [...] "We have learned it in the Mishnah or in a baraita" [...] (B. M. 90a; Yoma 48b). When he had presented some sentence to the attention of his pupils, he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> immediately, [...] "Whence have I this?" [...] and would then add a mishnah or a baraita from which he had derived the decision in question (Ket. 68a; comp. Yeb. 35a, 58a).|$|E
2500|$|Grace Hopper {{is famous}} for her nanoseconds visual aid. People (such as generals and admirals) <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> her why {{satellite}} communication took so long. [...] She started handing out pieces of wire that were just under one foot long (11.80 inches)—the distance that light travels in one nanosecond. She gave these pieces of wire the metonym [...] "nanoseconds." [...] She was careful to tell her audience that {{the length of her}} nanoseconds was actually the maximum speed the signals would travel in a vacuum, and that signals would travel more slowly through the actual wires that were her teaching aids. Later she used the same pieces of wire to illustrate why computers had to be small to be fast. At many of her talks and visits, she handed out [...] "nanoseconds" [...] to everyone in the audience, contrasting them with a coil of wire 984 feet long, representing a microsecond. Later, while giving these lectures while working for DEC, she passed out packets of pepper, calling the individual grains of ground pepper picoseconds.|$|E
