In this method stochastic excitation is discretized and represented in terms of a finite set of standard normal random variables.

40|$|In {{this study}} the maximum entropy {{formalism}} [JAYN 57] is suggested {{as an alternative}} theory for general queueing systems of computer performance analysis. The motivation is to overcome {{some of the problems}} arising in this field and to extend the scope of the results derived in the context of Markovian queueing theory. For the M/G/l model a unique maximum entropy solution., satisfying locALl balance is derived independent of any assumptions about the service time distribution. However, it is shown that this solution is identical to the steady state solution of the underlying Marko-v process when the service time distribution is of the generalised exponential (CE) type. (The GE-type distribution is a mixture of an exponential term and a <b>unit</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>function</b> at the origin). For the G/M/ 1 the maximum entropy solution is identical in form to that of the underlying Markov process, but a GE-type distribution still produces the maximum overall similar distributions. For the GIG 11 model there are three main achievements: first, the spectral methods are extended to give exaft formulae for the average number of customers in the system for any G/G/l with rational Laplace transform. Previously, these results are obtainable only through simulation and approximation methods. (ii) secondly, a maximum entropy model is developed and used to obtain unique solutions for some types of the G/G/l. It is also discussed how these solutions can be related to the corresponding stochastic processes. (iii) the importance of the G/GE/l and the GE/GE/l for the analysis of general networks is discussed and some flow processes for these systems are characterised. For general queueing networks it is shown that the maximum entropy solution {{is a product of the}} maximum entropy solutions of the individual nodes. Accordingly, existing computational algorithms are extended to cover general networks with FCFS disciplines. Some implementations are suggested and a flow algorithm is derived.

40|$|Road {{traffic noise}} is {{becoming}} an increasingly big problem in densely populated areas. One of the main contributions comes from the tyre/road interaction. For the interior noise, to which the occupants of the vehicle are exposed, tyre/road noise {{is also an important}} source, especially at lower frequencies. The vibrations of the tyre up to 500 Hz are transmitted via structural transmission paths to the interior effectively, thus causing acoustic noise. In this frequency range tyre/road noise is dominated by vibrational mechanisms. One of the aspects that has {{to be taken into account}} when modelling tyre vibrations is the effect of rotation.

30|$|To {{overcome}} {{the shortcomings of}} the conventional ELM, Fujimura and Der Kiureghian (2007) presented tail equivalent linearization method (TELM) which uses the advantages of first order reliability method (FORM). In this method stochastic excitation is discretized and represented {{in terms of a}} finite set of standard normal random variables. Based on this representation of excitation, the limit state surface for desired response at a specified time instant can be stated in terms of these variables. In TELM the nonlinear limit state of the specified response threshold and time is linearized at the nearest point to the origin. Based on the rotational symmetry and exponential decaying of the standard normal probability density function, this point which is called design point in FORM has the maximum likelihood among all points on the limit state surface and has the most contribution in the probability of failure. Tail equivalent linear system (TELS) is defined based on the linearized limit state surface, because its tail probability is equal to the tail probability of the nonlinear system. This definition is accomplished by <b>unit</b> <b>impulse</b> response <b>functions</b> (IRFs) for nonlinear system for each direction of excitation.

40|$|In this recitation, {{we review}} continuous-time and discrete-time convolution, {{as well as}} Laplace and z-transforms. You {{probably}} have seen these concepts in undergraduate courses, where you dealt mostly withone by one signals, x(t) and h(t). Concepts can be extended to cases where you have vectors of signals, for example, x(t) =[x 1 (t) [...] . xn(t) ] ′, but now, one {{needs to be more}} careful withmultiplication order. For example, as noted below, convolution is not commutative when vectors/matrices are invloved, but are commutative when x and h are one by one. Convolution Continuous-Time Convolution. The convolution of x and h is defined by h ∗ x(t) = h(t − τ) x(τ) dτ. It can be shown that the response of a linear system, with the impulse response 1 h(t, τ), to an input x(t) is y(t) = h(t, τ) x(τ) dτ (see [1]). If the system is time-invariant, then the response of the system to δ(t − τ), denoted by h(t, τ), is identical to a shifted version of its response to δ(t), i. e. h(t − τ, 0). Thus, if we let h(t, 0) = h(t), then the response of an LTI system to any input x(t) is given by the convolution integral. Discrete-Time Convolution. The convolution of the discrete-time signals x and h is defined by x ∗ h[n] = � +∞ k=− ∞ [n − k]x[k]. h It can be shown that the response of a linear system, with the impulse response 2 h[n, k], to an input x[n] is y[n] = � +∞ k=−∞ h[n, k]x[k] (see [1]). If the system is time-invariant, then the response of the system to δ[n − k], denoted by h[n, k], is identical to a shifted version of its response to δ[n], i. e. h[n − k, 0]. Thus, if we let h[n, 0] = h[n], then the response of an LTI system to any input x[n] is given by the convolution integral. Example 1 : Determine the response of a single input-single output continuous- (discrete-) time LTI system to the complex exponential input, est (zn), where s (z) is a complexnumber. Let’s plug into the convolution integral (sum). We have that x(t) ∗ h(t) = x(t − τ) h(τ) dτ = es(t−τ) h(τ) dτ = est − ∞ e−sτ h(τ) dτ = est −∞ H(s) where, assuming H(s) converges, H(s) = 1 Recall that the impulse response of the system is the output of the system, h(t, τ) when the input is the <b>unit</b> <b>impulse</b> <b>function,</b> δ(t − τ) ...|$|E

40|$|A new {{formulation}} {{to determine}} the <b>unit</b> <b>impulse</b> response (Green’s) <b>functions</b> of a loaded rotating tyre in the vehicle-fixed (Eulerian) reference frame for tyre/road noise predictions is presented. The proposed formulation makes use of the set of eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes for the statically loaded tyre obtained from a finite element (FE) model of the tyre. A closed-form expression for the Green’s functions of a rotating tyre in the Eulerian reference system {{as a function of}} the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the statically loaded tyre is found. Non-linear effects during loading are accounted for in the FE model, while the frequency shift due to the rotational velocity is included in the calculation of the Green’s functions. In the literature on tyre/road noise these functions are generally used {{to determine the}} tyre response during tyre/road contact calculations. The presented formulation opens the possibility to solve the contact problem directly in the Eulerian reference frame and to include local tyre softening due to non-linear effects while keeping the computational advantage of describing the tyre dynamics as a set of <b>impulse</b> response <b>functions.</b> The advantage of obtaining the Green’s functions in the Eulerian reference system is that only the Green’s functions corresponding to the potential contact zone need to be determined, which significantly reduces the computational cost of solving the tyre/road contact and since the mesh is fixed in space, a finer mesh can be used for the potential contact zone, improving the accuracy of the contact force calculations. Although these effects might be less pronounced if a more accurate tyre model is used, it is found that using the Green’s functions of the loaded tyre in a contact force calculation leads to smaller forces than in the unloaded case, lower frequencies are present in the response and they decrease faster as the rotational velocity increases...|$|R
