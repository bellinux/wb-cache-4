40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{describe}} how Shenzhen A-share listed companies <b>used</b> funds <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs during the 2006 – 2010 period. In exploring {{the relationship between}} internal corporate governance and the <b>use</b> of funds <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs, {{we find that the}} use of such funds to engage in severe over-investment behavior is prevalent among listed companies. Reasonable internal corporate governance mechanisms can effectively alleviate over-investment problems listed companies encounter in <b>using</b> funds <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs. However, the same individual serving as both chairman and CEO leads to funds raised in over-financed IPOs being over-invested. Moreover, executives driven by high levels of monetary compensation are more likely to <b>use</b> funds <b>raised</b> in such IPOs to engage in over-investment. We find that improving the balance of power between shareholders will help alleviate the over-investment of excess IPO funds. In addition, the over-investment problem is less severe in state-controlled listed companies than in their non-state-controlled listed counterparts. This study provides policy recommendations for Chinese securities regulators to ensure listed companies <b>use</b> funds <b>raised</b> in over-financed IPOs both rationally and effectively...|$|R
