50|$|An example {{application}} involves local utility <b>user</b> <b>taxes.</b> Utility <b>user</b> <b>taxes</b> are levied {{on the use}} {{of utility}} services, whether provided by a public or private entity, with the tax proceeds nearly always spent by local governments on purposes completely unrelated to the particular utility service being taxed. Local utility taxes are generally levied as a percentage of utility service cost, and are imposed in addition to local utility fees and charges. Utility <b>user</b> <b>taxes</b> typically appear as a separate charge on the local utility bill. Utility <b>user</b> <b>taxes</b> are imposed on one or more utility services, including water, electricity, sewer, gas, telephone, cable television, and refuse collection. When local utility rates are increased, the cost of utility service increases which generally also results in an increase in the amount of utility <b>users</b> <b>tax</b> that is paid by the consumer.|$|R

5000|$|Yet another {{application}} could target local utility <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> “modernization” {{measures that}} have been approved by voters {{over the past few}} years. There exists controversy whether utility <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> “modernization” measures permit local governments to levy taxes on online video streaming services. [...] In some instances, voters may have unknowingly authorized the imposition of a tax on online video streaming services in approving a local utility <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> “modernization” measure.

50|$|If one or {{more local}} {{government}} bad conduct events specified in a local Proposition 218 initiative were to occur, {{the magnitude of the}} levy reduction would be increased by a specified factor as set forth in the initiative. For example, a utility <b>users</b> <b>tax</b> rate could be reduced from 8% to 5% under the regular terms of the initiative, but the tax rate could be reduced by an additional amount to 2% (from 8% to 2%) if a local government bad conduct event were to occur. If multiple local government bad conduct events were to occur, the measure could provide for the repeal of the utility <b>users</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Utility user {{taxes are}} {{sometimes}} a significant revenue source {{for a local}} government. This can make the complete repeal of a local utility users tax politically problematic. Rather than providing for a complete repeal of a local utility <b>user</b> <b>tax,</b> a local initiative under Proposition 218 could target tax relief for just the residential utility customers while leaving utility tax rates for commercial customers unchanged.|$|E
50|$|A tie-in {{initiative}} {{associated with}} local government bad conduct events {{can also be}} incorporated into a Proposition 218 compensatory initiative (a compensatory tie-in hybrid initiative). As an example, suppose a local initiative under Proposition 218 is pursued to reduce or repeal a local government utility fee and the local government subsequently sues the initiative proponents to prevent the ballot initiative from proceeding or seeks to invalidate the initiative. As a potential legislative remedy, the initiative proponents could file a compensatory initiative providing for the reduction or repeal of a utility users tax imposed by the local government with a tie-in to local bad conduct events associated with the utility fee reduction or repeal initiative that was previously filed. The practical effect {{of this approach is}} that the local government could be facing a substantial loss of utility <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> revenues if it continues with its bad conduct in connection with the utility fee reduction or repeal initiative. If the local government were to subsequently act more responsibly in connection with the utility fee reduction or repeal initiative (such as dropping a lawsuit and allowing the measure to proceed to the ballot if sufficient signatures are obtained), the loss of utility <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> revenues would be minimal.|$|E

50|$|The {{final report}} of the National Advisory Committee, at best, can be {{described}} as confusing; at worst, conflicting.

The following day, the Committee recommended, by a vote of 12 to 10, deregulation of municipalities over 25,000 and urban cities. This would have allowed the use of amortization in these jurisdictions. A short while later, by a vote 12 to t 1, the committee rejected a recommendation which would permit amortization and levy a Federal <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> on nonconforming signs.|$|E

50|$|A {{toll road}} is a road over which users may travel over on payment of a toll, or fee. Tolls are {{a form of}} <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> that pays {{for the cost of}} road {{construction}} and maintenance, without raising taxes on non-users. Investor's bonds necessary for the construction of the roads are issued and sold with the expectation that the bonds will be paid back with user tolls. The toll roads may be run by government agencies that have bond issuing authority and/or private companies that sell bonds or have other sources of finance. Toll roads are usually a government guaranteed road monopoly that guarantees limited or no competing roads will be built by government agencies {{for the duration of the}} bonds. Private toll roads built with money raised from private investors in expectation of making money from the tolls probably dominated early toll roads. Government sponsored toll roads often guarantee a minimum payment (from other taxes) to the bond holders if traffic volume and toll collections are less than predicted. If the toll authority is a private company there is often a maximum amount of fees that they may extract from users. Toll road operators are typically responsible for maintaining the roads. After the bonds are paid off the road typically reverts to the government agency that authorized the road and owns the land it was built on. Like most government taxes it is not unusual for tolls to continue to be charged after the bonds have been paid off.|$|E

40|$|The Inland Waterway Revenue Act of 1978 (Public Law 95 - 502) {{established}} a surcharge on fuel {{consumed in the}} transportation of commodities by commercial inland waterway users. Initiated at four cents per gallon on October 1, 1980 the surcharge is scheduled to increase to ten cents per gallon by the 1985 navigation season. Revenues generated from the <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> have been earmarked to finance the maintenance and operations of existing navigation structures and practices and to defray the cost of current and planned construction. The legislated level of taxation, however, is insufficient to recover the total expenditures associated with these categories. This dissertation considers the impact of various taxation mechanisms designed to recover 100 percent of inland waterway navigation related expenditures;The focus {{of this study is}} narrowly defined, in that it is only the impact on shipments of the leading agricultural export commodities [...] corn, soybeans and wheat [...] which are considered. The impact of inland waterway user changes on transport costs, origin-destination routing, modal traffic share and modal revenue generated from shipments of grain are estimated utilizing a linear programming model. A solution to the model specifies that combination of corn, soybean and wheat shipments that minimizes the annual transportation costs of shipping grain from U. S. origin-surplus regions to domestic and foreign demand-deficit regions. Results are established upon comparison of a base [...] no user fee [...] solution and five <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> solutions. The five <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> types include a fuel tax, segment ton-mile tax, combination fuel segment ton-mile tax, and segment ton-mile tax accompanied by assumed 50 and 100 percent rail rate responses in water competitive regions;The results indicate that the impact on grain shipments is dependent upon the type of tax implemented. Of projected 1989 - 1990 crop year barge shipments, equal to 2. 4 billion bushels, between 10. 6 and 17. 6 percent are diverted to direct rail or truck shipments. The tax revenue generated from grain shipments ranges from 59. 3 to 67. 0 million dollars. On a per bushel basis, user charges result in an average increase in barge transportation costs ranging from 3. 0 to 3. 4 cents per bushel...|$|E

40|$|In 2009, the US {{government}} {{spent more}} than $ 42 billion on the federal-aid highway program. Most of this money was raised from motor vehicle taxes, whose proceeds are deposited in the highway trust fund. Federal motor vehicle user taxes flow into the fund and aid expenditures flow out from it to build and maintain highways and other transportation infrastructure. With so much money at stake it should be no surprise that expenditure decisions {{are the subject of}} intense political debate. Chief among these debates is the conflict between donor states, whose residents pay more in highway user taxes than the state receives in federal highway aid and donee states, whose residents pay less in highway user taxes than the state receives in highway aid. While this geographic redistribution has been masked recently by infusions of general fund revenue into the trust fund, the debate nevertheless continues. This paper attempts to understand why some states are donors and others are donees by simultaneously testing four hypotheses about the geographic redistribution of federal highway dollars that relate to a state’s highway need, economic condition, level of urbanization, and representation on the key Congressional oversight committees. The analyses show that redistribution does not favor states with larger highway systems, more highway use, or lower median incomes, all of which are different indicators of need. Instead, states that are less urban and better represented on the four key Congressional committees generally benefit from redistribution. These findings indicate that the <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> revenues are not used in places where they are most needed. Thus they provide little empirical support for any compelling policy argument for continued geographic redistribution of federal highway <b>user</b> <b>tax</b> dollars...|$|E

50|$|An example {{illustrating}} the foregoing involves {{the transfer of}} “profit” fees and charges by a local government {{in connection with the}} provision of electric service. This occurs when the local government intentionally overcharges ratepayers for electric service and then subsequently transfers a percentage of the utility fee and charge proceeds (known as “profit”) to the general fund of the local agency to be spent at the discretion of local politicians. If the local agency also levies a utility <b>users</b> <b>tax</b> on electric service, which tax proceeds are also typically placed in the general fund of the local agency to be spent at the discretion of local politicians, then it may be a better option to pursue a compensatory initiative under Proposition 218 providing for the repeal or reduction of the utility <b>users</b> <b>tax</b> as it pertains to electric service. In this instance, a successfully constructed compensatory initiative would at least offset any resulting increase in general fund revenues from the utility fund transfer with a corresponding reduction (or elimination) of utility tax revenues.|$|R
