5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiation,</b> ozone and other atmospheric gases are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E
5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a depletion of the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiation</b> of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a depletion of the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
25|$|The {{chlorine}} atom, written {{often as}} Cl., behaves very {{differently from the}} chlorine molecule (Cl2). The radical Cl. is long-lived in the upper atmosphere, where it catalyzes the conversion of ozone into O2. Ozone absorbs <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiation,</b> so its depletion allows more of this high energy radiation to reach the Earth's surface. Bromine atoms are even more efficient catalysts; hence brominated CFCs are also regulated.|$|E

The {{present study is}} conducted to study the effect of <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> for different durations on the superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, lipid peroxidation (measured as TBA index) and non-protein SH content in mung bean seedlings. The study revealed that the superoxide dismutase and the peroxidase activity was increasd significantly due to UV-B irradiance. A significant decrease in lipid peroxidation was observed in the seedlings exposed to <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> for longer durations. The non-protein SH content decreased significantly on third and fourth day of germination in mung bean seedlings. Exposure of mung bean seedlings to <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> lead {{to the formation of}} reactive oxygen species thus generating oxidative stress.

40|$|International audienceThe {{brown seaweed}} Pelvetia canaliculata and the marine {{angiosperm}} Salicornia ramosissima (purple glasswort) are two marine macrophytes {{growing in the}} upper intertidal zone. This location implies long emersion periods that lead to a direct exposure to UV solar radiation and to a potential photooxidative stress involving photoprotective compounds, such as phenols and pigments. To investigate the photoprotective responses in both species, which live under the same natural conditions but grow on different substrates, an experimental co-culture system was developed. Then, two three-week independent experiments were carried out with the artificial exposure of both macrophytes to a PAR alone treatment and either a PAR + dominant UV-A treatment (PA) simulating natural sunlight or a PAR + dominant UV-B treatment (PB) corresponding to high doses of <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> to enhance metabolic responses. Chlorophyll, carotenoid and phenol contents, as well as antioxidant activity, were determined for both species {{as a function of}} each light condition and exposure time (0, 7, 14 and 21 d). The accuracy and reproducibility of the first co-culture system created for both seaweeds and halophytes was confirmed by almost similar evolutions of pigments, phenols and antioxidant status after seven days of both PAR experiments. However, it seemed that young, annual and fast-growing plants of Salicornia ramosissima obtained from seed cultures acclimated slowly related to aging, perennial and apparently slow reacting thalli of P. canaliculata harvested in the field. Results showed that both UV treatments have almost no effect on chlorophyll contents. Carotenoid and phenol levels, as well as antioxidant activity, seemed to be less affected under PA treatment for both species. High doses of <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> induced few changes in carotenoid contents for both species, suggesting efficient constitutive contents for photoprotection. In contrast, phenol contents and antioxidant activity were not affected in P. canaliculata, whereas they decreased gradually in S. ramosissima. This could be explained by a fast acclimation of P. canaliculata to high <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> based on efficient contents of both phenols and carotenoids related to a strong antioxidant protection, versus a slow acclimation of S. ramosissima with a putative down regulation of phenols and the preferential involvement of carotenoids and/or other photoprotective systems...|$|R

Such conditions likely caused excess <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiation.</b> This favored the emergence of skin pigmentation in order to protect from folate depletion due to the increased exposure to sunlight. A theory that the pigmentation helped counter xeric stress by increasing the epidermal permeability barrier has been disproved.|$|E
25|$|Reasonable {{exposure}} to ultraviolet {{radiation from the}} sun {{can be a good}} source of vitamin D. One minimal erythemal dose of sunlight UV radiation provides the equivalent of about 20,000 IU of vitamin D2, taken as an oral supplement. If an adult's arms and legs are exposed to a half minimal erythemal UV radiation, it is the same as taking 3,000 IU of vitamin D3 through an oral supplement. This exposure of 10–15 minutes, on a frequency of two to three times per week will cause the adult's skin to produce enough vitamin D. It is not necessary to expose the face to the UV, as facial skin provides little vitamin D3. Individuals whose metabolism makes taking oral vitamin D ineffective are able, through {{exposure to}} an ultraviolet lamp that emits <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiation,</b> to achieve a 25 (OH) D blood level.|$|E
25|$|Ozone in {{the ozone}} layer filters out {{sunlight}} wavelengths from about 200nbsp&nm UV rays to 315nbsp&nm, with ozone peak absorption at about 250nbsp&nm. This ozone UV absorption is important to life, since it extends the absorption of UV by ordinary oxygen and nitrogen in air (which absorb all wavelengths < 200nbsp&nm) through the lower UV-C (200–280nbsp&nm) and the entire UV-B band (280–315nbsp&nm). The small unabsorbed part that remains of UV-B after passage through ozone causes sunburn in humans, and direct DNA damage in living tissues in both plants and animals. Ozone's effect on mid-range UV-B rays is illustrated by its effect on UV-B at 290nbsp&nm, which has a radiation intensity 350 million times as powerful {{at the top of}} the atmosphere as at the surface. Nevertheless, enough of <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiation</b> at similar frequency reaches the ground to cause some sunburn, and these same wavelengths are also among those responsible for the production of vitamin D in humans.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Flavonoids and {{phenolic}} acids {{have many}} functions in plants {{and they also}} have a antioxidative and anticarcinogenic effects in humans. Stress conditions such as excessive UV light, wounding or infection induces the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds. Light {{is one of the most}} extensively studied environmental factors in the phenolic metabolism. It is thought that phenolic compounds help to attenuate the amount of light reaching the photosynthetic cells. It’s well established that photomorphogenic response are regulated from a complex interactions within a network of phytochrome, cryptochrome and UV-B phototransduction pathways in seedlings, on the other hand no information are available on the role of this interactions for accumulation of flavonoid and phenolic acids in tomato fruits. In the present research tomato photomorphogenic mutants were used under different light conditions to investigate the phytochrome interaction on the photomorphogenic response and on the content of antioxitants and phenolics compounds. In tomato seedlings the hypocotyls length were significantly inhibited by the <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> and the phyB 1 showed a negative regulation of stem elongation. For a maximal flavonoids /anthocyanin accumulation under UV-B in seedlings phyB 1 were required instead phyB 2 acted as a negative regulator of the UV-B signaling in fact in phyB 2 mutants responses were very little and they were minimized in the absence of all 3 major phytochrome. The inhibition of hypocotyl elongation in wild-type tomato was significantly registered only in WG 280 -filtered UV radiations but the active spectral range for the antioxidants content was between 280 - 305 nm all the UB-B spectral range. The fruits antioxidants content was conditioned by genotype and environment interaction. The PHY mutants showed the smallest responses and the phyB 1 played a central role for the correct accumulation of these compounds. Furthermore a microarray-based expression profiling was used to identify the regulated by the <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> in tomato fruits. Differentially expressed gene were identified in WT and phyB 1 mutants and grouped in functional category. In each genotypes there were several answers and genes expression showed the complexity of the UV-B regulation transduction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{current study}} {{demonstrates}} that the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation not only helps in improvement of the red color of the peppers but also reduces their rate of decay. The Capia peppers were harvested at their full red ripe stage and subjected to the UV-B treatment at doses 4. 46 kJ m– 2 (UV-B 15) and 8. 93 kJ m– 2 (UV-B 30). Post irradiation, the peppers were packaged and stored at 5 ± 1 °C temperature with 90 - 95 % RH for 49 days. The UV-B treated group showed lower L* values, but higher a* and h° values {{as compared to the}} control group. Therefore, it was found that both the doses of <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> could enhance the quality of red color of the peppers. However, the lower dose (4. 46 kJ m- 2) was found to be optimal for reducing the decay rate of the peppers.

2500|$|Research by Nina Jablonski {{suggests}} that an estimated time of about 10,000 to 20,000 years {{is enough for}} human populations to achieve optimal skin pigmentation in a particular geographic area but that development of ideal skin coloration may happen faster if the evolutionary pressure is stronger, even {{in as little as}} 100 generations. The length of time is also affected by cultural practices such as food intake, clothing, body coverings, and shelter usage which can alter {{the ways in which the}} environment affects populations. [...] One of the most recently proposed drivers of the evolution of skin pigmentation in humans is based on research that shows a superior barrier function in darkly pigmented skin. Most protective functions of the skin, including the permeability barrier and the antimicrobial barrier, reside in the stratum corneum (SC) and the researchers surmise that the SC has undergone the most genetic change since the loss of human body hair. Natural selection would have favored mutations that protect this essential barrier; one such protective adaptation is the pigmentation of interfollicular epidermis, because it improves barrier function as compared to non-pigmented skin. In lush rainforests, however, where <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiation</b> and xeric stress were not in excess, light pigmentation would not have been nearly as detrimental. This explains the side-by-side residence of lightly pigmented and darkly pigmented peoples.|$|E
50|$|The {{environmental}} {{consequence of}} this discovery was that, since stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet-B (<b>UV-B)</b> <b>radiation</b> reaching {{the surface of the}} planet, depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs would lead to an increase in <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiation</b> at the surface, resulting in an increase in skin cancer and other impacts such as damage to crops and to marine phytoplankton.|$|E

40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiations}} {{have many}} detrimental effects in living organisms that challenge {{the stability and}} function of cellular structures. UV exposure also alters the properties and durability of materials and affects their lifetime. It is becoming increasingly important to develop new biocompatible and environmentally friendly materials to address these issues. Inspired by the strategy developed by fish, algae, and microorganisms exposed to UV radiations in confined ecosystems, we have constructed novel UV-protective materials that exclusively consist of natural compounds. Chitosan {{was chosen as the}} matrix for grafting mycosporines and mycosporine-like amino acids as the functional components of the active materials. Here, we show that these materials are biocompatible, photoresistant, and thermoresistant, and exhibit a highly efficient absorption of both UV-A and <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations.</b> Thus, they have the potential to provide an efficient protection against both types of UV radiations and overcome several shortfalls of the current UV-protective products. In practice, the same concept can be applied to other biopolymers than chitosan and used to produce multifunctional materials. Therefore, it has a great potential to be exploited in a broad range of applications in living organisms and nonliving systems. Susana C. M.

Ppmsh 2 mutants display pleiotropic growth and developmental defects, which reflect genomic instability. Based on loss of function of the APT gene, we estimated this mutator phenotype to be at least 130 times higher in the mutants than in wild type. We also found that MSH 2 is involved in some but not all the moss responses to genotoxic stresses we tested. Indeed, the Ppmsh 2 mutants were more tolerant to cisplatin and show higher sensitivity to <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations.</b> PpMSH 2 gene involvement in HR was studied by assessing gene targeting (GT) efficiency with homologous and homeologous sequences. GT efficiency with homologous sequences was slightly decreased in the Ppmsh 2 mutant compared with wild type.

40|$|The {{causes of}} Neanderthal {{extinction}} and the transition {{with the modern}} man in Europe and Near East;remain largely uncertain. The two main factors currently proposed are {{the arrival of a}} modern human competitor and/or the aptitude of the Neanderthals to survive rapidly changing climatic conditions. None of these hypotheses is fully satisfactory because the Neanderthals experienced other large climatic changes and the duration of overlap of the two populations remains largely unknown and even uncertain. No special attention has been given to the geomagnetic excursions of Laschamp and Mono Lake which are synchroneous with the extinction and were the most dramatic events encountered by the Neanderthals over the past 250 thousand years of their existence. During this period the geomagnetic field strength was considerably reduced and the shielding efficiency of the magnetosphere lowered, leaving energetic particles reach latitudes as low as 30. The enhanced flux of high-energy protons (linked to solar activity) into the atmosphere yielded significant ozone depletion down to latitudes of 40 °. A direct consequence was an increase of the <b>UV-B</b> <b>radiations</b> at the surface which might have reached at least 15 - 20 % in Europe with significant impacts on health of human populations.

Following regimes of <b>UV-B</b> and UV-C <b>radiation</b> were used for 7, 10 or 14 consecutive days: B 1 (4. 4 kJ m- 2 d- 1), B 2 (13. 3 kJ m- 2 d- 1) and C 1 (0. 1 kJ m- 2 d- 1) and C 2 (0. 3 kJ m- 2 d- 1). As compared to control, IAA decreased after 10 days of C 2 irradiation, although B 1 regime caused an increase. At {{the end of the}} experiment IAA was raised in C 2 -treated plants. ABA increased transiently in B 1 treated plants (10 d B 1) but it dropped {{at the end of the}} experiment (14 d UV) after both UV-B and UV-C irradiations. With one exception (7 d B 1), ACC accumulated in the treated plants. The increases in IAA and ABA concentrations after 10 days of B 1 regime was interpreted in relation to plant adaptation. Moderate accumulation in ACC in C 1 - and B 1 -treated plants could also be connected with stimulation of ethylene signal pathway that is needed for the defence system against UV-induced damage. _____________ *Corresponding author...|$|R

The loss in PSII efficiency was further reduced by excluding both UV-B and UV-A light. The photoinactivation of PSII was reversible under shade conditions, but restoration of nearly full activity required at least 10 d. Repeated exposure to direct sunlight induced an increase in the pool size of xanthophyll cycle pigments and in the content of UV-absorbing vacuolar compounds.
