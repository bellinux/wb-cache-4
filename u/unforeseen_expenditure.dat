50|$|The Constitution of India {{authorized}} the parliament {{to establish a}} contingency fund of India. The Contingency Fund of India is established under Article 267(1)of the Indian Constitution. It is {{in the nature of}} an imprest (money maintained for a specific purpose). Accordingly, Parliament enacted the contingency fund of India Act 1950. The fund is held by the Finance Secretary (Department of Economic Affairs) on behalf of the President of India and it can be operated by executive action.The Contingency Fund of India exists for disasters and related unforeseen expenditures. In 2005, it was raised from 50 to Rs 500 crore. Approval of the Parliament of India for such expenditure and for withdrawal of an equivalent amount from the Consolidated Fund is subsequently obtained to ensure that the corpus of the Contingency Fund remains intact. Similarly, Contingency Fund of each State Government is established under Article 267(2) of the Constitution - this is in the nature of an imprest placed at the disposal of the Governor to enable him/her to make advances to meet urgent <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditure,</b> pending authorization by the State Legislature. Approval of the Legislature for such expenditure and for withdrawal of an equivalent amount from the Consolidated Fund is subsequently obtained, whereupon the advances from the Contingency Fund are recouped to the Fund. The corpus varies across states and the quantum is decided by the State legislatures.|$|E
40|$|A bidding {{rotating}} {{savings and}} credit association (Rosca) is modeled as {{a sequence of}} symmetric-independent-private-value auctions with price-proportional benefits to bidders. We estimate a structural econometric model which, by introducing an altruistic component into each bidder's utility function, allows for socially favorable deviations from the private information, non-altruistic bidding equilibrium. We find that bidding is more altruistic in groups managed by experienced organizers and in Roscas whose current members have already run through more than one Rosca cycle of the current group, implying that effective leadership and enduring relationships help mitigate the social cost of strategic behavior. When a bidder has to meet an <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditure</b> and this information is public, bidders act more altruistically than when information is private and the Rosca funds are used for investment, indicating reciprocal risk sharing among Rosca participants. Roscas, Auctions...|$|E
25|$|Regardless of {{continued}} recent critical acclaim of the Playhouse, and despite its steadily popular and ambitious season schedules, the theatre {{had a history}} of financial difficulties since its reopening in the 1980s. Saddled with {{millions of dollars worth of}} debt from earlier <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditures</b> during the theatre's restoration, the Playhouse's operators struggled with balancing interest and loan repayments with increasing running costs.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{critical}} analysis of cash expenditures having {{an effect on the}} family budget in case of finance housing. The theoretical part is aimed at defining the basic terms that are needed to the further understanding of the problem. The next parts contain a critical analysis of the expenditures associated with the financing of housing, including the proposals for measures to eliminate risks arising from the <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditures</b> associated with housing...|$|R
50|$|Diamond and Dybvig's paper {{points out}} that {{business}} investment often requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns in the future. Therefore, they prefer loans with a long maturity (that is, low liquidity). The same principle applies to individuals seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as housing or automobiles. On the other hand, individual savers (both households and firms) may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, due to <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditures.</b> So they demand liquid accounts which permit them immediate access to their deposits (that is, they value short maturity deposit accounts).|$|R
40|$|The {{precautionary savings}} model predicts that {{households}} accumulate wealth to self-insure against unexpected declines in future income and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The goals {{of this study}} are twofold. First, we investigate whether the near-elderly who face higher health risks save more. Second, we examine the factors that contribute to health risks that the near-elderly face. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study to construct two measures of health risks. Our results do not support the hypothesis that household savings increase with the health risks that they face. Individuals who confront higher health risks in the future are those who are already in fair or poor health status or those who have a health condition such as diabetes or lung disease. Lower earnings and high medical expenditures caused by current poor health status prevent households from accumulating savings for future health adversities...|$|R
50|$|Article 106 {{creates a}} Contingencies Fund, {{to be used}} in the event of an urgent and <b>unforeseen</b> need for <b>expenditure.</b> Use of the fund {{requires}} the approval of the House of an Assembly by way of an appropriation Bill.|$|R
50|$|Through <b>unforeseen</b> {{circumstances}} the <b>expenditure</b> of the Company has considerably exceeded {{what was}} at first anticipated, but notwithstanding of this the directors trust that the benefit done to the district and the securing to the shareholders a permanent dividend of 3.25% is not an inadequate return for the labour and money expended.|$|R
50|$|The {{large number}} of {{attendees}} required an <b>unforeseen</b> level of <b>expenditure</b> by festival organizers; by the festival's conclusion, the organization had a debt in excess of C$40,000. To remedy their financial situation, the organizers held horse races as a fundraiser {{in conjunction with the}} 1971 festival. The 1971 festival was a success, drawing nearly 200,000 guests. However, instead of resolving the financial situation, the fundraiser pushed the organization further into debt.|$|R
40|$|Energy is the {{critical}} limiting resource to mobile computing devices. Correspondingly, an operating system must track, provision, and ration how applications consume energy. The emergence of third-party application stores and marketplaces makes this concern even more pressing. A third-party application must not deny service through excessive, <b>unforeseen</b> energy <b>expenditure,</b> whether accidental or malicious. Previous research has shown promise in tracking energy usage and rationing it to meet device lifetime goals, but such mechanisms and policies are still nascent, especially regarding user interaction. We argue for a new operating system, called Cinder, which builds {{on top of the}} HiStar OS. Cinderâ€™s energy awareness is based on hierarchical capacitors and task profiles. We introduce and explore these abstractions, paying particular attention {{to the ways in which}} policies could be generated and enforced in a dynamic system...|$|R
50|$|Section 76 {{describes}} {{the role of}} the Director of Finance of the Falkland Islands who lays out the revenues and expenditure of the islands which then must be authorised by the Legislative Assembly. Section 78 sets up a Contingencies Fund, {{to be used in the}} event of an urgent and <b>unforeseen</b> need for <b>expenditure.</b> Use of the fund requires the approval of the Legislative Assembly via an appropriation Bill. A Public Accounts Committee is set up by section 81, which also {{describes the}} membership, election and powers of the Committee.|$|R
40|$|Main {{objective}} {{in this article}} is to describe in more details specific interlinkages and exchange that is unfolding between political elite and entrepreneurs as key actors that possess, manage and deploy economic resources in the private sector of the economy. The focus is on the specific mechanisms through which the exchange has been unfolding, {{as well as on the}} perception of the functionality of the exchange for the position and interests of both type of actors. The analysis is conducted using empirical findings from the qualitative, in-depth research on political clientelism and party patronage implemented in the spring 2015 upon sample of 55 representatives of political elite, 26 economic actors, 9 interlocking broker and 8 experts. From the research, it is clear that economic actors have, to put it mildly, ambivalent attitude towards this way of functioning of the market. On the one hand, they feel all the risks they are exposed to: additional <b>expenditure,</b> <b>unforeseen</b> requirements, interference in their own personnel policy, uncertainty of their business in the long term, unfair competition, demand unpredictability etc. On the other hand, they take this play as given. When they think strategically, they rationally consider alternatives and cost-benefit relationship. Although the desire to get rid of the political embrace is present, the support that comes from that side represents at least a short-term guarantor of their position security. Political actors take this system as given to a certain extent and when describing the mechanisms of its functioning, they do not question the system itself...|$|R
