5|$|One {{definition}} sees language {{primarily as}} the mental faculty that allows humans to undertake linguistic behaviour: to learn languages and {{to produce and}} understand utterances. This definition stresses the universality of language to all humans, and it emphasizes the biological basis for the human capacity for language as a unique development of the human brain. Proponents of {{the view that the}} drive to language acquisition is innate in humans argue that this is supported by the fact that all cognitively normal children raised in an environment where language is accessible will acquire language without formal instruction. Languages may even develop spontaneously in environments where people live or grow up together without a common language; for example, creole languages and spontaneously developed sign languages such as Nicaraguan Sign Language. This view, which {{can be traced back to}} the philosophers Kant and Descartes, understands language to be largely innate, for example, in Chomsky's theory of <b>Universal</b> <b>Grammar,</b> or American philosopher Jerry Fodor's extreme innatist theory. These kinds of definitions are often applied in studies of language within a cognitive science framework and in neurolinguistics.|$|E

25|$|The term <b>universal</b> <b>grammar</b> (or UG) is {{used for}} the innate {{biological}} properties of the human brain, whatever exactly they turn out to be, that are responsible for children's rapid and overwhelmingly successful acquisition of a native language, without any obvious effort, during {{the first few years of}} life. The person most strongly associated with the scientific investigation of UG is Noam Chomsky, although the idea of <b>Universal</b> <b>Grammar</b> has clear historical antecedents at least as far back as the 1600s, in the form of the Port-Royal Grammar.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} issue of {{apparently}} limited input, one must turn to what is possibly the most quoted of all arguments in support of <b>universal</b> <b>grammar</b> and its nativist interpretation – Plato's Problem.

40|$|Introduction What do {{the terms}} "derivational" and "representational" {{actually}} mean for linguistic theory? As formally equivalent, mutually intertranslatable ways of characterizing sets of linguistic expressions, derivationality {{might appear to}} be a mathematical topic orthogonal to the core issues of linguistics [...] an epiphenomenon of the way linguistic insights are expressed. Such a position insulates linguistic theory from questions about computational complexity at the cost of retreating to a level of abstraction at which a linguistic principle is just a schema for an infinity of equivalent but unspecified proposals. Instead, I take the position that <b>Universal</b> <b>Grammar's</b> derivationality or non-derivationality is an empirical, and open question. This empirical position on derivationality prompts an important question when juxtaposed with considerations of conceptual simplicity: can particular theories in one mode or the other be actually intertranslated?

25|$|There {{are several}} {{concepts}} {{important to the}} Chomskyan (or generativist) approach to linguistics. The most fundamental of these ideas is the theory of <b>universal</b> <b>grammar</b> (UG). Simply put, and as implied by the name, UG refers to those grammatical properties thought to be shared by all (to be universal to all) derivations of human language (anything from Amharic to Zhuang).|$|E
25|$|Linguistics {{has many}} sub-fields {{concerned}} with particular aspects of linguistic structure. The theory that elucidates on these, as propounded by Noam Chomsky, {{is known as}} generative theory or <b>universal</b> <b>grammar.</b> These sub-fields range from those focused primarily on form to those focused primarily on meaning. They also run the gamut of level of analysis of language, from individual sounds, to words, to phrases, up to cultural discourse.|$|E
25|$|Within this framework, {{the goal}} of {{linguistics}} is to identify all of the principles and parameters that are universal to human language (called <b>Universal</b> <b>Grammar).</b> As such, any attempt to explain the syntax of a particular language using a principle or parameter is cross-examined with the evidence available in other languages. This leads to continual refinement of the theoretical machinery of generative linguistics {{in an attempt to}} account for as much syntactic variation in human language as possible.|$|E
40|$|Universal grammar(UG) {{is a list}} of innate {{constraints}} that specify the set of grammars that can be learned by the child during primary language acquisition. UG of the human brain has been shaped by evolution. Evolution requires variation. Hence, we have to postulate and study variation of UG. We investigate evolutionary dynamics and language acquisition in the context of multiple <b>universal</b> <b>grammars.</b> We provide examples for competitive exclusion and stable coexistence of different UGs. More specific UGs admit fewer candidate grammars, and less specific UGs admit more candidate grammars. We will analyze conditions for more specific UGs to outcompete less specific UGs and vice versa. An interesting finding is that less specific UGs can resist invasion by more specific UGs if learning is more accurate. In other words, accurate learning stabilizes UGs that admit large numbers of candidate grammars. c ○ 2003 Society for Mathematical Biology 1...|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{proposed}} that humans possess an innate, domain-specific moral faculty, and that this faculty might be fruitfully understood by drawing a close analogy with nativist theories in linguistics. This Linguistic Analogy (LA) hypothesizes that humans share a <b>universal</b> moral <b>grammar.</b> In this paper I argue that this conception is deeply flawed. After profiling a recent and appealing account of <b>universal</b> moral <b>grammar,</b> I suggest that recent empirical findings reveal a significant flaw, which {{takes the form of}} a dilemma: either there is something wrong with the moral grammar model because we do not actually possess the innate contents (rules, principles, and concepts) it says we have, or the moral grammar model is simply the wrong model of moral cognition. In light of this dilemma, I conclude we ought to be skeptical that the Linguistic Analogy can adequately serve as a general account of moral cognition...|$|R

25|$|In Plato's philosophy, innate {{ideas are}} {{revealed}} through the Socratic Method of investigation. In linguistics, <b>universal</b> <b>grammar</b> must have {{input from the}} environment (primary linguistic data) in order for children to achieve an individual grammar (output).

25|$|Lenneberg {{was also}} one of the first {{cognitive}} scientists to begin development of the Universalist theory of language that was formulated by Chomsky in the form of <b>Universal</b> <b>Grammar,</b> effectively arguing that all languages share the same underlying structure. The Chomskyan school also holds the belief that linguistic structures are largely innate and that what are perceived as differences between specific languages are surface phenomena that do not affect the brain's universal cognitive processes. This theory became the dominant paradigm in American linguistics from the 1960s through the 1980s, while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule.|$|E
25|$|Plato's Problem {{describes}} {{the disparity between}} input (poverty of the stimulus) and output (grammar). As Plato suggests in the Meno dialogue, the bridge between input (whether limited or lacking) and output is innate knowledge. Poverty of the stimulus {{is crucial to the}} Platonic argument and it is a linchpin concept in Chomskyan linguistics. For this reason, Plato's Problem is often used synonymously to mean poverty of the stimulus. Specific to linguistics, the formulation of this problem is evidence for the existence of <b>universal</b> <b>grammar.</b> Plato's Problem, as conceived here, informs much of the theory in this branch of linguistics.|$|E

25|$|A {{hypothesis}} that all creole languages derive their grammar from the medieval Mediterranean Lingua Franca was widely {{held at the}} end of the 1950s and the beginning of the 1960s before it fell out of favour. It was later argued that, for example, the grammar of Haitian Creole is a substratum, created when Fon-speaking African slaves relexified their language with French vocabulary, because of underlying similarities between Haitian and Fon. However, the role of relexification in creole genesis is disputed by adherents of generative grammar. , , , and , for example, have argued that the similarities in syntax reflect a hypothetical <b>Universal</b> <b>Grammar,</b> not the workings of relexification processes.|$|E
25|$|Born to middle-class Ashkenazi Jewish {{immigrants}} in Philadelphia, Chomsky developed an early interest in anarchism from alternative bookstores in New York City. At {{the age of}} 16 he began studies at the University of Pennsylvania, taking courses in linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy. From 1951 to 1955 he was appointed to Harvard University's Society of Fellows, where he developed the theory of transformational grammar {{for which he was}} awarded his doctorate in 1955. That year he began teaching at MIT, in 1957 emerging as a significant figure in the field of linguistics for his landmark work Syntactic Structures, which remodeled the scientific study of language, while from 1958 to 1959 he was a National Science Foundation fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study. He is credited as the creator or co-creator of the <b>universal</b> <b>grammar</b> theory, the generative grammar theory, the Chomsky hierarchy, and the minimalist program. Chomsky also played a pivotal role in the decline of behaviorism, being particularly critical of the work of B. F. Skinner.|$|E
25|$|Children come {{equipped}} with <b>universal</b> <b>grammar,</b> from which any natural human language will develop – without instruction. All {{that is needed}} is passive input during the critical period—defined in linguistics as that period within which a child must have necessary and sufficient exposure to human language so that language acquisition occurs; without sufficient exposure to primary linguistic data, the UG {{does not have the}} necessary input for development of an individual grammar; this period is commonly recognized as spanning from birth to adolescence, generally up to the age of 12 years, though individual variations are possible. If what the child predominantly hears (or sees via sign) as it is maturing through this critical period is the English spoken in Topeka, Kansas, then that is what the child will acquire. This is why, regardless of a child's ethnic/racial background (or any other non-relevant factor, the child will know Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu if the child's primary linguistic input is Cockney English, Egyptian Arabic, or isiZulu, respectively.|$|E

50|$|The {{language}} bioprogram {{theory or}} language bioprogram hypothesis (LBH) {{is a theory}} arguing that the structural similarities between different creole languages cannot be solely attributed to their superstrate and substrate languages. As articulated mostly by Derek Bickerton, creolization occurs when the linguistic exposure of children in a community consists solely of a highly unstructured pidgin; these children use their innate language capacity to transform the pidgin, which characteristically has high syntactic variability, into a language with a highly structured grammar. As this capacity is <b>universal,</b> the <b>grammars</b> of these new languages have many similarities.|$|R
25|$|During {{the last}} half of the 20th century, {{following}} the work of Noam Chomsky, linguistics was dominated by the generativist school. While formulated by Chomsky in part as a way to explain how human beings acquire language and the biological constraints on this acquisition, in practice it has largely been concerned with giving formal accounts of specific phenomena in natural languages. Generative theory is modularist and formalist in character. Chomsky built on earlier work of Zellig Harris to formulate the generative theory of language. According to this theory the most basic form of language is a set of syntactic rules universal for all humans and underlying the grammars of all human languages. This set of rules is called <b>Universal</b> <b>Grammar,</b> and for Chomsky describing it is the primary objective of the discipline of linguistics. For this reason the grammars of individual languages are of importance to linguistics only in so far as they allow us to discern the universal underlying rules from which the observable linguistic variability is generated.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this article is to explain, that Transformational <b>Grammars</b> take Linguistic <b>Universals</b> as <b>Grammar</b> <b>Universals.</b> From the point of view of this hypothesis, a {{discourse}} identification with its object is implied, and it shows one of the common characteristics of the empirical conception of knowledge, which operates by means of extraction, abstraction and practice techniques, in order to make a distinction between formal and substantive universals. The transformational cycle as a project is devised according to this empirical conception and, consequently, the transformational order does not occur in the reality of language. The Rule of Tree-Pruning bears no connection with reality, since the meta-rule that eliminates those sentences which have not undergone pruning is a mere artefact of Grammar, and not a reflection of the actual organization of language in the human brain. Finally, the Universalist Unitarian Hyphotesis considers as a priori forms both formal and substantive universals, the first being syntactic and the second semantic, the two of them coming from the same source: the Idea. But such forms are not available in language...|$|R
