40|$|Objectives:When {{metallic}} prosthetic {{appliances and}} dental fillings {{exist in the}} oral cavity, the appearance of metal-induced streak artefacts are not avoidable in CT images. The study {{was to develop a}} method for artefact reduction using the statistical reconstruction on MD (multi-detectors row) CT images. Methods:Adjacent CT images often depict similar anatomical structures. Therefore, reconstructed images with weak artefacts were attempted using projection data of an artefact-free image in a neighboring thin slice. Images with moderate and strong artefacts were continuously processed in sequence by successive iterative restoration where projection data was generated from the adjacent reconstructed slice. First, the basic maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) algorithm was applied. Next, the ordered subset-expectation maximization (OS-EM) algorithm was examined. Alternatively, a small region of interest (ROI) setting was designated. Finally, the GPGPU (general purpose graphic processing <b>unit)</b> <b>machine</b> was applied in both situations. Results:The algorithms reduced metal-induced streak artefacts on MDCT images when the sequential processing method was applied. The OS-EM and small ROI reduced the processing duration without apparent detriments. GPGPU realized the high performance. Conclusions:A statistical reconstruction method was applied for the streak artefact reduction. The alternatives of algorithms applied were effective. Both software and hardware tools, such as OS-EM, small ROI and GPGPU achieved fast artefact correction...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the late}} nineteenth century when high-cost {{equipment}} was introduced into forestry there has been a need to calculate the cost of this equipment in more detail with respect to, for example, cost of ownership, cost per hour of production, and cost per production <b>unit.</b> <b>Machine</b> cost calculations have been made using various standard economic methods, where costs have been subdivided into capital costs and operational costs. Because of differences between methods and between national regulations, mainly regarding tax rules and subsidies, international comparisons of machine costs are difficult.

The model gives users a simultaneous view of the input parameters and the resulting cost outputs.

40|$|In {{distributed}} memory concurrent computing, the ongoing challenge {{has been to}} optimally mate complex applications and complex hardware to achieve optimal use of resources. Traditionally, two metrics to assess success have been used. These are absolute performance, and performance per <b>unit</b> <b>machine</b> cost. One overlooked metric {{is the cost of}} software development and maintenance. This measure is strongly affected by the programming paradigm. Over the years {{there have been a number}} of proposed paradigms. They are parallel languages, coordination languages, language extensions, shared objects, and virtual shared memory. The most widely used paradigm for {{distributed memory}} systems has been message passing. The issues of control/communication strategy and its implementation, is a major hurtle to be overcome before the benefits of distributed computing can be employed. It is the goal of this research to create a Distributed Applications Builder (DAB), which will aid the distributed systems ’ user by hiding the control/communications aspects under a higher level of abstraction. This framework must produce multiprocess coordination mechanisms with which the end-user can operate. As a step towards the development of DAB and its communication foundation, this report focuses on the message passing paradigm for distributed memory computing. This is not an exhaustive list of existing systems, but is representative of message passing systems and their evolution over the years. The report discusses the progression of message passin...|$|E
40|$|Background Developments in the {{manufacturing}} environment such as shifting markets, emerging technologies and increasing competition require fundamental changes. One aspect is {{the integration of the}} activities process planning and process scheduling with the objective to balance resource loading, avoid bottlenecks and lower resource utilization. Method One approach to integrate process planning and scheduling is computer simulation. A manufacturing process of Supreme Precision Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is analysed by the use of a hybrid simulation model. Agent-based modeling and discrete event simulation are combined to investigate the impact of alternating set ups on the process. Different levels of flexibility, different decision criteria and different queuing principles are introduced into the model {{with the use of the}} software AnyLogic. Results The quantitative results show that a dynamic process is able to produce more output with shorter processing times per unit than a static process in the same period. Additionally, the machines in a dynamic process are more utilized and the waiting times per unit are shorter. Furthermore, it is more effective to base a decision for or against an alternative machine on the current queue length, rather than the average queue length or the machine utilization, as these processes provide better results in terms of output, processing time per <b>unit,</b> <b>machine</b> utilization and waiting time per unit. Last but not least, as soon as some flexibility is intro-duced into the process, a process applying LIFO queuing principles is more efficient than one applying FIFO. Conclusion The results confirm with theoretical goals and objectives of an efficient schedul-ing activity such as minimizing average flow time or maximizing machine utilization as pointed out by Tan and Khoshnevis (2000). However, the results are very case sensitive, which means it is difficult to make general assumptions or conclusions for other manufactur-ing environments or processes based on these results...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the design, the main {{characteristics}} and the automation systems of innovative autonomous ground mobile units (GMU) for physical weed control (PWC) in maize are described. The machine {{will be created}} within {{the activities of the}} European Project RHEA (Robot fleets for Highly Effective Agriculture and forestry management), that aims to produce different prototypes of autonomous terrestrial and aerial robot able to perform several activities related to the general crop protection in different agricultural scenarios. The first autonomous ground <b>unit</b> <b>machine</b> was designed in order to perform a mechanical and thermal treatment removing weeds from the inter-row crop space and applying in-row selective and precision flaming by means of two crossed LPG rod burners. By means of some modifications of the tools {{it will be possible to}} realize also an autonomous unit for the precision broadcast flaming application. In this case the design involves a replacement of the mechanical tools working in the inter-row space with 50 cm wide burners able to perform flaming at different intensities according to weed cover detected by the perception system of the robot. The working width of both the PWC machines will be of 4. 5 m, thus covering five entire maize inter-row spaces of 0. 75 m each and 2 half inter-row space of 0. 375 m each. The correct position of the tools (mechanical and thermal) will be guaranteed by an automatic precision guidance system connected and supervised to an image based row detection system. Each working elements will be provided by two crossed 0. 25 m wide rod burners, hitting one side of each crop row. The flame should hit the weeds growing in the “inrow” space (a 0. 25 m wide strip of soil with the maize plant in the middle). Regarding the control of the weed emerged in the “inter-row” space each working unit of the will be provided with rigid tools (one central foot-goose and two side “L” shaped sweeps). The mechanical treatment will be performed, independently from the weed presence, as hoeing is a very important agronomical practice. On the contrary, broadcast flaming in the inter-row space will be performed after weed detection, using three different LPG pressures and doses according to weed cover (no weed cover-no treatment, weed cover between 0 and 25...|$|E
