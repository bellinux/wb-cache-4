5|$|Technetium plays {{no natural}} {{biological}} role {{and is not}} normally found in the human body. Technetium is produced in quantity by nuclear fission, and spreads more readily than many radionuclides. It appears to have low chemical toxicity. For example, no significant change in blood formula, body and organ weights, and food consumption could be detected for rats which ingested up to 15µg of technetium-99 per gram of food for several weeks. The radiological toxicity of technetium (per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass)</b> {{is a function of}} compound, type of radiation for the isotope in question, and the isotope's half-life.|$|E
25|$|There {{are much}} larger {{discrepancies}} {{in some other}} units. For example, the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> in atomic units is the mass of an electron, while the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> in Planck units is the Planck mass, a mass so large that if a single particle had that much mass it might collapse into a black hole. Indeed, the Planck <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> is 22 orders of magnitude larger than the au <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass.</b> Similarly, there are many orders of magnitude separating the Planck units of energy and length from the corresponding atomic units.|$|E

50|$|From the {{equation}} for density (ρ = m / V), <b>mass</b> density has <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> divided by volume.

The SI <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> kilogram per cubic metre (kg/m3) and the cgs <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> gram per cubic centimetre (g/cm3) {{are probably the most}} commonly used units for density.1,000 kg/m3 equals 1 g/cm3. (The cubic centimeter can be alternately called a millilitre or a cc.)

The slug is defined as the amount of mass that accelerates at 1ft/s2 when one pound-force is exerted on it, and is equivalent to about 32.2 pounds (mass).|$|E
25|$|The megaelectronvolt (MeV) is {{commonly}} used as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> in particle physics, and these values are also important for the practical determination of relative atomic masses.

The total binding energy of the six electrons in a carbon-12 atom is 1030.1089eV= : Eb/muc2= , or about one part in 10million of the mass of the atom.|$|E
25|$|The SI base <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> is the {{kilogram}} {{which was}} originally defined in 1795 as {{the mass of}} one litre of water at the temperature of melting ice (0°C), though to ensure greater consistency of kilogram artefacts, {{and to create a}} practical physical realisation of the kilogram, a platinum artefact intended to have the mass of precisely 1kg was manufactured and placed in the French Archives in 1799. This artefact was replaced by one of British manufacture in 1889 which then became, and is still (as of 2013), the definitive kilogram, although it is anticipated that the kilogram will be redefined in terms of fundamental physical constants in the near future, thus bringing it in line with the other SI base units.|$|E

25|$|In 1670, John Wilkins, {{the first}} {{president}} of the Royal Society, published his proposal for a decimal system of measure, in his work An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language. His proposal envisaged a system of units in which the base unit of length was defined by a pendulum that had a period of one second, and the base <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> was defined by a cube of rainwater having sides equal to the base unit of length. He recycled the existing names of units of measure, so that there were 10 lines in an inch, 10inches in a foot, and so on. A century later, his concept of defining unit mass in terms of a cube of water with edges of unit length was one of the fundamental concepts of the metric system.|$|E

500|$|On 7 April 1795, the gramme, {{upon which}} the {{kilogram}} is based, was decreed to be equal to [...] "the absolute weight of a volume of pure water equal to a cube of one hundredth of a metre, and at {{the temperature of the}} melting ice". Although this was the definition of the gram, the regulation of trade and commerce required a [...] "practical realisation": a single-piece, metallic reference standard that was one thousand times more massive that would be known as grave. This mass unit, whose name is derived from the word [...] "gravitas", which was the Latin word for [...] "weight" [...] at the time, defined by Lavoisier and René Just Haüy had been in use since 1793. Notwithstanding that the definition of the base <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> was the gramme (alternatively [...] "gravet"), this new, practical realisation would ultimately become the base <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass.</b> A provisional kilogram standard was made and work was commissioned to determine the precise mass of a cubic decimetre (later to be defined as equal to one litre) of water.|$|E
