5|$|Singapore's LTA {{together}} with IBM, ran a pilot from December 2006 to April 2007, with a traffic estimation and prediction tool (TrEPS), which uses historical traffic data and real-time feeds with flow conditions from several sources, {{in order to}} predict the levels of congestion <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> in advance. By accurately estimating prevailing and emerging traffic conditions, this technology is expected to allow variable pricing, {{together with}} improved overall traffic management, including the provision of information in advance to alert drivers about conditions ahead, and the prices being charged at that moment.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character of the call changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct over a period of a few minutes or <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' {{left and right}} flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering {{the brunt of the}} assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the first}} birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and {{extremely}} varied. The male sings from a roost for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> beginning twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. The song is a running series of cheerful notes sounding like chick-up, chick-up, from which its common name of quitchup is derived. Counter-singing (repeating the first bird's song) by neighbouring birds is common. The territorial call, also given by opponents during fights, is a long preet with an upward inflection. The alarm call is a loud trilling whistle. Common calls, thought to be contact calls, are animated two-note calls variously described as terric, terric, cr-rook, cr-rook or put-put, put-put.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from behind. Such detours may take <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E
5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour</b> after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E

25|$|Courtship is not elaborate; {{the female}} must raise her wing {{to allow the}} male to couple with her. The moths remain in copula for <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour,</b> but the {{transfer}} of the spermatophore is usually accomplished within 10 minutes. Male moths can inseminate more than one female. Multiple mating in females is possible, but uncommon, because the female stops releasing the attracting pheromone after mating. After mating, the females begin depositing the eggs.|$|E

25|$|Like {{many other}} prosimians, the female aye-aye is {{dominant}} to the male. They are not typically monogamous, and will often challenge {{each other for}} mates. Male aye-ayes are very assertive in this way, and sometimes even pull other males away from a female during mating. Males are normally locked to females during mating in sessions that may last <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour.</b> Outside of mating, males and females interact only occasionally, usually while foraging. The aye-aye {{is thought to be}} the only primate which uses echolocation to find its prey.|$|E

40|$|After {{debridement}} {{and before}} dressing a wound with maggots of calliphorid fies, one frequently performed step is {{the application of}} antiseptics to the prepared wound bed. However, the concomitant application of antiseptic agents during maggot therapy is regarded controversial as antiseptics may interfere with maggots’ viability. In this experimental in vitro study, the viability of fy maggots was investigated after exposure to various antiseptics frequently used in wound care. Here, we show that Lucilia sericata fy maggots can survive <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>hour’s</b> exposure <b>to</b> wound antiseptics such as octenidine, povidone-iodine or polihexanide. Concomitant short-term application of wound antiseptics together with maggots on wound beds is tolerated by larvae and does not impair their viability...|$|R
