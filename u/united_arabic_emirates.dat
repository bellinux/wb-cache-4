5000|$|... "Heritage language" [...] is {{the term}} used to {{describe}} a language which is predominantly spoken by [...] "nonsocietal" [...] groups and linguistic minorities. [...] "Heritage languages include indigenous languages that are often endangered[...] [...] as well as world languages that are commonly spoken in many {{other regions of the}} world (Spanish in the <b>United</b> States, <b>Arabic</b> in France)" [...] The label heritage is given to a language based principally on the social status of its speakers and not necessarily on any linguistic property. Thus, while Spanish typically comes in second in terms of native speakers worldwide and has official status in a number of countries, it is considered a heritage language in the English-dominant United States. Speakers of the same heritage language raised in the same community may differ significantly in terms of their language abilities, yet be considered heritage speakers under this definition. Some heritage speakers may be highly proficient in the language, possessing several registers, while other heritage speakers may be able to understand the language but not produce it. Other individuals that simply have a cultural connection with a minority language but do not speak it may consider it to be their heritage language.|$|R
