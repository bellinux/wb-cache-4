40|$|Phonological {{learners}} must {{acquire a}} lexicon of underlying forms and a constraint ranking. These must be acquired simultaneously, as the ranking {{and the underlying}} forms are interdependent. Exhaustive search of all possible lexica is intractable; the space of lexica is simply too large. Searching the underlying forms for each overt form in isolation poses other problems. A single overt form is often highly ambiguous among both underlying forms and rankings. In this dissertation I propose a learning algorithm that attends to pairs of overt forms that differ in exactly one morpheme. These pairs can exhibit less ambiguity than the isolated overt forms, while still providing a reduced search space. The algorithm first assigns underlying values to occurrences of features whose surface realization never alternates; the other underlying features are left initially <b>unset</b> (Tesar et al., 2003). Pairs of overt forms that differ in one morpheme are then constructed. The algorithm then considers the possible values of <b>unset</b> features for each pair, processing pairs with the fewest <b>unset</b> features first. It uses inconsistency detection (Tesar, 1997) to test sets of values of <b>unset</b> features for viability. A set of values for the <b>unset</b> features i...|$|R

40|$|Alarm {{systems with}} keypads, sensors and sirens protect our homes and {{commercial}} premises from intruders. The reliability {{of these systems}} has improved {{over the past years}} but the technology has remained largely as it was 3 decades ago. With simple keypads and generally 4 digit PIN codes used for setting and <b>unsetting</b> the alarms, the main protection against a determined intruder is the necessity to choose robust PIN codes. However, with PIN codes chosen that are generally easy to remember and therefore relatively easy to guess, or numbers chosen to follow a pattern on the keypad, the main protection from these systems lies in the ability to detect an intruder as they approach the keypad. This gives the intruder very little time to try multiple codes meaning the systems are secure because the intruder is detected quickly. This research looks at the choices of PIN codes and the patterns that they often follow, and sets out the forthcoming research that will look at circumventing the safeguards by performing computer driven attacks against the codes when access to the device is possible and when remote access to the device can be made over the telephone system. Additionally, the forensic evidence left behind by an attacker is discussed and how simple enhancements to systems can have significant advantages in enhancing the amount of evidence that can be found. This paper describes the preliminary findings from analysing 700 alarm codes used in alarm systems throughout New Zealand and describes the planned research into alarm system security and forensic evidence remaining after a successful attack by an intruder...|$|E
40|$|The degration in {{the modern}} pattern of heroism during the 20 th century America started {{with the advent of}} science and materialistic look of life. Modern {{scientific}} studies proposed that "man is alone, absolutely alone in a universe in which his very appearance is a cosmic accident" tending, at his best, towards an animal ancestor. Man was not cared for by spiritual or moral providence. The over soul, which the American hero was supposed to melt in, was replaced by the machine which ironically metamorphosed his significance. Modern American's pursuit of worldly gains was ultimately made at the expense of his essential spiritual and moral priorities as any material gain must be balanced against a spiritual loss. This fact is made concrete in the dehumanized character of Joe, the protagonist of Clifford Odets's Golden Boy (1937), through his aggressive anti-social behaviour. He is characterized by a lack of community. Golden Boy shows how the Americans are increasingly enervated by economic strains, racist tensions and political intimidation. Almost everywhere was the lost sense of community, a sense of inner defeat and lost self-esteem. The lost sense of community was very harmful as the Americans started looking for survival at the expense of society itself; social and economic injustices arose. Odets introduces such a motif in the character of Joe. Edward Albee (1928) is one of the significant American dramatists of the 20 th century, uses the dramatic forms that were prominent on the postwar European stage to articulate an <b>unsetting</b> vision of the United States. He wrote about the emptiness of American cultures and the uncertainties of human existence. His work castigated what he sees as a blindly materialistic society devoid of any real sense of values and national purpose. He is against the materialism in the society which goes along with consumerism. The characters in The American Dream (1961) are materialistic. Mommy represents women's addiction to shopping.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 İnsansı robotların gerek ev gerek çalışma ortamlarında insanlarla birlikte çalışacağı bir gelecek öngörüsü ile robotik alanında sosyal robotik ismi verilen yeni bir alan doğmuş ve son yıllarda bu alanda yapılan araştırmaların sayısı hızla artmıştır. İnsanlarla yan yana ve işbirliği içinde robotların çalışabilmesi için vazgeçilmez üç ana unsuru birleştirmeleri gerekmektedir: (1) İnsanlar için tasarlanmış bir ortamda gerekli olan hareket esnekliğine sahip olma, (2) kararlı ve uzun süre çalışabilecek bir iletişim altyapısı ve (3) çalıştığı ortamda verilen görevleri yerine getirirken karşılaştığı engellerden sakınma. Bu çalışmada yukarıda sıralanan üç temel özellik, kararlı bir robot işletim sistemi altyapısı kullanılarak gerçekleştirilmiş. Bu sayede donanım ile yazılımlar arasında kararlı bir bağlantı oluşturulup sistemin modüler olması sağlanmıştır. Geliştirilen uygulamalar sayesinde insansı robot için servis robotiğinde kullanılmak üzere bazı kontrol ve veri alış-verişi alt-yapısı hazırlanmıştır. Örneğin robot, ofis ve ev ortamlarını tanılayıp içerde bulunan insanları ve hareketli nesneleri takip edebilecektir. Verilen görevleri yerine getirirken engellerden sakınacaktır ve kararlı bir işletim sistemi altyapısıyla daha önceden planlanmış görevleri hata olmadan yerine getirecektir. Robotun öğrenmeyi belli bir başarımla gerçekleştirebilmesi için ilk öncül olan taklit etme yeteneği (mimesis) bulunmaktadır. Bu uygulamalar ile robot, servis amaçlı robotik uygulamalarına da hazır bir alt yapı içermektedir ve az bir güncelleme ve uyarlama ile yaşlı-hasta bakımı vb. uygulamalarda kullanılabilir. A new {{research}} area called social robotics {{has been established}} since it was understood that in near future humans and robots will have to share the same working environment as in the office scenarios and the robots will be of service at our homes. In order to realize this visionary future, the robots need {{to be capable of}} (1) Flexibility to move around in the environments originally designed for humans and the compliance to handle dynamic force changes, (2) stable and long-term erro-free communication infrastructure, (3) mapping and navigating through non-collision roadmaps. In this work, all the three targets have been deployed on a robot specific operating system called ROS which is supported by several academical and professional institutions all over the world. By using such an operating system, robot’s high level software is made independent from hardware infrastucture. Standartization of a robot operating system help developers with using several libraries without software dependcy problems. Robot Operating System is modular so developers can change any algorithm with another causing no harm to software infrastructure. Using these applications and implementations, the service robot can navigate and perform tasks without causing any damage to humans. By using 3 d sensors, robot can detect and follow people’s motions and imitate them. While performing pre-defined tasks such as daily house tasks (<b>unsetting</b> table, emptying dishwasher), robot can avoid dynamic or static obstacles. These applications contains three fundemantel operations that a service robot must have in an enviroment which is placed by humans. By applying small modifications, developers can adapt this system to various social applications such as elderly-care or child education. This work consists of five chapters. First one is the introduction chapter which gives detailed research on robots using robot operating system and its several benefits which fastens the design process for developers. The research is extending from academical works to industrial applications of robot operating system. The second chapter focuses on the hardware and software infrastructure and gives detailed description of tools that are used while developing the infrastructure. In this work, robot uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor for 3 D perception, MINI-ITX board as the computer, ROS as the operating system. Robot uses several packages in order to fasten the software design of the robot such as transformation packages, robot description packages, motion planning packages, services and nodes which enables robot programs communicate with each others. Chapter 3 gives detailed theoratical information about algorithms which are used by packages,nodes and services and 3 D design of the robot. 3 D design of the robot is created by a 3 D CAD program. Robot uses trajectory filters for smoothing the planned motion. Motion planning generates paths that are not in collision with enviroment. Inverse kinematics is used for solving the target position and orientation. Kinect helps robot with imitating humans’ motion Trajectory planner is using cubic and quintic polinomial splines which smooth the paths created by the motion planning algorithm. Smoothed trajectories prevent robot exceed its joints’ maximum velocities and accelerations. Smoothed trajectories create more human like motions for a robot. Motion planners are the main structure which creates collision free paths by using Single Query Bi-directional PRM with Lazy Collision Checking algorithm based on probabilistic road maps. Basically PRM based motion planners, randomly generates points on robot’s workspace and eliminates the points which are in collision with obstacles or robot itself. The points that are not in collision are connected together in order to create collision free paths which robot can perform several tasks without damaging the enviroment or itself. Robot uses newton raphson method which is a numerical method and a recursive algorithm. Given a maximum number of iterations and a maximum error value, the solver tries to converge the tip position and orientation of the robot to target position and orientation within joint limits. Kinect is used to imitate humans’ motion by calculating humans’ arm and elbow joint angles. The angles are normalized and applied to robot’s arm joints considering the fact that robot’s arm joints’ limits are not exceeded. Chapter 4 is the implementation part. In the implementation part, a very powerful simulator called Gazebo is used in order to analyze the robots’ joint motions and torques by integrating the 3 D desing and the robot operating system. By using such a power simulator, errors that are made during the design can be detected and fixed easily. Modeling the service robot in a powerful simulation enviorement is very important because the real service robot may not be ready to use every time it is needed. But in a simulation enviroment, developers can work on robot any time they want to. It is very important to check results of the algorithms and fix the bugs in a simulation enviroment before deploying it on the actual robot. Considering the modularity, a simulation enviroment gives possibilty to developers and researches maintain their contributions regardless of locality, this means robot can be developed by several contributors from all over the world. In chapter 4, joint torques and dynamics of the robot are analyzed and in conclusion it is observed that the mechanical design of the robot meets the requirements that are set before desing process. Chapter 5 is the conclusion part which evaluates all the software infstracture used in order to build a modular service robot. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{secretion}} {{systems are}} machineries that allow one cell to take direct control of molecular processes in another one {{so that they}} are ubiquitously involved in the host interaction of mutualistic, commensal, and pathogenic bacteria. However, the evolutionary origin of these systems lies in genuine bacterial machineries. One of the most well-studied host-interacting secretion systems is the type IV secretion system (T 4 SS) that originally evolved to mediate bacterial conjugation, i. e., the interbacterial transfer of DNA. During conjugation, the DNA is transferred covalently linked to a protein called relaxase that is the actual substrate of the type IV secretion machinery. It is the common focus of most studies that come together in this thesis to unravel the adaptive path by which the host-interacting VirB/D 4 T 4 SS of Bartonella and its secreted effectors evolved from conjugative ancestors. In short, these studies allowed to propose a two-step model in which an ancestral conjugation machinery first acquired an interbacterial effector protein and was later exapted for host interaction which resulted {{in the evolution of the}} VirB/D 4 T 4 SS. In Review article I we comprehensively reviewed available literature regarding the molecular pathogenesis of the α-proteobacterial pathogen Bartonella and concluded that different phylogenetic lineages of this genus use partially divergent sets of virulence factors for essentially the same stealth infection strategy. Though the overall course of infection in their respective mammal reservoir hosts is similar, the bartonellae showed major differences in their host adaptability that correlated with the presence of the VirB/D 4 T 4 SS in the promiscuous lineages. This machinery contributes to Bartonella virulence by secreting a cocktail of effector proteins (Beps) into mammalian host cells where they manipulate cellular signaling processes in favor of the pathogen. Previous studies had shown that all effectors of the VirB/D 4 T 4 SS evolved from a single common ancestor that consisted of a FIC protein domain fused to a conserved type IV secretion signal which is also the most prevalent domain architecture among extant Beps. FIC domains are enzymatic domains that typically mediate adenylylation, the transfer of an adenosine 5 ’-monophosphate onto target proteins, suggesting that a prototypic effector of the VirB/D 4 T 4 SS may have targeted host proteins by post-translational modification. Interestingly, a bacterial conjugation system called Vbh T 4 SS had been discovered in Bartonella and is encoded on a plasmid together with a Bep-like protein consisting of FIC domain and type IV secretion signal that had been named VbhT. In Research article I we investigated the phylogeny and regulation of Fic proteins (i. e., proteins containing FIC domains) and found that their adenylylation activity is controlled by a conserved mechanism of active site obstruction via an inhibitory α-helix (αinh). Depending on the positioning of αinh either in a separate polypeptide or N- or C-terminally of the FIC domain in the same protein we classified FIC domain proteins as class I, class II, and class III, respectively. Fic proteins have repeatedly evolved into bacterial virulence factors, but the far majority of them are genuine bacterial proteins of unknown function. We showed that the mutational activation of bacterial Fic proteins of all three classes by abrogation of active site obstruction results in bacterial growth inhibition, suggesting that most Fic proteins may be some kind of toxins. Interestingly, the elusive Bep-like VbhT protein of the Vbh T 4 SS was found to inhibit bacterial growth via target adenylylation unless it is inhibited by a small protein VbhA that contains the αinh. as a hallmark of class I Fic proteins. This arrangement is reminiscent of toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules that are genetic elements consisting of a toxin that inhibits bacterial growth and an antitoxin that suppresses the toxin’s activity but can unleash it in order to induce a phenotypic switch to the dormant persister state. In Review article II we firmly established that class I Fic proteins form a new toxin-antitoxin (TA) module FicTA with FicT toxins being homologous to the VbhT FIC domain and FicA antitoxins being homologous to VbhA. A follow-up study described in Research article III characterized the FicTA toxin-antitoxin module and discovered that FicT toxins inhibit bacterial growth via the adenylylation and concomitant inactivation of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV (topo IV), the two bacterial type IIA topoisomerases. The resulting disruption of cellular DNA topology induced a phenotypic switch to the persister state. Although an important role of TA modules in persister formation is well established, previously known TA systems invariably induced dormancy by inhibiting translation or <b>unsetting</b> the proton-motive force. Our results therefore uncovered a new physiological path to the persister state that is likely involved in the inherent physiological heterogeneity of persisters as a main obstacle to their eradication. Furthermore, we found that the Vbh T 4 SS in Bartonella is sometimes associated to a functional FicTA module that is encoded at the locus where VbhTA would be expected but shows no trace of a type IV secretion signal. The concluding Perspective section of this work combines the results of the aforementioned articles with a considerable amount of unpublished data and proposes a model that can explain the evolution of the VirB/D 4 T 4 SS and its effectors in Bartonella from conjugative ancestors. In short, it is evident that an ancestral conjugative T 4 SS as well as a FicTA module (supplying the FIC domain for effector evolution) entered the genus Bartonella via horizontal gene transfer, though likely not together. After sequence reshuffling events had resulted in a ficAT locus encoded next to a conjugative Vbh-like machinery (like in some extant bartonellae), one of the two type IV secretion signals of the relaxase was transferred onto the FicT toxin via terminal reassortment and created a situation identical to the Vbh T 4 SS with VbhT. Based on additional evidence, we propose that extant Vbh T 4 SS and VbhT represent such an ancestral evolutionary state as a “living fossil”. Furthermore, we suggest that VbhT is an interbacterial effector that is secreted via the Vbh T 4 SS during bacterial conjugation in order to promote complementary strand synthesis in the recipient. Like this, the Vbh T 4 SS with VbhT constitutes a “missing link” in the evolution of the host-interacting, effector secreting VirB/D 4 T 4 SS from purely conjugative ancestors. The remarkable sequence similarity between Vbh T 4 SS and VbhT on one side and the VirB/D 4 T 4 SS and Beps on the other side suggests that such a conjugative machinery with interbacterial effector may have been exapted for host interaction in a second step. During that process, a primordial vbhT like effector gene served as the template for a series of gene duplication and diversification events that created the extant effector repertoires by gradual evolution. The different paralogous effectors created by this process were generally suspected to have different roles in host interaction. Among other evidence, I could show earlier that one effector (Bep 1) targets the host protein Rac 1 by adenylylation. In Research article II we followed up on these results and identified the adenylylated target of another effector, called Bep 2, as vimentin. For this purpose we had developed a new technique that identifies adenylylated target proteins by mass spectrometry using a characteristic pattern of peaks upon adenylylation with a mixture of heavy-isotope labeled ATP. Together with additional data of others and myself, these results suggest that the diversified effector repertoires of the VirB/D 4 T 4 SS evolved to promote the stealth infection strategy of Bartonella by fine-tuned manipulations of host cell signaling. In particular, the modular architecture of both the type IV machinery and its effectors conferred an inherent evolvability that is likely involved in the remarkable host adaptability of those bartonellae that encode VirB/D 4 T 4 SS and effectors. The most important open point in this model is the biological function of VbhT as the first bona fide interbacterial type IV secretion effector. Future studies should address a possible role of VbhT in bacterial conjugation in order to strengthen the claim of a “missing link”. In Research article IV we expanded the understanding of FIC domain proteins without obvious connection to Bartonella. This study was focused on NmFicT of Neisseria meningitidis as a model for class III Fic proteins that encode the αinh at their C-terminus, but contain no additional domains or modules for their regulation. We reported strong evidence for a model in which NmFicT is controlled by a double-lock mechanism where the first level of control is tetramerization that generates an inactive storage form of the protein. Upon an unknown trigger, NmFicT monomers would be freed from oligomerization and then remove the second lock via intermolecular auto-adenylylation which abolishes αinh –mediated active site obstruction and unleashes the full catalytic activity of NmFicT. Furthermore, we showed that activated NmFicT adenylylates DNA gyrase at the same residue as FicT toxins, though these also adenylylate topo IV and primarily inhibit the latter target in vivo. The biological function of NmFicT is unclear, but may be related to DNA repair and protection as described for other proteic gyrase inhibitors. ...|$|E
