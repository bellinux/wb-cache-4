5|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Leader of a Machine-gun Section of Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Third Marines, Fourth Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces during the assault on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Assailed by a tremendous volume of small-arms, mortar and artillery fire as he advanced with one squad of his section in the initial assault wave, Sergeant Cole boldly led his men up the sloping beach toward Airfield Number One despite the blanketing curtain of flying shrapnel and, personally destroying with hand grenades two hostile emplacements which menaced the progress of his unit, continued to move forward until a merciless barrage of fire emanating from three Japanese pillboxes halted the advance. Instantly placing his one remaining machine gun in action, he delivered a shattering fusillade and succeeded in silencing the nearest and most threatening emplacement before his weapon jammed and the enemy, reopening fire with knee mortars and grenades, pinned down his unit for the second time. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation and evolving a daring plan of counterattack, Sergeant Cole, armed solely with a pistol and one grenade, coolly advanced alone to the hostile pillboxes. Hurling his one grenade at the enemy in sudden, swift attack, he quickly withdrew, returned to his own lines for additional grenades and again advanced, attacked, and withdrew. With enemy guns still active, he ran the gauntlet of slashing fire a third time to complete the total destruction of the Japanese strong point and the annihilation of the defending garrison in this final assault. Although instantly killed by an enemy grenade as he returned to his squad, Sergeant Cole had eliminated a formidable Japanese position, thereby enabling his company to storm the remaining fortifications, continue the advance and seize the objective. By his dauntless initiative, <b>unfaltering</b> courage and indomitable determination during a critical period of action, Sergeant Cole served as an inspiration to his comrades, and his stouthearted leadership in the face of almost certain death sustained and enhanced the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E

Yet the government seems <b>unfaltering</b> and states that flexibility is needed to address the lack of industrial development in the country despite accusations from the opposition.|$|E
25|$|In {{fact the}} essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a {{performer}} whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, <b>unfaltering</b> truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas {{was not one of}} them. She found all she needed in the notes.|$|E
25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Executive Officer of the Third Battalion, First Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea on November 29, 1950. Assuming command of a composite unit of Army and Marine service and headquarters elements totalling approximately 250 men, during a critical stage in the vital defense of the strategically important military base at Hagaru-ri, Major Myers immediately initiated a determined and aggressive counterattack against a well-entrenched and clearly concealed enemy force numbering an estimated 4,000. Severely handicapped by a lack of trained personnel and experienced leaders in his valiant efforts to regain maximum ground prior to daylight, he persisted in constantly exposing himself to intense, accurate and sustained hostile fire in order to direct and supervise the employment of his men and to encourage and spur them on in pressing the attack. Inexorably moving forward up the steep, snow-covered slope with his depleted group in the face of apparently insurmountable odds, he concurrently directed artillery and mortar fire with superb skill and, although losing 170 of his men during fourteen hours of raging combat in sub-zero temperatures, continued to reorganize his unit and spearhead the attack which resulted in 600 enemy killed and 500 wounded. By his exceptional and valorous leadership throughout, Major Myers contributed directly to the success of his unit in restoring the perimeter. His resolute spirit of self sacrifice and <b>unfaltering</b> devotion to duty enhance and sustain the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.|$|E

[...] Roque Strew, of Pitchfork Media, struggles in the same vein: [...] "pin a single label, style, adjective on Isis and it slips right off." ...|$|E

[...] As a U.S. Senator, [...] "he excused himself from no duties; acted as chairman and member of several committees; was never absent from his seat, and was ready for debate at all times." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{screenplay}} for Prometheus, David is noted as being unusually {{fond of the}} 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, with the character viewing parallels to himself, as they both have <b>unfaltering</b> pursuits of the objectives. As such, Fassbender elected to model much of his performance and appearance around the Peter O'Toole depiction of T. E. Lawrence. Fassbender would continue to have his role make references to Lawrence of Arabia in [...] by having David play samplings of the soundtrack on his flute. For his first appearance in Prometheus, Fassbender, a natural brunette, dyed his hair blonde and fashioned it into a style influenced by Lawrence. Scott requested that Fassbender dye his hair for the role, {{in order to provide}} the character with an otherworldly and unsettling appearance.|$|E

[...] With {{the war in}} Europe almost over, the disposition of the various units was being decided by higher command. Some would remain as occupation forces in Europe, some {{would return to the}} United States, and some would be sent to the Pacific theater to fight against the Japanese. The Germans formally surrendered in the American sector on 7 May 1945, and two days later Patton issued his General Order Number98 thanking the soldiers of the Third Army, past and present, for their accomplishments. [...] On 13 May, Middleton wrote a letter to Bradley requesting to be released from active duty, once his combat services were no longer needed. He asked to return to LSU by 1 August 1945, but also paid compliments to Bradley and others by writing, [...] "That men such as you, Ike, Joe Collins, Courtney Hodges and others have accomplished so much in this war, are available to guide the future of our Army, we cannot but feel the future is in safe hands." ...|$|E

Chris was also repeatedly compared with Leon by IGN, both of them being regarded as the series' leading heroes. In 2010, GamesRadar website featured his team-up with Sheva in an article about gaming's [...] "most violent double acts" [...] for their actions in Resident Evil 5. That same year, Joystick Division's James Hawkins ranked Chris as the seventh sexiest video game character, commenting: [...] "Though Chris gets matched up with some of the finest damsels in all of video gaming, he never comes across as sleazy.

2500|$|Rosewater {{served on}} the Republican National Committee during the late 19th century. During 1888 he built the Bee Building, a {{downtown}} landmark which was demolished during 1966. During 1897, {{at the behest of}} President McKinley, Rosewater came to Washington D. C. to direct the U. S. delegation at the Congress of the Universal Postal Union (the international body responsible for promoting efficiency in the flow of mail from country to country, tasked that year with securing cheaper international postage). [...] This experience influenced his work as an organizer for the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition, for he prevailed on the Post Office to produce a special Trans-Mississippi Issue of nine stamps commemorating the Exposition, and was credited with much of the success of that event. The most profitable event of the exposition, an Indian Congress that convened representatives of some 35 tribes was [...] "the child of [...] brain," [...] according to the Congress's chief ethnological consultant James Mooney, and its [...] "successful outcome was due chiefly to his tireless activity and <b>unfaltering</b> courage."

2500|$|Amongst {{the papers}} {{captured}} on the Abbas was the cipher key Gordon used to code his messages {{in and out}} of Khartoum, which meant he could no longer read the messages he received, leading him to write in his diary: [...] "I think cipher-messages are in some countries, like this, a mistake". During this period, Gordon was lionized by the British press, which portrayed him as a latter-day Christian [...] "knight", a [...] "crusader" [...] and a [...] "saint", a man of pure good, heroically battling the Mahdi, who was depicted as a man of pure evil. The Pall Mall Gazette in a front page leader wrote that Gordon stood [...] "out in clear relief against the Eastern sky. Alone in a black continent, dauntless and <b>unfaltering,</b> he discharges his great trust, holding the capital of the Sudan against the beleaguering hordes". The defenses Gordon had built with lines of earthwork, mines, and barbed wire presented the Ansar with much difficulty and their attempts to storm Khartoum failed, but the Ansar made good use of their Krupp artillery to gradually batter down the defenses. To counter Gordon's armored streamers, the Mahdi built a series of forts along the Nile equipped with Krupp guns that over time proceeded to make it almost impossible for Gordon's navy to operate.|$|E
2500|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as a member of a Machine-gun Crew, serving with the First Battalion, Twenty-Sixth Marines, Fifth Marine Division, in action enemy Japanese forces during the seizure of Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, on 3 March 1945. Stationed in the front lines, Corporal Berry manned his weapon with alert readiness as he maintained a constant vigil with other members of his gun crew during the hazardous night hours. When infiltrating Japanese soldiers launched a surprise attack shortly after midnight in an attempt to overrun his position, he engaged in a pitched hand grenade duel, returning the dangerous weapons with prompt and deadly accuracy until an enemy grenade landed in the foxhole. Determined to save his comrades, he unhesitatingly chose to sacrifice himself and immediately dived on the deadly missile, absorbing the shattering violence of the exploding charge in his own body and protecting the others from serious injury. Stouthhearted [...] and indomitable, Corporal Berry fearlessly yielded his own life that his fellow Marines might carry on the relentless battle against a ruthless enemy and his superb valor and <b>unfaltering</b> devotion to duty in the face of certain death reflect the highest credit upon himself and upon the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.|$|E
2500|$|After {{referring}} to the bequest of the Outhwaite family and making placatory remarks about the Marist Brothers, Liston welcomed the Christian Brothers.

They have their own traditions to give us, formed in the society's work of teaching since 1802, and the fruit of the experience gathered, to speak only of Australia and New Zealand, of over 500 Brothers teaching more than 20,000 boys". Liston added, [...] " ... if I know the Brothers at all, the boys under their care will be put to hard work - an excellent thing - and teachers will not do for them what they should do for themselves. The thought of the years ahead and of the eternal life will be regarded as of first importance. Teachers will feel it their daily duty to fit the boys to bear life's burdens with a spirit of nobility and to meet life's problems with <b>unfaltering</b> courage". At the conclusion of his speech, Bishop Liston said, [...] "This is a very happy day for me indeed for I owe much more than I can say to the training I received {{at the hands of the}} Christian Brothers in Dunedin long years ago".|$|E

[...] Vastly outnumbered by a well-entrenched and cleverly concealed enemy force wearing the uniforms of friendly troops and attacking his platoon's open and unconcealed positions, Sergeant Johnson unhesitatingly took charge of his platoon in the absence of the leader and exhibiting great personal valor in the face of a heavy barrage of hostile fire, coolly proceeded to move about among his men, shouting words of encouragement and inspiration and skillfully [...] directing their fire. [...] Ordered to displace his platoon during the fire fight, he immediately placed himself in an extremely hazardous position from which he could provide covering fire for his men. [...] Fully aware that his voluntary action meant either certain death or capture to himself, he courageously continued to provide effective cover for his men and was last observed in a wounded condition single-handedly engaging enemy troops in close hand grenade and hand-to-hand fighting. [...] By his valiant and inspiring leadership, Sergeant Johnson was directly responsible for the successful completion of the platoon's displacement and the saving of many lives. [...] His dauntless fighting spirit and <b>unfaltering</b> devotion to duty in the face of terrific odds reflect the highest credit upon himself and the United States Naval Service.|$|E
