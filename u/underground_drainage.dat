40|$|This paper {{presents}} a field trial {{for developing a}} gas mixture enhanced coalbed methane (GECBM) technology that can be integrated with underground coal mine methane (CMM) drainage systems. The field trial {{was carried out in}} a deep underground coalmine roadway in two stages, initially degassing using a conventional method for 30 days in three boreholes installed in the underground coal seam and then injecting the gas mixture from one of the boreholes for about 2 months. The field trial focuses on the investigation of the technical and economic feasibilities of G-ECBM technology applied to <b>underground</b> CMM <b>drainage</b> systems. The results revealed that the G-ECBM technology integrated with <b>underground</b> methane <b>drainage</b> systems can provide an effective method to enhance the coalbed methane (CBM) recovery from coal mines and the efficiency of <b>underground</b> gas <b>drainage</b> systems, and hence improve the mining safety. The field measurements showed that the single-borehole flow rate and concentration of CH for the production boreholes with G-ECBM have increased by a factor of 4. 73 and 1. 68 on average, respectively, compared with the conventional production boreholes without G-ECBM. The results also showed the economic prospect of applying G-ECBM technology to <b>underground</b> CMM <b>drainage</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|Karst {{refers to}} the {{processes}} of chemical dissolution and mechanical erosion acting on soluble rocks (mainly carbonates and evaporites), and {{to the surface and}} subsurface landforms thus produced. In their book Karst Hydrogeology and Geomorphology, Derek Ford and Paul Williams state that about 20 percent of the emerged Earth’s surface is karst, with caves representing a typical and well-known expression (see Ford and Williams 2007, cited under Karst Hydrogeology: The Importance of Karst Aquifers). Together with caves, karst lands are characterized by <b>underground</b> <b>drainages</b> and by scarce presence of water running at the surface. Water, rather than flowing on the ground as watercourses and rivers, rapidly infiltrates underground through networks of fissures and conduits, which combine to the diffuse flow in recent carbonates, giving origin to the complex systems of karst caves. Karst environments and caves have been of interest to humans since the earliest civilizations—for water supply, as settlements or areas of protection, or to bury the dead...|$|R

5|$|A {{special feature}} of the limestone, {{resulting}} from its weathering by water, is its karstic nature. During the large Middle Pleistocene glaciations, surface runoff from glacial meltwaters would have fed directly into the river channel network {{because much of the}} upland limestone terrain was covered by ice, and many conduits in the karst would have been choked with sediment or permanently frozen. As a result, the glacier snouts came close to the modern valley bottoms. In contrast, during interglacial and interstadial periods, more effective coupling occurred between the surface drainage network and the internal karst drainage system. Since limestone dissolves as the water percolates through its pores, an extended <b>underground</b> <b>drainage</b> system has developed, with caves and channels that enlarge with time when their roofs collapse, producing rocky exposures and perpendicular slopes, which is also the reason why the water is scarce. Only when an impenetrable stratum is met, does water appear on the surface.|$|E
5|$|The first {{studies and}} propositions {{to clean up}} the river date back to 1859, and during the {{following}} years, many different commissions of engineers were assigned to examine possible solutions. Dozens of different ideas were submitted, many of which were completely unfeasible. Several of them proposed diverting large amounts of cleaner water from other rivers upstream to dilute the Senne, while greatly improving the drainage system in the city. Other proposals involved diverting the main course of the Senne completely to the Lesser Senne, which would then be enlarged and thus more useful for boat traffic and mills. Others considered any sort of sanitization impossible, and proposed covering the Senne without greatly changing its course. Among these was a proposal to double the size of the <b>underground</b> <b>drainage</b> tunnels, creating space for a subterranean railroad tunnel. The idea was ahead of its time, but would be implemented a century later with the North–South connection.|$|E

It is known however, that land in the Central region's Sébaco Valley has been recovered using surface drains and ongoing cleaning of natural drains. The Atlantic region is prone to flooding, therefore, both adequate surface and <b>underground</b> <b>drainage</b> is required.

As of 1985, the responsibilities and authority of the District were transferred to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. The Flood Control District encompasses more than 3,000 square miles and 85 cities in Southern California.

25|$|The Yucatan is an extensive, {{limestone}} rich plains {{region that}} {{is dominated by}} karst topography and geology. Being karst landscape is significant, as no surface water is present.

Any surface water that is retained is unsuitable for consumption and occurs in very small amounts. The <b>underground</b> <b>drainage</b> results in the northern Yucatan being covered in caves and sinkholes called Cenotes, which are subsequently used by the inhabitants to access drinkable ground water. Any relief in the Puuc region is due to unequal dissolution rates within the limestone bedrock, and never reaches 400 meters above sea level.|$|E

25|$|During {{this period}} of expansion, farmers {{introduced}} modern production practices. The widespread use of modern inputs—chemical fertilisers and insecticides, agricultural machinery, and improved seed varieties—sharply improved crop yields. Yet the modernisation process again made farm production dependent on supplies from abroad, this time on imports of petroleum and fertilisers. By 1984 domestic sources of energy covered only about 20 percent of farm needs, while in 1950 domestic sources had supplied 70 percent of them. In {{the aftermath of the}} oil price increases of the early 1970s, farmers began to return to local energy sources such as firewood. The existence of many farms that were too small to allow efficient use of tractors also limited mechanisation. Another weak point was the existence of many fields with open drainage ditches needing regular maintenance; in the mid-1980s, experts estimated that half of the cropland needed improved drainage works. At that time, about 1 million hectares had <b>underground</b> <b>drainage,</b> and agricultural authorities planned to help install such works on another million hectares. Despite these shortcomings, Finland's agriculture was efficient and productive—at least when compared with farming in other European countries.|$|E
50|$|Salty {{soils are}} a common feature and an {{environmental}} problem in irrigated lands in arid and semi-arid regions, resulting in poor or little crop production.
