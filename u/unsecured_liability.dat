40|$|In this enquiry {{the effect}} of gender on loan sums and {{conditions}} in dutch SME finance has been researched. Detailled information from a local Rabobank was retrieved out of 3, 502 loan applications which were processed during the financial crisis (2009 - 2015). With reference to existing literature not only the level of detail of research data was distinctive, the simultaneous involvement of gender effects among applicants, loan officers and their interrelation (pairs applicant - banker) was as well. In Behavorial Finance theory information asymmetry and psychology play {{an important part in}} limited rational decision making having characteristic differences between male and female. Risk aversion, motivation and intuition could lead to limitation of gender neutrality. There is an important difference between discrimination and permitted differentiation between heterogeneous groups. A sixfold hypothesis test was performed based on OLS-regression of applicants’, bankers’ and pairs’ gender on loan sums, approved part, processing time, interest, commission and fees. For financial and non-financial covenants a Negative Binomial regression analysis was applied for the determination of gender effects in that type of loan conditions. Gender effects were controlled for various loan characteristics and distinguishing marks (identified as the 5 Cs) of financed companies. Results indicated that there were gender differences among applicants, bankers and pairs both with respect to loan and loan conditions. Female applicants obtained lower loan sums and were charged higher commission but on the contrary they were constrained less covenants than their male counterparts. Female loan officers processed their applications quicker, approved higher average loan sums, discounted more interest, but they constrained more covenants per application. Mixed gender pairs differed from pairs consisting of only males by means of less financial covenants and a lower processing time. Negatively significant moderation effects on loan sums and conditions existed caused by poorer reimbursement perspectives, smaller sized companies and applications for working capital and real estate. In many regression models activities in agriculture, horticulture and fishery affected loan conditions in a positive way. Besides the appearance of some singular effects it was argued that results were in accordance with existing literature. Female applicants were expected to apply for lower loan sums because of their motivation to keep their enterprises small and because of their cognitive dissonance when making contracts with uncertain outcome. It was not expected that controlled for company characteristics they would pay higher commissions. Female applicants were favored with respect to processing time and amount of covenants constrained, so {{there was no evidence of}} discrimination. Based on literature about gender differences in risk aversion it was forseen that female loan officers would constrain more covenants in order to monitor better the perceived higher risks. Higher loan sums, interest discounts and lower processing times could therefore only be explained as i) a result from obliqueness in the allocation of applications by sectors applying for higher loan sums, ii) bankers’ freedom in defining loan conditions caused by a lack of decision-making procedures for loan conditions and iii) an intuitively perceived lower risk than calculated by the rating model. Further it was argued that working capital can be recited on a daily basis and real estate finance is often secured by a mortgage which explains the lower numbers of covenants constrained by bankers. The research showed some forms of ceilings in dutch SME finance. There appeared some gender differences, probably caused by behavorial aspects. However, there was no proof of ‘glass’ ceilings (detrimental to females). A remark has to be made that some of the regression models used had little explanatory value and the amount of female cases was relatively small. Nevertheless a recommendation was made in order to limit differentiation. Standardising decision-making rules, linking covenant constraints and <b>unsecured</b> <b>liability</b> to tarification and reviewing the ratingsystem used for start-ups can contribute to more transparancy in dutch SME financial decision making. Additional qualitative research on these topics is recommended...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{dynamics}} of Chapter 11 turn dramatically {{on the size of}} the business. The vast majority of the assets administered in Chapter 11 are concentrated in a handful of large cases, but most of the businesses in Chapter 11 are small, and the smaller the business, the smaller the distribution to general unsecured creditors. For businesses with assets above $ 5 million, unsecured creditors typically collect half of what they are owed. Where the business’s assets are worth less than $ 200, 000, ordinary general creditors usually recover nothing. In the typical small Chapter 11 case, the tax collector is the central figure. In small business bankruptcies, priority tax liabilities are the largest <b>unsecured</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the business. Tax obligations are entitled to priority and are obligations of both the corporation and those who run it. Given the large shadow tax claims cast over small Chapter 11 reorganizations, accounts of small Chapter 11 must focus squarely on them.

40|$|Vertrauen ist der Anfang von allem” (“trust is the {{beginning}} of everything”) - A large bank seemed {{to be aware of the}} importance of trust within financial markets when it started the marketing campaign in 1995. Almost fifteen years later banks all over the world trust nearly nobody and were not trusted by anybody. In this paper the origins, functions and aftermath of trust/distrust in financial economics are investigated by firstly analyzing trust in economic relationships in a general theoretical matter. Secondly, we provide some indicators for measuring institutional and interbank specific trust. Thirdly, we evaluate policy measures conducted by central banks due to recover the trust relationships at European interbank market. The paper is separated into two parts and seven chapters including introduction and conclusion. The first part explains a more generic approach to introduce trust and distrust into economic decisions. Thus, chapter 2 begins with some definitions about trust and an explanation about its relevance and functions in contract theory. Chapter 3 analyzes the formation of trust and distrust in the microeconomic environment based upon principal-agent theory. While trust and distrust vary in the date of origin they are both rational decision based and thus influenced by expectations, information and experience. Furthermore, the concept of social capital is introduced as a theory to explain trust and distrust in a macroeconomic framework which is more relevant to explain trust crises. The theoretical aspects are empirically applied by analyzing the net trust in macroeconomic institutions as government, central bank and money. A trust crisis - defined as sudden shift from positive to negative net trust - between EU citizen and national/transnational institutions in 2008 / 2009 can only be verified in case of the European Central Bank. But in contrast to theoretical requirements the net distrust occurs only for a short period. The next chapter (4) applies the economic theory of trust to the specific situation on interbank market transactions. Therefore, it investigates the role of trust in interbank relationships and the problem that occurs if this relationship is damaged. Finally, four indicators were derived to identify the want on confidence in bank-to-bank transactions: (a) the difference between EURIBOR and EUREPO rates (b) the credit volume of <b>unsecured</b> <b>liabilities</b> (c) the level of capacity for permanent facilities (d) vertical equalization of liquidity between central and commercial banks. The results of chapters 2 - 4 provide the theoretical framework for analyzing the specific situation at the European interbank market crisis in the second part of the paper. Chapter 5 starts with a general survey about the chronology and causes of the financial crises 2007 - 2009. The next chapter (6) reappraises the previously derived indicators of interbank confidence in pre-, within-, and after-crisis periods. It can be shown that the distrust situation between banks slew down since 2009, similarly to the results of institutional trust for the whole economy. The chapter closes with an interpretation of the results and some theoretical explanations. Within the last chapter (7) the reaction (interest rate reduction, restructuring of the tender system) of monetary authority to the financial distress is explained and evaluated in terms of restoring the interbank market. ...|$|R
40|$|Exchange traded {{products}} (“ETPs”) {{have been}} experiencing tremendous growth {{as a class}} of financial products for the past twenty years. One of the more recent innovations in the ETP market is the exchange traded note (“ETN”), which first came into existence in 2006. An ETN is an <b>unsecured</b> debt <b>liability</b> of the issuing financial institution that provides an investor economic exposure {{to a variety of}} asset classes, trading strategies, and markets with the convenience that comes with trading on an exchange. As the ETN market has grown, a number of phenomena have developed that pose interesting asset pricing questions. The chapters in this dissertation will describe ETNs and the ETN market, highlight a variety of stylized facts about ETNs, and provide an explanation {{for one of the most}} prominent ETN puzzles. The first chapter provides a detailed description of ETNs as a financial product, including an outline of their defining institutional features. The growth of the ETN market from the inception of the first product in June 2006 to a $ 23 billion market by the end of 2013 is documented throughout the chapter. Since financial industry references and discussions of ETNs often comingle ETNs with exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), the chapter offers a comparison of ETNs and ETFs, highlighting key similarities between the two classes of ETP and, more importantly, the key differences. A main contribution of this chapter is a documentation of the “ETN premium puzzle. ” As derivatively-priced products, the market price of an ETN should align with its fundamental value. This chapter shows that on average the market prices of ETNs exceed their fundamental values by 31 basis points with certain individual ETNs trading at premiums well above 100 basis points. ETNs trading at a discount are far less likely and the absolute magnitude of discounts are far lower than those of premiums. Collectively, these stylized facts constitute the “ETN premium puzzle. ”The second chapter presents a number of selected ETN case studies that motivate a preliminary explanation for the ETN premium puzzle. The first case study focuses on the ETNs that were issued by Lehman Brothers. As unsecured debt obligations of Lehman Brothers, those ETNs suffered substantial losses as a result of Lehman’s failure. The case study highlights that two of the three Lehman ETNs continued to trade at premiums up until the day of bankruptcy despite the generally increasing market concern about Lehman’s solvency. The chapter also uses the Lehman failure to study the ETN market’s general consideration of counterparty credit risk in ETN pricing, finding that the market became more attentive to the credit risk of ETNs after the failure, but that such attention did not last beyond a couple months. The chapter also uses case studies to demonstrate the effects of the two most significant factors that explain the ETN premium puzzle: (i) the suspension of new share creation by the issuer and (ii) the degree of competition that an ETN faces in providing exposure to its targeted asset class or market. The first factor serves as a limit to arbitrage, while the second factor contributes to the overall demand for the ETN. The third chapter presents a full explanation of the ETN premium puzzle. The chapter motivates the story of the explanation through the noise trader / arbitrager framework of De Long, et al. (1990) and Shleifer and Summers (1990). As applied to the ETN market, it is more appropriate to label noise traders as demand traders, since the noise trader definition presumes irrationality, while in the ETN context, there are rational non-arbitrageur market participants. The results of this chapter show that many of the institutional features of ETNs lead to substantial limits to arbitrage, which alone explain much of the ETN premium puzzle. The chapter conducts a cross sectional regression of ETN arbitrage speeds (i. e. the daily error correction rate for ETNs with stationary premiums) on various factors that limit arbitrage, showing which factors weaken the arbitrage mechanisms the most. The chapter then adds a number of factors that account for the demand of ETNs. In a panel regression that combines the limits to arbitrage with the demand factors, the chapter provides a fuller explanation of the ETN premium puzzle...|$|R
