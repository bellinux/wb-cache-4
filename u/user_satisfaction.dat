25|$|The {{increasing}} number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It {{is caused by the}} extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.|$|E

Service quality and <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> have improved after the private operators {{took over the}} systems. But according to the Association of Private Water Operators, the contracts are too short to compensate the small, local private operators for their initial efforts in setting up their operations. Due to low tariffs and lack of funding for investments the private operators largely failed to expand the water system to connect the poor. Therefore, in 2005 the International Finance Corporation and the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) designed a pilot project to provide performance-based subsidies to private operators to expand access to the poor.|$|E
40|$|International audienceNowadays, Network Operators (NOs) and Service Providers (SPs) {{are more}} {{interested}} by the <b>user's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> measurement because their businesses are highly dependent on the <b>user's</b> <b>satisfaction.</b> Generally, the traditional strategies to measure the user's perception are based on Quality of Service (QoS), which {{is not sufficient to}} reflect the real user's perceived quality. Therefore, NOs and SPs start to develop new strategies based on the Quality of Experience (QoE) metric to analyze the relationship between the <b>user's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and influence factors (QoE IFs). In this paper, we propose a new method to build a predictive model to estimate <b>user's</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in term of Mean Opinion Score (MOS).

40|$|ABSTRACT: “User {{involvement}} ” {{in information}} system development {{is generally considered}} an important mechanism for improving system quality and ensuring successful system implementation. The common assumption that user involvement leads to s:ystem usage and/or information satisfaction is examined {{in a survey of}} 200 production managers. Alternative models exploring the causal ordering of the three variables are developed and tested via path analysis. The results demonstrate that user involvement in the development of information systems will enhance both system usage and the <b>user‘s</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with the system. Further, the study provides evidence that the <b>user‘s</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with the system will lead to greater system usage. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Computer <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> (and {{closely related}} {{concepts}} such as System Satisfaction, <b>User</b> <b>Satisfaction,</b> Computer System Satisfaction, End User Computing Satisfaction) is the attitude of a user to the computer system (s)he employs {{in the context of}} his/her work environments. Doll and Torkzadeh's (1988) definition of <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> is, the opinion of the user about a specific computer application, which they use. In a broader sense, the definition of <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> can be extended to <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> with any computer-based electronic appliance. However, scholars distinguish between <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> and usability as part of Human-Computer Interaction. Successful organisations have systems in place which they believe help maximise profits and minimise overheads. It is therefore desirable that all their systems succeed and remain successful; and this includes their computer-based systems. According to key scholars such as DeLone and McLean (2002), <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> is a key measure of computer system success, if not synonymous with it. However, the development of techniques for defining and measuring <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> have been ad hoc and open to question. The term Computer <b>User</b> <b>Satisfaction</b> is abbreviated to <b>user</b> <b>satisfaction</b> in this article.|$|E
