40|$|Several {{sensor network}} {{applications}} {{based on data}} diffusion and data management call determine the communication transfer rate between two sensors beforehand. In this framework, we consider the problem of energy efficient Communication among nodes of a wireless sensor network and propose an application-driven approach that minimizes <b>radio</b> <b>activity</b> intervals and prolongs network lifetime. On the basis of possible Communication delays we estimate packet arrival intervals at any intermediate hop of a fixed-rate data path. We study a generic strategy of <b>radio</b> <b>activity</b> minimization wherein each mode maintains the radio switched on just in the expected packet arrival intervals and guarantees low Communication latency. We define a probabilistic Model that allows {{the evaluation of the}} packet loss probability that results front the reduced <b>radio</b> <b>activity.</b> The Model Call be used to optimally choose the <b>radio</b> <b>activity</b> intervals that achieve a certain probability of successful packet delivery for a specific <b>radio</b> <b>activity</b> strategy,v. Relying oil the probabilistic model we also define I cost model that estimates the energy consumption of the proposed strategies, under specific settings. We propose three specific strategies and numerically evaluate the associated Costs. We finally Validate our work with a simulation made with TOSSIM the Berkeley motes' simulator).

An exception to this behaviour arises only in the very centre, where a highly dispersed component is detected. These particular H I and H 2 features suggest that a strong interplay between the radio source and the surrounding ISM is ongoing. The physical properties of the cold gas in the proximity of the radio source may regulate the accretion recently triggered in this AGN...|$|R
