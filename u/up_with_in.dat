5|$|Vilhelm Moberg, in {{his history}} of the Swedish people, {{provides}} a thoughtful discussion of the atrocities which were committed by {{both sides in the}} struggle over the border provinces, and identified them as the source of propaganda to inflame the peoples' passions to continue the struggle. These lopsided representations were incorporated into history text books on the respective sides. As an example, Moberg compares the history texts he grew <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> Sweden which represented the Swedish soldier as ever pure and honorable to a letter written by Gustavus Adolphus celebrating the 24Scanian parishes he had helped level by fire, with the troops encouraged to rape and murder the population at will, behavior that may well have been mirrored equally on the Danish side. Skåneland was a rather unpleasant place to dwell for an extended period.|$|E

25|$|Fangio {{was never}} married, but was {{involved}} in a romantic relationship with Andrea Berruet whom he broke <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> 1960. They had a son named Oscar Cacho Espinosa who was acknowledged as the unrecognised son of Fangio in 2000. In July 2015, an Argentinian court ruling ordered exhumation of Fangio's body after Espinosa's claims to be the unacknowledged son of the former race car driver. In December 2015, the Court confirmed that Espinosa was indeed Fangio's son. In February 2016, it was confirmed that Rubén Vázquez is Fangio's son.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} also the first and only in the {{original}} series under the direction of LucasArts that never actually took place on Monkey Island. However, it is revealed in the following game, The Curse of Monkey Island, that the Carnival of the Damned seen in the LeChuck's Revenges conclusion was actually part of Monkey Island. The game's creator, Ron Gilbert, departed from Lucas Arts after the second game. He stated on his blog that he had a clear vision what the ending in the second game meant, how the story will develop from here, and that the story development Lucas Arts came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> his absence was not close to his ideas.|$|E
25|$|Gough {{has gone}} further than Fuller {{with regard to}} the {{interpretation}} of events in the north, believing that {{there is no evidence of}} polyandry in that area at all. She argues that all European travelogues describing polyandry came from the region of Central Kerala. Gough notes the differing personal experiences of earlier Nair commentators and that this could go some way to explaining the varied pronouncement: Panikkar, who queries the existence of polyandry, comes from the northern Travancore region; that A. Aiyappan, who acknowledges its existence, comes from Central Kerala; and that both have based their writings on customs they grew <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> their very different environs.|$|E
25|$|Having {{spent time}} amongst the artists of Paris in the 1920s, McKay was intimately {{acquainted with the}} {{dynamics}} between painters and models {{and the manner in}} which modernist painters presented African subjects and African culture. In her article, “Caribbean Models for Modernism in the Work of Claude McKay and Jean Rhys,” Leah Rosenberg writes, “The fascination with African art and its identification with female sexuality was characteristic of modernist and avant-garde primitivism”. The inclination to stereotype and caricatures the African physical form created, however inadvertently, a form of hegemony reminiscent to McKay of the colonialism he grew <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> Jamaica. “Sexuality and black culture,” Rosenberg explains, “held a privileged place in modernist and avant-garde art from Picasso to Gertrude Stein”. In need of money, McKay posed nude for the Cubist painter Andre Lhote. Through his experience, McKay saw first-hand how the larger social hegemony between European white supremacy and people of Afro-Caribbean descent could play itself out between the artist and its subject. McKay critically recalled the experience in various ways in many of his most notable works. In doing so, he shined a critical light on a cornerstone of modernism and once again pushed back against a system in which he found himself.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the episode, Leslie had a large framed photo of Dave Sanderson, the Pawnee police officer she had {{recently}} broken <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> the episode [...] "Christmas Scandal". Sanderson was played by stand-up comedian Louis C.K. in several of Parks and Recreation episodes. When asked about her ideal man, Leslie said she wanted somebody with the brains of film star George Clooney and the body of Joe Biden, the 67-year-old Vice President of the United States. April said she was late for work because she had to finish watching the 2002 teenage horror-film Swimfan.|$|E

500|$|The Simpsons {{producers}} {{rushed out}} a chalkboard gag for [...] "Homer the Heretic", which aired {{a week after}} [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge". It read, [...] "I will not defame New Orleans." [...] The gag was their attempt to apologize for the song and hopefully bring the controversy to an end. [...] "We didn't realize people would get so mad", said Al Jean. [...] "It was the best apology we could come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> eight words or less." [...] The issue passed quickly, and {{a person in a}} Bart Simpson costume even served as Krewe of Tucks Grand Marshal at the 1993 New Orleans Mardi Gras.|$|E

In his article celebrating the 50th anniversary of Rubber Soul, Rob Sheffield identifies the album as the work on which the Beatles became true recording artists. He cites [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] {{as one of the}} tracks that, in their focus on modern, independent-thinking women, presented [...] "complex and baffling females, much like the ones the Beatles ended <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> real life".|$|E
500|$|Timberlake {{said that}} the chorus was [...] "very James Brown-ish, call out and repeat, like 'Sex Machine'." [...] He wrote the track [...] "from top to bottom.

[...] Timberlake {{said that the}} lyric, [...] "bringing sexy back", {{was one of the}} first lines he came <b>up</b> <b>with.</b> <b>In</b> addition, he admitted that the song was not going to be titled [...] "SexyBack", saying, [...] "We weren't originally going to call it 'SexyBack'. I definitely didn't think it would become the most worn-out phrase of 2006. It just sounded like a nice opening to the song." ...|$|E

500|$|The first {{official}} trailer for X-Men: Days of Future Past {{was released in}} October 2013. Jason Callina of Herald News gave the trailer a positive response, saying, [...] "it is fantastic to see characters that I grew <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> the flesh...we still {{have to wait till}} the end of May to see if Fox succeeded, but for now they have my interest". Ben Child of The Guardian criticized the trailer for the amount of characters that will appear in the film. Child wrote, [...] "overloading the movie with superheroes might please fans of the comic books, but the rest of us will be chewing on our own spleens when the umpteenth brightly coloured dude turns up to spout one line of dialogue, then drop off the map".|$|E
500|$|Playing a thinly-fictionalized {{version of}} himself named [...] "Mr. Sims", Sims made a 1990 {{appearance}} on The Cosby Show, {{then one of}} the most popular programs on television. [...] "Mr. Sims" [...] was the dance instructor the Huxtables signed their young daughter Rudy <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> order to help her prepare for a class assignment about the Harlem Renaissance. During the episode, Cliff Huxtable (Bill Cosby) challenged [...] "Mr. Sims" [...] to a dance-off, part tribute to and part parody of Sims's real-life tap challenges, which Sims won handily. Later that same year, the Apollo Theater played host to Rat-a-Tat-Tap, another tap-dance festival, and the Sandman, [...] "always a deserved audience favorite at tap festivals," [...] was a featured performer there alongside his Tap co-stars Savion Glover and Gregory Hines.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Michelle Erica Green, who watched the episode in April 2013 for TrekNation, thought that it was not a typical Deep Space Nine episode and that it {{required}} knowledge of Worf's history from The Next Generation. She said that the episode was [...] "admirable for a drama that takes place mostly walking through uninteresting cave sets". She thought that towards the end, it became a little [...] "mumbo-jumbo-mystical" [...] but that it was in [...] "perfect keeping with the Klingons". However, she felt that the episode again relied on Jadzia's past as Curzon Dax and that the ending would have been better with Toral stealing the sword at the last minute so that it could be followed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> a later episode.|$|E

500|$|The {{quality of}} the game's {{graphics}} was rated poorly by most reviewers, reviewers noted that the overall {{quality of the}} game made up for this deficiency. GameSpy's Carla Harker described the graphics as [...] "...dated by about seven years" [...] and the game as a [...] "technological pariah", despite calling it one of the best role-playing games released in the past year. Green similarly described graphics as dated and something to put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> favor of gameplay. Website Just RPG's Eric Arevalo described them as simplistic but noted the game's story and the ability to control [...] "fascinating mutant creatures" [...] made up for this. The Entertainment Depot's Nick Stewart differed, praising the graphics as [...] "Simplistic without being plain, lavish without being overdone" [...] as well as the fluidity of character animation and detail of character designs.|$|E
500|$|In February 1927, an {{agreement}} {{was signed by}} five leading Hollywood movie companies: [...] Famous Players-Lasky (soon {{to be part of}} Paramount), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Universal, First National, and Cecil B. DeMille's small but prestigious Producers Distributing Corporation (PDC). The five studios agreed to collectively select just one provider for sound conversion. The alliance then sat back and waited to see what sort of results the forerunners came <b>up</b> <b>with.</b> <b>In</b> May, Warner Bros. sold back its exclusivity rights to ERPI (along with the Fox-Case sublicense) and signed a new royalty contract similar to Fox's for use of Western Electric technology. As Fox and Warners pressed forward with sound cinema in different directions, both technologically and commercially—Fox with newsreels and then scored dramas, Warners with talking features—so did ERPI, which sought to corner the market by signing up the five allied studios.|$|E
500|$|In the band, Joseph {{covered a}} lot of the {{keyboard}} parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a [...] "full-bodied, live-effect sound". [...] He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. [...] Joseph said that [...] "Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. If you listen to the original recordings he did and what we ended <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>in</b> our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input." [...] He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.|$|E
