25|$|Under normal circumstances, a tiny {{amount of}} <b>urobilinogen,</b> if any, is {{excreted}} in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, {{some of the}} conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing {{an increase in the}} amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to <b>urobilinogen,</b> reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine <b>urobilinogen.</b> This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine <b>urobilinogen</b> helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E
25|$|Iron {{is removed}} from heme and {{salvaged}} for later use, it is stored as hemosiderin or ferritin in tissues and transported in plasma by beta globulins as transferrins. When the porphyrin ring is broken up, the fragments are normally secreted as a yellow pigment called bilirubin, which is secreted into the intestines as bile. Intestines metabolise bilirubin into <b>urobilinogen.</b> <b>Urobilinogen</b> leaves the body in faeces, in a pigment called stercobilin. Globulin is metabolised into amino acids that are then released into circulation.|$|E
25|$|Max Jaffe was a {{distinguished}} 19th-century German biochemist, pathologist, pharmacologist, and professor. He {{was born on}} July 25, 1841, in what was formerly Grünberg, Silesia and is now Zielona Góra, Poland. While attending medical school at the University of Berlin, he studied under Ludwig Traube and Wilhelm Kühne. Afterward, he worked as an assistant in a medical clinic in Königsberg. There, he co-authored a paper on putrid sputum with Ernst Viktor von Leyden {{that led to the}} discovery of certain characteristic putrid processes in the lungs. After earning his degree in internal medicine, he served in the Franco-Prussian War and was decorated with the Iron Cross Second Class. The title of Extraordinary Professor of Medicinal Chemistry was awarded to him in 1872 and the following year he became the first Ordinary Professor of Pharmacology at the University of Königsberg. He was promoted to director of the Laboratory for Medical Chemistry and Experimental Pharmacology in 1878 and {{became a member of the}} Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina in 1882. Aside from studying creatinine, he is also known for discovering urobilin and <b>urobilinogen</b> in urine and found that these compounds originated in bile. He died on October 26, 1911 in Berlin and is buried in the Weißensee Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|There, colonic {{bacteria}} deconjugate and metabolize the bilirubin into colorless <b>urobilinogen,</b> {{which can}} be oxidized to form urobilin and stercobilin. [...] Urobilin is excreted by the kidneys to give urine its yellow color and stercobilin is excreted in the faeces giving stool its characteristic brown color. A trace (~1%) of the <b>urobilinogen</b> is reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation to be re-excreted in the bile.|$|E
2500|$|This form of {{bilirubin}} is excreted {{from the}} liver in bile. Excretion of bilirubin from liver to biliary canaliculi is an active, energy dependent and rate limiting process. The intestinal bacteria deconjugate bilirubin diglucuronide and convert bilirubin to urobilinogens. Some <b>urobilinogen</b> is absorbed by intestinal cells and transported into the kidneys and excreted with urine (urobilin, {{which is the}} product of oxidation of <b>urobilinogen,</b> is responsible for the yellow colour of urine). The remainder travels down the digestive tract and is converted to stercobilinogen. This is oxidized to stercobilin, which is excreted and is responsible for the color of feces.|$|E
2500|$|Urine [...] {{bilirubin}} {{may also}} be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Testing urine for both bilirubin and <b>urobilinogen</b> can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1979, 138 {{inhabitants}} of Palm Island, Queensland, Australia, were admitted to hospital, suffering various symptoms of gastroenteritis. All {{of these were}} children; in addition, 10 adults were affected but not hospitalised. Initial symptoms, including abdominal pain and vomiting, resembled those of hepatitis; later symptoms included kidney failure and bloody diarrhoea. Urine analysis revealed high levels of proteins, ketones and sugar in many patients, along with blood and <b>urobilinogen</b> in lesser numbers. The urine analysis, along with faecal microscopy and poison screening, could not provide a statistical link to the symptoms. [...] All patients recovered within 4 to 26 days, {{and at the time}} there was no apparent cause for the outbreak. Initial thoughts on the cause included poor water quality and diet, however none were conclusive, and the illness was coined the “Palm Island Mystery Disease”.|$|E
50|$|Increased {{amounts of}} {{bilirubin}} are formed in hemolysis, which generates increased <b>urobilinogen</b> in the gut. In liver disease (such as hepatitis), the intrahepatic <b>urobilinogen</b> cycle is inhibited also increasing <b>urobilinogen</b> levels. <b>Urobilinogen</b> {{is converted to}} the yellow pigmented urobilin apparent in urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Urobilinogen</b> {{content is}} {{determined}} by a reaction with Ehrlich's reagent, which contains para-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and may be measured in Ehrlich units. Ehrlich's reagent reacts with <b>urobilinogen</b> to give a pink-red colour. One Ehrlich unit is equal to one milligram of <b>urobilinogen</b> per deciliter of sample (1 mg/dL).|$|E
5000|$|Low urine <b>urobilinogen</b> {{may result}} from {{complete}} obstructive jaundice or treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, which destroy the intestinal bacterial flora. (Obstruction of bilirubin passage into the gut or failure of <b>urobilinogen</b> production in the gut.) ...|$|E
50|$|Intestinal {{bacteria}} {{convert the}} conjugated bilirubin that is excreted by the bile duct into the intestine into <b>urobilinogen</b> and stercobilinogen. Part of the <b>urobilinogen</b> is reabsorbed in the intestine then circulated {{in the blood}} to the liver where it is excreted. A small part of this recirculated <b>urobilinogen</b> is filtered out by the kidneys and appears in urine (less than 1 mg/dl urine). The stercobilinogen can not be reabsorbed and remains in the intestine.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>urobilinogen</b> in the {{intestine}} {{is directly}} reduced to brown stercobilin, {{which gives the}} feces their characteristic color. It can also be reduced to stercobilinogen, which can then be further oxidized to stercobilin. This constitutes the normal [...] "enterohepatic <b>urobilinogen</b> cycle".|$|E
50|$|<b>Urobilinogen</b> is a {{colourless}} {{by-product of}} bilirubin reduction. It is {{formed in the}} intestines by bacterial action on bilirubin. About half of the <b>urobilinogen</b> formed is reabsorbed and taken up via the portal vein to the liver, enters circulation and is excreted by the kidney.|$|E
50|$|Ehrlich's reagent is {{also used}} as a stain in thin layer {{chromatography}} and as a reagent to detect <b>urobilinogen</b> in fresh, cool urine. If a urine sample is left to oxidize in air to form urobilin the reagent will not detect the <b>urobilinogen.</b> By adding few drops of reagent to 3 mL of urine in a test tube one can see a change of color, to dark pink or red. The degree of color change {{is proportional to the}} amount of <b>urobilinogen</b> in the urine sample.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Urobilinogen</b> ( [...] D-urobilinogen) {{is closely}} related to two other compounds: mesobilirubinogen (a.k.a. I-urobilinogen) and {{stercobilinogen}} (a.k.a. L-urobilinogen). [...] Specifically, <b>urobilinogen</b> can be reduced to form mesobilirubinogen, and mesobilirubinogen can be further reduced to form stercobilinogen. Confusingly, however, all three of these compounds are frequently collectively referred to as [...] "urobilinogens".|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Choluria. Urine {{test strip}} shows a {{high levels of}} the {{bilirubin}} and <b>urobilinogen.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{complete}} {{obstruction of}} the bile duct, no <b>urobilinogen</b> {{is found in}} the urine, since bilirubin has no access to the intestine and it is in the intestine that bilirubin gets converted to <b>urobilinogen</b> to be later released into the general circulation. In this case, presence of bilirubin (conjugated) in the urine without urine-urobilinogen suggests obstructive jaundice, either intra-hepatic or post-hepatic.|$|E
50|$|There, colonic {{bacteria}} deconjugate and metabolize the bilirubin into colorless <b>urobilinogen,</b> {{which can}} be oxidized to form urobilin and stercobilin.

50|$|In biliary obstruction, below-normal {{amounts of}} {{conjugated}} bilirubin reach the intestine for conversion to <b>urobilinogen.</b> With limited <b>urobilinogen</b> available for reabsorption and excretion, {{the amount of}} urobilin found in the urine is low. High amounts of the soluble conjugated bilirubin enter the circulation where they are excreted via the kidneys. These mechanisms {{are responsible for the}} dark urine and pale stools observed in biliary obstruction.|$|E
50|$|Any {{deterioration}} in liver function reduces {{its ability to}} process the recirculated <b>urobilinogen.</b> The excess that remains in the blood is filtered out by the kidneys and appears in urine. When hemolytic disorders occur the amount of unconjugated bilirubin that {{is present in the}} blood increases causing an increase in hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin, resulting in increased amounts of <b>urobilinogen</b> that in turn causes an increase in reabsorption, recirculation and renal excretion.|$|E
5000|$|Bilirubin is {{conjugated}} with {{glucuronic acid}} {{in the liver}} by the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, making it soluble in water. Much of it goes into the bile and thus out into the small intestine. Although 95% of the secreted bile is reabsorbed by the small intestine, conjugated bilirubin is not reabsorbed in small intestine. All conjugated bilirubin in the large intestine is metabolised by colonic bacteria to <b>urobilinogen,</b> which is then further oxidized to urobilin and stercobilin. Urobilin, stercobilin and their degradation products give feces its brown color. [...] However, just like bile, some of the <b>urobilinogen</b> reabsorbed is resecreted in the bile which {{is also part of}} enterohepatic circulation. The rest of the reabsorbed <b>urobilinogen</b> is excreted in the urine where it is converted to an oxidized form, urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic yellow color.|$|E
50|$|Relatively low {{conversion}} of bilirubin to <b>urobilinogen</b> by the intestinal flora, resulting in relatively high absorption of bilirubin {{back into the}} circulation.|$|E
5000|$|Urine: no {{bilirubin}} present, <b>urobilinogen</b> > 2 units (i.e., {{hemolytic anemia}} causes increased heme metabolism; exception: infants where gut flora has not developed).|$|E
5000|$|Laboratory tests; {{trimethoprim}} and sulfonamides {{have been}} reported to interfere with diagnostic tests, including serum-methotrexate and serum-plasma creatinine levels, also urea, urinary glucose and <b>urobilinogen</b> tests.|$|E
50|$|Low urine <b>urobilinogen</b> {{levels may}} result from {{congenital}} enzymatic jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia syndromes) or from treatment with drugs that acidify urine, such as ammonium chloride or ascorbic acid.|$|E
50|$|This {{conjugated}} bilirubin is excreted from the liver into the biliary and cystic ducts {{as part of}} bile. Intestinal bacteria convert the bilirubin into <b>urobilinogen.</b> From here <b>urobilinogen</b> can take two pathways. It can either be further converted into stercobilinogen, which is then oxidized to stercobilin and passed out in the feces, {{or it can be}} reabsorbed by the intestinal cells, transported in the blood to the kidneys, and passed out in the urine as the oxidised product urobilin. Stercobilin and urobilin are the products responsible for the coloration of feces and urine, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Measurement {{of total}} {{bilirubin}} includes both unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated bilirubin is a breakdown product of heme (a part of hemoglobin in red blood cells). It is very hydrophobic and is mainly transported bound to albumin circulating in the blood. Addition of high-concentration hydrophobic drugs (certain antibiotics, diuretics) and high {{free fatty acids}} can cause elevated unconjugated bilirubin. Heme can also come from myoglobin, found mostly in muscle, cytochromes, found mostly in mitochondria, catalase, peroxidase, and nitric oxide synthase. The liver is responsible for clearing the blood of unconjugated bilirubin, and about 30% of it is taken up by a normal liver on each pass of the blood through the liver by the following mechanism: bilirubin is taken up into hepatocytes, 'conjugated' (modified to make it water-soluble) by UDP-glucuronyl-transferase, and secreted into the bile by CMOAT (MRP2), which is excreted into the intestine. In the intestine, conjugated bilirubin may be metabolized by colonic bacteria, eliminated, or reabsorbed. Metabolism of bilirubin into <b>urobilinogen</b> followed by reabsorption of <b>urobilinogen</b> accounts for the yellow color of urine, as urine contains a downstream product of <b>urobilinogen.</b> Further metabolism of <b>urobilinogen</b> into stercobilin while in the bowels accounts for the brown color of stool. Thus, having white or clay-colored stool is an indicator for a blockage in bilirubin processing and thus potential liver dysfunction or cholestasis.|$|E
50|$|Elevated {{levels may}} {{indicate}} hemolytic anaemia (excessive breakdown of {{red blood cells}} RBC), overburdening of the liver, increased <b>urobilinogen</b> production, re-absorption - a large hematoma, restricted liver function, hepatic infection, poisoning or liver cirrhosis.|$|E
50|$|Urobilin or urochrome is the {{chemical}} {{primarily responsible for}} the yellow color of urine. It is a linear tetrapyrrole compound that, along with the related compound <b>urobilinogen,</b> are degradation products of the cyclic tetrapyrrole heme.|$|E
50|$|Automatic {{analysis}} of urine test strips using automated urine test strip analysers is a well-established practice in modern-day urinalysis. They can measure calcium, blood, glucose, bilirubin, <b>urobilinogen,</b> ketones, leukocytes, creatinine, microalbumin, pH, ascorbic acid and protein.|$|E
5000|$|The {{increase}} of stercobilin (urobilin) in the feces and urine {{is caused by}} the enhanced intracellular hemolysis of erythrocytes. Formed an unconjugated bilirubin entering the intestine, gives a large number of stercobilinogen (<b>urobilinogen).</b> Last absorbed into the blood and passes into the urine.|$|E

From top to bottom the pathological strip shows: Leukocytes (-), nitrites (-), <b>urobilinogen</b> (-), proteins (+), pH (5), hemoglobin (+), specific gravity (1.025), ketones (++++), bilirubin (+), glucose (+++).|$|E
50|$|Stercobilin {{results from}} {{breakdown}} of the heme moiety of hemoglobin found in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Bilirubin binds tightly to plasma proteins (especially albumin) in the blood stream and is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated {{with one or two}} glucuronic acid residues into bilirubin diglucuronide, and secreted into the small intestine as bile. In the small intestine, some bilirubin glucuronide is converted back to bilirubin via bacterial enzymes in the terminal ileum. This bilirubin is further converted to colorless <b>urobilinogen.</b> <b>Urobilinogen</b> that remains in the colon can either be reduced to stercobilinogen and finally oxidized to stercobilin, or it can be directly reduced to stercobilin. Stercobilin is responsible for the brown color of human feces. Stercobilin is then excreted in the feces.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{substances}} {{interfere with the}} Ehrlich reaction on the Multistix strip: porphobilinogen, indican, p-amino salicylic acid, sulphonamide, methyldopa, procaine and chlorpromazine. The test should be carried out at room temperature as the reaction’s sensitivity increases with temperature. Poorly stored samples can yield false negative results as the <b>urobilinogen</b> suffers photo oxidation to urobilin that does not react. The formaldehyde used as a preservative produces false negatives in both reactions.|$|E
5000|$|Urine {{bilirubin}} {{may also}} be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Testing urine for both bilirubin and <b>urobilinogen</b> can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice.|$|E
