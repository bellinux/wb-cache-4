40|$|Next-generation planar {{lightwave}} circuits (PLCs) {{will need}} circuits that have greater functionality and are larger in scale, {{but they must}} also be less expensive to make. To achieve this, we must continue improving the waveguide fabrication process and develop new ones. A PLC fabricated using a technique for fabricat-ing optical fibers can provide a high-quality lightwave circuit on a substrate. This means that both PLCs and optical fiber use the same silica-based glass material, buried waveguide geometry, and glass forming method. The fundamental PLC fabrication process is shown in Fig. 1. First, SiO 2 and GeO 2 glass particles are deposited on a Si substrate by flame hydrolysis deposition (FHD). SiO 2 particles are deposited to form the <b>under-cladding</b> <b>layer</b> and GeO 2 -doped SiO...|$|E
40|$|A {{waveguide}} Bragg grating {{temperature sensor}} implemented using a hybrid inorganic-organic material (Ormocer) with a 25 -times higher temperature sensitivity than a typical silica fiber is presented. The sensor consists of second order gratings (1010 -nm pitch) in 5 mu m x 5 mu m waveguides fabricated on a planar substrate using the replication-based methods. The gratings were imprinted in the <b>under-cladding</b> <b>layer,</b> and the waveguide cores were patterned on top by capillary filling of microchannels, which were defined in a transparent and flexible mold. The somewhat larger, slightly multimode waveguides facilitate pigtailing with an optical fiber but lead to three reflection peaks {{corresponding to the}} different excited waveguide modes. The peak at the longest wavelength (Bragg wavelength at 1539 nm, corresponding to the fundamental mode) was tracked during temperature testing, and a sensitivity of - 249 pm degrees C- 1 was found...|$|E
