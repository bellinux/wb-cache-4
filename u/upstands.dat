25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} is {{a robust}} single storey timber-framed building clad in chamferboards. Standing on a red-coloured concrete slab on fill it {{is covered by}} a low-pitched hipped corrugated sheet roof with half round ridge tiles and quad gutters, all of asbestos cement. Verandahs located on {{the north and east}} sides are supported on pairs of 150mm square posts finished with skirtings and capitals on capped concrete <b>upstands.</b> Along the verandahs, projecting porches with gabled hips distinguish the entrances when viewed from the main garden and driveway. The verandah walls and interior partition walls have exposed frames lined with vertical v-jointed tongue and groove boards and ceilings are lined with asbestos cement sheeting finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit a spanner (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} lockplate, and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through <b>upstands</b> inside the lockplate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{slab track}} {{consists}} of rails, fasteners and track slabs with a cement asphalt mortar. On the roadbed and in tunnels, circular <b>upstands</b> (measuring 400–520mm {{in diameter and}} 200mm high) are located at 5m intervals. The ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{areas of}} inaccuracy in current modelling techniques for bridge decks with wide cantilevers. A 3 -D grilllage model {{known as the}} <b>upstand</b> grillage is assessed by comparing its behaviour {{with that of a}} three-dimensional, finite-element model. Recommendation are made for the implementation of such a technique. The paper concludes with a comparison of results from analyses of a bridge deck using the standard and <b>upstand</b> grillage analogies and a three-dimensional finite-element method...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at a very {{detailed}} process of a transparent plexiglass used for manufacturing an <b>upstand</b> of a gramophone. The diploma work is mainly focused on various types of the plexiglass, its attributes and the gramophone’s <b>upstand</b> production. Several manufacturing technologies of a plexiglass such as division of a board-type semi product, precise milling, grinding, polishing and thermal treatment are provided in this diploma work through a very detailed description of a production process of a gramophone’s deck. The outcome of this thesis is a description of individual technologies and the economic evaluation within the real business environment of AZ Plastik company...|$|R
5000|$|The timber rails wore {{rapidly and}} later flat {{cast-iron}} plates were provided {{to limit the}} wear. In some localities, the plates were made L-shaped, the <b>upstand</b> of the L providing the guidance; this is generally {{referred to as a}} [...] "plateway".|$|R
40|$|For {{slab bridge}} decks with wide {{transverse}} edge cantilevers, the plane grillage analogy {{is shown to}} be an inaccurate method of linear elastic analysis due to variations in the vertical position of the neutral axis. The <b>upstand</b> grillage analogy is also shown to give inaccurate results, this time due to inappropriate modelling of in-plane distortions. An alternative method, known as <b>upstand</b> finite element analysis, is proposed which is sufficiently simple to be used on an everyday basis in the design office. The method is shown to give much better agreement than the others when compared with an elaborate three-dimensional solid finite element model. Single- and two-span bridge decks with solid and voided sections are considered for both longitudinal and transverse bending stresses...|$|R
5000|$|Roofing felts {{are usually}} a 'paper' or fiber {{material}} impregnated in bitumen. As gravel cannot protect tarpaper surfaces where they rise vertically {{from the roof}} such as on parapet walls or <b>upstands,</b> the felts are usually coated with bitumen and protected by sheet metal flashings.|$|E
50|$|The {{middle and}} rear {{portions}} of the shed have concrete floors {{and a number of}} drains run through these areas. The barrel storage area in the middle portion of the shed is organised around a grid of walkways and concrete <b>upstands</b> accommodating concrete plinths on which the barrels stand.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 {{the club}} reconstructed the Corrour Bothy.The Cairngorm Club are {{responsible}} for the construction of many bridges throughout the Cairngorms including those over the Luibeg Burn at [...] Preas nam Meirleach, and over the River Dee at Corrour Bothy. Probably the most famous is the Cairngorm Club Footbrige over the Am Beanaidh in Rothiemurchus Forrest. Known as the Iron Bridge, the construction is largely mild steel, with cast iron <b>upstands.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1812 the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway {{opened to}} convey coal from pits in the Kilmarnock area to a harbour at Troon. It was a plateway {{in which the}} [...] "rails" [...] were L-shaped plates; the <b>upstand</b> of the profile guided the wagon wheels, which did not have flanges.|$|R
50|$|The Bullo Pill Railway was {{probably}} completed soon afterwards. The track {{was of the}} L-plate form in which plain wagons wheels could run, guided by the <b>upstand</b> of the L. There are uncertainties about the gauge, but four feet measured between the outer faces of the vertical flanges, is generally assumed.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} Outram recommended further reservoir {{capacity for}} the canal, and conversion {{of all the}} existing tramroad connections to plateways, in which the rails are L-shaped plates, the <b>upstand</b> providing the guidance to plain wagon wheels; the gauge was to be 4ft 2in. The Canal Company accepted his recommendations, and this was formalised on 18 December 1800.|$|R
50|$|Verandahs {{are located}} on the southeast, {{northwest}} and between the eastern and western wings. These have timber posts on masonry <b>upstands</b> with timber batten balustrade between, arched timber valance, raked boarded ceilings and timber floors. Arched panelled windows with central hopper sections, lighting the main court room, are located above the verandah line with deep curved timber eave brackets. Below these are French doors, with panelled glass upper portions and hopper fanlights, and casement windows opening onto the verandah.|$|E
5000|$|The bar {{windows and}} glazed doors have cut, engraved, and frosted glass. The upper floors have {{recessed}} sash windows linked by ornate iron balconies {{on the second}} and third floors. The slate roof is framed by a stucco molded parapet with a prominent stucco main entablature with deep cornices and lions' head modillions. Centered on both sides are <b>upstands</b> with [...] "The Albert" [...] incised on them. The interior retains some bar fittings that date back to c. 1900.|$|E
5000|$|As the {{guidance}} of the wagons was improved, short strings of wagons could be connected and pulled by horses, and the track could be extended from the immediate vicinity of the mine or quarry, typically to a navigable waterway. The wagons were built to a consistent pattern and the track would be made to suit the wagons: the gauge was more critical. The Penydarren Tramroad of 1802 in South Wales, a plateway, spaced these at [...] over the outside of the <b>upstands.</b>|$|E
40|$|Channel screens {{are used}} to {{restrict}} the smoke from spreading laterally under the first balcony. Effect of channel screens on smoke contamination in atrium upper balconies {{with the presence of}} balcony open <b>upstand</b> and 1 m deep down stand at the fire compartment is investigated in this paper. Fire dynamic simulator (FDS 6) which is a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software was utilized to conduct the simulation. A comparison between the results of smoke contamination with the presence and omission of channeling screens showed that the height of smoke contamination in atrium upper balconies increased by 90 % in case of no channel screens at the fire compartment are installed. A new correlation obtained from this work is able to predict the height of smoke contamination in atrium upper balconies with the presence of 1 m deep down stand, balcony open <b>upstand</b> and no channel screens...|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the shell is formed from 105 bent and tapered cast-iron plates, each about 32 mm thick, with an <b>upstand</b> flange on each side, and bolted with cast-iron bolts, each weighing 2 lb. There are eight levels of panel tapering to the sixth 'course'. The first three horizontal joints are covered by iron bands supported on brackets and topped with fillets of concrete.|$|R
25|$|Set {{off from}} the main {{building}} by approximately 13 metres to the north-west and south-east are two wide butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters with built-in seating that faces both tracks. Four steel T-shaped components support steel perforated purlins, which inturn support the corrugated metal roof sheeting. The former divide the seating lengths. Set about {{four and a half}} metres apart, they are made with two cantilevered, tapering I-beams bolted to a rectangular hollow steel column (made with two C-sections welded together) which is founded in a concrete <b>upstand.</b> A perpendicular <b>upstand</b> runs the length of the shelter along the midline. Welded to the steel columns and beams are lighter steel frames. The infill panels of glass have been removed, as have some of the steel ones, while others are corroded. The seating is made with painted timber slats supported on timber studs and some steel framing. The downpipes taking water from the box gutter continue the rhythm of the columns, piercing the timber caps that join the two sides of seating at the centre of each gap.|$|R
50|$|A wide {{entrance}} stair, with rendered masonry <b>upstands</b> {{to either}} side, is located centrally. Non-original timber framed French doors with obscured glass panes and sidelights are {{located at the}} top of the stair, the verandah has been enclosed with glass louvres and compressed sheeting, and latticed timber panels are located between the brick piers supporting the verandah. The eastern gable end of the roof has decorative timber bargeboards, and a deck opening from the first floor of the rear wing is located adjacent to the gable end and is supported by timber posts above the enclosed eastern verandah.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} {{is on the}} south, recessed below a flat concrete awning supported by large concrete brackets. Directly above is a projecting angled alcove, with windows to the first floor, which culminates at the parapet. The building has terracotta tiled roofdecks with solid <b>upstands</b> and metal tubular railings to the southeast and northwest. The {{north side of the}} building sits on a face brick base with a dining terrace on the northeast, below the main bedroom, which overlooks the lawn tennis court to the north. The entrance to the subfloor air-raid shelter is located on the east below a projecting rounded pediment.|$|E
50|$|As {{an early}} high rise {{concrete}} {{building in a}} marine environment, Edgewater Towers suffered concrete degradation in the thin (3inch/75mm) balcony <b>upstands,</b> where the steel reinforcement bars were not provided with adequate protective concrete cover which require periodic repairs. The building had concrete remediation in 1995 followed by repainting. The most recent concrete remediation was completed in 2011 and then repainted white. Edgewater Towers has always been painted white, though the original sales brochure shows it differently. Whilst the structural integrity of the building was not affected, {{the facade of the}} building was disfigured by the gaps where concrete had spalled from various balconies. The most recent concrete remediation was managed by Aurecon.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{is surrounded by}} extensive grounds, including mature trees and several flower beds. Driveway access and carparking is along the southern boundary of the site, and a second driveway enters off Aplin Street and accesses the rear portico. A large forecourt forms {{the entrance to the}} building from Abbott Street, and a low concrete <b>upstand</b> which runs along the Abbott Street boundary may be the base of the original concrete fence.|$|R
5000|$|Gunstock~, jowled~, flared~, teasel~ (rare). A flared post, larger {{at the top}} {{than the}} bottom, most {{commonly}} found in the side walls but could be any location. Rarely a post may have an [...] "integral bracket" [...] which is a mid-post flair to carry a lower timber. The portion of a flared post extending upward at the top is called the <b>upstand</b> {{and one of the}} top tenons is called a teazle (teasel) tenon.|$|R
25|$|Two more {{narrower}} butterfly-roofed, steel-framed shelters {{are situated}} on the island platform serving tracks 3 and 4 {{to the west and}} Honour Avenue. They are of similar construction but with two seating bays at each end and a central section clad with a ribbed sheeting product that closely resembles the zincanneal that featured prominently in the standard design for these awnings. Surrounding the stairway opening in this platform is some metal railings bolted to a concrete <b>upstand.</b>|$|R
50|$|The former Aboriginal {{quarters}} is a timber framed building, once sheltered by a {{gable roof}} with skillion roofs extending {{to the north}} and south, that stands in a paddock some 240 metres south of the main house. The roof framing and corrugated iron roof sheeting has blown off in a violent storm and lies stacked nearby. The north wall is constructed of vertical timber slabs set into a bedlog and notched to take a top rail; a concrete half wall stands to the west, and the south and east walls are clad with corrugated galvanised iron. The building has concrete floors, <b>upstands</b> and drains, and metal gates and fences remaining from its use as a piggery.|$|E

50|$|A {{rectangular}} steel {{framed and}} concrete shed sheltered by a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting, the plant room stands {{to the middle}} of the site. The south-west wall is concrete with a corrugated iron gable infill; the concrete block north-east wall has a fibrous cement sheet gable infill and the side walls are concrete to half height, the balance clad with corrugated iron. The interior concrete walls are plastered and painted, a dado line separating the upper and lower portions. A concrete floor runs throughout and low concrete <b>upstands</b> accommodate various pieces of machinery. The timber framed roof is unlined and accommodates a narrow ridge vent with fixed glazed windows and timber louvres. Two large 20-light steel framed windows punctuate the north-west wall and a double timber door opens to the south-east. A later cold room extension sheltered by a skillion roof sits off the south-east side.|$|E
50|$|In {{fact it was}} to be a plateway {{in which}} plain wagon wheels were to run on L-shaped plates; the {{guidance}} was provided by the <b>upstand</b> of the L-profile. The authorised capital was £35,000, to build from Lydbrook to Lower Forge by way of Mierystock and Parkend. There were to be eight branches. The railway company was not to be a carrier itself, but simply to provide the tramway on which independent carriers might run their own horse-drawn wagons.|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{is built}} on a concrete slab on the ground, measuring 2.5 metres by 2 metres. The enclosure is a 2 metres high timber framed structure on a concrete blockwork <b>upstand.</b> The enclosure is built up against a kiosk block wall to the east. The north and south walls are sheeted with flat fibre cement. Open mesh {{is located on the}} west side. The roof is sheeted with super-6 corrugated asbestos cement with a small mesh section.|$|R
