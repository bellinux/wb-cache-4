Finally, {{the effect of the}} implant on Warwick's hand function was measured using the University of Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). It was feared that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference, but no measurable effect nor rejection was found. Indeed, nerve tissue grew around the electrode array, enclosing the sensor.|$|E
25|$|With {{the advent}} of the World-Wide Web, birders have been <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> convey information; this can be via mailing lists, forums, bulletin-boards, web-based {{databases}} and other media. While most birding lists are geographic in scope, there are special-interest lists that cater to bird-identification, 'twitchers', seabirds and raptor enthusiasts to name but a few. Messages can range from the serious to trivial, notifying others of rarities, questioning the taxonomy or identification of a species, discussing field guides and other resources, asking for advice and guidance, or organizing groups to help save habitats. Occasional postings are mentioned in academic journals and therefore can be a valuable resource for professional and amateur birders alike. One of the oldest, Birdchat (based in the US) probably has the most subscribers, followed by the English-language fork of Eurobirdnet, Birding-Aus from Australia, SABirdnet from South Africa and Orientalbirding.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In Vietnam, men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) are highly {{affected}} by HIV and need new targeted HIV prevention strategies. OBJECTIVES: To assess <b>the</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> seek information on HIV prevention and care and associated factors among MSM in Ho Chi Minh City. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in 2012. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling method in venues most frequented by MSM and completed a self-administered questionnaire. Logistic regression models were performed to estimate factors associated with <b>the</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> seek information on HIV prevention and care. RESULTS: A total of 358 MSM were approached for the survey and 222 questionnaires (62. 0 %) were eligible for analyses. Overall, 76. 1 % of the respondents reported that they were willing <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> seek information on HIV prevention and care. A number of male partners in last year less than or equal to 3 (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 3. 07, 95 % Confidence interval: 1. 40 - 6. 73), a history of STI screening (4. 10, 1. 02 - 16. 48) and HIV testing (3. 23, 1. 20 - 8. 64) and having ever sought a male sexual partner through <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> (3. 56, 1. 55 - 8. 18) were significantly positively associated with <b>the</b> willingness <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> seek information on HIV prevention and care. CONCLUSION: The MSM interviewed in Ho Chi Minh City reported a high willingness <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> <b>to</b> seek information on HIV prevention and care. In a context where new media are increasingly considered as promising options for reaching this HIV risk group, further research should be conducted on developing and testing tailored online tools adapted to the needs of Vietnamese MSM...|$|R
