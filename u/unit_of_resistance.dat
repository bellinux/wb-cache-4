5|$|The {{resistor}} {{is perhaps}} the simplest of passive circuit elements: as its name suggests, it resists the current through it, dissipating its energy as heat. The resistance {{is a consequence of}} the motion of charge through a conductor: in metals, for example, resistance is primarily due to collisions between electrons and ions. Ohm's law is a basic law of circuit theory, stating that the current passing through a resistance is directly proportional to the potential difference across it. The resistance of most materials is relatively constant over a range of temperatures and currents; materials under these conditions are known as 'ohmic'. The ohm, the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance,</b> was named in honour of Georg Ohm, and is symbolised by the Greek letter Ω. 1Ω is the resistance that will produce a potential difference of one volt in response to a current of one amp.|$|E
25|$|In 1843 Wheatstone communicated an {{important}} {{paper to the}} Royal Society, entitled 'An Account of Several New Processes for Determining the Constants of a Voltaic Circuit.' It contained an exposition of the well known balance for measuring the electrical resistance of a conductor, which still {{goes by the name}} of Wheatstone's Bridge or balance, although it was first devised by Samuel Hunter Christie, of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, who published it in the Philosophical Transactions for 1833. The method was neglected until Wheatstone brought it into notice. His paper abounds with simple and practical formulae for the calculation of currents and resistances by the law of Ohm. He introduced a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance,</b> namely, a foot of copper wire weighing one hundred grains (6.5 g), and showed how it might be applied to measure the length of wire by its resistance. He was awarded a medal for his paper by the Society. The same year he invented an apparatus which enabled the reading of a thermometer or a barometer to be registered at a distance by means of an electric contact made by the mercury. A sound telegraph, in which the signals were given by the strokes of a bell, was also patented by Cooke and Wheatstone in May of that year.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{so-called}} [...] "absolute" [...] {{units of}} charge and current are expressed as combinations of units of mass, length, and time, dimensional {{analysis of the}} relations between potential, current, and resistance show that resistance is expressed in units of length per time — a velocity. Some early definitions of a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance,</b> for example, defined a unit resistance as one quadrant of the Earth per second.|$|E
50|$|The {{mercury column}} method of realizing a {{physical}} standard ohm {{turned out to}} be difficult to reproduce, owing to the effects of non-constant cross section of the glass tubing. Various resistance coils were constructed by the British Association and others, to serve as physical artifact standards for the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b> The long-term stability and reproducibility of these artifacts was an ongoing field of research, as the effects of temperature, air pressure, humidity, and time on the standards were detected and analyzed.|$|E

5000|$|As for {{the case}} of linear {{dependent}} sources, the proportionality constant between dependent and independent variables is dimensionless if they are both currents (or both voltages).

50|$|His {{writings}} were numerous. The {{most important}} was his pamphlet published in Berlin in 1827, {{with the title}} Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet. This work, the germ of which had appeared during the two preceding years in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, has exerted an important influence {{on the development of}} the theory and applications of electric current.

50|$|Various {{artifact}} {{standards were}} proposed as {{the definition of}} the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b> In 1860 Werner Siemens (1816-1892) published a suggestion for a reproducible resistance standard in Poggendorffs Annalen der Physik und Chemie. He proposed a column of pure mercury, of one square millimetre cross section, one metre long: Siemens mercury unit. However, this unit was not coherent with other units. One proposal was to devise a unit based on a mercury column that would be coherent - in effect, adjusting the length to make the resistance one ohm. Not all users of units had the resources to carry out metrology experiments to the required precision, so working standards notionally based on the physical definition were required.|$|E

50|$|Glazebrook {{was born}} in West Derby, Liverpool, Lancashire, {{the son of a}} surgeon. He was educated at Dulwich College until 1870, Liverpool College from 1870 to 1872, and Trinity College, Cambridge, from which he {{graduated}} in Mathematics in 1876 and of which he was elected a fellow in 1877. He studied physics under James Clerk Maxwell and Lord Rayleigh at the new Cavendish Laboratory and in 1880 was appointed a demonstrator at the laboratory. The following year he was also appointed a college lecturer in mathematics and physics and a university lecturer in mathematics. His research focused on electrical standards and aviation. When defining electrical standards for the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance,</b> the British Science Association were trying to determine what length a mercury column should be, to express the absolute value of the Ohm. A number of different values had been obtained over the years and Glazebrook determined the value at 106.3 cm. Despite scepticism of mercurial standards this was the International value agreed on later by the 1893 Chicago conference.|$|E

5000|$|In 1800, as {{the result}} of a {{professional}} disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Luigi Galvani, Alessandro Volta developed the so-called voltaic pile, a forerunner of the battery, which produced a steady electric current. Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was zinc and silver. In 1861, Latimer Clark and Sir Charles Bright coined the name [...] "volt" [...] for the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance.</b> [...] By 1873, the British Association for the Advancement of Science had defined the volt, ohm, and farad. [...] In 1881, the International Electrical Congress, now the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), approved the volt as the unit for electromotive force. [...] They made the volt equal to 108 cgs units of voltage, the cgs system at the time being the customary system of units in science. They chose such a ratio because the cgs unit of voltage is inconveniently small and one volt in this definition is approximately the emf of a Daniell cell, the standard source of voltage in the telegraph systems of the day. [...] At that time, the volt was defined as the potential difference what is nowadays called the [...] "voltage (difference)" [...] across a conductor when a current of one ampere dissipates one watt of power.|$|E

40|$|This article {{develops}} {{the notion that}} poetry is crucially distinguished from other forms of verbal art by its foregrounding of segmentivity, the spacing of language. If a measure {{is regarded as the}} smallest <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>resistance</b> to meaning, measure determines where gaps open up in a poetic text. Poetry is, however, not only measured, but typically countermeasured and narrative in poetry can also be countermeasured against the segmentation that is specific to narrative. The present article investigates segmentivity in one particular type of narrative poem, namely poems in discontinuous stanzaic forms. The concept of affordances (referring to different potentials for use) is applied to the stanzaic form in Edmund Spenser’s “The faerie queene” (1590; 1596) and to the “ottava rima” stanza, as exemplified by Kenneth Koch’s postmodernist narrative poem, “Seasons on earth” (1960; 1977; 1987) ...|$|E
40|$|Quite generally, an {{insulator}} is theoretically {{defined by}} a vanishing conductivity tensor at the absolute zero of temperature.
