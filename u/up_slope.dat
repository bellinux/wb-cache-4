25|$|The {{southern}} {{access point}} is just off exit 74 of Interstate 476 via U.S. Route 209 through Jim Thorpe {{and across the}} bridge to the north bank on Pennsylvania Route 903 to the Glen Onoko neighborhood, formerly East Mauch Chunk the left bank or {{northern part of the}} borough of Jim Thorpe. This access point is on the opposite bank from the Glen Onoko nature and hiking trail which climbs <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> westerly alongside the tributary descending Glen Onoko Falls giving the eponymous name to that region of the lower gorge, whilst the Lehigh descends through several sharp curves before reaching the slack water elevation of Nesquehoning Junction between Jim Thorp and Nesquehoning. The two railroad lines which competed for trade along the Lehigh diverge to run on opposite shores at this entrance.|$|E
25|$|The {{approaching}} Russian cavalry was on {{the heights}} and numbered about 3,000 sabres. The Scots Greys {{and the rest of}} the British dragoons were waiting at the base of the heights, and totalled about 800 men. Satisfied that his brigade was ready, Scarlett finally sounded the advance. Although Scarlett had spent precious minutes ordering his line, it soon proved to be unwieldy, especially in the sector occupied by the Scots Greys, who had to pick their way through the abandoned camp of the Light Brigade. The Scots Greys, once clear of the Light Brigade's camp, had to speed up to catch Scarlett and his aides, who were more than 50 yards ahead of them. For some reason, the Russian cavalry commander chose to halt <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> of the Heavy Brigade, choosing to receive the charge at a halt.|$|E
60|$|Old Tom and Old Dan had {{not come}} down off the slopes with us after the pups. And upon our return both the old hounds began to bay deep and fast. With shrill ki-yi the pups bounded off, {{apparently}} frantic {{to make up for}} misbehavior. Soon the whole pack was in full chorus. Edd and George spurred into the brush, yelling encouragement to the hounds. This day I managed to make my horse do a little of what I wanted. To keep in sight of the Haught boys was indeed beyond me; but I did not lose sound of them. This chase led us <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> and down slope, through the brush and pine thickets, over bare ridges and into gullies; and eventually out into the basin, where the hounds got beyond hearing.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the anxiety at {{utilization}} of wheelchairs. When the human use wheelchairs, from the influence of environment, the human {{feel a sense of}} unease. In particular, when the human go <b>up</b> <b>slopes</b> using wheelchairs, the human feel a sense of unease. The sense of unease is under influence of the organ of vision and the vestibular organ. In this paper, we clarify the relation between the sense of unease and the vestibular organ, when the human go <b>up</b> <b>slopes</b> using wheelchairs...|$|R

50|$|An <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> runway {{will allow}} an {{aircraft}} {{to land in}} a shorter distance. A down slope runway will require a greater landing distance. It will take longer for the aeroplane to touch down from 50 ft above the runway threshold, as the runway is falling away beneath the aeroplane and of course braking while going downhill is not as effective as on a level or <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> runway.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{the waters}} are pooled in Lake Hauto above the Hauto Dam in the Hamlet of Hauto, near where the {{historically}} important Hauto Tunnel serviced the many coal breakers of Lansford, Coaldale, and historic Summit Hill. The Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of Pennsylvania (CNJ), both Class I railroads ran trackage <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> to cross north and west over the mountain ridges.|$|E
50|$|After {{crossing}} {{the upper west}} branch of the Neversink at the trailhead, 2,400 feet (731.5 m) in elevation, the yellow-blazed P-EB trail works its way gently <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> and over some lesser streams 0.7 mile (1 km) to the old carriage road it originally followed through the Winnisook Club property. It follows this south past a reliable spring 0.3 mile (500 m) to the western terminus of the red-blazed Burroughs Range Trail, the old horse trail built in 1892.|$|E

50|$|In 1928, a {{combined}} warehouse, garage, and office was built across the road, {{southeast of the}} ranger residence. In 1934, the warehouse was enlarged. At the same time, a bunkhouse for summer fire crews was built across the road and <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> to the east. In the late 1930s, a small, temporary Civilian Conservation Corps camp was established in Stehekin. In 1939, the Civilian Conservation Corps crew built a barn and a gas and oil house for the ranger station. Both of these structures were later demolished by the Forest Service.|$|E

50|$|Adenanthos ellipticus {{is found}} only in Fitzgerald River National Park, where it occurs in three populations occupying an area of less than 0.31 square {{kilometres}} (77 acres). It grows in quartzite-derived siliceous sand on rocky hillsides. It is found in association with coastal jugflower (Adenanthos cuneatus) and veined adenanthos (A. venosus), but generally grows higher <b>up</b> <b>slopes</b> than those species.|$|R
50|$|Nordic ski {{technology}} was adapted {{during the early}} 20th century to enable skiers to turn at higher speeds. New ski and ski binding designs, coupled {{with the introduction of}} ski lifts to carry skiers <b>up</b> <b>slopes,</b> enabled the development of alpine skis. Meanwhile, advances in technology in the Nordic camp allowed for the development of special skis for skating and ski jumping.|$|R
50|$|They hid their rubber {{boats and}} {{explosives}} and demolition equipment {{under the trees}} {{as best they could}} and began moving <b>up</b> <b>slope.</b> They eventually found an empty barn {{on the edge of the}} locality of Carpeneggio and settled in. On the morning of March 23, two team members, 1st Lt. Russo and Sgt. Mauro, went out to get food and information at the nearest farm. An Italian farmer named Franco Lagaxo saw Russo and Mauro approaching his cottage who identified themselves as U.S. soldiers and was asked if he could buy food for them. He agreed to do so and later in the day guided them on reconnaissance which succeeded in locating access to the Genoa-La Spezia rail tunnel.|$|E
5000|$|James {{was born}} in a U.S. Army {{hospital}} in Hot Springs, Arkansas, to two ecologists. She was brought up on a farm at the base of Kessler Mountain near Fayetteville, in the Arkansas Ozarks. At age eight, her family moved <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> to a custom-built house in the woods, where she developed an interest in natural history and archaeology. James' parents encouraged an appreciation for nature in her and her sisters, taking them on trips within the Ozarks and to the American southwest and Mexico. James found some Amerindian artifacts on these excursions, leading her to join the Northwest Arkansas Archaeological Association at age twelve. James' father accepted a one-year Fulbright Fellowship and the family moved to Cape Coast, Ghana.|$|E

50|$|The {{mail train}} {{crashed into the}} GWR goods train, the engine of the LMS train {{clipping}} {{the edges of the}} two front-most goods vans of the GWR Train before crashing into the tender, which at that point was slightly askew of the main line as it was being shunted clear. The LMS engine crashed into the right-hand side of the GWR tender and derailed to the right, ploughing into two empty wagons of the up LMS train before it overturned onto its right side against the <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> near the bridge. The GWR tender was flung onto its left side against {{the north side of the}} bridge, while the GWR engine became wedged against the abutment, causing the first six vehicles (the parcel van, the other van, the front composite, the two 3rd class carriages and the rear composite) to become wedged under the bridge.|$|E
50|$|In May 1863, the Reserves, then {{commanded}} by Samuel W. Crawford, {{returned to the}} Army of the Potomac and became the 3rd Division of the V Corps. McCandless retained command of the 1st Brigade, and {{was active in the}} Battle of Gettysburg. On {{the second day of the}} battle, McCandless moved to the army’s left and deployed his men in two lines, together with the 93rd Pennsylvania Infantry of Frank Wheaton’s brigade, at the foot of Little Round Top. McCandless’ brigade, under immediate supervision by Crawford, launched a counterattack against the Confederates, mostly from William T. Wofford’s command, across Plum Run Valley and <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> to the edge of the Wheatfield on July 2, 1863. (Wofford had been ordered to withdraw and did not resist as fiercely as he desired.) McCandless’s brigade held its position to the end of the battle. Then it advanced late on July 3, gathering up stragglers from the Confederate withdrawal.|$|E
50|$|The most {{peculiar}} {{characteristic of}} the gravel belts is their stiff clay. The soil of these gravel belts is very stiff and forms clods. They are continuous for miles, maintaining a constant level, and then merge into a single set of ridges in the Black River valley. Unlike most beaches of sand, {{the remains of the}} Arkona beaches are only the base structure, which are heavily impregnated with clay. Except for their consistent elevation, they would not have been identified as beach remnants.The Arkona beaches have been heavily modified by wave actions and the emergence of Lake Whittlesey. Initially, Lake Whittlesey's waves began the process of washing the top portion of the Arkona beaches away. Then, the depth of the lake grew and water currents along the bottom of the lake moved the larger gravels <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> {{to become part of the}} Lake Whittlesey beaches. Then a period of deep quiet water allowed fine lays to leave suspension and be deposited among the remaining gravel.|$|E
50|$|In 1970, CMB started fitting more {{powerful}} engines to its Guy Arab double-deckers, giving them enough power for climbing <b>up</b> <b>slopes</b> and servicing {{areas such as}} the Mid-levels. In the same year, CMB also decided to convert its Guy Arab MkV single-deckers to double-deckers. Some of the short-wheelbase buses were rebodied with low-height double-deck bodies, enabling them to provide service on the Victoria Peak.|$|R

50|$|Low angle (<20°), cross-stratified {{sandstones}} form units up to 50 cm thick, rarely reaching thicknesses {{as much as}} 2 m. The current directions {{here are}} to the southeast - <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> - and was considered to reinforce their interpretation as aeolian dunes. They are alternatively interpreted as superficial bars and channel deposits on lower and middle intertidal zones, a far less controversial interpretation given their intimate association with intensely bioturbated rocks. FA2 also contains a dense, varied trace fossil assemblage, taken by some as indicative of a tidal, marine-influenced setting, given the Tumblagooda Sandstone clearly predates the widespread development of land plants. Current and wave ripple marks are also widespread, which may be have formed on tidal flats as water depths varied, or perhaps in shallow streams, with flooded hollows hosting the creators of the trace fossils.Cyclicity is poorly shown or absent, suggesting that, rather than being seasonal events, the occasional inundation was based on unpredictable events such as storms, a varying water table, and changing stream courses.|$|E
50|$|On 5 June 1982 Hamilton was {{deployed}} {{in command of}} a four-man observation patrol into positions behind enemy lines on West Falkland to observe Argentinian activity at Port Howard. He established himself in an observation post only 2500 metres from the Argentine positions, from which radio reports were dispatched. Shortly after dawn on 10 June 1982 he and a radio operator, Corporal Roy Fonseka, both together in the post, were discovered by an Argentinian patrol from the 1st Section of the 601 Commando Company, operating out of Port Howard. Fonseka engaged the enemy force followed by Hamilton. As the small arms fire-fight continued with grenades being exchanged, during which Hamilton {{was hit in the}} arm by a rifle bullet, Hamilton ordered that they should both attempt to fight their way out. Since the only withdrawal route available was to the rear, and was exposed to enemy observation on the <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> of the ridge for 50 yards to the summit, Hamilton maintained automatic covering fire from within the post at the Argentinian commandos to allow Fonseka to withdraw first in a co-ordinated fall-back manoeuvre. Hamilton then attempted to follow, and in the process was struck by Argentinian rifle fire and killed, Fonseka being afterwards taken prisoner of war.|$|E
5000|$|Some teams propose dry venting {{of carbon}} dioxide (CO2) gas and sand, {{occurring}} between the ice and the underlying bedrock. It is known that a CO2 ice slab is virtually transparent to solar radiation where 72% of solar energy incident at 60 degrees off vertical will reach {{the bottom of a}} 1 m thick layer. In addition, separate teams from Taiwan and France measured the ice thickness in several target areas, and discovered that the greatest thickness of the CO2 frost layer in the geysers' area is about 0.76-0.78 m, supporting the geophysical model of dry venting powered by sunlight. [...] As the southern spring CO2 ice receives enough solar energy, it starts sublimation of the CO2 ice from the bottom. [...] This vapor accumulates under the slab rapidly increasing pressure and erupting. High-pressure gas flows through at speeds of 160 km/h or more; [...] under the slab, the gas erodes ground as it rushes toward the vents, snatching up loose particles of sand and carving the spidery network of grooves. [...] The dark material falls back to the surface and may be taken <b>up</b> <b>slope</b> by wind, creating dark wind streak patterns on the ice cap. [...] This model is consistent with past observations. [...] It is clear that sublimation of the base of the seasonal ice cap is more than capable of generating a substantial overpressure, which is four orders of magnitude higher than the ice overburden pressure and five orders of magnitude higher than atmospheric pressure as discussed above.|$|E
