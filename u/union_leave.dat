The {{strength}} of this desire is such, that it is ready, so far forth as it can, to dissolve that sweet knot of union that is betwixt body and soul, a knot more dear to a reasonable creature than that can be which is betwixt wife and husband, parent and child, or {{a man and his}} estate. For even 'all that a man hath will he give for his life,' and to keep body and soul firmly knit together. But now, when this desire comes, this 'silver cord is loosed'; is loosed by consent. This desire grants to him that comes to dissolve this <b>union</b> <b>leave</b> to do it delightfully. 'We are confident and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord' (2 Cor 5:8). Yea, this desire makes this flesh, this mortal life, a burden. The man that has this desire exercises self-denial, while he waits till his desired change comes. For were it not that the will of God is that he should live, and did he not hope that his life might be serviceable to the truth and church of God, he would not have wherewith to cool the heart of this desire, but would rather, in a holy passion with holy Job, cry out, 'I loathe,' or I abhor it, 'I would not live alway: let me alone,' that I may die, 'for my days are vanity' (Job 7:15-17).|$|E
