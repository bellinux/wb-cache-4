Once she had laid claim to {{temporal}} power, believed herself to be the sole agency of God on earth, had spoken ex cathedra on philosophy, history, theology, and science, had undertaken to confer eternal bliss and to damn forever. Her members, and even her priests, had gone from murder to mass and from mass to murder, and she had engaged in cruel wars and persecutions to curtail the liberties of mankind. <b>Under</b> <b>that</b> <b>conception</b> religion was a form of insurance of the soul. Perhaps a common, universal belief had been necessary in the dark ages before the sublime idea of education for the masses had come; but the Church herself--through ignorance--had opposed the growth of education, had set her face sternly against the development of the individual, which Christ had taught, the privilege of man to use the faculties of the intellect which God had bestowed upon him. He himself, their rector, had advocated a catholic acceptance, though much modified from the mediaeval acceptance,--one that professed to go behind it to an earlier age. Yes, he must admit with shame that he had been afraid to trust where God trusted, had feared to confide the working out of the ultimate Truth of the minds of the millions.|$|E

It shows how the school from its function as a mechanism of historical tuning of the subject and dissemination of normative parameters of society, as scientists and academics of humanity achievements, you can get to claim the difference and to defend it as a focus of building indeed, to avoid reducing it to a single universal truth, which historically have derived the greatest conflicts in society...|$|R

The work describes the ten most successful companies, according to the polls Top 100 ICT companies in the Czech Republic 2008. The list of the Top 100 is annualy prepared by Computerworld magazine. My bachelor work describes the profile of these companies and their products and services. Furthermore, it deals with Internet {{which is one of}} the most developed ICT sectors. To provide better specification about my idia I chose two companies that are operating on Internetc, on the Czech market web portals.

40|$|Whether animals, {{especially}} companion animals, {{count as}} friends {{depends on the}} conception of friendship {{as well as on}} the conception of animals. Some accounts of friendship can include (other than human) animals more easily than others. I present an argument in favour of characterising some animal-human connections as friendships, and address some of the standard objections to this characterisation. It might seem <b>that</b> <b>under</b> any <b>conception</b> of friendship, characterising animals as (potential) friends would likely lead to better treatment of animals, as various kinds of ill-treatment or use would not be consistent with treating someone as a friend. However, concern for animal welfare typically extends well beyond the direct concern for our own household companions, and is a concern for animals (or certain animals) in general, whereas friendship, by its nature, is particularist. There are limits to applying the concept of friendship to animal treatment beyond particular relationships. 15 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} a {{mathematical}} structure is a most pervasive and central one in twentieth-century mathematics. Over several decades of this century, many mathematical disciplines, particularly those belonging to the “pure ” realm, developed <b>under</b> the <b>conception</b> <b>that</b> the aim of research is the elucidation of certain structures associated with them. At certain periods of time, especially from the 1950 s to the 1970 s, {{it was not uncommon}} in universities around the world to conceive the ideal professional formation of young mathematicians in terms of a gradual mastering of the various structures that were considered to embody the hard-core of mathematics. Two important points of reference for understanding the development of twentieth century mathematics in general pertain the ideas of David Hilbert, on the one hand, and of the Bourbaki group, on the other hand. This is also true, in particular, {{for the development of the}} conception of mathematics as a science of structures. In the present article I explain how, and to what extent, the idea of a mathematical structure appears in the works of Hilbert and of Bourbaki. My presentation will be based on defining the idea of a mathematical structure as...|$|R

Sexual aggressiveness (libido) is a behavioral factor that can influence the number of matings a bull can achieve and, thus, may influence the conception rate obtained during natural mating. Accurate evaluation of sexual aggressiveness and its relationship to fertility may provide useful information for selecting young beef bulls with high breeding potential. We conducted the following studies to investigate sexual activity in young beef bulls during a series of libido tests and to evaluate the relationship between libido test activity and fertility during natural mating...|$|R

The result of the study show <b>that</b> <b>conceptions</b> of Satan, demons and hell are strong in most of the individuals’ life but one.
