40|$|Forced flow {{over the}} {{asymmetric}} topography of the Darling Scarp, Western Australia is modelled, using a nonhydrostatic model, and compared with observations. Drag histories and sensitivity tests {{indicate that it}} is possible for the flow to be dominated by hydrostatic downslope windstorms even if the hydrostatic index indicates nonhydrostatic dominance. Experiments {{on a wide range of}} one- or two-layered flows suggest that nonhydrostatic effects on windstorm events are very small. However, the development and location of trapped lee waves can be significantly affected if there is sufficient <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forcing</b> in the flow.

40|$|The {{underwater}} swimming manipulator (USM) is a {{new class}} of robots that combines the underwater snake robot's biologically inspired shape with the thruster actuators typical of other underwater robots. This combination makes USMs highly flexible and facilitates for inspection, maintenance, and repair in otherwise inaccessible environments. However, because the USM floats freely in the water, any motion of the manipulator will cause a reaction that affects the position and orientation of the base, and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> will cause rotations of the entire vehicle. This thesis proposes a USM control scheme that accounts for reaction <b>forces</b> and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces.</b> The approach is based on a method originally developed for robots in space, using the generalized Jacobian matrix. The generalized Jacobian takes base-manipulator coupling into account and allows manipulation without actuating the base coordinates. Applying this to a USM differs from previous USM control methods, which actively control the base link to allow fixed-base control of the end-effector. The previous methods require many thrusters, and the power to drive them. This thesis investigates if USM control with the generalized Jacobian is feasible, despite the differences between underwater and space robots. The complete control system is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and verified in the Vortex Studio real-time hydrodynamic simulator. Without <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces,</b> the system is found to be useful even without sensor feedback, with small tracking errors. With nonzero <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces,</b> sensor feedback is required for acceptable accuracy, and position feedback was found to give significantly better precision than velocity feedback. The thesis demonstrates that the generalized Jacobian can be used for efficient USM control, and is applicable to any underwater vehicle manipulator system, including underwater snake robots without thrusters. For USMs, this means that longer missions on battery power are possible and that the thrusters are freed to other tasks...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACTIn the {{proposed}} paper numerical {{calculations are carried}} out using two versions of a three-dimensional, time-domain panel method developed by the group of Prof. P. Sclavounos at MIT, i. e. the linear code SWAN 2, enabling optionally {{the use of the}} instantaneous non-linear Froude-Krylov and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> and the fully non-linear SWAN 4. The analytical results are compared with experimental results for three hull forms with increasing geometrical complexity, the Series 60, a reefer vessel with stern bulb and a modern fast ROPAX hull form with hollow bottom in the stern region. The details of the geometrical modeling of the hull forms are discussed. In addition, since SWAN 4 does not support transom sterns, only the two versions of SWAN 2 were evaluated over experimental results for the parent hull form of the NTUA double-chine, wide-transom, high-speed monohull series. The effect of speed on the numerical predictions was investigated. It is concluded that both versions of SWAN 2 the linear and the one with the non-linear Froude-Krylov and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> provide a more robust tool for prediction of the dynamic response of the vessels than the non-linear SWAN 4 code. In general, their results are close to what was expected on the basis of experience. Furthermore, the use of the option of non-linear Froude-Krylov and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> is beneficial for the accuracy of the predictions.

40|$|A weakly {{nonlinear}} seakeeping {{methodology for}} predicting motions and loads {{is presented in}} this paper. This methodology assumes linear radiation and diffraction forces, calculated in the frequency domain, and fully nonlinear Froude-Krylov and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces,</b> evaluated in the time domain. The particular approach employed here allows to overcome numerical problems connected to {{the determination of the}} impulse response functions. The procedure is divided into three consecutive steps: evaluation of dynamic sinkage and trim in calm water that can significantly influence the final results, a linear seakeeping analysis in the frequency domain and a weakly nonlinear simulation. The first two steps are performed employing a three-dimensional Rankine panel method. Nonlinear Froude-Krylov and <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> are computed in the time domain by pressure integration on the actual wetted surface at each time step. Although nonlinear forces are evaluated into the time domain, the equations of motion are solved in the frequency domain iteratively passing from the frequency to the time domain until convergence. The containership S 175 is employed as a test case for evaluating the capability of this methodology to correctly predict the nonlinear behavior related to wave induced motions and loads in head seas; numerical results are compared with experimental data provided in literature...|$|R

50|$|Differences in mean blood {{pressure}} are responsible for blood flow from one location to another in the circulation. The rate of mean blood flow depends on both {{blood pressure}} and the resistance to flow presented by the blood vessels. Mean blood pressure decreases as the circulating blood {{moves away from the}} heart through arteries and capillaries due to viscous losses of energy. Mean blood pressure drops over the whole circulation, although most of the fall occurs along the small arteries and arterioles.

50|$|Gravity: The {{effects of}} gravity on venous return seem {{paradoxical}} because {{when a person}} stands up, <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>forces</b> cause the right atrial pressure to decrease and the venous pressure in the dependent limbs to increase. This increases the pressure gradient for venous return from the dependent limbs to the right atrium; however, venous return actually decreases. The {{reason for this is}} when a person initially stands, cardiac output and arterial pressure decrease (because right atrial pressure falls). The flow through the entire systemic circulation falls because arterial pressure falls more than right atrial pressure; therefore the pressure gradient driving flow throughout the entire circulatory system is decreased.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a novel GE Compliant Plate Seal is {{proposed}} {{that consists of}} compliant plates attached to a stator in a circumferential fashion around a rotor. The compliant plates have a slot that extends radially inwards from the seal outer diameter, and an intermediate plate extends inwards into this slot from stator. This design is capable of providing passive <b>hydrostatic</b> feedback <b>forces</b> acting on the compliant plates that balance at a small tip-clearance. When the tip-clearance reduces below the equilibrium clearance, the <b>hydrostatic</b> lift <b>forces</b> cause the compliant plates to lift away from the rotor. Conversely when the tip-clearance increases above the equilibrium clearance, the <b>hydrostatic</b> blowdown <b>forces</b> cause the compliant plates to blow down towards the rotor. Due to this self-correcting behavior, this seal is capable of providing high differential pressure capability and low leakage within a limited axial span, and non-contact operation even {{in the presence of}} large rotor transients. Simplified CFD models have been developed to predict the leakage flow rates and hydrostatic lift and blowdown forces, and a design philosophy {{is proposed}} to predict the feedback phenomenon from the CFD models. The proposed models are validated and self-correcting behavior is demonstrated through experimental testing...|$|R

The workability of the method is illustrated with the simulation of ship motions in irregular stern quartering waves...|$|R
