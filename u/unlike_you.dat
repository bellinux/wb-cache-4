6000|$|... "Daren. I--I don't {{understand}} you," [...] she said, unsteadily. [...] "You frighten me. Let me go--please, Daren. This is--so--so <b>unlike</b> <b>you.</b> You insult me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Come,’ she said, ‘this is <b>unlike</b> <b>you.</b> You are not wont to be afraid. You {{say that}} you admire my husband: in his name, be honest.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Bert. [...] Yes--I nursed thee, [...] Because thou wert my first-born, and I {{knew not}} [...] If {{there would be}} another <b>unlike</b> <b>thee,</b> [...] That monstrous sport of Nature. But get hence, [...] And gather wood![205] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why so?" [...] he asked, with bitter disappointment. [...] "Ayesha, {{those parts}} have been mine for many a day; more, I grow no younger, and, <b>unlike</b> <b>thee,</b> shall soon be old. Also, life is fleeting, and {{sometimes}} I think that I near its end." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "But surely," [...] I cried, [...] "you {{will give}} me some reason! This is <b>unlike</b> <b>you,</b> Agatha. Tell me how I have been unfortunate enough to offend you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] she said, [...] "this is <b>unlike</b> <b>you.</b> You are not wont to be afraid. You {{say that}} you admire my husband: in his name, be honest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Carley, how you rave!" [...] exclaimed her friend. [...] "What {{has gotten}} into you lately? Why, {{everybody}} tells me you're--you're queer! The way you insulted Morrison--how <b>unlike</b> <b>you,</b> Carley!" ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> on Honshū, <b>you</b> can see alpine {{plants at}} altitudes {{as low as}} 1000 meters in the Mashike mountains.|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} links with another in Burkina. The schools in Burkina Faso, like in England, are free but the {{government}} cannot afford to deliver this assurance to all the Burkinabé children. <b>Unlike</b> England <b>you</b> {{are much more likely}} to receive an education if you are a boy.|$|R
50|$|Max {{integration}} into Ableton Live, developed by Ableton and Cycling ’74, to build unique synths and effects, create algorithmic composition tools, or fuse Live and controller hardware into new music machines. <b>Unlike</b> Pluggo, <b>you</b> can edit the device created with Max for Live {{directly from the}} Live by pressing the edit button.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not quite}} {{understand}} the nature of your question, Gerald," [...] Mr. Fentolin began. [...] "It is <b>unlike</b> <b>you.</b> You do not seem yourself. Is there anything in particular the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because your {{figure is}} perfect, {{and because she}} is straggling. She is as <b>unlike</b> <b>you</b> as {{possible}} in everything. She has thick lumpy red hair, while yours is all silk and softness. She has large hands and feet, and--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{friend of}} the Pritchards, Tom dear, who wants a bed here to-night. I couldn't imagine why the sleigh didn't come for me. It's so <b>unlike</b> <b>you</b> not to {{remember}} it." [...] And {{she gave him a}} look to melt adamant.|$|E
50|$|What You Make It is a {{short story}} {{collection}} by English writer Michael Marshall Smith, first published in 1999. It was his first short storie collection. The contents were later republished {{as part of the}} expanded collection More Tomorrow & Other Stories, which, <b>unlike</b> What <b>You</b> Make It, was available outside of the UK.|$|R
6000|$|HOTCHKISS. No you shant. I {{have one}} card left {{to play that}} youve forgotten. Why were <b>you</b> so <b>unlike</b> {{yourself}} when <b>you</b> spoke to the Bishop? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So Mrs. Staunton says,' replied Helen; 'she {{used to tell}} me that I was a {{good deal}} like her, and should be more so; but I do not think she would have said so, if she had seen you. I am so slow and so dull, and so <b>unlike</b> to <b>you</b> in your quick active ways.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{why do you}} cry so bitterly?" [...] asked Hafrydda. [...] "It is so <b>unlike</b> <b>you</b> to {{give way}} to despair. Besides, you defied him, you say, and you were right to do so, for my dear father will never force you to wed against your wishes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are desperate, full of fancies, and wilful; and you misunderstand. I have an {{additional}} reason for seeing you tonight besides love of you. For though, <b>unlike</b> <b>you,</b> I feel our affection may be eternal, I feel {{with you in}} this, that our present mode of existence cannot last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{must confess}} I {{did not expect}} that you would ridicule my confidence, Freda," [...] he said frigidly.

5000|$|<b>Unlike</b> [...] "Do <b>You</b> Love Me", {{which had}} been (allegedly) {{originally}} intended for The Temptations, Shake Sherry was written specifically for The Contours, one of several songs Gordy composed for the group.|$|R
5000|$|In the 10 November 1984 {{issue of}} Number One magazine, Deanne Pearson {{reviewed}} the album, writing: [...] "If you want genuine, heartfelt love songs, cries of passion without cliche, {{look no further}} than Alf. With a heart as big as her voice, Alison Moyet is one of the singer/songwriters of the '80s. Commercial but uncontrived. <b>Unlike</b> Wham, <b>you</b> don't feel you're being taken for a ride." ...|$|R
40|$|To {{the youth}} of this country I have a message. You have a {{wonderful}} future ahead of <b>you.</b> <b>Unlike</b> us, <b>you</b> have a country free from any domination. You grow up with your heads held high as masters in your own country. As masters you have the privileges {{as well as your}} duties and responsibilities. The future of this country rests on you: whether our star rises or falls, it will be due to you solely. Therefore, be ready to serve her, to build her up and to give your life in her defence. You and I must be determined to make Malaya a place which we shall all be proud to call home. We have therefore a role to play and let us play it well. —Tunku Abdul Rahma...|$|R

Now, is it not unjust, and <b>unlike</b> <b>you,</b> to judge him from what you saw of me the other night?' ...|$|E
60|$|Like you, I {{was shocked}} when this new {{discovery}} burst upon me on Friday, though, <b>unlike</b> <b>you,</b> I never could believe in ----, solely (I think) because, often as I have tried him, I never found him standing by my desk when I was writing a letter without trying to read it.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I ride in {{this fashion}} we are really not very <b>unlike,</b> <b>you</b> see, and I let one or two men I met {{get a good look}} at me," [...] he said. [...] "I meant it as a hint that it would be wise of you to come to terms with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{the world}} {{thinks that he}} was guilty. And then {{he is such a}} man:--so singular, so <b>unlike</b> anybody else! <b>You</b> know, papa, that I don't think very much of money, merely as money." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} abhorred {{by both the}} music critics and the public alike. Actress Sissy Spacek, using the {{pseudonym}} Rainbo, recorded the song [...] "John, You Went Too Far This Time" [...] {{in response to the}} album's cover. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic remarked that it was [...] "not <b>unlike</b> what <b>you</b> might get if you turned on a tape recorder for a random half-hour in your home", calling the music [...] "naked".|$|R
6000|$|... "How queer, how strange, how <b>unlike</b> {{other people}} <b>you</b> are, Katharine," [...] Cassandra said, {{her whole body}} and voice seeming to fall and {{collapse}} together, and no trace of anger or excitement remaining, but only a dreamy quietude.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>you</b> {{gentlemen of}} the profession, I think the soliloquy in Hamlet commencing [...] "Oh, my offence is rank," [...] surpasses that commencing [...] "To be or not to be." [...] But pardon this small attempt at criticism. I should like to hear you {{pronounce}} the opening speech of Richard III. Will you not soon visit Washington again? If you do, please call and let me make your personal acquaintance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't say so, ma'am." [...] There was a tartness in {{his tone}} evoked by the tartness she had used. [...] "If you would do me the honour to listen, you would not misapprehend me. For if <b>unlike</b> <b>you</b> I do not always say {{precisely}} what I think, at least I say precisely what I wish to convey. To be ungrateful may be human; but to display it is childish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are a good}} girl;" [...] he replied, [...] "and I {{have great}} {{pleasure}} in thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your doing very well together. Your tempers {{are by no means}} <b>unlike.</b> <b>You</b> are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will always exceed your income." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does look}} a little like it, sir," [...] he replied, with some caution, [...] "but it also looks not <b>unlike</b> a water-course. <b>You</b> see {{it is a little}} wet just hereabouts. Isn't it? What think you, Isaac Martin?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{might as}} well try to flirt with a statue!" [...] she declared, discontentedly. [...] "What makes <b>you</b> so <b>unlike</b> other people, <b>you</b> man of granite? You used to kiss me very clumsily when I asked you to, and now--why, how hot your hand is!" ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Unlike</b> regular backgammon, <b>you</b> {{may only}} bear off pieces that exactly match the dice roll. For instance, if the 6 and 5 points {{are open and}} you roll a 6-5, you may not use that roll to bear off a checker from the 4-point.|$|R
