[...] Lead actress Kristen Bell expressed surprise over the initial decision by saying, [...] "I love working with Jason and he's such a great actor to work opposite, but sometimes, I feel it's really just weird luck.

Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role. Snyder stated, [...] "Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, {{but one of the}} most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role." [...] When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, [...] "The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense." [...] Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp's original take on Zod, [...] "To follow Terence Stamp's iconic performance in the original, it is daunting, but I just focused on one day at a time. It's interesting that when we started with this, we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit.</b> It is a very physical movie at the end of the day.

According {{to the person who}} called in, the concept of the commercial was to place ducks on a hot plate, so they would jump about. Other listeners called in the radio show to blast the ad agency, and the SPCA lodged a police report. When it was discovered that 'dancing ducks' was a hoax, the press went to town saying that Patrick was being irresponsible, and some even called for his resignation.

However, in the Zippo 200 at The Glen, Ambrose won his third straight Watkins Glen he held off Joey Logano and Kevin Harvick to win. Since the win, he started to gain some form, recording a top 10 at Atlanta and a top 5 at Richmond. At the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Sonoma, Ambrose led 35 laps, and held a ten-second lead over Jimmie Johnson. His lead got erased by a caution on lap 104. During the caution, Ambrose turned off his car's engine to conserve fuel, {{but was unable to}} restart it. As a result, Ambrose attempted to return to his spot, but was forced to fall to seventh on the restart due to not maintaining a particular speed during the caution, and finished sixth. After the race, Ambrose stated, [...] "I was leading the race and had trouble getting the motor cranked back <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> there, and NASCAR made the call.

2500|$|Milo Goes to College {{is cited}} {{as one of}} the most {{significant}} albums of the early-1980s southern California hardcore punk movement. Steven Blush, author of , remarked that its [...] "cheeky love songs disguised as hardcore blasts became the most aped formula in rock." [...] Rock critic Robert Christgau gave it an A- rating, saying [...] "These fishermen don't kid around about what powers hardcore hyperdrive—not simply an unjust society, but also a battered psyche. When they're feeling bad, any kind of power—money, age, ass-man cool, the possession of a vagina—can set off their anarchic, patricidal, 'homo'-baiting, gynephobic rage. But their bad feelings add poignant weight to the doomed vulnerability of the last four songs, which happen to be their hookiest". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called the album [...] "Perfect for the little guy who was ever called a nerd and never got the girl. The chainsaw pop combined with earthy humor conveys what is often an inarticulate rage." [...] Hilburn's review was especially affirming for Stevenson, whose father criticized and discouraged his songwriting: [...] "Robert Hillburn was saying something different. He was saying that I can write okay, that I'm a decent songwriter. So it served to shut my dad <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> so that I could pursue the band thing a little less encumbered by his stifling attitude." ...|$|E

The track opens with a [...] "rotating piano riff" [...] while during the verses and choruses Lewis' vocals are joined by a strings orchestra, all of which critics noted while pointing to the strong gospel influences. [...] "I to You" [...] is another song written by Sandé and produced by Loco. It is driven by a string instrument-led melody, which was performed by the orchestral collective Wired Strings and arranged by Rosie Danvers. [...] "Shake You Up," [...] was noted by critics as a [...] "modern remake" [...] of an 80's pop song with strong elements of bubblegum pop. It was written by Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins and British singer-songwriter Olivia Waithe (also known as Livvi Franc). Critics noted that [...] "Shake You Up" [...] starts with a vocal interlude from Lewis, who asks [...] "Can you turn the music <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> please?" [...] The production, helmed by Darkchild, uses synths and a midtempo [...] "80's pop" [...] melody. Critics compared it to the early work of the late American entertainer Whitney Houston. [...] "Stop the Clocks" [...] returns to the electronic production present on much of the album, but according to critics it was a [...] "lighter instrumental production" [...] {{that could have been}} taken from Lewis' last album Echo (2009).|$|E

I knew that I had to drive a perfect race, every corner we had to drive perfect. I think we did a great job." [...] Third-place finisher di Grassi praised the track and the race weekend but acknowledged his team did not have the pace to stay with both Mahindra cars. However, he spoke of his enjoyment with his battle against Vergne and claimed his car was quicker in the second race: [...] "Yesterday we found some pace, which meant we could keep <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> with these guys, but we need to improve.

He soon has to go to Dan's parole and speak up in order to have him stay locked up. He decides to have Nathan as his best man and then fuses his bachelor party with Lindsey's. He also gives Haley his new book, and she tells him not to marry Lindsey after reading it. Lucas proceeds with the wedding, but Lindsey stops him after realizing his book is about Peyton. She leaves him, and when he chases after her, he sees Lindsey's bags packed. After a confrontation, she leaves him, saying, [...] "People always leave, Luke. You know that."

Andy convinces Lucas to go after Lindsey, prompting him to go to her and tell her that one day she will come back to him. She comes back to Tree Hill for Jamie's 5th birthday, but tells Lucas that it was really over. He then helps Brooke cope with having baby Angie around. After Lindsey calls him to tell him she is seeing someone, he blows up after an opposing player gets away with attempting to injure Quentin Fields, drawing himself a 10-game suspension. He becomes heavily drunk and tells Peyton he hates her when she comes to his help. He later apologizes to her after being confronted by Haley. He tells her that it was hard to let her go, hard to see her and that it remains difficult for him, making apparent his love for Peyton.
