5|$|When the Sultan {{appeared}} before the Fortress he saw the walls hung with red cloth, as though for a festive reception, and a single great cannon thundered once to greet the mighty warrior monarch. The siege began on 6 August when Suleiman ordered a general assault on the ramparts, although the attack was successfully repulsed. Despite being <b>undermanned,</b> and greatly outnumbered, the defenders were sent no reinforcements from Vienna by the imperial army.|$|E
5|$|With the Byzantine {{forces at}} the Persian front having already {{suffered}} heavy casualties in previous confrontations, Domentziolus {{was unable to}} oppose the Sassanid raids during 605. There was also little chance of further reinforcements. Phocas had concluded peace treaties with the Lombards and Avars {{in an attempt to}} secure control of his provinces in the Italian Peninsula and the Balkans. He had already stripped the Balkans of most of their military forces, reassigning them to the Persian front. But this policy had backfired with the <b>undermanned</b> Balkans facing a Slavic invasion, notably endangering Thessalonica.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, the {{division}} remained on mainland Japan. It occupied Kyūshū from 1945 until 1950. During this time, the US Army shrank. At the end of World War II it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, the 24th Infantry Division was one of only 10 active divisions in the force. It was one of four understrength divisions on occupation duty in Japan. The others were the 1st Cavalry Division, 7th Infantry Division, and 25th Infantry Division, all under control of the Eighth United States Army. The 24th Division retained the 19th, 21st, and 34th regiments, but the formations were <b>undermanned</b> and ill-equipped due to the post-war drawdown and reduction in military spending.|$|E
5|$|He was {{transferred}} to command of the 177th (2/1st Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade, part of the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division in January 1916. The 59th was a second-line Territorial Force division, formed from those Territorials and new volunteers who had not volunteered for overseas service. As a result, it was generally <b>undermanned</b> and underequipped, with priority given to equipping its first-line counterpart, and tasked mostly with home defence duties. The 177th Brigade had been formed as the duplicate of the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade, with two second-line battalions of the Lincolnshire Regiment {{and two of the}} Leicestershire Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In spring 1392, Jogaila {{proposed}} a compromise through his envoy, Henry of Masovia, Bishop of Płock: Vytautas {{would become the}} Grand Duke of Lithuania if he would recognize Jogaila as the Supreme Duke. By summer, Vytautas had secured the release {{of many of the}} hostages he had given to the Knights, and accepted the offer. Since this agreement with Jogaila was reached in secret, the Knights suspected nothing when Vytautas invited them to the festivities at his headquarters, the Ritterswerder Castle on an island in the Neman River. Most of the prominent guests were taken prisoner and Vytautas' army proceeded to attack and destroy the <b>undermanned</b> wooden castles of Ritterswerder, Metenburg, and Neugarten (New Hrodna) near Hrodna.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after this, however, Chinese infiltrators began {{appearing}} {{regularly in the}} <b>undermanned</b> 2nd Company's area, and by 15 May, Queen discovered the Chinese were moving in force to Hill 581, several miles from their position, from which the Chinese could fortify and attack Hill 258. Queen led the platoon on a sneak attack of the Chinese force on 17 May, covered by 7th Division artillery fire. At 15:00, they engaged the surprised Chinese, conducting a double envelopment supported by continued artillery fire. By 17:00, the Rangers secured Hill 581 from the Chinese, who suffered 50 killed and 90 wounded in the attack.|$|E
5|$|In January 1801, in {{an attempt}} to {{increase}} the size of the French Mediterranean Fleet and to reinforce the beleaguered Egyptian garrison, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte ordered a squadron of seven ships of the line to sail from Brest on the Atlantic coast to the Mediterranean under Rear-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume. The squadron made three unsuccessful attempts to reach Egypt, eventually retiring to Toulon in late July 1801. During the final effort, Ganteaume's squadron sailed from Toulon on 27 April 1801 with instructions to briefly secure local naval supremacy around Elba to allow a seabourne invasion to go ahead, before travelling on into the Eastern Mediterranean. During these operations, Ganteaume discovered that several ships in his force were dangerously <b>undermanned,</b> and therefore decided to consolidate his crews and send three ships of the line, Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, and the frigate Créole back to Toulon.|$|E
5|$|In orbit, the <b>undermanned</b> Enterprise is {{attacked}} and disabled by Kruge. In the standoff that follows, Kruge orders {{that one of}} the hostages on the surface be executed. Marcus is killed defending Saavik and Spock. Kirk and company feign surrender and activate the Enterprises self-destruct sequence, killing the Klingon boarding party while the Enterprise crew transports to the planet's surface. Promising the secret of Genesis, Kirk lures Kruge to the planet and has him beam his crew to the Klingon vessel. As the Genesis planet disintegrates, Kirk and Kruge engage in a fistfight; Kirk emerges victorious after kicking Kruge off a cliff into a lava flow. Kirk and his officers take control of the Klingon ship and head to Vulcan.|$|E
5|$|North Korean forces, meanwhile, flanked the American {{positions}} {{under cover}} of fog. The Koreans passed around the Americans' right flank and attacked the mortar positions in the rear. T-34 tanks also joined in the fight, and also passed around the American flanks while obscured by the fog. Around 0900 the North Korean forces in Chonui initiated a frontal assault on the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry's positions. An observer with the unit called in artillery and pushed back the North Korean infantry inflicting heavy casualties on the assaulting force. By 1100, the North Korean infantry, supported by several T-34s, was pressing on A Company's position, which was <b>undermanned.</b> At 1125 the requested airstrike came in; American aircraft rocketed the T-34s to no effect while strafing the Korean forces attacking A Company. The aircraft were able to push back the attack for several minutes before running out of ammunition and being forced to leave. The North Korean troops immediately resumed their assault.|$|E
5|$|On 20 April, his 56thbirthday, Hitler {{made his}} last trip from the Führerbunker (Führer's shelter) to the surface. In the ruined {{garden of the}} Reich Chancellery, he awarded Iron Crosses to boy {{soldiers}} of the Hitler Youth, who were now fighting the Red Army at the front near Berlin. By 21 April, Georgy Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici's Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced {{to the outskirts of}} Berlin. In denial about the dire situation, Hitler placed his hopes on the <b>undermanned</b> and under-equipped Armeeabteilung Steiner (Army Detachment Steiner), commanded by Waffen SS General Felix Steiner. Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient, while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} {{cut across}} the Elle River and advanced slowly toward Saint-Lô, fighting bitterly in the Normandy hedge rows. German reserves formed a new defensive front outside the town, and American forces fought a fierce battle with them two miles outside of the town. German forces used the dense bocage foliage to their advantage, mounting fierce resistance in house-to-house fighting in the ravaged Saint-Lô. By {{the end of the}} fight, the Germans were relying on artillery support to hold the town following the depletion of the infantry contingent. The 29th Division, which was already <b>undermanned</b> after heavy casualties on D-Day, was even further depleted in the intense fighting for Saint-Lô. Eventually, the 29th was able to capture the city in a direct assault, supported by airstrikes from P-47 Thunderbolts.|$|E
5|$|Their goal in Laos {{seemingly}} achieved, President Thieu and General Lãm {{ordered a}} withdrawal of ARVN forces beginning on 9 March {{that was to}} continue {{through the rest of}} the month, destroying Base Area 604 and any supplies discovered in their path. General Abrams implored Thieu to reinforce the troops in Laos and that they keep disrupting the area until the beginning of the rainy season. The battle was shifting to Hanoi's advantage. Anti-aircraft fire remained devastating and the PAVN had no trouble resupplying or reinforcing their troops in the battle area. As soon as it became evident that ARVN forces had begun a withdrawal, the PAVN increased its efforts to destroy these force before they could reach South Vietnam. Anti-aircraft fire was increased to halt or slow helicopter resupply or evacuation efforts, the <b>undermanned</b> firebases were attacked, and ARVN ground forces had to run a gauntlet of ambushes along Route 9.|$|E
5|$|With the Seleucid treaty concluded, Philip's army {{attacked}} Ptolemy's territories in Thrace. Upon {{hearing that}} the King of Pergamum, Attalus I, had joined the Rhodian alliance, Philip became enraged and invaded Pergamese territory. However, before having set out to campaign against Philip's navy in the Aegean Sea, Attalus had strengthened the city walls of his capital. By taking this and other precautions, he hoped to prevent Philip from a seizing {{a large amount of}} booty from his territory. Seeing that the city was <b>undermanned,</b> he sent his skirmishers against it, but they were easily repelled. Judging that the city walls were too strong, Philip retreated after destroying a few temples, including the temple of Aphrodite and the sanctuary of Athena Nicephorus. After the Macedonians captured Thyatira, they advanced to plunder the plain of Thebe, but the booty proved less fruitful than anticipated. Once he arrived at Thebe, he demanded supplies from the Seleucid governor of the region, Zeuxis. Zeuxis, however, never planned to give Philip substantial supplies.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, the Army {{developed}} the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH) concept from {{experiences in the}} European Theater. The US Army sought a highly mobile hospital unit which could be {{as close to the}} fighting as possible to increase the survival rate of casualties. These 60-bed, 124-man units would act as mobile hospitals for the treatment of wounded. By the beginning of the hostilities in Korea, all MASH units were <b>undermanned</b> and the difficult terrain in Korea prevented easy transport, making it very difficult for the MASH units to operate in the Pusan Perimeter battle. The 8055th MASH was the first such unit to arrive in Korea, being assigned to the 24th Infantry Division on July 9. Two more hospitals, the 8063rd and 8067th, would join the UN forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting. The MASH units were routinely overwhelmed with patients due to shortages of transport, often receiving between 150 and 200 per day, although sometimes the number was high as 400. The units operated on men that were too critical to be transported. Those who could be moved or could not be treated in the MASH were taken by air or sea to US Army hospitals in Japan depending on the severity of their injuries.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse had {{detached}} {{a few of}} his {{ships to}} blockade the York and James Rivers farther up the bay, and many of the ships at anchor were missing officers, men, and boats when the British fleet was sighted. He faced the difficult proposition of organizing a line of battle while sailing against an incoming tide, with winds and land features that would require him to do so on a tack opposite that of the British fleet. At 11:30 am, 24 ships of the French fleet cut their anchor lines and began sailing out of the bay with the noon tide, leaving behind the shore contingents and ships' boats. Some ships were so seriously <b>undermanned,</b> missing as many as 200 men, that not all of their guns could be manned. De Grasse had ordered the ships to form into a line as they exited the bay, in order of speed and without regard to its normal sailing order. Admiral Louis de Bougainville's Auguste {{was one of the first}} ships out. With a squadron of three other ships Bougainville ended up well ahead of the rest of the French line; by 3:45 pm the gap was large enough that the British could have cut his squadron off from the rest of the French fleet.|$|E
5|$|Fort 56 {{consisted}} of three wings, each surrounded by its own earthwork, stockades and a moat. Partially obscured by the trees of Brühl's Garden, the central wing was further reinforced by the St. Laurence's Church and the surrounding monastery. The fort, commanded by General Józef Sowiński, was manned by two battalions of the 8th Regiment of Line Infantry (1,200 men), with 40 sappers, 13 cannon, two Congreve rocket launchers, and a small detachment from the 14th Regiment of Line Infantry (170 men). Directly in front of it, on a hill overlooking the battlefield, lay the smaller, irregularly-shaped Fort 57 manned by 300 men under Maj. Józef Krassowski, armed with four pieces of artillery and two Congreve rocket launchers. To the north lay Fort 59 (four cannon and 400 men under Maj. Józef Borzęcki), while to the south Fort 54 (up to 350 men under Maj. Ignacy Dobrzelewski and six guns under Lt. Julian Konstanty Ordon). Even though the remaining forts of Wola (Forts 55, 58, 60 and 61) were deprived of their garrisons to strengthen the defence, the most important Polish positions were still severely <b>undermanned.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March 1896, the Matabele again rose {{up against}} the British South Africa Company {{administration}} in what became called the Second Matabele War or the First Chimurenga (liberation war). Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger {{that led to this}} confrontation. The colonists' defenses in Matabeleland were <b>undermanned</b> due to the ill-fated Jameson Raid into the South African Republic (or Transvaal), and in {{the first few months of}} the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Selous. The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols. It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds, Burnham and Baden-Powell, would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for the program and the code of honor for the Boy Scouts.|$|E
5|$|One of the British {{reinforcements}} cruising in the Central Mediterranean in June was the frigate , {{commanded by}} Captain Edward Foote. Seahorse was officially rated as a 38-gun ship, {{but in reality}} carried 46 guns, including 14 32-pounder carronades, very heavy short-range cannon. Foote had been despatched by Earl St. Vincent to join Nelson's squadron in his hunt for the French and carried on board a number of reinforcements for , one of Nelson's ships commanded by Captain Thomas Troubridge. On 26 June 1798, Seahorse was passing along the southern Sicilian coast in search {{of information about the}} whereabouts of the British fleet when at 16:00 his lookout sighted a ship. Advancing rapidly, Foote recognised the stranger as a French frigate and prepared for battle. The frigate was Sensible, which was on a northeasterly course from Malta to Toulon when sighted. Bourdé, knowing that his ship was overladen, <b>undermanned</b> and carried only 36 guns, some of which were only 6-pounders, turned away and sailed south, hoping to outrun his opponent during the night.|$|E
5|$|Plaman Mapu {{was a tiny}} Malaysian village {{only half}} a mile behind {{the western part of}} the border between Sarawak and Kalimantan. There the British had {{established}} a base for 'B' Company of the Parachute Regiment. Apart from the two 3-inch mortars stationed there, the place had little strategic value beyond being a lookout point for the British to detect Indonesian raids over the border. By the low standards of the makeshift British jungle bases, it was fairly well defended, equipped with aforementioned mortars, an interconnected trench network, and a command bunker, with supporting artillery weapons within range of the base to supply cover. The defenders of the base, by contrast, were wholly unprepared for combat. The <b>undermanned</b> 'B' Company had recently been supplied with a platoon of inexperienced troopers who had pitiful experience in jungle warfare. Due to the intensity of recent fighting, the base commander, Lieutenant Colonel Ted Eberhardie, had only been able to spare a few of the new men for a training course in such combat at Singapore, but one of those was Sergeant Major John Williams, who would play a crucial role in the coming battle.|$|E
5|$|The English {{plan for}} 1673 centred on first {{achieving}} naval dominance, followed by landing an army in Zeeland. The King appointed the Duke as supreme commander, with Rupert as his deputy, combining {{the rank of}} General and Vice Admiral of England. During the winter of 1672, however, Charles—still (legitimately) childless—decided that the risk to the Duke, his heir, was too great and made Rupert supreme Allied commander in his place. Rupert began the 1673 campaign against the Dutch knowing the logistical support for his fleet remained uncertain, with many ships <b>undermanned.</b> The result was the Battle of Schooneveld in June and the Battle of Texel in August, a controversial sequence of engagements in which, at a minimum, poor communications between the French and English commanders assisted the marginal Dutch victory. Many English commentators were harsher, blaming the French for failing to fully engage in the battles and Rupert—having cautioned against the alliance in the first place—was popularly hailed as a hero. Rupert finally retired from active seagoing command later that year.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1799 the Bay of Bengal was largely undefended. The British naval commander, Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier, had taken most of his ships westwards to the Red Sea to {{participate}} in opposition to Napoleon Bonaparte's campaign in Egypt, leaving only a single frigate to protect trade shipping in the region. This ship was the 40-gun HMS Sybille, a large, powerful ship captured from the French at the Battle of Mykonos in 1794. Weighing more than 1,000 tons bm and with a maindeck battery of 28 18-pounder long guns supplemented by six 9-pounder long guns and fourteen 32-pounder cannonades, Sybille was a formidable ship, but significantly weaker than the massive Forte. Many of Sybilles crew had fallen ill while the ship had been stationed at Calcutta, leaving her <b>undermanned.</b> To compensate, the crew had been augmented by a detachment from the frigate HMS Fox and soldiers from the Scotch Brigade. In command was Captain Edward Cooke, who had distinguished himself early in the war by negotiating the surrender of the French Mediterranean port city of Toulon in 1793. This action, under threat of execution by the Republican faction in the city, led to the Siege of Toulon {{and the destruction of}} almost half of the French Mediterranean Fleet. In January 1798 Cooke and Sybille had participated in the successful Raid on Manila.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} heavy rain squalls reduced {{visibility}} and prevented any decisive movement by either side, but on 25 January the French squadron had rounded St. Nicholas Point at the northwestern tip of Java {{and was in}} full pursuit of Canning's ships, which had been joined by Houghton. Resolu in particular was struggling to escape the advancing enemy, but Mitchell had realised the danger and was sailing to intercept the French. At 06:30 Houghton, Nonsuch and Vengeur joined with the remainder of Mitchell's force and two hours later Renaud's ships met the British line, Resolu just managing to reach safety in {{the shelter of the}} large East Indiamen despite being hit repeatedly in the latter stages of the chase. For an hour the two squadrons continued a general exchange of fire at long-range, before Mitchell turned William Pitt, Houghton and Nonsuch towards the French at 09:30, the latter two both managing to hit Cybèle with destructive broadsides. Firing continued for another 18 minutes as Renaud withdrew, eventually anchoring off the island of Pulau Baby. Neither commander was keen to continue the action, Mitchell fearing that his <b>undermanned</b> ships {{would not be able to}} properly engage the better armed French vessels. Casualties among the French squadron are not known, but the only loss on the British ships was on Nonsuch, which had a man killed in combat with Cybèle.|$|E
5|$|When news reached Bonaparte that Ganteaume had {{returned}} to Toulon for a second time, he once again issued orders for the admiral {{to go to sea}} and fulfill his original orders to resupply the Egyptian garrison. On 27 April, the French force sailed for the third time, with seven ships of the line, two frigates, a corvette and two storeships. Before sailing to Egypt Ganteaume first cruised off Elba in the Ligurian Sea, achieving regional superiority long enough that a force was able to cross to the island from Piombino, rapidly subduing all but the fortress of Porto Ferrajo, which was besieged. Ganteaume's ships bombarded the fortress on 6 May, but an outbreak of typhus in the squadron significantly reduced its operational effectiveness. Ganteaume therefore divided his force, taking four ships with healthy crews south, while Formidable, Indomptable and Desaix, and the frigate Créole were all too <b>undermanned</b> to perform efficiently, and were sent back to Toulon. Having reorganised his force, Ganteaume passed through the Straits of Messina on 25 May. On 5 June off Brindisi, the squadron sighted and chased the British frigate HMS Pique under Captain James Young, which was able to effect an escape to Alexandria and warn Keith of Ganteaume's approach. A planned rendezvous off Brindisi with three Neapolitan frigates did not occur, and by 7 June the squadron was close enough to Egypt for Ganteaume to send his corvette Héliopolis to investigate the situation at Alexandria.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the governor, both {{among his}} contemporaries and later historians, {{have claimed that}} had he sailed {{directly}} to the Moluccas rather than to Malacca, he very possibly could have dislodged the <b>undermanned</b> Dutch from the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Wavell {{once again}} {{had the misfortune}} of being placed in charge of an <b>undermanned</b> theatre which became a war zone when the Japanese {{declared}} war on the United Kingdom in December 1941. He was made Commander-in-Chief of ABDACOM (American-British-Dutch-Australian Command).|$|E
25|$|Being a {{very old}} ship the <b>undermanned</b> Royal Norwegian Navy in exile did not use Heimdal for any {{operational}} duties and put her {{to use as a}} headquarters ships, and as a depot ship for Rosyth Command. She served alongside the fellow Norwegian ship Ranen at Port Edgar in the latter function, until being deactivated and laid up at Burntisland, Scotland on 29 October 1943.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, Rostislav led a {{large portion}} of his troops off to Bohemia in order to assist his {{father-in-law}} against King Ottokar II of Bohemia. Thus his Vidin province became <b>undermanned,</b> and the situation was ideal for Tsar Constantine Tikh who attacked the token forces left behind in Vidin and regained not only the city but the whole province to the borders of the province of Braničevo.|$|E
25|$|Despite all the changes, the Mavs {{remained}} in contention. However, their season effectively ended when James Donaldson {{went down with}} a ruptured patella tendon on March 10, 1989 and missed {{the rest of the}} season as a result. The Mavericks were left <b>undermanned,</b> demoralized and disheartened as they finished with a 38–44 record. It was their first losing season since 1982–83—which was also the last time they missed the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the Civil War, John L. Gardner was in command at Fort Moultrie. With secession growing more imminent, Gardner had made several {{requests}} to Secretary of War John B. Floyd for more troops to garrison and defend the <b>undermanned</b> fortress. Each time his requests were ignored, as Floyd (who joined the Confederacy) was planning to hand the forts in Charleston Harbor over to the secessionists.|$|E
25|$|The army {{consists}} of some 6,000men in voluntary service, augmented by a part-time national People's Militia composed of civilians between 25 and 35years of age {{who are trained}} in both military and civil duties. According to Jane’s Sentinel Country Risk Assessment, Burkina Faso's Army is <b>undermanned</b> for its force structure and poorly equipped, but has wheeled light-armour vehicles, and may have developed useful combat expertise through interventions in Liberia and elsewhere in Africa.|$|E
25|$|After {{the raid}} there were worries in April about the still very badly <b>undermanned</b> west coast and Chief of Staff George Marshall {{discussed}} a possible {{attack by the}} Japanese upon our plants in San Diego and then a flight by those Japs down into Mexico after they have made their attack. So Secretary Stimson asked State to touch base with their people south of the border, and Marshall flew to the West Coast on 22 May.|$|E
25|$|Hasdrubal's army scouts {{detected}} the approaching Roman fleet before the Punic navy and warned their fleet {{of the coming}} danger through fire signals. Most of the crews had been foraging, and they hastily had to man their ships and sail out in a disorderly manner. There was little coordination and some ships were <b>undermanned</b> because of the surprise achieved by the Romans. As Himilco sailed out, Hasdrubal drew up his army on the shore to give encouragement to his fleet.|$|E
25|$|The Eóganacht Chaisil {{under the}} MacCarthys would later form {{the much more}} militarily capable but <b>undermanned</b> Kingdom of Desmond. The O'Sullivans, the eldest of the Eóganacht Chaisil, were the most {{powerful}} lords under them. The O'Keeffes of Eóganacht Glendamnach would later produce many great soldiers for Irish and Continental armies. The O'Callaghans were a smaller sept who have distinguished themselves in recent times, while the MacAuliffes and MacGillycuddys are, as stated, simply septs of the MacCarthys and O'Sullivans. The O'Kirbys of Eóganacht Áine were ruined by the Norman Invasion of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps in {{response}} to Hamilcar's raids, Rome built another fleet (paid for with donations from wealthy citizens). It was this fleet that rendered the Carthaginian success in Sicily futile, as the stalemate Hamilcar produced in Sicily became irrelevant following the Roman naval victory at the Battle of the Aegates Islands in 241 BC, where the new Roman fleet under consul Gaius Lutatius Catulus was victorious over an <b>undermanned</b> and hastily built Carthaginian fleet. Carthage lost most of its fleet and was economically incapable of funding another, or of finding manpower for the crews.|$|E
25|$|Fearing another raid, {{and with}} the Spanish {{settlements}} on the American West coast being overstretched, <b>undermanned</b> and underarmed; a crisis followed. Menéndez even conferred with the Council of the Indies in Seville (who received confirmation of St. Augustine's destruction by July) and Philip II, that all concentration should be {{in one place and}} that being at St. Augustine. Mendendez despite objections got his way and as a result Parris Island and Santa Elena were abandoned. This marked the end of the permanent Spanish presence in what today is South Carolina.|$|E
25|$|At one point, Belgica almost rammed the Belgian Royal Yacht. Rio de Janeiro, Brazil {{was reached}} on 6 October 1897. Frederick Cook joined the ship there. On {{reaching}} Montevideo, Uruguay, the cook was sacked and a Swedish replacement was hired. On the voyage between Montevideo and Punta Arenas, Chile, the engineer allowed the boiler to run dry. He was dismissed {{when the ship}} reached Punta Arenas, which was on 1 December 1897. Further disciplinary problems at Punta Arenas resulting in the Chilean Navy being asked to intervene. The Swedish cook and three Belgian sailors were dismissed, and Belgica departed for the Antarctic somewhat <b>undermanned.</b>|$|E
