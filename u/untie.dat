Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive into the ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. After a comical 147 dates, Gru and Lucy get married, and Margo, Edith and Agnes finally have someone close to a mother.|$|E
5|$|Black {{struggles to}} find {{anything}} useful while investigating the abduction. However, he begins to experience seemingly-psychic visions which lead him to believe she {{is being held in}} their former home. The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is able to track down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a rafter. He goes to <b>untie</b> her but is blinded by a camera flash. He struggles with the Polaroid Man, which we see through a series of photographs taken by the man's camera. Black is able to wrest the Polaroid Man's knife away from him and stab him to death.|$|E
5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's bedroom, where {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to <b>untie</b> him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

25|$|Odysseus {{was curious}} {{as to what the}} Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of Circe, he had all of his sailors plug their ears with beeswax and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he heard their {{beautiful}} song, he ordered the sailors to <b>untie</b> him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released. Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.|$|E

The report concludes that there is much scope for further actions towards <b>untying</b> aid in genuine partnerships between donors and aid recipients.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} acts was the reform regarding the central administration of the State, with which Crispi wished to strengthen the role of head of government. The bill aimed to separate the roles of the government from those of parliament, trying to <b>untie</b> the first by the political games of the second. The first point of the law was to give the cabinet the right to decide on the number and functions of the ministries. The prospect was also to keep the King (as well as provided the Albertine Statute) free to decide on the organization of the various ministries. Moreover the reform provided the establishment of the secretaries, who were supposed to help ministers and, at the same time, do them as spokesmen in parliament.|$|E
25|$|A family story {{initially}} recounts {{an actual}} historical event concerning named family members. Seasoned {{with time and}} re-telling, the story gets revised and honed to express specific values and character traits valued in the family. Instead of historical accuracies, the narration becomes a medium to re-state and re-enforce shared values of the family group. These stories generally {{take the form of}} an anecdote and follow the pattern of many common traditional tales. A favorite family story involves how the parents met, or how they decided on the one true partner among several. In one family, if the story is to be believed, the prospective bride had to <b>untie</b> all the knots in the string to demonstrate her care and diligence. Another family tells how the young couple got stuck {{at the top of a}} Ferris wheel when he proposed, and she had to either say yes or jump. Given time and repetition, the anecdotes serve to shape the family story as a whole, populating it with real individuals and historical events made personal. In their transmission, these stories serve to codify the norms of behavior within the family.|$|E

Kirby is forced to answer horror movie trivia to save Charlie, who is tied up outside. Sidney goes upstairs to find Jill, {{promising}} to return to Kirby. After Kirby answers Ghostface's questions, she goes outside to <b>untie</b> Charlie, believing that she has won the game. He suddenly stabs her in the stomach and reveals himself as Ghostface, before leaving her for dead. Sidney is confronted by Charlie and a second Ghostface, who is revealed as Jill. Jill explains that her motive was out of jealousy because of the attention Sidney got for surviving the murders, and that they intend to frame Trevor as Ghostface; she then pulls Trevor out of a closet and shoots him in the head. Jill then betrays Charlie and kills him, too, to pin him as Trevor's accomplice and to make herself the sole survivor. Jill stabs Sidney in the stomach and mutilates herself {{to make it seem}} as if Trevor attacked her. Later, Dewey, Judy, {{and the rest of the}} police stumble upon the carnage.|$|E
40|$|Evaluate the biomechanical {{behavior}} of four variants of the transosseous-equivalent/suture bridge (TOE/SB) repair. Four suture bridge (SB) constructs were created using 24 sheep infraspinatus tendon-humerus constructs (n = 6 per technique). The groups were (1) Knotted Standard Suture Bridge (Standard SB) -suture bridge with two medial mattress stitches, (2) Knotted Double Suture Bridge (Double SB) -four medial mattress stitches, (3) <b>Untied</b> Suture Bridge with Medial FT Anchors (<b>Untied</b> SB with FT) -two medial mattress stitches without knots, and (4) <b>Untied</b> Suture Bridge with PushLocks (<b>Untied</b> SB with Pushlocks) -two medial mattress stitches without knots. The contact area footprint {{was measured with}} an electronic pressure film prior to dynamic mechanical testing for gapping and testing to failure. The Double SB produced the greatest contact area footprint {{compared to the other}} techniques, which did not differ. The Double SB repair with a mean failure load of 456. 9 N was significantly stronger than the <b>Untied</b> SB with Pushlocks repair at 300 N (P = 0. 023), the standard SB repair at 295 N (P = 0. 019), and lastly the <b>Untied</b> SB with FT repair at 284 N (P = 0. 011). No differences were detected between the two mattress stitch standard SB repair with knots and the knotless two mattress stitch repairs (<b>Untied</b> SB with FT and <b>Untied</b> SB with Pushlocks). Gaps developed during cyclic loading in all repairs apart from the Double SB repair. The transosseous-equivalent/suture bridge repair with 4 stitches tied in the medial row and maximal lateral suture strand utilization (Double SB) outperformed all other repairs in terms of failure load, tendon-bone contact, and gapping characteristics. The presence of knots in the medial row did not change tendon fixation with respect to failure load, contact area or gapping characteristics. 6 page(s...|$|R

500|$|Throughout {{his early}} career Etty was highly {{regarded}} by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, {{who had been}} educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings.

In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses ("Odysseus" [...] in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to <b>untie</b> him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.|$|E

A {{statue of the}} so-called Venus in a bikini {{was found in a}} cupboard in the southwest corner in Casa della Venere, others were found in the front hall. A statue of the so-called Venus was recovered from the tablinum of the house of Julia Felix, and another from an atrium in the garden at Via Dell'Abbondanza.

The museum's exhibits include female statues wearing see-through gold lamé brassiere, basque and knickers. The Kings of Naples discovered these Pompeii artifacts, including the one meter tall, almost unclothed statue of Venus painted in gold leaf with something like a modern bikini. They found them so shocking that for long periods the secret chamber was opened only to [...] "mature persons of secure morals". Even after the doors were opened, only 20 visitors were to be admitted at a time, and children under 12 were not allowed into the new part of the museum without their parents' or a teacher's permission.|$|E
