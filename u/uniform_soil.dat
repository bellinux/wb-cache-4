40|$|The limit {{analysis}} and the {{finite element method}} are powerful tools for analysing the bearing capacity of foundations. Previous research mainly focused on the foundations in <b>uniform</b> <b>soils.</b> In realistic conditions, soil properties are always varying spatially due to complex physical, chemical, and biological process in earth evolution. This paper investigates the bearing capacity and failure mechanism of footings buried at various depths in clays with spatially variable distribution of undrained shear strength using the lower bound limit analysis, the upper bound limit analysis, and the finite element analysis. Results show that the bearing capacity increases with increasing buried depths in spatially random soils, {{which is the same}} as in the <b>uniform</b> <b>soils.</b> The bearing capacity factors calculated using the finite element method, the lower bound limit analysis, and the upper bound limit analysis for a footing in spatially varied soils are all smaller than the corresponding values in <b>uniform</b> <b>soils.</b> The majority of the bearing capacity factors obtained from the finite element method is bounded by those obtained from the lower bound and the upper bound limit analysis.

Nieber. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 142 pages, appendices A-B. A roadside swale is an infiltration practice that removes water during rainfall-runoff, infiltrate {{water into the}} soil and filter the soil and associate pollutant from the water. Infiltration rate {{is an important factor}} affecting the performance of a swale. Though roadside swales convey and treat road runoff, data on the performance of swales with regards to infiltration is relatively sparse. Therefore, the objective of this study is to, 1) Modify the optimization technique of the new Modified Philip Dunne (MPD) infiltrometer, 2) Verify the results obtained from this MPD infiltrometer for <b>uniform</b> <b>soil,</b> layered soil and <b>uniform</b> <b>soil</b> with macopores by numerical simulation, 3) Utilize the MPD infiltrometer to characterize the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kfs) of five roadside swales located in Twin-Cities, MN and one swale located in Madison, WI and 4) Analyze the derived results obtained from the measurements taken by the MPD infiltrometer. From numerical simulations it was found that MPD Infiltrometer overestimates Kfs value by 10 to 36 % for the <b>uniform</b> <b>soil,</b> 12 % to 63 % for layered soil and 4 % to 29 % for <b>uniform</b> <b>soil</b> containing macropores. MPD infiltrometer allows collecting multiple infiltration measurements simultaneously to capture the spatial variation of infiltration rate of an infiltration practice. In this study a total of 720 infiltration measurements were collected in swales located in Twin-Cities, MN and in Madison, WI. Statistical analysis was performed on the Kfs values to analyze the effect of initial soil moisture content, season, soil texture class and distance in downstream direction on the geometric mean Kfs value of a swale. Because of high spatial variation of Kfs value in the same swale no effect of initial soil moisture content, season and soil texture class was observed on the geometric mean Kfs value. But the distance in downstream direction may have positive or negative effect on the Kfs value...|$|E

However, variability in soil nitrate concentrations causes sampling problems when using the test to assess N availability. Although variability of soil nitrate concentrations has been studied, {{there is a lack of}} information on the uncertainty associated with assessment of nitrate concentrations for small research-sized plots. Also, few studies have been conducted to develop guidelines for efficient sampling of fields for soil nitrate {{in late spring}}. Knowledge of the variability of nitrate concentrations within and among small areas of seemingly <b>uniform</b> <b>soil</b> within a field is essential for site-specific management of N;Studies were conducted to learn more about the variability of nitrate concentrations within small plots of seemingly <b>uniform</b> <b>soil</b> and variability among these small plots within a field. Results from these studies show that there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the determinations of nitrate concentrations from samples collected from small plots of seemingly <b>uniform</b> <b>soil.</b> Such uncertainties must be considered whenever soil nitrate results are interpreted. This problem, however, can be minimized by collecting several samples, looking for trends established by most samples, and giving little credence to samples that do not follow the observed trends. The results also show that much of the within-field variability in nitrate concentrations can be explained by differences in Kjeldahl N concentrations. These findings suggest that within-field differences in soil organic matter concentrations, which are correlated with Kjeldahl N concentrations, offer a practical way to divide fields into 2 ̆ 7 sites 2 ̆ 7 for soil nitrate testing. This is helpful because differences in organic matter contents can be visually identified when soil samples are collected...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{preliminary}} design charts {{were developed to}} predict the bearing capacity of fully and partially penetrated deep mixing (DM) of soft soil. The charts were produced by a new numerical analysis tool based on discontinuity layout optimisation (DLO) in which a previously proposed homogenisation method was used to define the improvement area. To measure the applicability of implementation of the homogenisation method in the DLO, a series of validation processes was performed against several previous studies under <b>uniform</b> <b>soil</b> strength. A new empirical solution was developed from the DLO method using the homogenisation method for the bearing capacity of soft ground under <b>uniform</b> <b>soil</b> strength, improved by the fully penetrated DM method.

40|$|During {{earthquake}} ground shaking earth {{pressures on}} retaining structures can cyclically increase and decrease {{as a result}} of inertial forces applied to the walls and kinematic interactions between the stiff wall elements and surrounding soil. Limit equilibrium analysis imposes a pseudo-static inertial force to a soil wedge behind the wall (the mechanism behind the widely-used Mononobe-Okabe method), which is a poor analogy for either inertial or kinematic wall-soil interaction. Many basement walls and retaining structures are dominated by kinematic soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects arising from differences in displacement between the wall and the free-field soil. Kinematic SSI solutions are often formulated for <b>uniform</b> <b>soil</b> conditions, but the shear modulus of most soils is known to increase with mean effective stress, and therefore with depth. We examine the influence of vertical heterogeneity of shear modulus on kinematic SSI for rigid walls. An existing free-field displacement solution is presented first, followed by analysis of earth pressure increments using a Winkler assumption. Vertical heterogeneity is shown to reduce seismic earth pressures compared with a <b>uniform</b> <b>soil</b> case (for a given frequency and peak ground surface displacement) because free-field displacements are largest near the surface, where the soil is softest and Winkler stiffness is lowest. The proposed Winkler solution is then compared with an exact analytical solution for vertically heterogeneous soil over a rigid base and retained between two opposing rigid walls. The agreement is imperfect, but reasonable, with differences likely due to assumptions regarding the dynamic Winkler stiffness intensity...|$|E

In this paper the authors explore the recommendations given in AEP 55 regarding the testing of surrogate mine blasts using both minepots and the STANAG standard sandy gravel.

40|$|Adding {{discrete}} fibers to soils {{can improve}} their strength; however, fiber reinforcement remains scarce in practice. Previous {{studies on the}} performance of soils reinforced with discrete fibers consist mainly of laboratory studies with either clay or, most often, uniform sand as the host soil, so {{there is a lack of}} data on other types of soils such as weathered soils, which tend to be well graded.

This study examines the effect of adding fibers to a completely decomposed granite (CDG) typical of many residual soils, which has the characteristics to be sensitive to material and sample preparation and also to be compressive during shearing. It is found that adding discrete fibers to the CDG homogenizes it because the reinforced soil is not sensitive to the method of material or sample preparation. It is also found that, despite its compressive nature, fibers mobilize extra strength compared with the unreinforced soil, and this effect does not reduce at large confining stresses...|$|R

This paper aimed to characterize and classify two pedons derived from basalt at the Atlantic Forest Zone, Pernambuco State, Northeastern coast of Brazil. Two representative pedons (P 1 and P 2) were selected on a hillslope at the Cabo de Santo Agostinho municipality. Field macromorphological descriptions {{were carried out}} and soil horizon were sampled for physical, chemical, mineralogical and micromorphological characterization.
