30|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) {{technique was}} {{shown to be a}} very effective analytical tool for the detection and identification of molecules, thanks to its high sensitivity [1, 2]. It has been widely used for <b>ultrasensitive</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> down to the single molecule sensitivity. Its field of applications is as varied as to include chemical-biochemical analysis, nanostructure characterization as well as biomedical applications [3 – 7]. Especially in chemistry, SERS is applied for the detection of conformational changes and structural differences regarding preferred orientations of molecules with respect to a metal surface [8]. The facts that SERS gives a specific fingerprint of a molecule and is sensitive to very small molecules make it a good candidate for application in the fields of chemical and biological sensors. The SERS enhancement is due to the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the metallic nanostructure. The nanostructured LSPR properties need to be designed and strongly controlled in order to produce highly reproducible active SERS substrates [9, 10]. In previous studies, we have discussed the necessity to optimize the size of gold nanocylinders (GNCs) in order to achieve the highest possible SERS enhancement. In addition, we have demonstrated the necessity to optimize the LSPR in the case of each studied molecules [11].|$|E

Utilizing this high sensitivity and by applying <b>chemical</b> functionalization, an <b>ultrasensitive</b> <b>chemical</b> sensor for gases based on a nanobeam cavity was demonstrated. A limit of detection of 1. 5 parts-per-billion (ppb) in ambient conditions, determined from the noise level of the system, was achieved for nerve agent simulant methyl salicylate. The nanobeam cavity’s nonlinear thermo-optical bistability is also utilized to realize a threshold detector for cumulative chemical exposure...|$|R

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} some recent {{advances}} {{made in the}} field of gas sensors based on polyaniline [PANI], a conducting polymer with excellent electronic conductivity and electrochemical properties. Conducting polymers represent an important class of organic materials with an enhanced resistivity towards external stimuli. Among them, PANI polymers have attracted wide interest because of the versatility in their use, combined with the easy of synthesis, high yield and good environmental stability, together with a favorable response to guest molecules at room temperature. Moreover, PANI can be shaped into various structures with different morphologies and the possibility of obtaining nanofibers, in addition to thin films, has opened a rapid development of <b>ultrasensitive</b> <b>chemical</b> sensors, with improved processability and functionality. This review provides {{a brief description of the}} current status of gas chemiresistive sensors based on polyaniline and highlights the properties and applications of these devices in diverse range of application...|$|R

40|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) spectroscopy {{has been}} considered as a promising way to realize real-time, in-situ and ultrasensitive analysis of chemo- and biochemical molecules in different applications even in intracellular or aqueous environments. In this work, polymer-supported novel Ag nano-necklaces (AgNLs) as flexible SERS substrates were fabricated for <b>ultrasensitive</b> <b>chemical</b> and biological detection. With the stringing of dense "hot spot" in three-dimension, AgNLs located on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) work like the removable and reusable "tip" {{on the surface of}} analytes with different morphologies and conditions. The novel substrate shows ultra-high enhancement factor (as high as 109) with excellent reproducibility and long-term stability (7 months) in an aqueous environment. With further functionalizing with p-mercaptobenzoic acid, AgNLs/PDMS elastomer also reveals sensitive and consistent pH detection ability over the wide range of pH 4. 0 - 9. 0, indicating their wide applications in biological and environmental fields. This work provides a feasible strategy for designing ultrasensitive, reproducible and flexible SERS substrate for practical detection...|$|R
40|$|The {{new method}} for the <b>Chemical</b> Quantitative Mineral <b>Analysis</b> (CQMA) is {{presented}} and critically evaluated. The percentages of minerals are calculated of the elemental bulk <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> using identified minerals and their crystallochemical formulas. For this calculation an optimization procedure is used. CQMA enables also the feedback {{calculation of the}} bulk <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> from CQMA calculated mineral contents. Subsequent comparison of the feedback calculated bulk <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> and actual bulk <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> of the same sample is used for critical evaluation of the input data. If necessary the input data are completed and/or reanalyzed and used for repeated calculation to achieve better match between the feedback calculated and actual chemical analyses, which consequently leads to more accurate mineral analysis. Moreover the feedback bulk <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> can be also separately calculated from any mineral analyses determined e. g. by XRD, FTIR and/or optical method. Six German rock reference samples representing a very wide range of minerals and chemical composition of materials were selected and their mineral analyses carried out by CQMA and Rietveld X-ray diffraction methods. The results were compared with reference mineral analyses and critically evaluated. Web of Science 51426424...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{nutrition}} {{of children}} in kindergartens has a great significance for proper growth and development of children. In order to save time and money, the control of macronutrients content is performed by calculations using food composition tables instead of performing a <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis.</b> Methods: We examined the macronutrients content of 240 whole day meals using food composition tables and performed <b>chemical</b> <b>analysis</b> of meals to determine adequacy and validity of food composition tables in calculation of macronutrient contents in kindergarten meals. Findings: We established no correlation (P> 0. 05) between the value of proteins, fats and carbohydrates.
