5|$|One notable {{feature of}} string theory and M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In string theory, spacetime is ten-dimensional (nine spatial dimensions, and one time dimension), while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional (ten spatial dimensions, and one time dimension). In order to describe real physical phenomena <b>using</b> <b>these</b> theories, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.|$|E
5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} while {{standing beside the}} instrument, holding the upper edge of its flange between the thumb and other fingers with the left hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks about half a foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end. <b>Using</b> <b>these</b> balus, players handle the agung {{similar to the way}} a brass tom-tom is played.|$|E
5|$|The basic story {{elements}} unfold as the protagonist, Tim, {{attempts to}} rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. <b>Using</b> <b>these</b> abilities, the player progresses by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.|$|E

5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also had the advantage of absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat <b>using</b> <b>these</b> arguments.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 17, Mercury and {{his family}} fled from Zanzibar for safety reasons due to the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution, in which {{thousands}} of Arabs and Indians were killed. The family moved into a small house at 22 Gladstone Avenue, Feltham, Middlesex, England. Mercury enrolled at Isleworth Polytechnic (now West Thames College) in West London where he studied art. He ultimately earned a diploma in Art and Graphic Design at Ealing Art College (now the Ealing campus of University of West London), later <b>using</b> <b>these</b> skills to design the Queen heraldic arms. A British citizen at birth, Mercury remained so {{for the rest of}} his life.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} few decades, these paper targets have been {{gradually}} replaced by electronic target systems, immediately displaying the results on monitors. When <b>using</b> <b>these</b> systems, actual scoring lines are not printed, but {{the location of the}} impact hole (which can be determined acoustically) is automatically converted into corresponding scores by a computer. ISSF rules now require the use of these systems in top-level competitions. They are generally used in other international competitions as well, and in some countries they are even common in national competitions.|$|E

5|$|In early 1943, the Nazis {{decided to}} {{increase}} greatly the gassing capacity of Birkenau. Crematorium II, {{which had been}} designed as a mortuary with morgues {{in the basement and}} ground-level incinerators, was converted into a killing factory by installing gas-tight doors, vents for the Zyklon B (a highly lethal cyanide-based pesticide) to be dropped into the chamber, and ventilation equipment to remove the gas thereafter. It went into operation in March. Crematorium III was built using the same design. Crematoria IV and V, designed from the start as gassing centers, were also constructed that spring. By June 1943, all four crematoria were operational. Most of the victims were killed <b>using</b> <b>these</b> four structures.|$|E
5|$|In {{recent years}} the Ritz has taken {{measures}} to enforce their trademark against infringement.

The Desborough Ritz, which had been using the name since the 1930s, changed its name in 2012 after being advised by solicitors to do so. That same year, a Northamptonshire wedding location named The Ritz changed its name to the Banqueting & Conference Suites at the Kettering Ritz after another notification. The Brighouse Ritz, which has operated under the name since 1938, was notified in 2017 to change its name or face legal action.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of the {{deciphering}} of the Maya hieroglyphic script, scholars have come to understand that it was a fully functioning writing system in which it was possible to express unambiguously any sentence of the spoken language. The system is of a type best classified as logosyllabic, in which symbols (glyphs or graphemes) can be used as either logograms or syllables. The script has a complete syllabary (although not all possible syllables have yet been identified), and a Maya scribe {{would have been able to}} write anything phonetically, syllable by syllable, <b>using</b> <b>these</b> symbols.|$|E

Despite maintaining her stature, build, and facial features, she {{is described in}} Queen of Blades as having mottled green skin, covered in a glossy protective carapace. Kerrigan's eyes are bright yellow as opposed to her natural green, and her hair has transformed into stalks, described as being segmented like an insect's legs. Kerrigan's fingers are stated to now contain extendible claws. A pair of skeletal wings has also grown from her back, consisting of elongated segmented spikes that reach down {{to the level of}} her knees. Kerrigan is seen <b>using</b> <b>these</b> wings as a melee weapon, tearing opponents apart.|$|E

5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. <b>Using</b> <b>these</b> terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E

5|$|One alternative, {{aimed at}} {{avoiding}} inequality and revenue allocation issues, is {{to implement a}} rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This system {{would be similar to}} the existing emissions trading of carbon credit. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits, and would have the option of <b>using</b> <b>these</b> for themselves, or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota. This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.|$|E
5|$|Outside of London and the South East, {{the use of}} {{regional}} airports has increased dramatically in recent years, {{with the amount of}} air traffic <b>using</b> <b>these</b> facilities doubling in the period 1995 to 2005. To illustrate this growth, in the five years from 2001 passenger numbers at the regional airports of Exeter International Airport, Bristol International Airport, and Newcastle Airport increased by 191 per cent, 113 per cent, and 60 per cent respectively. In the same period the largest airports experienced some of the slowest growth, with Heathrow passenger numbers increasing by 11 per cent, and those of Gatwick increasing by less than 10 per cent.|$|E
5|$|Rhodesian {{air traffic}} was not seriously {{threatened}} until about 1977, {{in the latter}} stages of the war; before this time, neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target. The weapon that made such attacks feasible for ZIPRA was the Strela-2 shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile launcher, supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid-1970s {{as part of the}} Warsaw Pact's materiel support. By September 1978, there had been 20reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft <b>using</b> <b>these</b> weapons, none of which had been successful. Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit, but all had survived and landed safely. No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War.|$|E
