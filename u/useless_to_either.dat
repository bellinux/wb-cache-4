6000|$|... "Mabel," [...] said he steadily, [...] "the will of God must be done. It is <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> attempt deceiving <b>either</b> you or myself; my {{time has}} come, {{and it is}} a {{consolation}} to me to die like a soldier. Lundie will do me justice; for our good friend Pathfinder will tell him what has been done, and how all came to pass. You do not forget our last conversation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] said Sir Marmaduke, {{rising from}} his chair with dignity, [...] "that I called here to discuss such matters as these. As it happens, you, Mr. Stanbury, are not the Governor of the Mandarins, and I have not the honour to write for the columns of the penny {{newspaper}} with which you are associated. It is therefore <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> discuss what <b>either</b> of us might do in the position held by the other." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let the men {{practice}} with these, {{and remember that}} they must aim at {{the legs of the}} Romans. It is <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> shoot at <b>either</b> shields or armour. Besides, let each man make himself a spear, strong, heavy, and fully eighteen feet long, with the point hardened in the fire, and rely upon these rather than upon your swords to check their progress. Whenever you find broad paths of firm ground across the swamps, cut down trees and bushes to form stout barriers.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the news}} of this procedure, which was {{obviously}} fatal to all chances of securing the park as an open space, came to the ears of Mr Burchett, he at once went to Mr Dethbridge of [...] "The Hermitage", to consult with him {{as to how the}} imminent sacrifice of the frontages (and with them the whole park) could be delayed, or prevented. It soon appeared that it was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> appeal <b>either</b> <b>to</b> the generosity of the public or the public spirit {{of the majority of the}} ground-tenants, while for merely two of the lessees to refuse to sell their rights would avail nothing to prevent building opposite the frontages of the remainder. Mr Burchett therefore arranged with Mr Dethbridge that they should make known their readiness to sell their rights of prohibition, but at not less than Â£1000 each.|$|R
60|$|Some of {{the more}} astute among the people had {{certainly}} thought for a while that the cannon was a humbug, that it was <b>useless</b> <b>either</b> <b>to</b> royalist or to republican, in fact, {{that it would never}} go off at all. But these sceptics were cured of their infidelity at Thouars, when they saw the soldiers as well as the republicans of the town fall in heaps beneath the thunders of Marie Jeanne.|$|R
6000|$|But Miss Pinnegar was too angry to be philosophic. Alvina {{knew it was}} <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> be <b>either</b> {{angry or}} {{otherwise}} emotional. None the less, she also {{felt as if she}} had been knocked down. And she almost envied poor Miss Pinnegar the prospect of a little, day-by-day haberdashery shop in Tamworth. Her own problem seemed so much more menacing. [...] "Answer or die," [...] said the Sphinx of fate. Miss Pinnegar could answer her own fate according to its question. She could say [...] "haberdashery shop," [...] and her sphinx would recognize this answer as true to nature, and would be satisfied. But every individual has his own, or her own fate, and her own sphinx. Alvina's sphinx was an old, deep thoroughbred, she would take no mongrel answers. And her thoroughbred teeth were long and sharp. To Alvina, the last of the fantastic but pure-bred race of Houghton, the problem of her fate was terribly abstruse.|$|R
60|$|How glorious is {{the wisdom}} and {{goodness}} of the great Creator of the World! in thus restraining these seraphic OUTCASTS from the power of assuming human or organic bodies! which could they do, envigorating them with the supernatural Powers, which, as Seraphs and Angels, they now possess and might exert, {{they would be able}} even to fright mankind {{from the face of the}} Earth, and to destroy and confound God's Creation; nay, even as they are, were not their power limited, they might destroy the Creation it self, reverse and over-turn nature, and put the World into a general conflagration: But were those immortal Spirits embodied, tho' they were not permitted to confound nature, they would be able to harrass poor weak and defenceless man out of his wits, and render him perfectly <b>useless,</b> <b>either</b> <b>to</b> his Maker or himself.|$|R
60|$|Corrie did not smile; {{he did not}} {{betray the}} {{smallest}} symptom of power <b>either</b> <b>to</b> appreciate or to indulge in jocularity at that moment. But feeling that it was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> appeal to the former experience of the boatswain, he changed his plan of attack.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> {{dispute with}} her; and worse than <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> sit there, and {{encourage}} her to say more. I got up on my feet.|$|R
60|$|I had {{intended}} to remonstrate with him pretty sharply for taking Lucilla to Browndown. After what he had now said, it was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> attempt anything of that sort--and doubly <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> hope that he would let me extricate myself from my difficulties by letting me tell her the truth.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Crewe {{thought it}} {{obviously}} <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> continue this conversation.|$|R
60|$|Miss Haldin {{thought it}} <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> protest against all these assumptions.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the heavy}} losses {{incurred}} in the battle, the strategic {{value of the}} island became controversial. [...] It was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. Army as a staging base and <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> the U.S. Navy as a fleet base. However, Navy Seabees rebuilt the landing strips, which were used as emergency landing strips for USAAF B-29s.|$|R
60|$|He nodded. He {{felt that}} it was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> combat her resolution.|$|R

60|$|It was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> deny it. Horace {{admitted}} that the servants were right.|$|R
60|$|It would {{therefore}} be <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> call at Farfrae's house till very late.|$|R
60|$|Dave did {{not believe}} this, but said nothing on the point to his companion, for {{he knew it would}} be <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> attempt to uproot so deep--set a superstition.|$|R
60|$|Pierson {{understood}} all at {{once that}} it was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> try and move her.|$|R
60|$|It being <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> {{remain on}} the bar, Leo hastily clambered into the basket.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> {{argue with}} such stupendous folly; Captain Flower tried another tack.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion EtCO 2 {{during a}} {{successful}} SBT seems <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> predict outcome of extubation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I won't," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "But I {{want to see}} fair play." [...] He knew {{it would}} be <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> attempt to get Tom to give up the fight.|$|R
60|$|O'Grady smiled pleasantly, {{and said}} it was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> argue with so obstinate a man.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew it was}} <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} he had let many spring-cleaning times pass.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> offer another card, so I {{mentioned}} it {{in a clear}} voice.|$|R
60|$|Holmes's {{cold and}} inexorable manner showed the {{secretary}} {{that it was}} <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> argue with him.|$|R
60|$|Some {{reply was}} {{obviously}} required. It was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> keep protesting that I was not Sam.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew it was}} <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} he had let many spring {{cleaning}} times pass.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I allow {{he seems}} to be the goods all right. And I was wrong about its being <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> go to him. Say, shall we go right away back to the Ritz?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now Betty {{knew that}} she had been seen, and that it was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> deny the truth.|$|R
60|$|It was <b>useless</b> <b>to</b> {{contend with}} her. Mrs. Crayford yielded. The two women {{left the house}} together.|$|R
