50|$|A similar stop is the <b>Unda</b> <b>maris,</b> {{which is}} similar to the Voix celeste except that it {{typically}} uses a Dulciana or a softer-scale string (or even flutes), as opposed to the Voix Celeste which almost always refers to a brighter-scaled string celeste. The Voce Umana is an Italian variant of the celeste employing Principal pipes.|$|E
5000|$|... 11 Villa <b>Unda</b> <b>Maris</b> - A {{classical}} residence with balcony, {{the facade}} highlighted with ionic pilasters. Originally named Villa Saint Martin, {{at which time}} it possessed an impressive formal garden, later partly subsumed by an annex. The back of the villa was embraced by the courtyard of lÉcole du Rocher (the School of the Rock). The school was replaced in 2010 by the National Council building which extended over the former courtyard to closely abut and overlook the villa, compromising its aspect. The villa was demolished in 2013 and replaced by an apartment building of the same name.|$|E
5000|$|Often, {{an organ}} will feature two similarly-voiced stops, one tuned {{slightly}} sharp or flat of the other. When these stops are played together, a unique undulating effect results due to alternating constructive and destructive interference (beat frequency). Examples include the Voix céleste (French for celestial voice), typically tuned slightly sharp, and the <b>Unda</b> <b>maris</b> (Latin for sea waves), typically tuned slightly flat. String stops are {{most commonly used}} as undulating stops, though some builders have made undulating flute stops (notably Ernest M. Skinner's Flute celeste), and rarely an organ may feature an undulating diapason, as in the Italian [...] "Voce Umana" [...] (not {{to be confused with}} the Vox Humana, which is a soft reed stop with a short resonator).|$|E
50|$|The choir loft {{houses a}} large, four manual Steinmeyer pipe organ built in Ottengen, Bavaria with almost 5,000 pipes played for all Masses and Services by Cathedral organist Robert Corso.The organ {{contains}} 84 ranks of pipes divided with sections in the Chancel and Gallery. The {{tone of the}} organ ranges from a very deep profound bass, with many large wooden pipes, to a very brilliant sound with 14 ranks of mixtures on the Great, main manual alone, containing pipes with a high tin content, adding to the overall brilliance of sound. One {{of the features of}} the choir manual keyboard is a set of pipes made entirely of copper, named Copper Gedect. The large scale facade pipes consisting of the pedal Diapason 16' and the Great manual's Diapason 16' are constructed of zinc. In 1981 the Chancel organ was moved further North to allow more space in the Sanctuary. In 1990, a new 4 manual console was added by R. A Denton & Son of Hamilton, built by R.A Colby, Johnson City, Tennessee, temporarily used by the Mormon Tabernacle during their organ console rebuild in the late 1980s. The four manuals are named from top to bottom: Antiphonal/Echo, Swell, Great and Choir. The new console has solid state multiple memory banks for selecting different combinations of stops rapidly. The organ also contains two stops which are tuned sharp and flat to achieve a warm, rich tone. These are a Celeste on the Swell manual and an <b>Unda</b> <b>Maris</b> of the sea on the choir manual. In April 2016 a new Casavant French terraced four manual console was installed by the Casavant Freres firm of Ste. Hyacinthe, Quebec. The height of the console being quite low, allows the organist to conduct the choirs from the bench while accompanying. To rebuild the organ today in 2016 would most likely cost approximately $5 million Canadian dollars.|$|E
40|$|In {{the year}} 1704, the year {{following}} {{the dedication of}} the new organ built by Eugenio Casparini for the Church of Sts. Peter and Paul in Görlitz, Christian Ludwig Boxberg published {{a detailed description of the}} organ. The organ attracted immediate attention because of its large size, and because of the remarkably imaginative design of its case. But the organ 2 ̆ 7 s reputation as something extraordinary was a direct result of Boxberg 2 ̆ 7 s booklet, which enjoyed a relatively wide circulation and spread a favorable impression of the organ far beyond its immediate locale. Through his effusive praise of the organ, Boxberg aroused interest in an instrument that in many respects may not have been as distinguished as Boxberg 2 ̆ 7 s description suggests. Numerous reports of the organ 2 ̆ 7 s deficiencies offer evidence of its tonal and technical shortcomings. Nonetheless, the organ was influential in middle Germany and Silesia during the eighteenth century. The <b>Unda</b> <b>Maris,</b> a principal celeste rank with roots in the Italian Fiffaro, began to appear in large organs after Casparini introduced the stop to this area in the organ at Görlitz. A tonal design, similar to the one used by Casparini, with a markedly different scaling for the principal chorus in each division of the organ was adopted by two of the century 2 ̆ 7 s most prominent organbuilders in middle Germany, Gottfried Silbermann and Zacharias Hildebrandt. Although the organ at Görlitz continued to attract interest throughout the eighteenth century, it seems unlikely that the organ itself provided sufficient impetus for its continuing fame, given its history of mechanical and tonal deficiencies. It seems probable that, without the publication of Boxberg 2 ̆ 7 s description, the organ might never have enjoyed the reputation, nor exerted the influence it did on organbuilding in middle Germany throughout the eighteenth century...|$|E
