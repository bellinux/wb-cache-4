40|$|Reconstruction • Retractor • Prosthesis • Urinary {{incontinence}} • Erectile dysfunction Objective: We demonstrate {{an innovative}} {{use of a}} barrier sur-gical wound retractor/protector system {{for use in a}} variety of prosthetic urologic procedures (penile prosthetics, artificial urinary sphincters, male slings). Materials and Methods: We demonstrate the use of a self-retaining ring wound retrac-tor in a multitude of prosthetic urological procedures: inser-tion of an inflatable penile prosthesis through an infrapubic approach as well as penoscrotal approach, placement of a transperineal artificial urinary sphincter, and placement of a male urethral sling. Results: The self-retaining ring wound retractor facilitated a more rapid setup and takedown, pro-vided 360 degrees of atraumatic retraction as well as 360 de-grees of wound protection, allowed for maximum exposure with a minimum incision size, significantly shortened the operating wound depth thus maximizing exposure, and iso-lated the surgical field minimizing prosthesis to skin contact. Conclusion: Our experience shows that prosthetic <b>urologic</b> <b>surgeries</b> can be enhanced {{with the use of the}} self-retaining ring wound retractor as it provides better surgical exposure, lowers wound infection risks, sets up more quickly as a safer retraction system with substantial cost savings...|$|R
40|$|Background. Polyorchidism, {{alternatively}} supernumerary testes (SNT), is {{a condition}} where an individual is born with more than two testicles. This congenital anomaly is quite rare and the literature has described various presentations. Questions/Purposes. To our knowledge, this presentation of polyorchidism {{has yet to be}} described in the literature. The goal of this case study is to add to the pediatric, general, and <b>urologic</b> <b>surgery’s</b> body of knowledge of the subject matter. Case Study. A nine-month-old boy was admitted for an impalpable right testis and phimosis. At the time of surgical exploration, there appeared to be polyorchid testis on the right-hand side, with three masses that potentially appeared to be undescended testes. Discussion. Proponents of a conservative approach argue that infertility is common in patients with polyorchidism and, by preserving a potentially functional SNT, there may be improved spermatogenesis. When performing definitive surgical treatment, meticulous intra-abdominal and intrainguinal exploration must be undertaken. Orchiopexy should be performed to reduce the chances of torsion, malignancy, and infertility. Conclusion. Our case is important to the literature as it is the first known case of polyorchidism with 3 SNT on the right side, located intra-abdominally, and in a patient less than 1 year of age...|$|R

40|$|Background: Urinary {{retention}} is {{a common}} postoperative complication that mandates urinary catheterization. Urinary catheterization is associated with different physical, mental, and financial problems for both patients and healthcare systems. The patient inconvenience, urinary tract infections, and increase in hospital stay and expenses are common problems of urinary retention and urinary catheterization. Therefore, alternative ways of relieving urinary retention, preferably noninvasive interventions, are of great interest. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the effects of placing hot pack and lukewarm-water-soaked gauze on the suprapubic region on male patients with postoperative urinary retention. Patients and Methods: This was a three-group, randomized, controlled trial. A convenience sample of 126 male patients who had undergone general, orthopedic, or <b>urologic</b> <b>surgeries</b> were recruited. The block randomization method was used for allocating patients to either the two experimental groups (the hot pack and the lukewarm-water-soaked gauze groups) or the control one. Patients in the experimental groups were treated by placing either hot pack or lukewarm-water-soaked gauze on the suprapubic region. All patients were monitored for 20 minutes for urinary retention relief. If they did not experience urinary retention relief (starting urine flow and bladder evacuate), urinary catheterization would be performed. The data was collected using information sheet. Elimination of urinary retention was compared among study groups. The one-way analysis of variance and the Chi-square tests were used for analyzing data. Results: Respectively, 59. 5...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundWe present our {{experience}} of complications of pure transperitoneal laparoscopic surgery in urology at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. MethodsBetween September 2003 and March 2006, 185 laparoscopic urologic operations were performed, consisting of 70 nephrectomies (36 radical, 17 partial, 11 simple, 6 donor), 28 adrenalectomies, 28 nephroureterectomies, 22 radical prostatectomies, 17 ureterolithotomies, 6 radical cystectomies, 5 pyeloplasties, 2 renal cyst unroofings, 2 nephropexies and 5 other operations. We reviewed the database of the patients to evaluate the complications and analyze factors related to laparoscopic surgeries. ResultsA total of 25 patients had 26 complications (14. 1 %, major in 4, minor in 22). The complications were categorized into intraoperative and postoperative complications in 10 and 16 patients, respectively. The mortality rate was 0 %. The conversion rate was 0. 54 % (1 patient). The re-operation rate was 1. 08 % (2 patients). The most common intraoperative complication was vascular injury (5 patients). The incidence of complication {{was related to the}} difficulty level of operation. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} complication rate and patient age, patient body mass index or the American Society of Anesthesiologist score. ConclusionThe complications of laparoscopic <b>urologic</b> <b>surgeries</b> are strongly correlated with the operative difficulties. In spite of elevated complication rates in difficult surgeries, the major complication rate in this study was very low. As the laparoscopic surgeries in urology involve more and more technique-dependent difficult fields, documentation and analysis of experience of complications is important for the development of this surgical modality...|$|R
40|$|Background: Perioperative {{lidocaine}} infusion improves postoperative outcomes, mostly after abdominal and <b>urologic</b> <b>surgeries.</b> Knowledge of {{the effect}} of lidocaine on peripheral surgeries is limited. Presently, we investigated whether intraoperative lidocaine infusion reduced anesthetic consumption, duration of ileus, pain intensity, analgesic consumption and hospital stay after breast plastic surgeries. Methods: Sixty female patients, aged 20 - 60 years, enrolled in this prospective study were randomly and equally divided to two groups. One group (n = 30) received a 1. 5 mg/kg bolus of lidocaine approximately 30 min before incision followed by continuous infusion of lidocaine (1. 5 mg/kg/h) until skin closure (lidocaine group). The other group (n = 30) was untreated (control group). Balanced inhalation (sevoflurane) anesthesia and multimodal postoperative analgesia were standardized. End tidal sevoflurane concentration during surgery, time to the first flatus and defecation, visual analog pain scale (0 - 10), analgesic consumption and associated side effects at 24, 48, and 72 h after surgery, hospital stay, and patient’s general satisfaction were assessed. Results: Compared to the control group, intraoperative lidocaine infusion reduced by 5 % the amount of sevoflurane required at similar bispectral index (P = 0. 014). However, there were no significant effects of lidocaine regarding the return of bowel function, postoperative pain intensity, analgesic sparing and side effects at all time points, hospital stay, and level of patient’s satisfaction for pain control. Conclusions: Low dose intraoperative lidocaine infusion offered no beneficial effects on return of bowel function, opioid sparing, pain intensity and hospital stay after various breast plastic surgeries.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose To {{determine}} whether using different intraperitoneal insufflation pressures for transperitoneal laparoscopic <b>urologic</b> <b>surgeries</b> decreases postoperative pain. Materials and Methods 76 patients who underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic upper urinary tract surgery at different insufflation pressures were allocated {{into the following}} groups: 10 mmHg (group I, n= 24), 12 mmHg (group II, n= 25) and 14 mmHg (group III, n= 27). These patients were compared according to age, gender, body mass index (BMI), type and duration of surgery, intraoperative bleeding volume, postoperative pain score and length of hospital stay. A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for postoperative pain. Results Demographic characteristics, mean age, gender, BMI and type of surgeries were statistically similar among the groups. The mean operation time was higher in group I than group II and group III {{but this was not}} statistically significant (P= 0. 810). The mean intraoperative bleeding volume was significantly higher in group I compared with group II and group III (P= 0. 030 and P= 0. 006). The mean length of postoperative hospital stays was statistically similar among the groups (P= 0. 849). The mean VAS score at 6 h was significantly reduced in group I compared with group III (P= 0. 011). At 12 h, the mean VAS score was significantly reduced in group I compared with group II and group III (P= 0. 009 and P< 0. 001). There {{was no significant difference in}} the mean VAS scores at 24 h among three groups (P= 0. 920).

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} effects of an Acute Pain Service (APS) {{inception}} on postoperative pain management in a general teaching hospital using pain indicators as performance measures. DESIGN: Open, prospective, nonrandomized, observational study. SETTING: Postanesthesia Care Unit, surgical wards of University Hospital Center of Charleroi. PATIENTS: 1304 patients in the pre-APS inception phase and 671 patients after its implemention who have undergone various types of surgery (orthopedics, gynecology, urology, neurosurgery, stomatology, ear, nose, and throat, ophthalmic, abdominal, vascular-thoracic, plastic, and maxillofacial). INTERVENTIONS: An APS, nurse-based, anesthesiologist-supervised model was devised, based on the concept that postoperative pain relief can be greatly improved by providing in-service training for surgical nursing staff and optimal use of systemic analgesics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Postoperative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) every 4 hours for 72 hours in the two phases. Analgesic consumption was registered at the same time. Time-related VAS scores were summarized using several pain indicators. There was an overall improvement in the pain scores after APS inception. The differences were most pronounced, around 50 %, in patients undergoing vascular, maxillofacial, gynecologic, and <b>urologic</b> <b>surgeries,</b> and stomatology. Regular administration of paracetamol and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs decreased morphine consumption in the second phase. CONCLUSION: This study validates {{the benefits of a}} formal APS, using continuous monitoring of rest pain intensity and analgesic consumption in the postoperative period.
