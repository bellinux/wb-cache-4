50|$|December 11, 1964: Restart attempt failed, due {{to problem}} with <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Ullage motors (also {{known as}} ullage engines or [...] <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets)</b> are {{relatively}} small, independently fueled rocket engines {{that may be}} fired to accelerate the rocket prior to main engine ignition, when the vehicle is in a zero-g situation.|$|R
50|$|To ensure clean {{separation}} and prevent contact, multistage rockets may have small retrorockets on lower stages, which ignite upon stage separation. Meanwhile, the succeeding stage may have <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets,</b> both to aid {{separation and}} ensure good starting of liquid-fuel engines.|$|R
50|$|AC-3 was {{launched}} on June 30, 1964. Insulation panel and payload shroud jettison were performed {{for the first}} time, and the rocket carried a Surveyor mockup. Although the boost phase went entirely according to plan, a shaft in a hydraulic pump acutator failed during the Centaur burn, causing engine gimbaling to fail. The Centaur tumbled and lost thrust. It reached orbit, but could not be restarted, however the small <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> were successfully tested. AC-4 (December 11) reached orbit successfully, but could not be restarted due to an ill-conceived design modification--the <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> were reduced in size to save weight, however they proved insufficient to settle the propellants in the tanks. Venting liquid hydrogen caused the Centaur to tumble out of control.|$|R
50|$|The {{separation}} of the two rocket stages was filmed by eight cameras that themselves separated from the rocket to be recovered 800 km (497 mi) downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. The whole stage separation system worked perfectly with the retrorockets firing on the first stage to decelerate it and <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> on the S-IV firing to settle its fuel to aft of the stage.|$|R
50|$|Its {{three stages}} {{duplicated}} the flight configuration, ordnance, and umbilical connections of their live counterparts. Although inert, the retrograde <b>rockets,</b> <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets,</b> and shaped charges had {{the dimensions of}} the live ordnance to let the launch team practice ordnance installation. The first stage only had one real F-1 engine, and the inter-tank section of the first stage had a different paint scheme than flight vehicles. The third stage had a paint scheme matching the Saturn 1B, for which it was originally made. SA-500F was stacked on Mobile Launcher 1 in VAB Bay 1 with the Apollo spacecraft facilities verification vehicle boilerplate.|$|R
50|$|The first {{attempted}} {{launch in}} the program took place on January 21, 1959 at Vandenberg AFB's LC-75. As the Agena was being loaded with fuel (the Thor was still empty at this point), someone decided to conduct {{a test of the}} launch computer sequencer. The result was that the Agena accidentally received a signal that staging had taken place and to begin booster separation. As everyone in the blockhouse watched in dismay, the <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> {{on the outside of the}} Agena began firing and the internal fuel pumps began spinning up for engine start. A quick-thinking member of the blockhouse crew then pressed a button on his control console to send a shutdown signal to the booster. Although potential disaster had been averted, the Agena now had nothing except gravity holding it onto the Thor and the risk of the stage falling to the ground, rupturing, and spilling its corrosive nitric acid/UDMH propellant load existed. In addition, the heat from the <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> could potentially ignite the propellants in the stage. Pad crews had to wait several hours for the batteries in the Agena to run down before they could begin dismantling the launch vehicle. The Thor sustained minor damage and was sent back to Douglas for refurbishment, but the Agena had had nitric acid spilled down its exterior and was deemed unsafe to fly. In any case, it was one of the first Agena stages produced and lacked some technical refinements made to newer models. It ended up being used at Lockheed for training purposes.|$|R
50|$|Use of {{a parking}} orbit {{requires}} a rocket upper stage {{to perform the}} injection burn while under zero g conditions. Often, the same upper stage which performs the parking orbit injection {{is used for the}} final injection burn, which requires use of a restartable liquid-propellant rocket engine. During the parking orbit coast, the propellants will drift away {{from the bottom of the}} tank and the pump inlets. This must be dealt with through the use of tank diaphragms, or <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> to settle the propellant back to the bottom of the tank. A reaction control system is needed to orient the stage properly for the final burn, and perhaps to establish a suitable thermal orientation during coast. Cryogenic propellants must be stored in well-insulated tanks, to prevent excessive boiloff during coast. Battery life and other consumables must be sufficient for the duration of the parking coast and final injection.|$|R
50|$|To provide {{third stage}} restart {{capability}} for the Saturn V, the J-2 gaseous hydrogen start tank was refilled in 60 seconds {{during the previous}} firing after the engine had reached steady-state operation (refill of the gaseous helium tank was not required because the original ground-fill supply was sufficient for three starts). Prior to engine restart, the stage <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> were fired to settle the propellants in the stage propellant tanks, ensuring a liquid head to the turbopump inlets. In addition, the engine propellant bleed valves were opened, the stage recirculation valve was opened, the stage prevalve was closed, and a LOX and LH2 circulation was effected through the engine bleed system for five minutes to condition the engine to the proper temperature to ensure proper engine operation. Engine restart was initiated after the “engine ready” signal was received from the stage. This {{was similar to the}} initial “engine ready”. The hold time between cutoff and restart was from a minimum of 1.5 hours to a maximum of 6 hours, depending upon the number of earth orbits required to attain the lunar window for translunar trajectory.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least three}} {{previous}} Soviet planetary probes {{had been lost}} due to malfunctions of the <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> (BOZ) on the Blok L stage, but an investigation found that the problem was easily resolved. The spacecraft, a Venera 3MV-1, was launched on April 2, 1964 from Tyuratam {{and this time the}} launch vehicle performed flawlessly. During the cruise phase, a slow leak from a cracked sensor window caused the electronics compartment to lose air pressure. This was a serious problem as Soviet electronics relied on vacuum tubes which would overheat without cooling air. An ill-timed command from ground control turned on its radio system while there was still a rarefied atmosphere inside, causing the electronics to short out by corona discharge. Since the mission could not succeed, it was unacceptable to give it a Venera designation, but as the probe had exited Earth orbit, it also could not be given the Kosmos cover name, so Soviet authorities instead announced the probe as [...] "Zond" [...] and claimed that it was designed to [...] "stress-test components in deep space". Chief Designer Sergei Korolev was upset at the failure of the mission and demanded higher quality control from the OKB-1 Bureau, including X-rays to test for pressure leaks.|$|R
40|$|Three {{dimensional}} nozzles and jet flows {{have attracted}} the attention of many researchers due to their potential application to many practical devices. Rectangular nozzles are considered for short/vertical take off and landing aircrafts for achieving powered lift. Axisymmetric nozzles with lobes, tabs or slots and elliptical nozzles are considered for noise reduction in aircrafts and mixing augmentation in airbreathing rockets. Interaction of supersonic jets with solid surface, {{as in the case of}} retro and <b>ullage</b> <b>rockets</b> in launch vehicles and interaction of multiple jets as in the case of launch vehicles with multiple booster rockets/multiple nozzle engines are of practical importance. Design of rockets and aircrafts employing these nozzles needs the understanding of the structure and behaviour of the complex three dimensional supersonic jets issuing from these nozzles. The problem is so complex that different investigators have addressed only some specific aspects of the problem and there is much more to be done to fully understand these flows. For example, in the case of rectangular nozzle with semi circular ends (known as elliptical nozzle), the investigations have been limited to a single nozzle of aspect ratio 3, 0 and pressure ratio (ratio of the total pressure to ambient pressure) 3. 0. Further, the measurements were made in the far field subsonic region beyond a distance of 20 times the equivalent nozzle radius (RJ. For the present study, the elliptical sonic nozzle of the type mentioned above was chosen, as it offered simplicity for manufacturing and carrying out computations, but has all the complex features associated with the three dimensional jets. A systematic study to understand the mean flow structure and the effect of important governing parameters like ratio and pressure ratio on the flow development process of the jet issuing from Navier-Stokes equations. The experimental study revealed many interesting flow features. It was found that the Underexpanded jet issuing from elliptical sonic nozzle spreads rapidly in the minor axis plane while it maintains almost constant width or contracts in the major axis plane. However, the gross spreading of this jet is much higher compared to the axisymmetric jet. The higher spreading rates experienced in the minor axis plane compared to the major axis plane of this 'et, results in the jet width in the minor axis plane to become higher than that in the major axis plane. The longitudinal location, where this occurs is called the axis switching location. This kind of axis switching phenomenon is known to exist for subsonic elliptical jets. However, for the present supersonic jets, the axis switching locations are much closer to the nozzle exit compared to the subsonic cases reported. It was further found that this location strongly depends on the pressure and aspect ratios. A critical pressure ratio was found to exist for each nozzle at which the axis switching location is the farthest. Above the critical pressure ratio, the axis switching location was observed to move upstream with the increase in the pressure ratio and is controlled by the complex interactions of shock and expansion waves near the nozzle exit. Below the critical pressure ratio, the axis switching location moves upstream with the decrease in pressure ratio and is controlled by some kind of instability in the minor axis plane. The shock structure present in the underexpanded jet from an elliptical nozzle was also observed to depend on both pressure and aspect ratios. For some aspect ratios and pressure ratios, the shock pattern observed in both the major and minor axis planes are similar to that of an axisymmetric jet, where the incident barrel shock and the Mach reflection (from the edges of the Mach disk) are present. But for all other cases, this shock continues to be seen only in the major axis plane. Whereas, in the minor axis plane, the incident shock is absent in the shock pattern. Detailed measurement in the jet cross sectional planes, for the case of aspect ratio 2. 0 nozzle, shows that the cross sectional shape changes along the length and it becomes almost a circle at the axis switching location. Further downstream, the jet spreads rapidly in the minor axis plane whereas no significant change in the width of the jet in the major axis plane is observed. Far downstream, the jet boundary appears like a distorted ellipse with its major and minor dimensions lying respectively in the minor and major axis planes of the nozzle. The elongated shape of the jet cross sections at locations downstream of the axis switching point gives the impression that the entire flow in the major axis plane is turned towards the minor axis plane. This effect appears to be predominant at high pressure ratios. The computed near field shock structure in the planes of symmetry, pitot pressure distributions, cross sectional shape of the jet and the spreading pattern agree very well with the experimental results. In addition to this, the present computational method gives the detailed near field flow structure including the azimuthal extent of the incident shock, cross flow details and distributions of flow variables. It is shown that the present inviscid methodology can also predict the axis switching point accurately if it occurs before the formation of the Mach disk and it demonstrates that the jet growth phenomenon in the near field, atleast, is mainly controlled by the inviscid flow process. The computed results have shown that changes in the jet cross sectional shape in the near field is caused mainly by the interaction of compression and expansion waves with each other and with the constant pressure boundary. The inviscid method seems to be able to capture the complicated secondary cross flow structure (indicating presence of longitudinal vortices) of the elliptical jet. The complex mean flow structure in the near field region of the jet issuing from elliptical nozzles and the effect of nozzle aspect ratio and pressure ratio on the structure are brought out clearly in the present study. The mechanism governing the spreading and the axis switching characteristics are also brought out. Thus the present experimental and computational investigations give a comprehensive understanding of the mean flow structure of the underexpanded jets issuing from elliptical nozzles. Further studies are required to understand the other aspects of the elliptical jets as well as other three-dimensional jets. Some of these studies are identified for future work...|$|R
