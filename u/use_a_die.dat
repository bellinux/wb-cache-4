50|$|The {{order of}} {{installation}} of a typical headset follows. The steerer tube is cut to the appropriate length by the bicycle fork manufacturer and the top 1-2 inch cm of the steerer is threaded using a rolling process. This process assures that no material is lost and the steerer would not be weakened as with a die or lathe cutting. Threaded forks necessitate that the threads on the steerer only use the top 1-2 inches, therefore the forks are sold in varying lengths. If {{there is a need}} to use a fork that is too long, meaning the fork steerer is not threaded down far enough, a bicycle mechanic can <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> to extend the threads. This is not recommended if the threads need to be cut farther than an inch or so. As a side note, one should never try to thread an unthreaded steerer after manufacturing as this will weaken the steerer tube. The threads are normally of the ISO standard, 1 in by 24 tpi, but other standards exist. The headtube may be faced and then the cups are pressed into the headtube using a special press that ensures they are square and true. The fork crown may be faced and then the crown race is pressed on to the fork crown with a special press that also makes sure that it is square and true. Then the bearings are placed on top of the crown race, after which the steerer tube is inserted into the headtube. The upper bearings are placed in the upper cup, and the upper race is screwed onto the steerer. A washer, frequently a keyed washer, is placed on top of the upper race and a locknut is screwed on top of that.|$|E
40|$|The microstructures and {{properties}} of a two-phase Mg– 8 % Li alloy were evaluated {{in three different}} conditions: after casting; after casting followed by extrusion at different temperatures and speeds; and after casting, extrusion and processing by ECAP for four passes at room temperature using a die with a channel angle of 135 °. The results show extrusion introduces significant grain refinement and there is additional refinement in ECAP. In tensile testing, the elongations to failure increase with decreasing extrusion temperature, but are essentially independent of the extrusion speed. The ductilities are low in the cast condition, intermediate in the extruded condition and high after extrusion and ECAP. For the last condition, an exceptionally high elongation of 1780 % was achieved at a testing temperature of 473 K. It is shown that it is advantageous to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> with a channel angle of 135 ° because it permits pressing at room temperature where grain growth is limited...|$|E

50|$|Taps {{and dies}} are tools {{used to create}} screw threads, which is called threading. Many are cutting tools; others are forming tools. <b>A</b> tap is <b>used</b> to cut or form the female portion of the mating pair (e.g., <b>a</b> nut). <b>A</b> <b>die</b> is <b>used</b> to cut or form the male portion of the mating pair (e.g., a bolt). The process of cutting or forming threads <b>using</b> <b>a</b> tap is called tapping, whereas the process <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> is called threading.|$|R
40|$|The {{shearing}} {{patterns are}} calculated for equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) under three different conditions: (i) rotation {{of a sample}} around the X-axis when <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> angle of 90 °, (ii) rotation around the X-axis when <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> angle of 120 ° and (iii) rotation around the Y- and Z-axes when using plate samples with <b>a</b> <b>die</b> angle of 90 °. Separate sets of shearing patterns are constructed for the four standard processing routes: route A with no rotation of the sample between consecutive passes, routes BA and BC with rotations of 90 ° in alternate directions or the same direction between each pass, and route C with a rotation of 180 ° between passes. It is concluded {{that the development of}} a uniform microstructure of equiaxed grains, separated by high-angle grain boundaries, is favored using route BC because (i) shearing occurs over large angular ranges on the three orthogonal planes within the sample, (ii) there is a regular and periodic restoration of an equiaxed structure during consecutive pressings and (iii) deformation occurs on each orthogonal plane...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Equal-channel angular {{pressing}} (ECAP) {{was conducted}} using dies having two different channel angles, = 90 o and 135 o, for grain refinement of a Cu- 38 %Zn- 3 %Sn alloy. Orientation image microscopy (OIM) {{was used for}} microstructural observations and phase identification including the analysis of misorientation angles. Tensile testing and upset testing were carried out at elevated temperatures to examine the superplastic ductility and the formability of the alloy. The grain refinement was achieved effectively by conducting the ECAP at a temperature where a phase transformation occurs.

In the metalworking and leather industries, the process is known as clicking and the machine may be referred to as a clicking machine.

5000|$|Play of Chandragupta {{follows the}} general {{sequence}} of the other hex-and-counter style board games, each player taking turns moving units, conducting combat, and resolving combat <b>using</b> <b>an</b> odds-based combat results table (CRT) <b>using</b> <b>a</b> <b>die.</b> <b>As</b> with the other games in the GBoH series, rules for leadership and command and control are emphasized, and players have the opportunity (depending upon leader quality) to conduct [...] "extra" [...] moves and/or [...] "trump" [...] an opponent, effectively cancelling activation of an opponent's leader. Combat results generally result in rout and/or retreat, and victory is achieved by (more commonly) forcing an opponent's army to quit the field when a certain threshold of losses has been achieved, or by (less commonly) obtaining a specific territorial objective.|$|R
50|$|Three-point bending is a newer {{process that}} <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> with <b>an</b> adjustable-height bottom tool, moved by a servo motor. The height {{can be set}} within 0.01 mm.

Three-point bending can achieve bend angles with 0.25 deg. precision. While three-point bending permits high flexibility and precision, it also entails high costs and there are fewer tools readily available. It is being used mostly in high-value niche markets.|$|R

50|$|This process <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> {{arranged}} in <b>a</b> large machine that has high closing force to clamp the die closed.

5000|$|The next {{method is}} button rifling. This method <b>uses</b> <b>a</b> <b>die</b> with <b>a</b> {{negative}} {{image of the}} rifling cut on it.
