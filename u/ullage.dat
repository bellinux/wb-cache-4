5|$|Because it {{is lighter}} than air, {{airships}} and balloons are inflated with helium for lift. While hydrogen gas is more buoyant, and escapes permeating through a membrane {{at a lower}} rate, helium {{has the advantage of}} being non-flammable, and indeed fire-retardant. Another minor use is in rocketry, where helium is used as an <b>ullage</b> medium to displace fuel and oxidizers in storage tanks and to condense hydrogen and oxygen to make rocket fuel. It is also used to purge fuel and oxidizer from ground support equipment prior to launch and to pre-cool liquid hydrogen in space vehicles. For example, the Saturn V rocket used in the Apollo program needed about 370,000m3 (13 million cubic feet) of helium to launch.|$|E
25|$|Each {{propellant}} tank has a vent and relief valve at its forward end. This dual-function valve can be opened by {{ground support equipment}} for the vent function during prelaunch and can open during flight when the <b>ullage</b> (empty space) pressure of the liquid hydrogen tank reaches 38 psig (262 kPa) or the <b>ullage</b> pressure of the liquid oxygen tank reaches 25 psig (172 kPa).|$|E

40|$|Cryogenic {{propulsion}} systems {{are subjected to}} various engine start environments during ground testing, first burn, and restart after orbital coast. These operational modes necessitate careful engine-stage integration, particularly in thermal control of propellant feed systems and engine subsystems. The wide range of operational conditions imposed on propellant feed systems include varying heat loads and acceleration forces for static test first burn and orbital restart. One method used to provide Net Positive Suctign,Head (NPSH) and maintain turbopump I is thermal control propellant circulation through the feed system prior to engine start. The attendant design and operational criteria are inter-related with stage and vehicle systems, including for example, auxiliary propulsion and propellant <b>ullaging</b> methods such as propellant tank propulsive venting. Thermally sensitive engine components require environmental control, protection, or special sequencing in order to assure repeatable engine start performance. An example is thrust chamber pre-chill to avoid pump stall during rapid start transient. Trends in engine development are toward expanding system flexibility to accommodate {{the wide variety of}} environments without special pre-start conditioning...|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} two {{unmanned}} launches, eight solid-fuel <b>ullage</b> motors ignited for four seconds to give positive acceleration to the S-II stage, followed by start of the five J-2 engines. For the first seven manned Apollo missions only four <b>ullage</b> motors were used on the S-II, and they were eliminated completely for the final four launches. About 30 seconds after first stage separation, the interstage ring dropped from the second stage. This was done with an inertially fixed attitude so that the interstage, only 1 meter from the outboard J-2 engines, would fall cleanly without contacting them. Shortly after interstage separation the Launch Escape System was also jettisoned. See Apollo abort modes {{for more information about}} the various abort modes that could have been used during a launch.|$|E
25|$|After {{fermentation}} {{the grapes}} are then aged in small oak barrels. In many DOC regions, the wines {{are required to}} age for at least 3 years {{though it is not}} uncommon for producers to age their wines for 5 to 10 years. Traditionally the barrels were made of chestnut instead of oak, which contributed high amounts of wood tannins and was very porous which promoted excessive evaporation in the barrel. Under this same traditional style of winemaking, a large <b>ullage</b> or air space would emerge in the barrel and oxidation took place. This gave the wine its characteristic amber but also flavours and traits that may be characterised as wine faults. Towards the end of the 20th century, more produces began switching to oak barrels while maintaining the tradition of not topping up the barrels and filling in the <b>ullage</b> space. This angel's share still produces some level of oxidation, though not as severe as the style was historically made. Modern winemaking technique also calls for more temperature control and keeping the wine in rooms with a consistent temperature that promotes more fresh flavours in the wine and fewer faults.|$|E
25|$|The Saturn V {{consisted}} of three stages—the S-IC first stage, S-II second stage and the S-IVB third stage—and the instrument unit. All three stages used liquid oxygen (LOX) as an oxidizer. The first stage used RP-1 for fuel, while {{the second and third}} stages used liquid hydrogen (LH2). The upper stages also used small solid-fueled <b>ullage</b> motors that helped to separate the stages during the launch, and to ensure that the liquid propellants were in a proper position to be drawn into the pumps.|$|E
25|$|The S-IVB-500 {{model used}} on the Saturn V {{differed}} from the S-IVB-200 used as {{the second stage of}} the Saturn IB, in that the engine was restartable once per mission. This was necessary as the stage would be used twice during a lunar mission: first in a 2.5 min burn for the orbit insertion after second stage cutoff, and later for the trans-lunar injection (TLI) burn, lasting about 6 min. Two liquid-fueled Auxiliary Propulsion System (APS) units mounted at the aft end of the stage were used for attitude control during the parking orbit and the trans-lunar phases of the mission. The two APSs were also used as <b>ullage</b> engines to settle the propellants in the aft tank engine feed lines prior to the trans-lunar injection burn.|$|E
25|$|Some {{degree of}} {{humidity}} is {{required in order to}} keep wines with cork enclosures from drying out. Even when wine bottles are stored on their sides, one side of the cork is still exposed to air. Should the cork begin to dry out, it can allow oxygen to enter the bottle, filling the <b>ullage</b> space and possibly causing the wine to spoil or oxidize. Excessive humidity can also pose the risk of damaging wine labels, which may hinder identification or hurt potential resale value. Wine experts such as Jancis Robinson note that 75% humidity is often cited as ideal but also that there is very little significant research to definitively establish an optimal range. Concern about humidity is one of the primary reasons why wine experts such as Tom Stevenson recommend that wine should not be kept in a refrigerator since the refrigeration process often includes dehumidifying, which can quickly dry out corks.|$|E
500|$|The {{first and}} second stages were {{connected}} by an interstage structure containing four Siskin IB separation and <b>ullage</b> motors, which separated and ignited seven seconds after the first stage had cut off. The interstage separated from the second stage six seconds later. The second stage, which was [...] long and measured [...] in diameter, was powered by a two-chamber Gamma 2 engine which ignited shortly after the separation motors, and continued to burn for 123 seconds. Three minutes after launch, during the second stage burn, the payload fairing separated.|$|E
2500|$|Most wine racks are {{designed}} to allow a wine to be stored on its side. The thinking behind this orientation is that the cork {{is more likely to}} stay moist and not dry out if it is kept in constant contact with the wine. Some wineries package their wines upside down in the box for much the same reason. Research in the late 1990s suggested that the ideal orientation for wine bottles is at a slight angle, rather than completely horizontal. This allows the cork to maintain partial contact with the wine in order to stay damp but also keeps the air bubble formed by a wine's <b>ullage</b> at the top rather than {{in the middle of the}} bottle if the wine is lying on its side. Keeping the <b>ullage</b> near the top, it has been argued, allows for a slower and more gradual oxidation and maturation process. This is because the pressure of the air bubble that is the <b>ullage</b> space rises and falls depending on temperature fluctuation. When exposed to higher temperatures the bubble's pressure increases (becomes positive relative to the air outside of the bottle), and if the wine is tilted at an angle, this compressed gas will diffuse through the cork and not harm the wine. [...] When the temperature falls the process reverses. [...] If the wine is completely on its side then this action will eject some wine through the cork. Through this [...] "breathing" [...] which can result from variations in temperature, oxygen may be repeatedly introduced into the bottle and as a result, can react with the wine. [...] An appropriate and constant temperature is therefore preferred. Additionally, oxidation will occur more rapidly at higher temperatures and gases dissolve into liquids faster the lower the temperature.|$|E
2500|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Vin Santo {{was often}} sold as basic vino da tavola due to Italian wine authorities' {{difficulties}} in classifying the many different styles of the wine. Today {{most of the major}} Italian wine producing regions have their own DOCs for specific Vin Santo wines produced in those areas. While the style is traditionally associated with Tuscany, examples {{can be found on the}} international wine market from throughout Italy. In the Trentino region, a dried straw wine made from the Nosiola grape is popularly labelled as Vino Santo. A noticeable difference between the Trentino and Tuscan examples is that the Trentino wines are usually less oxidised due to the wines regularly being [...] "topped up" [...] to prevent a large <b>ullage.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The saignée (French for [...] "bleed") {{method is}} the {{practice}} of removing ("bleeding off") some of the juice from the must in order to more deeply concentrate the phenolics, colour and flavour the red wine. It {{has a long history}} of use in the French wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy but wasn't always used for rosé production. For some red winemakers, the juice bleed off is simply poured down the drain or used as [...] "topping wine" [...] to fill the <b>ullage</b> (the headspace of barrels and tanks) during storage. Its use in rosé production is sometimes considered an afterthought, as a way to increase cash-flow by producing a second wine to a primary red wine that can be released much sooner and available to market. While many wineries have been able to produce critically acclaimed rosé using the saignée method, its use has provoked criticism from wine personalities such as François Millo, president of the Provence Wine Council (CIVP) who claim that saignée method rosés are “not true rosés" [...] because the bleeding process (which is not pressed with the must) is more of an afterthought.|$|E
2500|$|Cars {{can build}} up static charge by driving on dry road surfaces. However many tire {{compounds}} contain enough carbon black {{to provide an}} electrical ground which prevents charge build-up. Newer [...] "high mileage" [...] tires use more silica and can increase the buildup of static. A driver who does not discharge static by contacting a conductive part of the car will carry it to the insulated handle of the nozzle and the static potential will eventually be discharged when this purposely-grounded arrangement is put {{into contact with the}} metallic filler neck of the vehicle. Ordinarily, vapor concentrations in the area of this filling operation are below the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the product being dispensed, so the static discharge causes no problem. The problem with ungrounded gas cans results from a combination of vehicular static charge, the potential between the container and the vehicle, and the loose fit between the grounded nozzle and the gas can. This last condition causes a rich vapor concentration in the <b>ullage</b> (the unfilled volume) of the gas can, and a discharge from the can to the grounded hanging hardware (the nozzle, hose, swivels and break-a-ways) can thus occur at a most inopportune point. The Petroleum Equipment Institute has recorded incidents of static-related ignition at refueling sites since early 2000.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ullage</b> motors (also {{known as}} <b>ullage</b> engines or [...] <b>ullage</b> rockets) are {{relatively}} small, independently fueled rocket engines {{that may be}} fired to accelerate the rocket prior to main engine ignition, when the vehicle is in a zero-g situation.|$|E
50|$|Two {{other methods}} in current use to inert fuel tanks are a foam {{suppressant}} system and an <b>ullage</b> system. The FAA {{has decided that}} the added weight of an <b>ullage</b> system makes it impractical for implementation in the aviation field. Some US Military aircraft still use nitrogen based foam inerting systems, and some companies will ship containers of fuel with an <b>ullage</b> system across train routes.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{the greater}} the amount of <b>ullage,</b> the more {{potential}} that the wine has been exposed to harmful levels of oxidation. This is why auction houses and retailers of mature wines {{pay close attention to}} the <b>ullage</b> levels in determining the resale value of the wine. The <b>ullage</b> level can also give insight as to the type of care and storage condition that the wine was kept in. Wines that have been kept at ambient humidity levels and in temperatures between 50-59°F (10-15°C) will experience evaporation and diffusion at a slower rate than wine kept in lesser conditions and will thus have a lower <b>ullage</b> levels. <b>Ullage</b> levels are generally important to the likelihood of almost any wine being in good shape. Vintage Port might be slightly less prone to damage since it is fortified, but the only wines that can not be damaged by oxidation are Madeira wines, which are already oxidized.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ullage</b> motors are {{typically}} very small; {{research shows that}} accelerations of the order 0.001 g are needed to avoid excessive gas intake. Some vehicles use other techniques to hold liquid at the inlet, as once the main engines are ignited, <b>ullage</b> motors are no longer required.|$|E

50|$|By further extension, in brewing {{and beer}} retail, <b>ullage</b> is {{the residue of}} beer left in a barrel that has been emptied. When calculating tax returns and the like, {{licensed}} premises owners, landlords or managers can factor in the duty on <b>ullage,</b> or unavoidable barrel wastage.Ullage therefore {{has come to be}} used as a general term, in the licensed trade, for waste beer whether at the barrel or at the bar tap or pump. However, what customers leave in their glasses does not count as <b>ullage,</b> because it has been sold.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>ullage</b> {{level of}} a wine bottle is {{sometimes}} described as the [...] "fill level". This describes {{the space between the}} wine and the bottom of the cork. During the bottling process, most wineries strive to have an initial <b>ullage</b> level of between 0.2-0.4 inches (5-10mm). As a cork is not a completely airtight sealant, some wine is lost through the process of evaporation and diffusion. As a wine ages in the bottle, the amount of <b>ullage</b> will continue to increase unless a wine is opened, topped up and recorked. If the wine is stored on its side, in contact with the cork, some wine will also be lost by absorption into the cork with longer corks having the potential to absorb more wine (and thus create more <b>ullage)</b> than shorter corks.|$|E
