25|$|The {{right to}} be heard in answer to charges before an {{unbiased}} tribunal is illustrated in the Singapore case Tan Boon Chee David v. Medical Council of Singapore (1980). During a disciplinary hearing, council members were either not conscientious about their attendance or did not attend the whole course of proceedings. This meant they did not hear all the oral evidence and submissions. The High Court held that this had substantially prejudiced the appellant and constituted a fundamental breach of natural justice. On the other hand, mere absence from a hearing does not necessarily lead to <b>undue</b> <b>prejudice.</b> It was held in Re Teo Choo Hong (1995) that the function of a lay member of a lawyers' disciplinary committee was to observe and not cast a vote or make a judgment. Thus, the appellant had not suffered <b>undue</b> <b>prejudice.</b>|$|E

This document, the issue of which was one of those touches that ensured the success of the Annexation, was a powerful summing up in colloquial language of the arguments used in the proclamation strengthened by quotations from the speeches of the President. It ends with these words: [...] "It remains only for me to beg of you to consider and weigh what I have said calmly and without <b>undue</b> <b>prejudice.</b> Let not mere feeling or sentiment prevail over your judgment. Accept what Her Majesty's Government intends shall be, and what you will soon find from experience, is a blessing not only to you and your children, but to the whole of South Africa through you, and I believe that I speak these words to you as a friend from my heart." ...|$|E

50|$|Virginia {{pleading}} practice {{differs from}} that of federal courts and many other states in that it offers no amendments to the pleadings as of right. If a plaintiff files an amended complaint, and the defendant responds to that pleading, both the filing and the response are a legal nullity. A party must instead seek and receive leave to amend before any amended pleading will be accepted, even if that amended pleading is filed before any response to the initial pleading has been received. However, Virginia courts are generally liberal in allowing parties to amend, absent <b>undue</b> delay or <b>prejudice</b> to a party.|$|R

40|$|A {{peculiar}} {{principle of}} legal evidence in common law systems is that probative evidence may be excluded {{in order to}} increase the accuracy of fact-finding. A formal model is provided that rationalizes this principle. The key assumption is that the fact-finders (jurors) have a cognitive cost of processing evidence, an assumption well grounded in the psychological literature. Within this framework, the judge excludes evidence in order to incentivize the jury to focus on other, more probative evidence. Our analysis sheds light on two distinctive characteristics of this type of exclusionary rules. First, that broad exclusionary powers are delegated to the judge. Second, that exclusion by <b>undue</b> <b>prejudice</b> is peculiar to common law systems. Both features arise in our model. 1 InformationAcquisitionandtheExclusionofEvidencei...|$|E

The {{influence}} of vehicle model and colour on assessments {{of speed and}} culpability: the case for (and against) Computer Generated Exhibits (CGE) The effects of stereotypes on perceptions of speed and culpability in a road traffic accident. International Review of Law and Technology., 26 (1), 37 - 48. Computer Generated Exhibits (CGE) are frequently deployed in legal contexts {{under the rubric of}} demonstrative evidence, i. e. to facilitate juror comprehension. However, a number of legal and academic commentators have suggested that the nature of the computerised moving image could exert <b>undue</b> <b>prejudice</b> on decision makers, e. g. judge and/or jury. The current study aimed to assess the manipulation of vehicle characteristics (make and colour) when a road traffic accident was presented in the format of a computer generated animation (CGA). In experiment 1, two groups of subjects watched two different makes of car, a Range Rover Sport and a Volkswagen Touran in a black-and-white format; no significant differences emerged over vehicle model with regards to vehicle speed or overall responsibility for the accident. Experiment 2 presented the same vehicles to four groups of participants in full colour, with the cars in contrasting red or beige; significant differences emerged with regards to culpability for vehicle make only. The findings could have implications for the format and style of CGE used in legal settings. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the use of}} expert testimony in prosecuting those charged with domestic abuse. Part I provides a background on the need and nature of expert testimony in domestic violence cases and the requirements for the admission of such expert testimony. It traces {{the development of the}} role of expert testimony in domestic violence cases from its initial exclusive use as a defense tool to support self-defense claims to its present use by prosecutors to explain a complainant 2 ̆ 7 s recantation or other puzzling behavior. Part II {{discusses the}} appellate cases that have addressed the admissibility and scope of expert testimony offered by the prosecution in domestic abuse cases. It then analyzes the proper uses of the expert testimony, including when the State may introduce the testimony and what guidelines courts should follow to ensure that its probative value outweighs any prejudicial effect on the defendant. Part III applies the existing case law to the uncharted issue of whether the courts should allow expert testimony to explain a complainant 2 ̆ 7 s outright refusal to testify. It explains that law enforcement needs to change the prototype of a domestic abuse prosecution from being victim-propelled to one where sufficient independent evidence of the crime is gathered to enable prosecutors to proceed without the victim 2 ̆ 7 s cooperation or participation. Concomitant with this shift in focus, prosecutors, such as those in the Moon case, should view expert testimony as an integral component of a victimless prosecution. Part III explains that courts should allow expert testimony to explain the characteristics of battered women to help the jury properly assess the state 2 ̆ 7 s evidence in light of the complainant 2 ̆ 7 s absence. By limiting the expert to explaining general aspects of battering and its effects, rather than addressing the particular victim or specific acts of violence, the courts will safeguard the defendant against <b>undue</b> <b>prejudice.</b> Over time, the propriety of defense use of expert testimony has been unanimously accepted by the courts. The same judicial acceptance is developing for prosecutorial use of expert testimony on battering. The relevance of the expert testimony is identical in both situations: It aids the jury in assessing the evidence by explaining the effect of battering on the witness. This article concludes that the developing trend of prosecutorial use of expert testimony is an appropriate and necessary tool in successfully prosecuting domestic violence cases...|$|E
