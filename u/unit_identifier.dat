50|$|Operationally, the Luftwaffe {{organization}} underwent {{changes in}} July 1938. Luftkreise were consolidated into three Luftwaffengruppenkommandos (Airforce Group Commands). As a result, on 1 August 1938, Luftwaffenkommando Ostpreußen (Airforce Command East Prussia) replaced Luftkreis 1. This change also rendered the three digit Geschwader identifiers meaningless. From 1 November 1938, Geschwader identifiers were changed universally. The third digit of the <b>Unit</b> <b>Identifier</b> {{was replaced with}} the same digit as its parent Luftwaffengruppenkommando. For example, all units under Luftwaffengruppenkommando 1 (headquartered in Berlin), had the third digit of their identifiers replaced with a '1'. For units under Luftwaffengruppenkommando Ostpreußen, the third digit was replaced with a zero.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, Gander saw {{its first}} {{military}} flying unit {{return to the}} area since the war when a detachment of 424 Squadron, flying CH-113 Labrador helicopters moved to CFS Gander to provide search and rescue (SAR) operations (this being in response to Canada declaring its 200 nmi km Exclusive Economic Zone offshore, resulting in increased Canadian fishing activities). Having found a permanent home at Gander, the SAR helicopters were no longer a 424 Squadron detachment and a new <b>unit</b> <b>identifier</b> was required. Thus, in May 1977, 103 Search and Rescue Flight was reactivated at Gander. Air Command (AIRCOM) also regained control of CFS Gander from Communications Command in May 1977, although Communications Command continued to operate the radio intercept facility. 103 Squadron was housed in a separate facility constructed {{some distance from the}} civilian airfield terminal.|$|E
50|$|The game also {{includes}} abstracted rules for ground combat. Terran land units are green while Imperium units are black. In addition to regular land units and planetary defense units that can oppose a landing, there are special drop troops that can {{land on a}} planet without requiring a ship to transport them to the surface. If one side is all standard troops {{and the other side}} is all drop troops, the standard troops gain a bonus artillery attack against the drop troops to simulate the inability of the drop troops to carry a lot of heavy vehicles with them. The ground units have a single combat factor, plus a symbol and a <b>unit</b> <b>identifier.</b> Surface combat used a combat differential with the defense combat factor subtracted from the attacker's combat factor. A die is then rolled to determine whether the unit is destroyed.|$|E

50|$|All {{units that}} respond from a fire station are {{identified}} {{over the radio}} by their type (Engine, Ladder, Quint, Rescue, Battalion, Division, etc.) followed by the station number (1, 2, 3, etc.).

If a station {{has more than one}} of the same type of apparatus responding from it, such as two rescues from one station, or two engines from one station, the apparatus type remains the same, but the number 2 precedes the station number. For example, the second rescue at station 46 is numbered Rescue 246. The second rescue at station 102 is identified as Rescue 2102. This numbering pattern continues for third, and fourth units respectively such as at Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (Station 10) with Truck 210, 310, and 410.|$|E

50|$|Quotron’s success {{attracted}} the attention of Robert S. Sinn, who observed its disadvantages: it could only give a last price. The opening price, high and low for the day, and share volume were not available. His system received the ticker transmissions from the various stock and commodity exchanges. These were then automatically interpreted by a hard wired digital computer updating a drum memory with the last sale prices {{and at the same time}} computing and updating highs and lows and total volume for each stock. As these items were updated a data packet would be generated for transmission by AT&T Dataphone at 1000 bits/second to identical magnetic drum storage devices in each major city in the United States. These slave drum memory units located in the metropolitan centers in the US could then be accessed by desk units in local stock brokerage offices again using Dataphone transmission. The desk units would set up the ticker symbol code for the desired stock by mechanical means actuating micro switches. The local control box would continuously interrogate each desk unit in sequence and send a request data packet by Dataphone to the local drum memory which would then send return data packets back to the local brokerage office. Each packet both for request and answer would contain the request stock alphabetic symbols plus a desk <b>unit</b> <b>identifier.</b> Because the desk units set up the requested stock code statically the desk unit would automatically update the stock price, volume, and highs and lows without any operator intervention because the control unit could complete the interrogation of all desk units in the office in about every one or two seconds, This is the first use of data packet transmission with the sender’s identification imbedded in the data packet in order to avoid switching- a forerunner of the internet? There was no switching in the entire system; all was done with data packets containing sender identifiers.|$|E

5000|$|In the Luftwaffe, {{there were}} {{centralized}} regulations on field camouflage patterns. In practice, these were either amended or ignored. Units in various areas used {{their own way}} of painting the aircraft excepting the Geschwaderkennung alphanumeric <b>unit</b> <b>identifiers.</b> <b>Units</b> in the very northern parts of Europe used pale blue wavy lines on a gray background. Night units of both fighters and bombers tended to color their aircraft completely black with a light brown or light gray pattern. This changed in early 1942: night fighters were painted a light gray on the upper surfaces and fuselage/nacelle sides, with light blue undersides, then over-sprayed with either irregular dark gray spots or irregular dark gray lines over all their upper surfaces. The irregular lines were meant to match the intricate patterns of ocean waves (usually called [...] "wave-mirror" [...] camouflage) {{as seen from the}} air, especially for interceptions of RAF night bombers over the North Sea. The nighttime skies over Germany usually had some light from either moonlight or even from city lights reflecting upwards into the skies, making a light base color effective for night fighters against sometimes cloudy or foggy skies below the night fighters' usual combat altitudes. Reconnaissance and maritime aircraft operating over the North Sea tended to paint the underside light blue and the top side in a dark gray or dark green to resemble the sea. By 1943, as economic conditions tightened, front line units used captured allied paint where available. Central control over camouflage relaxed even further.Later-deployed examples of both night fighters defending the Reich, and Heinkel He 177 heavy bombers used for night raids over England such as with Operation Steinbock, often returned to using flat black undersurfaces replacing the light blue previously used during the mid-war years, while retaining the skyglow-based light gray base color/darker gray [...] "wave-mirror" [...] irregular lines or irregular splotches on the upper surfaces. With units disbanding and reforming frequently, intricate patterns became less common. Dark green became more or less the standard. With deteriorating conditions and scarce supplies, various motley color schemes were used. This changed only for those day fighter and [...] "destroyer" [...] units that flew as part of the Defense of the Reich (Reichsverteidigung) campaign. Later in 1944 these units adopted the pattern of a distinct color band, or two-colored bands, around the aft fuselage, with each Geschwader usually having their own unique combination.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{essential}} {{characteristic of}} a signed language corpus {{is that it has}} been anno-tated, and not, contrary to the practice of many signed language researchers, that it has been transcribed. Annotations are necessary for corpus-based investigations of signed or spoken languages. Multi-media annotation software can now be used to transform a recording into a machine-readable text without it first being necessary to transcribe the text, provided that linguistic units are uniquely identified and annotations subsequently appended to these <b>units.</b> These unique <b>identifiers</b> are here referred to as ID-glosses. The use of ID-glosses is only possible if a reference lexical database (i. e., dictionary) exists as the result of prior foundation research into the lexicon. In short, the creators of signed language corpora should prioritize annotation above transcription, and ensure that signs are identified using unique gloss-based annotations. Without this the whole rationale for corpus-creation is un-dermined...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) stocks and changes under {{different}} land use systems can help determine vulnerability to land degradation. Such information {{is important for}} countries in and areas with high susceptibility to desertification. SOC stocks, and predicted changes between 2000 and 2030, were determined at the national scale for Jordan using The Global Environment Facility Soil Organic Carbon (GEFSOC) Modelling System. For {{the purpose of this}} study, Jordan was divided into three natural regions (The Jordan Valley, the Uplands and the Badia) and three developmental regions (North, Middle and South). Based on this division, Jordan was divided into five zones (based on the dominant land use) : the Jordan Valley, the North Uplands, the Middle Uplands, the South Uplands and the Badia. This information was merged using GIS, along with a map of rainfall isohyets, to produce a map with 498 polygons. Each of these was given a unique ID, a land management <b>unit</b> <b>identifier</b> and was characterized in terms of its dominant soil type. Historical land use data, current land use and future land use change scenarios were also assembled, forming major inputs of the modelling system. The GEFSOC Modelling System was then run to produce C stocks in Jordan for the years 1990, 2000 and 2030. The results were compared with conventional methods of estimating carbon stocks, such as the mapping based SOTER method. The results of these comparisons showed that the model runs are acceptable, taking into consideration the limited availability of long-term experimental soil data {{that can be used to}} validate them. The main findings of this research show that between 2000 and 2030, SOC may increase in heavily used areas under irrigation and will likely decrease in grazed rangelands that cover most of Jordan giving an overall decrease in total SOC over time if the land is indeed used under the estimated forms of land use.

40|$|Annotations are an {{important}} resource in corpus-based linguistic research. In fact, the most important feature of a modern signed language corpus should be {{that it has been}} annotated rather than simply transcribed. Digital multi-media annotation software can now transform language recordings into machine-readable texts using gloss-based annotations without it first being necessary to transcribe these utterances, provided that sign tokens are identified and discriminated according to type. Further annotations can subsequently be appended to these <b>units.</b> However, unique <b>identifiers</b> of sign types (or ‘ID-glosses’) can only be used if a comprehensive reference lexical database of the language already exists. In order to create a basic multi-purpose reference signed language corpus, therefore, linguists should prioritize annotation using ID-glosses above transcription.

5000|$|The {{sequence}} and picture parameter-set mechanism decouples {{the transmission of}} infrequently changing information from the transmission of coded representations {{of the values of}} the samples in the video pictures. Each VCL NAL <b>unit</b> contains an <b>identifier</b> that refers to the content of the relevant picture parameter set and each picture parameter set contains an identifier that refers to the content of the relevant sequence parameter set. In this manner, a small amount of data (the identifier) can be used to refer to a larger amount of information (the parameter set) without repeating that information within each VCL NAL unit.Sequence and picture parameter sets can be sent well ahead of the VCL NAL units that they apply to, and can be repeated to provide robustness against data loss. In some applications, parameter sets may be sent within the channel that carries the VCL NAL units (termed [...] "in-band" [...] transmission). In other applications, it can be advantageous to convey the parameter sets [...] "out-of-band" [...] using a more reliable transport mechanism than the video channel itself.|$|R
40|$|Investigating Earth {{for life}} in extreme environments {{provides}} insight into what life might exist elsewhere in the universe. Many celestial bodies have dry and cold landscapes. On Earth the Andes Mountains that form the eastern border of the Atacama Desert in South America are marked by a very dry and cold environment. A previous study in the region, of a volcanic mountain with a summit above 6000 meters above sea level (m. a. s. l.), discovered a fumarole (geothermal vent) that supports an oasis of life in an otherwise barren landscape. This study re-sampled the same fumarole located at 5825 m. a. s. l. and a second fumarole near the summit at 6050 m. a. s. l., which is now the highest elevation fumarole ever investigated for biota. Additionally, three non-fumarole sites were sampled; two at 5825 m. a. s. l. and one at 6050 m. a. s. l. Biogeochemical parameters (enzyme activity, percent water, and percent carbon and nitrogen) were measured {{in addition to the}} creation of high-throughput DNA sequencing libraries of 16 S and 18 S rRNA operational taxonomic <b>unit</b> (OTU) <b>identifiers.</b> Sequence analysis and statistical tests were done {{to determine the effects of}} fumarolic activity, elevation, and biogeochemical parameters on community alpha and beta diversity. Fumarole samples had much higher alpha diversity than all non-fumarole samples, with over three times more bacterial and eukaryotic OTUs observed. Furthermore, beta diversity analyses revealed fumarolic soils closely clustered together, to the exclusion of non-fumarolic soils for all three domains of life. This pattern was shown to be statistically significant using Adonis, while elevation and biogeochemical properties were not a significant driver of community composition. These findings indicate that fumarolic activity allows the proliferation of complex microbial communities, even in environments that are seemingly devoid of life due to dry and cold conditions...|$|R
40|$|The report gives a {{complete}} defining {{description of the}} international algorithmic language ALGOL 60. This is a language suitable for expressing a large class of numerical processes in a form sufficiently concise for direct automatic translation into the language of programmed automatic computers. The introduction contains {{an account of the}} preparatory work leading up to the final conference, where the language was defined. In addition the notions reference language, publication language, and hardware representations are explained. In the first chapter a survey of the basic constituents and features of the language is given, and the formal notation, by which the syntactic structure is defined, is explained. The second chapter lists all the basic symbols, and the syntactic <b>units</b> known as <b>identifiers,</b> numbers, and strings are defined. Further, some important notions such as quantity and value are defined. The third chapter explains the rules for forming expressions, and the meaning of these expressions. Three different types of expressions exist: arithmetic, Boolean (logical), and designational. The fourth chapter describes the operational units of the language, known as statements. The basic statements are: assignment statements (evaluation of a formula), go to statements (explicit break of the sequence of execution of statements), dummy statements, and procedure statements (call for execution of a closed process, defined by a procedure declaration). The formation of more complex structures, having statement character, is explained. These include: conditional statements, for statements, compound statements, and blocks. In the fifth chapter the units known as declarations, serving for defining permanent properties of the units entering into a process described in the language, are defined. The report ends with two detailed examples of the use of the language, and an alphabetic index of definitions...|$|R
