25|$|I cannot <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> idle {{discussing}} religion. If we are honest—and {{scientists have}} to be—we {{must admit that}} religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E
500|$|On August 28, the FBI New York {{field office}} {{requested}} that {{a criminal case}} be opened to determine whether Mihdhar {{was still in the}} United States, but the request was refused. The FBI ended up treating Mihdhar as an intelligence case, which meant that the FBI's criminal investigators could not work on the case, due to the barrier separating intelligence and criminal case operations. [...] An agent in the New York office sent an e-mail to FBI headquarters saying, [...] "Whatever has happened to this, someday someone will die, and the public will not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> were not more effective and throwing every resource we had at certain 'problems.'" [...] The reply from headquarters was, [...] "we [...] are all frustrated with this issue ... hese are the rules. NSLU does not make them up." ...|$|E
500|$|Aaliyah {{was known}} to have usually been {{accompanied}} by {{members of her family}} and the [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] filming was credited by Rashad Haughton as being the first and only time her family was not present. In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad {{had to take care of}} my mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said in the last year of her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E

Friends raised their eyebrows in horror, before inquiring if we had seen [...] "that Panorama programme". My grandmother politely inquired <b>why</b> <b>we</b> wanted to go to [...] "that shmatte place". As I left for the airport, I got a sweet good-bye text from my house-mate. [...] "Have a lovely trip. Please don’t get Jew-bashed." ...|$|R

But after the [...] {{whipping}} was over, mamma did {{not allow us to}} leave her until we [...] were perfectly happy, and perfectly <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> had been [...] whipped. I never remember having felt the least bit bitterly toward [...] mamma for punishing me. I always felt I had deserved my punishment, [...] and was much happier for having received it. For after mamma had [...] punished us and shown her displeasure, she showed no signs of [...] further displeasure, but acted as if we had not displeased her in [...] any way.|$|R
2500|$|The Sunday Telegraph's {{claim that}} Engel came {{low on the}} list of 'value for money' MPs was itself criticised by The Guardian for failing to mention that Engel had two periods of {{maternity}} leave whilst Engel herself wrote an article linking the expenses and hours of Parliament to the difficulties of raising a young family. [...] "The expenses debate... has forced MPs to talk to the people they represent... Only when people realise that we split our time between constituency and Westminster can they begin to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> even have a second-home allowance." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{the chagrin}} of long-time fans, the band waited until 2010 to perform live, despite having been {{together}} (as Shadow Gallery) since the early 1990s. When asked the question in one interview, Wehrkamp explained that [...] "We have always been more a studio band than a performing band unfortunately, and while we rehearsed for a tour just before Tyranny was started, a few obstacles blocked our touring options, and we were locked back in the studio to make another record. I know {{there are many people}} who cannot <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> haven't played in support of this record, and I can see why they feel that way, but honestly, it's very difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza was a thoroughgoing determinist {{who held}} that {{absolutely}} {{everything that happens}} occurs through the operation of necessity. For him, even human behaviour is fully determined, with freedom being our capacity to know we are determined and to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> act as we do. By forming more [...] "adequate" [...] ideas {{about what we do}} and our emotions or affections, we become the adequate cause of our effects (internal or external), which entails an increase in activity (versus passivity). This means that we become both more free and more like God, as Spinoza argues in the Scholium to Prop. 49, Part II. However, Spinoza also held that everything must necessarily happen the way that it does.|$|E
60|$|Hiram's {{explanation}} {{was not so}} plain that I could <b>understand</b> fully <b>why</b> <b>we</b> {{had been sent to}} throw up intrenchments simply that they might prove to be our grave, and for the moment I gave way to anger, even charging General Ward and those around him with having needlessly sacrificed our lives.|$|R

2500|$|Clarence Hickman {{was born}} on a farm {{established}} by his grandfather Leak on August 16, 1889. The nearest town was Lizton, Indiana to the south. Clarence and his siblings attended the Leak country school until 1898, when the family moved northward to the Job Hadley farm, where the children attended another country school. In both residences, Clarence pursued an interest in archery, playing with bows and arrows made by his father. By his own account, The arrows had heavy heads so {{that we did not}} need feathers to guide the arrow.... We boys shot fish with bows, using umbrella staves as arrows. I well remember that I could not <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> had to aim under the fish to hit it. [...] It was not until I attended high school, where I learned about refraction of light, that I understood this phenomenon.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} Deputies Committee meeting on {{terrorism}} held in April 2001, Clarke strongly {{suggested that the}} U.S. put pressure on both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda by arming the Northern Alliance and other groups in Afghanistan. Simultaneously, that they target bin Laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the MQ-1 Predators. To which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz responded, [...] "Well, I just don't <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> are beginning by talking about this one man bin Laden." [...] Clarke replied that {{he was talking about}} bin Laden and his network because it posed [...] "an immediate and serious threat to the United States." [...] According to Clarke, Wolfowitz turned to him and said, [...] "You give bin Laden too much credit. He could not do all these things like the 1993 attack on New York, not without a state sponsor. Just because FBI and CIA have failed to find the linkages does not mean they don't exist." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} live recording of a November 1958 performance at Philadelphia's Latin Casino, but the mono recording of the concert was disregarded by producer Al Ham who wanted the album recorded in stereo. Bennett and Basie were then reunited in the studio a month later to recreate the live concert. Fake applause was dubbed onto the original release of In Person! by Ham, and placed in incorrect places on the album. The effect was poorly received and removed for the album's 1994 re-issue. In his autobiography, The Good Life, Bennett wrote that [...] "I never <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> didn't release the live version. The whole attempt at fabricating an audience was in bad taste" [...] and {{that as a result of}} the experience he had always preferred the second album he recorded with Basie that year, Strike Up the Band.|$|R
2500|$|By 1975, {{the band}} began feeling stale and {{felt they had}} {{achieved}} as much success in the UK and Europe that they could. Furthermore, their 1975 movie Slade in Flame received a mixed reception and the band's latest UK tour had seen a less-than-frantic rush for tickets in contrast to their 1973 tour. Slade and their manager Chas Chandler decided that the next best career move was to try and crack America. The band agreed to move to there and build a reputation for their live performances from scratch, {{just as they had}} in the UK. Holder said in 1975: [...] "During the past five years when the band peaked, we did five major tours of Britain, six tours of Europe, two tours of Australia, two of Japan, visited the USA a few times, made a film... you can <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> felt more than a little jaded. We reckoned that we needed to undertake a fresh challenge to regain that old spark." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{shortly before}} the Iraq War, Schäuble accused German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of [...] "strengthening Saddam Hussein" [...] by {{undermining}} the unanimity of international pressure on Iraq {{to open up to}} United Nations weapons inspectors. On Schröder's initiative to join forces with President Jacques Chirac of France and President Vladimir Putin of Russia in opposing the war, Schäuble commented: [...] "This triangular relationship involving Berlin, Paris and Moscow was a dangerous development. It was very dangerous for the small countries in Europe because they perceived it as an axis and you can <b>understand</b> <b>why.</b> <b>We</b> want good relations with Russia but we do not want those relations to be misunderstood." [...] Schäuble, in contrast to many German politicians, subsequently defended the United States' decision to invade Iraq. By 2006, he said he thought the overthrow of Saddam Hussein was in itself correct, but that he was [...] "doubtful" [...] from the outset about the Iraq war because it resulted from a unilateral decision by the US.|$|E
2500|$|... "Werner Heisenberg [...] recollects a {{friendly}} conversation among young {{participants at the}} 1927 Solvay Conference, about Einstein and Planck's views on religion. Wolfgang Pauli, Heisenberg, and Dirac took part in it. Dirac's contribution was a poignant and clear criticism of the political manipulation of religion, that was much appreciated for its lucidity by Bohr, when Heisenberg reported it to him later. Among other things, Dirac said: [...] "I cannot <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> idle discussing religion. If we are honest – and as scientists honesty is our precise duty – we cannot help but admit that any religion is a pack of false statements, deprived of any real foundation. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} human imagination. [...] I do not recognize any religious myth, at least because they contradict one another. [...] " [...] Heisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli had kept silent, after some initial remarks. But when finally he was asked for his opinion, jokingly he said: [...] "Well, I'd say that also our friend Dirac has got a religion and the first commandment of this religion is 'God does not exist and Paul Dirac is his prophet'". Everybody burst into laughter, including Dirac.|$|E
5000|$|The {{announcement}} of the casting of Angelina Jolie {{in the role of}} Mariane Pearl drew criticism within the African-American community. Orville Lloyd Douglas, a pop critic, has criticized the casting because, he said, [...] "Jolie is white" [...] and Mariane Pearl is [...] "mixed race". In fact, Pearl is the multi-racial daughter of a Dutch-Jewish father and an Afro-Chinese-Cuban mother.Pearl personally chose Jolie to play the lead in A Mighty Heart. [...] In response to casting complaints, Pearl said [...] "I have heard some criticism about her casting, but it is not about the color of your skin. It is about who you are. I asked her to play the role—even though she is way more beautiful than I am—because I felt a real kinship to her. She put her whole heart into it, and I think she <b>understood</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should do this movie. We had something to say that we knew we should say together." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{designing}} the game, Avalanche Software focused {{not only on}} the inclusion of the NFC-enabled Marvel figurines, but improving the Toybox mode (especially for younger players) as well. Jimmy Pitaro, president of Disney Interactive Studios stated [...] "we wanted to take everything that worked so well and make it epic." [...] Each character was picked based on how they would fit in the game, as said by TQ Jefferson, [...] "what you're going to see as we roll out and reveal more characters, is that they're going to be more characters that you've known forever and they make sense," [...] Jefferson said. [...] "And the other characters, you may not know them as well, but once you see them in-game, you're going to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> made the choices that we made. These characters bring a certain narrative strength with them and, just as important, they bring a unique bit of gameplay with them ... characters that are the most fun to play ... that have the most impact on story. Once you see the full spectrum of characters, it's not just an Avengers game. It's very much a Marvel super heroes game." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{sociology}} of punishment seeks to <b>understand</b> <b>why</b> and how <b>we</b> punish; the general justifying aim of punishment and {{the principle of}} distribution. Punishment involves the intentional infliction of pain and/or the deprivation of rights and liberties. Sociologists of punishment usually examine state-sanctioned acts in relation to law-breaking; why, for instance, citizens give consent to the legitimation of acts of violence.|$|R
