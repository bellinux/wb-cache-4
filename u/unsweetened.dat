5|$|Two hot {{beverages}} that Palestinians consume is coffee—served in {{the morning}} and throughout the day—and tea which is often sipped in the evening. Tea is usually flavored with na'ana (mint) or maramiyyeh (sage). The coffee of choice is usually Turkish or Arabic coffee. Arabic coffee is similar to Turkish coffee, but the former is spiced with cardamom and is usually <b>unsweetened.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arak is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, <b>unsweetened</b> anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit juice to create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.|$|E
5|$|A UK Kennel Club survey {{puts the}} median {{lifespan}} of Miniature Schnauzers {{at a little}} over 12 years. About 20% lived to >15 years. While generally a healthy breed, Miniature Schnauzers may suffer health problems associated with high fat levels. Such problems include hyperlipidemia, which may increase the possibility of pancreatitis, though either may form independently. Other issues which may affect this breed are diabetes, bladder stones and eye problems. Feeding the dog low- or non-fatty and <b>unsweetened</b> foods may help avoid these problems. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to comedone syndrome, a condition that produces pus filled bumps, usually on their backs, {{which can be treated}} with a variety of methods. Miniature Schnauzers should have their ears dried after swimming due to a risk of infection, especially those with uncropped ears; ear examinations {{should be part of the}} regular annual check up. Miniature Schnauzers are also prone to von Willebrand disease (vWD). vWD in dogs is an inherited bleeding disorder that occurs due to qualitative or quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric protein that is required for platelet adhesion.|$|E

25|$|<b>Unsweetened</b> {{chocolate}} is pure chocolate liquor, {{also known as}} bitter or baking chocolate. It is unadulterated chocolate: the pure, ground, roasted chocolate beans impart a strong, deep chocolate flavor. It is typically used in baking or other products to which sugar and other ingredients are added. Raw chocolate, {{often referred to as}} raw cacao, is always dark and a minimum of 75% cacao.|$|E
25|$|In Italy (particularly in the south), Spain and France, {{liquorice}} {{is popular}} {{in its natural}} form. The root of the plant is simply dug up, washed, dried, and chewed as a mouth freshener. Throughout Italy, <b>unsweetened</b> liquorice is consumed {{in the form of}} small black pieces made only from 100% pure liquorice extract; the taste is bitter. In Calabria a popular liqueur is made from pure liquorice extract.|$|E
25|$|Bitterness is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various bittering agents. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, <b>unsweetened</b> cocoa, South American mate, bitter gourd, olives, citrus peel, many plants in the Brassicaceae family, dandelion greens, wild chicory, and escarole. The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and orange in bitters. Quinine is also known for its bitter taste and is found in tonic water.|$|E
500|$|Cincinnati chili (or Cincinnati-style chili) is a Mediterranean-spiced meat sauce {{used as a}} topping for {{spaghetti}} (a [...] "two-way") or {{hot dogs}} ("coneys"), both dishes developed by Macedonian immigrant restaurateurs in the 1920s. Ingredients include ground beef, stock, tomato paste, spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, cumin, and chili powder, <b>unsweetened</b> dark chocolate and bay leaf, in a soup-like consistency. Other toppings include cheese, onions, and beans; specific combinations of toppings are known as [...] "ways". The name [...] "Cincinnati chili" [...] is often confusing to those unfamiliar with it, who expect the dish {{to be similar to}} chili con carne; as a result, it is common for those encountering {{it for the first time}} to conclude it is a poor example of chili.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Cincinnati chili" [...] {{is often}} {{confusing}} to those unfamiliar {{with it because}} the term [...] "chili" [...] evokes the expectation of chili con carne, which it [...] "bears no resemblance to." [...] Cincinnati chili is a Mediterranean-spiced meat sauce for spaghetti or hot dogs and is very seldom eaten by the bowl as is typical with chili con carne. It is common for Cincinnatians to describe it starting with, [...] "Well, it's not really chili..." [...] Cincinnati chili is always seasoned with cinnamon, allspice, cloves, cumin, nutmeg, and chili pepper. Many recipes call for {{a small amount of}} dark <b>unsweetened</b> chocolate, but according to Dann Woellert, author of The Authentic History of Cincinnati Chili, [...] "There is no chili parlor in Cincinnati that uses chocolate in its chili." [...] It is normally of a thin consistency, closer to a soup than a stew, and contains no chunks of meat or vegetables, though it is common to find large pieces of cayenne pepper hulls in Empress chili. The consistency, seasonings, and serving method are more similar to pasta sauce or the spiced meat sauces used to top hot dogs in Rochester and other parts of Upstate New York, Rhode Island, and Michigan than they are to chili con carne.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{types of}} {{chocolate}} can be distinguished. Pure, <b>unsweetened</b> chocolate, often called [...] "baking chocolate", contains primarily cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions. Much of the chocolate consumed today {{is in the}} form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.|$|E
2500|$|Oral {{rehydration}} solution (ORS) (a slightly sweetened {{and salty}} water) {{can be used}} to prevent dehydration. Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (<b>unsweetened),</b> and <b>unsweetened</b> fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt (3 grams) and two tablespoons sugar (18 grams) added (approximately the [...] "taste of tears"). Rehydration Project recommends adding the same amount of sugar but only one-half a teaspoon of salt, stating that this more dilute approach is less risky with very little loss of effectiveness. Both agree that drinks with too much sugar or salt can make dehydration worse.|$|E
2500|$|Crème Chantilly {{is another}} name for whipped cream. [...] The {{difference}} between [...] "whipped cream" [...] and [...] "crème Chantilly" [...] is not systematic. [...] Some authors distinguish between the two, with crème Chantilly being sweetened, and whipped cream not. [...] However, most authors treat the two as synonyms, with both being sweetened, neither being sweetened, or treating sweetening as optional. Many authors use {{only one of the}} two names (for the sweetened or <b>unsweetened</b> version), so it is not clear if they distinguish the two.|$|E
2500|$|According to Canadian Food and Drug Regulations, a [...] "chocolate product" [...] is a {{food product}} that is sourced from at least one [...] "cocoa product" [...] and {{contains}} {{at least one of}} the following: [...] "chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate, sweet chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate." [...] A [...] "cocoa product" [...] is defined as a food {{product that is}} sourced from cocoa beans and contains [...] "cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, <b>unsweetened</b> chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder." ...|$|E
2500|$|Arak or araq (...) is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof, commonly 50% Alc. Vol./100 proof) in the anis drinks family. It is a clear, colorless, <b>unsweetened</b> anise-flavored distilled alcoholic drink. The Persian (Iranian) {{version of}} Arak (commonly called Arak Saggi) {{does not contain}} anise, as it is usually produced from ‌raisins, dates or saccharum plant. Despite {{the majority of the}} Middle East being Muslim, arak is the traditional alcoholic beverage in the Arab world, especially in the Levant/Mashriq and also in the Maghreb, as well in Iran and Turkey.|$|E
2500|$|Rakı is an <b>unsweetened,</b> {{occasionally}} (depending on area of production) anise-flavored, {{alcoholic drink}} that is popular in Turkey, Albania, Greece (where it is distinctly different and comes as an unflavoured distillate, unlike its Turkish counterpart), Iran, [...] Turkic countries, {{and in the}} Balkan countries as an apéritif. It is often served with seafood or meze. [...] It is similar to several other alcoholic beverages available around the Mediterranean and the Middle East, e.g. pastis, ouzo, sambuca, arak, Aragh Sagi and aguardiente. In Turkey and Greece, it is considered a national drink.|$|E
2500|$|In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia, an <b>unsweetened</b> and {{unsalted}} yogurt drink {{usually called}} simply jogurt {{is a popular}} accompaniment to burek and other baked goods. Sweetened yogurt drinks are the usual form in Europe (including the UK) and the US, containing fruit and added sweeteners. These are typically called [...] "drinkable yogurt". Also available are [...] "yogurt smoothies", which contain {{a higher proportion of}} fruit and are more like smoothies. In Ecuador, yogurt smoothies flavored with native fruit are served with pan de yuca as a common type of fast food. In Turkey, yogurt soup or Yayla Çorbası is a popular way of consuming yogurt. The soup is a mix of yogurt, rice, flour and dried mint.|$|E
2500|$|In Mali, {{gunpowder}} tea {{is served}} in series of three, {{starting with the}} highest oxidisation or strongest, <b>unsweetened</b> tea, locally referred to as [...] "strong like death", followed by a second serving, where the same tea leaves are boiled again with some sugar added ("pleasant as life"), and a third one, where the same tea leaves are boiled {{for the third time}} with yet more sugar added ("sweet as love"). Green tea is the central ingredient of a distinctly Malian custom, the [...] "Grin", an informal social gathering that cuts across social and economic lines, starting in front of family compound gates in the afternoons and extending late into the night, and is widely popular in Bamako and other large urban areas.|$|E
2500|$|Moving {{into the}} 17th century, <b>unsweetened</b> or honey-sweetened waffles and oublies – often made of non-wheat grains – were the type {{generally}} {{accessible to the}} average citizen. The wheat-based and particularly the sugar-sweetened varieties, while present throughout Europe, were prohibitively expensive {{for all but the}} monarchy and bourgeoisie. Even for the Dutch, who controlled much of the mid-century sugar trade, a kilogram of sugar was worth ½ an ounce of silver (the equivalent of ~$7 for a 5lb. bag, 01/2016 spot silver prices), while, elsewhere in Europe, it fetched twice the price of opium. The wealthier families' waffles, known often as mestiers, were, [...] "...smaller, thinner and above all more delicate, being composed of egg yolks, sugar, and the finest of the finest flour, mixed in white wine. One serves them at the table like dessert pastry." ...|$|E
2500|$|Users have {{experimented with}} various {{alternative}} flavours and syrups, including snow cone syrup, concentrates from real fruit juices, powdered drink mixes and home-made or supermarket concoctions. [...] A few small independent vendors offer speciality flavours such as soft drink syrups with real cane sugar. A modern {{version of the}} [...] "Hires Root Beer kit" [...] <b>unsweetened</b> concentrate is distributed by the Hires Big H drive-in restaurant chain, but its users must add both sugar and carbonated water. Other manufacturers have tried to make syrups that are more compatible with SodaStream, such as Rio, which makes both a concentrated version that can be sweetened with sugar or other sweeteners, or a fully sweetened version that is ready to use. The use of these syrups has been met with mixed reviews, thought their popularity seems to have increased since SodaStream changed their flavor offerings and formulation.|$|E

60|$|Mrs. Kelly kept two {{ordinary}} in-door {{servants to}} assist {{in the work of the}} house; one, an antiquated female named Sally, who was more devoted to her tea-pot than ever was any bacchanalian to his glass. Were there four different teas in the inn in one evening, she would have drained the pot after each, though she burst in the effort. Sally was, in all, an honest woman, and certainly a religious one;--she never neglected her devotional duties, confessed with most scrupulous accuracy the various peccadillos of which she might consider herself guilty; and it was thought, with reason, by those who knew her best, that all the extra prayers she said,--and they were very many,--were in atonement for commissions of continual petty larceny with regard to sugar. On this subject did her old mistress quarrel with her, her young mistress ridicule her; of this sin did her fellow-servant accuse her; and, doubtless, for this sin did her Priest continually reprove her; but in vain. Though she would not own it, there was always sugar in her pocket, and though she declared that she usually drank her tea <b>unsweetened,</b> those who had come upon her unawares had seen her extracting the pinches of moist brown saccharine from the huge slit in her petticoat, and could not believe her.|$|E
