5|$|By {{the time}} that Whetstone had reached Hispaniola, Du Casse had already departed. Benbow's force {{subsequently}} sighted the French on 19 August, sailing off Cape Santa Marta. The French had three transports and four warships carrying between 68 and 70 guns, while Benbow commanded seven ships carrying between 50 and 70 guns. The English forces were heavily scattered, and the light winds meant that they were slow to regroup. They did not achieve a form of collective order <b>until</b> <b>four</b> in the afternoon, after which a partial engagement was fought, lasting about two hours, until nightfall caused the fleets to temporarily break off.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Deady {{spent the}} next four years working for his father on the family farm, engaged in manual labor, while also reading {{extensively}} in his spare time. On February 17, 1841, he left home after a disagreement with his father and moved to Barnesville, Ohio. For four years he lived with the family of John Kelly, working as a blacksmith’s apprentice. Beginning in 1843, Deady attended Barnesville Academy, continuing his education there <b>until</b> <b>four</b> months beyond the time that his blacksmith apprenticeship ended. The apprenticeship had paid {{for the first six months}} of school. At the school he earned a certificate that allowed him to become a teacher on July 7, 1845, from his instructor Nathan R. Smith.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 11July, four days after sailing, Convoy Faith was {{attacked}} by three Condors. Both troopships were severely damaged and subsequently sunk by torpedoes from the escorts; over 100 of the personnel aboard the two ships were killed. The freighter escaped unscathed, but was damaged in a second air attack on 12July en route to Casablanca. The loss of the two troopships delayed the movement of a division of West African soldiers to India <b>until</b> <b>four</b> replacements arrived.|$|E

5|$|The French {{crews of}} Henri IV {{received}} a telegraph from Admiral de Gueydon, {{suggesting that the}} bombardment of the city would begin soon, which the crews welcomed with enthusiasm. By then, a large crowd of people in Rabat and Salé had gathered to observe the French ships after they were spotted by Moroccan artillery operators. Admiral de Gueydon decided against starting the bombardment until consul Elton was aboard Caton; the consul did not come aboard the ship <b>until</b> <b>four</b> hours later. At dawn on 26 November though, the British steamer Janus joined Caton, and took the consul as its passenger.|$|E
5|$|Although Waugh {{made his}} ODI debut against Pakistan in December 1988, {{he did not}} score his first century <b>until</b> <b>four</b> years later. Between his debut and the 1996 World Cup he made five centuries, all against {{different}} opponents. Waugh was more prolific at the 1996 World Cup scoring three centuries. Waugh set {{the record for the}} highest individual score by an Australian when he made 173 against West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in February 2001. The following month he scored a match-winning 133 not out against India at the Nehru Stadium, Pune which also became his last century in the format. Despite a slow start to his ODI career, he became the third highest century-maker in ODIs at the time of scoring his last century.|$|E
5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower <b>until</b> <b>four</b> to five years after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George recommends a sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E

5|$|For {{his support}} he was {{promoted}} to lieutenant colonel and joined the new General Staff. For seven months, between October 1945 and April 1946, Castillo Armas received training at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, coming in contact with American intelligence officers. After serving on the General Staff, he became director of the military academy until early 1949, at which point he was made the military commander at Mazatenango, a remote military garrison. He was at Mazatenango when Arana launched a failed coup attempt against Arévalo on 18July 1949, and was killed: Castillo Armas did not hear of the revolt <b>until</b> <b>four</b> days later. Historians differ on what happened to him at this point. Piero Gleijeses writes that Castillo Armas was expelled from the country following the coup attempt against Arévalo. Nick Cullather and Andrew Fraser, however, state that Castillo Armas was arrested in August 1949, that Árbenz had him imprisoned under doubtful charges until December 1949, and that he was found in Honduras a month later.|$|E
5|$|Jay Lethal {{defended the}} TNA X Division Championship against Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Johnny Devine, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt in the 2008 TNA Xscape match {{to open the}} event. In this match, the six {{competitors}} fought <b>until</b> <b>four</b> were eliminated by pinfall or submission; the two remaining wrestlers then fought {{to escape from the}} cage, with the first to do so the winner. The duration of the contest was 10 minutes and 45 seconds. Dutt was the first eliminated in the bout by Devine with a roll-up pin at 2 minutes and 50 seconds. The second was Shark Boy at 4 minutes and 30 seconds, after Creed performed his signature Creed-DT maneuver. At 7 minutes and 15 seconds, Creed was eliminated by Curry Man after his signature Spice Rack maneuver. Curry Man was the last eliminated at 8 minutes and 40 seconds by Devine following his signature Devine Intervention maneuver. With the match down to two competitors, Devine and Lethal fought to escape the cage. Lethal escaped the cage first, thus winning the match and retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
5|$|The Weather Bureau {{predicted}} Flora {{to turn to}} {{the northwest}} after entering the Windward Passage and affect the Bahamas. Forecasters advised those in The Bahamas to quickly complete preparations, though the eye of the hurricane did not pass over the archipelago <b>until</b> <b>four</b> days later. When Flora turned to the northeast out to sea, forecasters again advised Bahamian citizens to prepare for the hurricane, and on October 9, weather advisories advised the southeastern Bahamas to prepare for gale-force winds and strong tides. One advisory considered there to be less than a 50% chance of the hurricane reaching southeastern Florida, though weather bulletins advised Florida citizens to monitor the hurricane. At its closest approach to Florida, the hurricane remained 330miles (530km) away, though gale warnings were issued from Stuart to Key West due to the hurricane's large size.|$|E

5|$|The nilgai is diurnal (active mainly {{during the}} day). The animals band {{together}} in three distinct kinds of groups: {{one or two}} females with young calves, three to six adult and yearling females with calves, and all-male groups with two to 18 members. Typically tame, the nilgai may appear timid and cautious if harassed or alarmed; it flees up to -or even , galloping away from the source of danger. Herbivores, nilgai prefer grasses and herbs, though they commonly eat woody plants in the dry tropical forests of India. Females become sexually mature by two years, while males do not become sexually active <b>until</b> <b>four</b> or five years old. The {{time of the year}} when mating takes place varies geographically, but a peak breeding season lasting three to four months can be observed at most places. Gestation lasts eight to nine months, following which a single calf (sometimes twins or even triplets) is born. As typical of several bovid species, nilgai calves stay hidden for the first few weeks of their lives. The lifespan of the nilgai is around ten years.|$|E
5|$|June had offseason foot {{surgery in}} February 2008. During the opening {{game of the}} season, Brooks {{suffered}} a hamstring injury and removed himself from {{the game in the}} third quarter, which fueled speculation during the following week that he would miss the first start of his fourteen-year career and that June would start on the weakside. Brooks, however, made his 194th-consecutive start the following week. In a story not published <b>until</b> <b>four</b> weeks later, Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson claims that June attempted to injure him in a November 16 game. June made his first interception of the season and second as a Buccaneer on a Drew Brees pass that was tipped by Ronde Barber in the twelfth game of the season as Tampa earned its fourth consecutive victory to improve its record to 93 on November 30 against the New Orleans Saints. After the Buccaneers lost their final four games to miss the playoffs, the Buccaneers replaced Jon Gruden and Bruce Allen with Raheem Morris and Mark Dominik as head coach and general manager. The team subsequently released five veteran players in a move that was said to be unrelated to the salary cap. June was released by the Buccaneers on February 25, 2009 along with Derrick Brooks, Ike Hilliard, Warrick Dunn and Joey Galloway. The transaction avoided a $2million roster bonus for June.|$|E
