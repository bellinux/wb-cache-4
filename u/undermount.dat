5000|$|High-end acrylic drop-in (lowered {{into the}} countertop) and <b>undermount</b> (attached from the bottom) sinks are {{becoming}} more popular, although {{they tend to be}} easily damaged by hard objects - like scouring a cast iron frying pan in the sink.|$|E
50|$|The game {{is played}} in a first person perspective, instead of the third person {{viewpoint}} of the four preceding titles, and is also the first game in the Conflict series which does not feature four main characters. Denied Ops is based around two CIA operatives, each having his own weapon and style: a sniper named Lincoln Graves who uses an SR-25 with an <b>undermounted</b> M26 MASS, and a machine gun operator named Reggie Lang who uses an M249 PARA with an <b>undermounted</b> M320 grenade launcher. The two characters have quite opposite personalities. Lang is rather loud and noisy while Graves is quiet and stealthy.|$|R
50|$|The E36/5 {{made use}} of the older {{semi-trailing}} arm rear axle, {{as opposed to the}} E36's Z-Axle Multi-link suspension. As the trailing arm design was smaller, it allowed for a lower trunk floor height, fold-down rear seats, and an exterior <b>undermounted</b> compact spare tire.|$|R
40|$|Epistemology {{emerges from}} the study of the ways {{knowledge}} is gained in the different fields of scientific endeavor. Current polemics on the nature of psychoanalytic knowledge involve counterposed misconceptions of the nature of mind. On one side clinical psychoanalysis is under siege from philosophical “hard science ” stalwarts who, upholding as the unitary model of scientific knowledge the Galilean model of science built around the “well-behaved ” variables of mechanics and cosmology, argue clinical psychoanalysis does not meet empirical criteria for the validation of its claims. On the other side, its empirical character is renounced by hermeneuticists who, agreeing with “hard science ” advocates on what science is, dismiss the animal nature of human beings and hold that clinical psychoanalysis is not an empirical science but a “human ” interpretive one. Taking Adolf Grünbaum’s critique as its referent, this paper examines how, by ignoring the differences between “exact ” and observational science, the “hard science ” demand for well-behaved variables misconstrues the nature of events in the realm of mind. Criteria for an epistemology fit for the facts of clinical psychoanalysis as an empirical, observational science of mind are then proposed [...] it keeps close to the facts in its field of study, seeks to solve the immediate problems of observation [...] —Freud The empirical status of the clinical psychoanalytic method is <b>undermounting</b> challenges from two unlike stances which, I hold, disregard essential qualities of “mind. ” On one side the method’s empirical cogency is dismissed by such “hard science ” stalwarts as Ernest Nagel (1959), Karl Popper (1963, 1983), and Adolf Grünbaum (1984, 1993), who hold that in spite of Freud’s methodological sophistication its findings do not attain evidential, probative status. Such appraisals ja...|$|R
50|$|The SC-20K {{returns with}} a {{multitude}} of new attachments, such as a foregrip that reduces recoil and increases accuracy, a launcher that fires non-lethal weaponry, an <b>undermount</b> shotgun attachment for close quarters firing, and a prototype 20mm sniper attachment for long-range combat. The SC-20K now uses a reflex sight that zooms to 1.5x magnification, while the sniper scope allows from 1.5x to 3.5x magnification.|$|E

5000|$|Chateau Royale is a {{multi-story}} residential condominium {{located in}} downtown Hamilton, Ontario, Canada on James Street South near Augusta Street. Standing at 14-stories (70.0 metres) {{it is the}} 19th tallest building in the city. It opened in 2006 after being transformed from an office tower complex into a condominium complex. Originally the office tower complex {{was known as the}} <b>Undermount</b> Office Complex [...] and before the Office Complex this was the site of The Alexandra, a roller rink which opened on Christmas Day 1906. It became a popular entertainment spot that featured skating, dancing and big band music. The roller rink closed down 30 April 1964 and was torn down soon thereafter.|$|E
50|$|Bottom-mount or under-mount sinks are {{installed}} below the countertop surface. The {{edge of the}} countertop material is exposed at the hole created for the sink (and so must be a carefully finished edge rather than a rough cut). The sink is then clamped {{to the bottom of}} the material from below. Especially for bottom-mount sinks, silicone-based sealants are usually used to assure a waterproof joint between the sink and the countertop material. Advantages of an <b>undermount</b> sink include superior ergonomics and a contemporary look; disadvantages include extra cost in both the sink and the counter top. Also, no matter how carefully the cut out is made, the result is either a small ledge or overhang at the interface with the sink. This can create an environment for catching dirt and allowing germs to grow.|$|E
50|$|The Avery Company, {{founded by}} Robert Hanneman Avery, was an American farm tractor {{manufacturer}} famed for its undermounted engine which resembled a railroad engine {{more than a}} conventional farm steam engine. Avery founded the farm implement business after the Civil War. His company built a large line of products, including steam engines, beginning in 1891. The company started with a return flue design and later adapted the <b>undermount</b> style, including a bulldog design on the smokebox door. Their design was well received by farmers in central Illinois. They expanded their market nationwide and overseas until the 1920s, when they failed to innovate and the company faltered. They manufactured trucks {{for a period of}} time, and then automobiles. until they finally succumbed to an agricultural crisis and the Depression.|$|E
