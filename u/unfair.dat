5|$|He was a vocal {{critic of}} Jews, {{accusing them of}} <b>unfair</b> competition.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{dismissed}} meritocracy as a sham, {{arguing that}} it was <b>unfair</b> to consider the two streams equivalent for admissions purposes. Though ostensibly open to non-Bumiputra, critics alleged that most who took matriculation were Malays.|$|E
5|$|It {{would be}} <b>unfair</b> {{to place the}} entire weight of many {{comparatively}} small losses upon the shoulders of one person in such cases.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} was widely {{received}} as {{inferior to the}} first, {{but it has been}} noted that this may be slightly <b>unfair.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bodyline, {{also known}} as fast leg theory bowling, was a cricketing tactic devised by the English cricket team for their 1932–33 Ashes tour of Australia, {{specifically}} to combat the extraordinary batting skill of Australia's Don Bradman. England's use of a tactic perceived by some as overly aggressive or even <b>unfair</b> ultimately threatened diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries before the situation was calmed.|$|E
5|$|Coke's meaning {{has been}} disputed over the years; some {{interpret}} his judgment as referring to {{judicial review of}} statutes to correct misunderstandings which would render them <b>unfair,</b> while others argue he meant that the common law courts {{have the power to}} completely strike down those statutes they deem to be repugnant.|$|E
5|$|French breeders of polled Limousins {{claimed that}} the breed {{standard}} that prevented their animals being recorded in the French Herd Book provided an <b>unfair</b> export advantage to foreign countries {{that do not have}} similar restrictions. The French recording ban was removed in July 2007 with the introduction of the Purebred class, but so far no polled Limousin have yet been accepted and registered as Full French.|$|E
5|$|He {{argued against}} funding to build Washington, D.C.'s infrastructure, stating {{that it was}} <b>unfair</b> to expect state {{citizens}} {{to pay for the}} city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some members}} of the Indian freedom {{struggle}} such as Nehru felt that Sastri was too sympathetic to the British rulers, and too co-operative with them. This was especially apparent at the Round table conferences where Sastri and his party member agreed to the <b>unfair</b> proposals of the British.|$|E
5|$|Morgan appealed his {{conviction}} {{on the grounds}} that it was <b>unfair</b> due to the level of publicity the case had received. His application was rejected by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales on 5 February 1998 after the three sitting judges ruled there were insufficient grounds to justify an appeal.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 2000, {{during a}} game with Manchester City, he {{ruptured}} his anterior cruciate ligaments, keeping him out of action for several months. He was awarded a testimonial against Manchester City in August 2000, but got into a dispute with the club over the financial arrangements. He then left the club in November 2000, and issued employment tribunal proceedings for <b>unfair</b> dismissal.|$|E
5|$|Richard John Charles Tomlinson (born 13 January 1963) is {{a former}} officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). He {{believes}} he was subject to <b>unfair</b> dismissal from MI6 in 1995, and attempted to take his former employer to a tribunal. MI6 refused, arguing that {{to do so would}} breach state security, although Tomlinson disputed this reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Some Iranian {{newspapers}} avoided {{mentioning the}} character, presumably to avoid offending Iran's clerical rulers. On March 2009, Javad Shamaqdari, cultural adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, demanded an apology from {{a delegation of}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences actors and producers visiting Iran for what he characterized as negative and <b>unfair</b> portrayals of the Islamic republic in The Wrestler and other Hollywood films.|$|E
5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's fandom {{is often}} criticized, mostly due to {{negative}} generalization of the community. Scott Cawthon made a post on Steam regarding these claims, defending the fandom and criticizing the wider community for the <b>unfair</b> generalization.|$|E
5|$|The NLRB {{applied a}} right it had {{recently}} announced in Quality Mfg. Co. and then clarified in Mobil Oil Corp. that employees in unionized workplaces {{had a right}} under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) {{to the presence of}} a union representative during any inquiry where the employee's job might be in jeopardy. The NLRB had explained in those decisions that having a union representative present was an exercise of the right to the 'mutual aid and protection' protected by Section 7. Therefore, an employer's refusal of such presence was an <b>unfair</b> labor practice and actionable under the NLRA. As a result, the NLRB found that Weingarten had engaged in an <b>unfair</b> labor practice by refusing Collins a representative and Weingarten appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{say there}} was no popular concern; by 2005 for example a chorus of US {{executives}} along with trade union and mid-ranking government officials had been speaking out about what they perceived to be <b>unfair</b> trade practices by China.|$|E
5|$|A bodyline {{delivery}} was {{one where}} the cricket ball was bowled at {{the body of the}} batsman, in the hope that when he defended himself with his bat, a resulting deflection could be caught by one of several fielders standing close by. This was considered by critics to be intimidatory and physically threatening, {{to the point of being}} <b>unfair</b> in a game that was supposed to uphold gentlemanly traditions.|$|E
5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine {{was brought in}} to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was <b>unfair,</b> particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E
5|$|Concerning drugs, Paul {{has criticized}} {{mandatory}} minimums {{that he believes}} have led to unreasonably harsh sentences for repeat offenders. He has highlighted the case of Timothy L. Tyler as particularly <b>unfair.</b> Paul {{does not believe in}} legalizing the recreational use of drugs like marijuana and cocaine, but does not support jailing marijuana users. He supports state laws to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Paul was one of three U.S. senators in 2015 to introduce a bipartisan bill, CARERS, that would legalize medical marijuana under federal law.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s to the present, Apple {{has been}} {{plaintiff}} or defendant in civil {{actions in the}} United States and other countries. Some of these actions have determined significant case law for the information technology industry and many have {{captured the attention of}} the public and media. Apple's litigation generally involves intellectual property disputes, but the company has also been a party in lawsuits that include antitrust claims, consumer actions, commercial <b>unfair</b> trade practice suits, defamation claims, and corporate espionage, among other matters.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Woods and golfer Arnold Palmer {{initiated}} {{a case against}} Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) {{and others in the}} effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and <b>Unfair</b> Trade Practices Act. Palmer was also named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, the UK National Consumer Council (NCC, now Consumer Focus) {{called on}} the UK's Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to {{investigate}} Apple's EULA, claiming Apple's EULA, and those of multiple other technology companies, misled consumers and infringed legal rights. The NCC's product complaint included Apple's iLife as well as Microsoft's Office for Mac, and products by Corel, Adobe, Symantec, Kaspersky, McAfee, and others. The OFT determined the licensing agreements were <b>unfair</b> and Apple agreed to improve its terms and conditions to make them clearer and fairer to consumers.|$|E
5|$|In New York, Michael {{manages to}} talk to Wallace, who has {{seemingly}} been avoiding him, and complains that it is <b>unfair</b> {{that he has to}} drive to New York in order {{to talk to}} him instead of on the phone, and that he deserves more respect after being at Dunder Mifflin for fifteen years. David agrees to fund an anniversary party for him and attend, but Michael abruptly announces his resignation from the company and walks out.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of countries, mainly in Asia, {{legislation}} or corporate practice has introduced formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid {{leave of absence from}} their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is <b>unfair</b> to men.|$|E
5|$|In early November, about 50 players renewed {{talks of}} union {{decertification}} if the union went lower than 52.5% of BRI or agreed to additional restrictions on contracts, salary-cap exceptions, or free agency. Decertifying {{would require that}} 30% of the union—about 130 players—sign a petition, allowing an election {{under the auspices of}} the NLRB by all NBPA members to decertify with a simple majority. The NLRB traditionally does not consider a decertification petition while a charge is pending, such as the NBPA's <b>unfair</b> labor practice charges filed in August.|$|E
5|$|In the 2006 presidential election, Lukashenko {{was opposed}} by Alaksandar Milinkievič, who {{represented}} {{a coalition of}} opposition parties, and by Alaksandar Kazulin of the Social Democrats. Kazulin was detained and beaten by police during protests surrounding the All Belarusian People's Assembly. Lukashenko won the election with 80% of the vote; the Russian Federation and the CIS deemed the vote open and fair while the OSCE and other organizations called the election <b>unfair.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Dunstan became {{well known for}} his {{campaign}} {{against the death penalty}} being imposed on Max Stuart, who was convicted of rape and murder of a small girl. He harried Playford aggressively over the matter, creating an uproar over what he saw as an <b>unfair</b> process. Playford eventually relented, and appeared shaken thereafter; the event was seen as {{a turning point in the}} LCL's decline, and Labor gained momentum. During Labor's time in opposition, Dunstan was prominent in securing some reforms in Aboriginal rights, and was at the forefront of Labor abandoning the White Australia Policy.|$|E
5|$|Industry representatives {{complained that}} the final rule overstated the {{environmental}} effects of corn ethanol, and also criticized the inclusion of ILUC as an <b>unfair</b> penalty to domestic corn ethanol because deforestation {{in the developing world}} was being tied to U.S. ethanol production. The 2011 limit for LCFS means that Mid-west corn ethanol failed, unless current carbon intensity was reduced. Oil industry representatives {{complained that the}} standard left oil refiners with few options, such as Brazilian sugarcane ethanol, with its accompanying tariff. CARB officials and environmentalists counter that time and economic incentives will allow produces to adapt.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} on 22 March 2013 that West Ham {{had signed a}} 99-year lease for the Olympic Stadium after the government agreed to put in an extra million towards the costs of converting the site. The club's plan was {{to move into the}} stadium {{prior to the start of}} the 2016–17 season. Supporters of rival clubs had pressed for an inquiry into the granting of West Ham's tenancy, arguing that West Ham were being given an <b>unfair</b> advantage by the arrangement. In September 2015, however, the government rejected holding such an inquiry.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{judgment}} {{has been}} criticised as being unusually short-sighted because {{he failed to}} see that while his decision was correct for that particular case, the precedent it would set would create an <b>unfair</b> monopoly for the booksellers and publishers. This {{was one of only}} a small number of cases in which Mansfield was overruled; in his entire career only six of his judgments were overturned by a higher court. Mansfield's judgement here has been seen as part of a wider agenda; along with other legal figures such as Sir William Blackstone, he was personally in favour of a perpetual copyright.|$|E
5|$|Military {{thinking}} shifted rapidly. Given {{the lack}} of equipment and properly trained men, Ironside had {{had little choice but}} to adopt a strategy of static warfare, but it was soon perceived that this would not be sufficient. Ironside has been criticised for having a siege mentality, but some consider this <b>unfair,</b> as he is believed to have understood the limits of the stop lines and never expected them to hold out indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Nigeria regained {{democracy}} in 1999 when it elected Olusegun Obasanjo, the former military head of state, {{as the new}} President of Nigeria. This ended almost 33 years of military rule (from 1966 until 1999), excluding the short-lived second republic (between 1979 and 1983) by military dictators who seized power in coups d'état and counter-coups during the Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998. Although the elections that brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and <b>unfair,</b> Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.|$|E
5|$|On November2, {{following}} an investigation, President Corazon Aquino ordered Sulpicio Lines temporarily closed {{while the government}} was asked to inspect the company's crews and ships. Company officials felt that the indefinite closing was <b>unfair</b> and argued it would disrupt shipping across the island nation, and that the inspection can take place without shutting the entire company down. Typhoon Ruby {{was the first of}} three tropical cyclones to affect the island chain in a span of a mere two weeks; Ruby was followed by Tropical Storm Tess and Typhoon Skip in early November1988.|$|E
5|$|Rome's revenue equaled {{the amount}} of the {{successful}} bids to farm the taxes. The tax farmers' profits consisted of additional amounts they could forcibly wring from the populace with Rome's blessing or turning a blind eye. Lack of effective supervision, combined with tax farmers' desire to maximize their profits, produced a system of arbitrary exactions regarded quite rightly as barbarously cruel to taxpayers, <b>unfair,</b> and very harmful to investment and the economy.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was <b>unfair</b> to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was <b>unfair</b> to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Steph is {{diagnosed}} with cervical cancer {{and does not}} tell Gilly, who later finds out from Cheryl. Gilly is angry at Steph for keeping this from him. Steph undergoes a hysterectomy to remove the cancer. However, doctors tell her and Gilly it failed. She is soon told her cancer is terminal. Gilly takes the news bad. The pair split up when Steph feels it is <b>unfair</b> on Gilly, but they get back together and start to plan their wedding. Gilly and Steph eventually get married beside the village river.|$|E
