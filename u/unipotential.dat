50|$|An einzel lens (from Einzellinse - single lens), or <b>unipotential</b> lens, is a charged {{particle}} lens that focuses without changing {{the energy of}} the beam. It consists of three or more sets of cylindrical or rectangular apertures or tubes in series along an axis. It is used in ion optics to focus ions in flight, which is accomplished through manipulation of the electric field {{in the path of the}} ions.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{computer}} code to design high-transmission cylindrical electrostratic lenses has been developed. Optimized geometries and voltages are determined using the CYLENS program enhanced with the simplex method of non-linear optimization. The possibility of improvements over <b>unipotential</b> lenses used in commercial instruments is predicted. The design of high-transmission <b>unipotential</b> lenses is described for such special purposes as time-of-flight mass spectrometry of organic ions or reflection geometry laser ionization mass spectrometry. Low accelerating voltage, {{in the first}} case and large working distance, in the second case have been realized, keeping the objective of high transmission. Asymmetric potential lenses were also investigated and, in the deceleration regime, {{they turned out to be}} superior to low accelerating voltage <b>unipotential</b> lenses. Misalignment and stability studies show that lens optimization provides less vulnerability towards anomalies in manufacturing or in operating conditions...|$|E

(2014) identify a postnatal self-renewing <b>unipotential</b> progenitor population capable of generating thymic medullary cells and {{lay the foundation for}} research into thymic regeneration...|$|E
40|$|An {{electron}} microscope has been constructed {{to test a}} number of new methods of obtaining photographs. The aim has been to obtain in as simple a manner as possible both as regards operation and construction a resolving power in the range of the greatest present usefulness of electron microscopy (say ten times better than light microscopy), and to operate in a voltage range sufficient to obtain this resolution for the usual thin specimens. The instrument is a combined electron and light microscope and utilizes <b>unipotential</b> electrostatic electron lenses...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{accurate}} {{method is}} presented of calculating the potential in lenses composed of three cylinders separated by two finite gaps under {{the form of}} an expansion of Bessel functions. The optical elements of mechanically symmetrical lenses, and, either <b>unipotential,</b> or electrically asymmetrical ones, have been computed. The results agree very well with those obtained by Read by means of the charge distribution method. The influence of the mechanical asymmetry on the optical properties has also been studied, and an important property has been pointed out : the optical properties depend essentially on the distance between the median planes of the two gaps and very little on the lengths of these gaps...|$|E
40|$|Human {{bone marrow}} {{contains}} cells which form leukocyte colonies in semisolid culture media. Each leukocyte colony arises {{from a single}} colony-forming cell which {{is thought to be}} a <b>unipotential</b> stem cell, and which is subject to regulation in vitro by colony-stimulating factor. In acute myelogenous leukemia variable abnormalities in colony formation by marrow cells occur. Usually colony formation either fails to occur or the colonies that are formed are small and contain fewer than 50 cells. Similar abnormalities have been described in bone marrow dysfunction preceding overt leukemia. Usually remission of leukemia is accompanied by improved cloning by marrow cells. In this study three patients are reported in whom remission was associated with impaired cloning, and one of these patients has remained in continuous remission for a further 18 months. These observations suggest that remission status is not necessarily associated with repopulation of the bone marrow by normal hematopoietic cells...|$|E
40|$|SummaryVertebrate {{hematopoiesis}} first produces primitive (embryonic) lineages {{and ultimately}} generates the definitive (adult) blood. Whereas definitive hematopoiesis may produce many diverse blood types via a common multipotent progenitor, primitive hematopoiesis has been thought to produce only erythrocytes or macrophages via progenitors that are unipotent for single blood lineages. Using {{a variety of}} in vivo cell-tracing techniques, we show that primitive blood in zebrafish derives from two different progenitor types. On the dorsal gastrula, blood progenitors are <b>unipotential</b> cells that divide infrequently, populate the rostral blood islands, and differentiate into macrophages. In contrast, on the ventral gastrula, blood progenitors are multipotential cells with rapid cell cycles; populate the intermediate cell mass; and differentiate into erythrocytes, neutrophils, and thrombocytes. Our results demonstrate the existence of primitive hematopoietic progenitors that are segregated very early in development and that are specified to produce either a unipotent or a multipotent blood cell lineage...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the heterogeneous antibody population produced in response to stimulation by an antigenic determinant represents the antibody product of numerous clones of cells, each cell and cell clone producing homogeneous antibody (1 - 6). Thus, the specificity of the immune response derives from selective stimulation of those cells, among an individual's entire precursor cell repertoire, whose antibody product reacts best with the stimulating antigenic determinant. This population would be unique for a given determinant, though elements of it may be stimulated by similar determinants. Inherent in the concept of <b>unipotential</b> cells is the ability of antigen to selectively stimulate such cells by interacting with a surface receptor whose chemical and specificity characteristics mimic those of its potential antibody product (7). Evidence exists for both the immunoglobulin nature of receptors (8 - 11) and their antibody-like specificity (10 - 13). Analyses of the parameters of antigenic stimulation of secondary immune responses, intended to verify the above hypothesis, have indicated that, in addition to accounting for the specificity of stimulation, the mechanism of antigenic stimulation must als...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the molecular mechanism(s) by which growth and differentiation of the primitive hematopoietic stem cell is initiated, {{as well as the}} means by which the maturing cell can commit to development along a specific cell lineage, we elected to study the Id family of helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcriptional regulators. Some members of the HLH family are expressed in a stage-specific manner during hematopoietic development and can regulate the ability of immature hematopoietic cells to terminally differentiate. None of the four Id family genes were detected in the most primitive progenitors. Id- 1 was widely expressed in proliferating bi- and <b>unipotential</b> progenitors, but its expression was downregulated in cells of increasing maturity; conversely, Id- 2 and, to a limited extent, Id- 3 gene expression increased as cells matured and lost proliferative capacity. Id- 2 expression ran counter to that of Id- 1 not only during maturation, but during periods of cell growth and arrest as well. This is quite distinct from the nonhematopoietic tissues, in which these two factors are coordinately expressed and suggests that Id- 1 and Id- 2 might be regulating very different events during hematopoiesis than they regulate in other cell types...|$|E
40|$|In the adult, {{platelets}} {{are derived}} from <b>unipotential</b> megakaryocyte colony-forming cells (Meg-CFCs) that arise from bipotential megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MEPs). To better define the developmental origin of the megakaryocyte lineage, several aspects of megakaryopoiesis, including progenitors, maturing megakaryocytes, and circulating platelets, were examined in the murine embryo. We found {{that a majority of}} hemangioblast precursors during early gastrulation contains megakaryocyte potential. Combining progenitor assays with immunohistochemical analysis, we identified 2 waves of MEPs in the yolk sac associated with the primitive and definitive erythroid lineages. Primitive MEPs emerge at E 7. 25 along with megakaryocyte and primitive erythroid progenitors, indicating that primitive hematopoiesis is bilineage in nature. Subsequently, definitive MEPs expand in the yolk sac with Meg-CFCs and definitive erythroid progenitors. The first GP 1 bβ-positive cells in the conceptus were identified in the yolk sac at E 9. 5, while large, highly reticulated platelets were detected in the embryonic bloodstream beginning at E 10. 5. At this time, the number of megakaryocyte progenitors begins to decline in the yolk sac and expand in the fetal liver. We conclude that the megakaryocyte lineage initially originates from hemangioblast precursors during early gastrulation and is closely associated both with primitive and with definitive erythroid lineages in the yolk sac prior to the transition of hematopoiesis to intraembryonic sites...|$|E
40|$|Fibroblast {{growth factors}} (FGFs) play an {{important}} role in hepatic induction during development. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of exogenous FGFs on ex vivo liver development. We begin our analysis by examining FGF signaling during early mouse liver development. Phospho-FGF receptor (Tyr 653 / 654) was detected in embryonic day 10 (E 10) to E 12 livers only. Next, E 10 livers were cultured in the presence of FGF 1, FGF 4, or FGF 8 for 72 hours and examined for histology, proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. FGFs especially FGF 8 promoted sheet-like architecture, cell proliferation, and survival as compared to the control. All FGFs induced a striking increase in the number of c-kit and α-fetoprotein-positive progenitors, without altering albumin staining. However these progenitors were CK- 19 -positive (biliary and bipotential progenitor marker) only in the presence of FGF 1 or FGF 4 and not FGF 8. FGFs also induced β-catenin, a stem cell renewal factor in these cultures. In conclusion, the presence of activated FGFR indicates a physiological role of FGF during early liver development. FGF 1 and FGF 4 enrich the embryonic liver cultures for bipotential hepatic progenitors. FGF 8 promotes such enrichment and induces a one-step differentiation toward a <b>unipotential</b> hepatocyte progenitor. Thus, FGFs might be useful for enrichment and propagation of developmental hepatic progenitors...|$|E
40|$|The adult rodent liver {{contains}} {{at least}} two recognized populations of cells with stem-like properties that contribute to liver repair/regeneration under different pathophysiological circumstances: (i) <b>unipotential</b> committed progenitor cells (differentiated hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells) and (ii) multipotential nonparenchymal progenitor cells (oval cells). In retrorsine-induced hepatocellular injury the capacity of fully differentiated rat hepatocytes to replicate is severely impaired and massive proliferation of oval cells does not occur. Nevertheless, retrorsine-exposed rats can replace their entire liver mass after 2 / 3 surgical partial hepatectomy through the emergence and expansion of a population of small hepatocyte-like progenitor cells that expresses phenotypic characteristics of fetal hepatoblasts, oval cells, and fully differentiated hepatocytes, but differ distinctly from each type of cell. The activation, proliferation, and complete regeneration of normal liver structure from small hepatocyte-like progenitor cells have not been recognized in other models of liver injury characterized by impaired hepatocyte replication. We suggest that the selective emergence and expansion of small hepatocyte-like progenitor cells observed in the retrorsine model reflect a novel mechanism of complete liver regeneration in the adult rat. Furthermore, we suggest that these cells may represent a novel progenitor cell population that (i) responds to liver deficit when the replication capacity of differentiated hepatocytes is impaired, (ii) expresses an extensive proliferative capacity, (iii) can give rise to large numbers of progeny hepatocytes, and (iv) can restore tissue mass...|$|E
40|$|To {{progress}} in the monitoring and understanding of soil water processes, geophysical methods can be helpful because they are noninvasive and as such do not disturb either the structure or the water dynamics of the soil. In this study we attempt to image water infiltration dynamics under a tension infiltrometer in a vertical two-dimensional (2 D) plane using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). Two-dimensional images of soil electrical resistivity at different times were obtained using a Wenner array with 32 electrodes and a 10 -cm spacing during the infiltration of a Cl– or Br– solution at 0. 36 and 0. 34 M, respectively. This procedure allowed monitoring {{the development of the}} infiltration bulb through time. Both <b>unipotential</b> and multipotential infiltrations were performed and used to derive soil hydraulic conductivity and sorptivity values. Anion concentrations in soil samples taken after infiltration were compared with resistivity values obtained with ERT measurements. The axisymetrical pattern of the multipotential infiltration exhibited large distortions, well detected and imaged by the ERT and consistent with the anion concentration data. In general, images derived from 2 D inversions of ERT measurements underestimated the depth of the infiltration bulb. Axisymetrical inversion software would be helpful for the interpretation of ERT data taken below tension disc infiltrometers. The ERT on a small scale seems a helpful and promising tool for deriving in situ soil hydraulic parameters and for monitoring infiltration processes without the need for placing sensors into the soil...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} {{cells that}} {{have the ability to}} proliferate and differentiate into all epithelial components of the liver lobule, we isolated fetal liver epithelial cells (FLEC) from ED 14 Fischer (F) 344 rats and transplanted these cells in conjunction with two-thirds partial hepatectomy into the liver of normal and retrorsine (Rs) treated syngeneic dipeptidyl peptidase IV mutant (DPPIV−) F 344 rats. Using dual label immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization, three subpopulations of FLEC were identified: cells expressing both α-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin, but not CK- 19; cells expressing CK- 19, but not AFP or albumin, and cells expressing AFP, albumin, and cytokeratins- 19 (CK- 19). Proliferation, differentiation, and expansion of transplanted FLEC differed significantly in the two models. In normal liver, 1 to 2 weeks after transplantation, mainly cells with a single phenotype, hepatocytic (expressing AFP and albumin) or bile ductular (expressing only CK- 19), had proliferated. In Rs-treated rats, in which the proliferative capacity of endogenous hepatocytes is impaired, transplanted cells showed mainly a dual phenotype (expressing both AFP/albumin and CK- 19). One month after transplantation, DPPIV+ FLEC engrafted into the parenchyma exhibited an hepatocytic phenotype and generated new hepatic cord structures. FLEC, localized in the vicinity of bile ducts, exhibited a biliary epithelial phenotype and formed new bile duct structures or were incorporated into pre-existing bile ducts. In the absence of a proliferative stimulus, ED 14 FLEC did not proliferate or differentiate. Our results demonstrate that 14 -day fetal liver contains lineage committed (<b>unipotential)</b> and uncommitted (bipotential) progenitor cells exerting different repopulating capacities, which are affected by the proliferative status of the recipient liver and the host site within the liver where the transplanted cells become engrafted. These findings have important implications in future studies directed toward liver repopulation and ex vivo gene therapy...|$|E
