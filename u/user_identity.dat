30|$|User's privacy: There are {{two major}} privacy issues of concern for mobile networks: <b>user's</b> <b>identity</b> and location. Since {{sometimes}} the <b>user's</b> real <b>identity</b> is sensitive to adversaries [6] or the linkable <b>identity</b> of a <b>user</b> is useful in mining his/her behavior, the <b>user's</b> <b>identity</b> and associated information must be kept secret from outsiders {{as well as the}} mobile user's current location.|$|R
40|$|User {{mobility}} is {{a feature}} that raises many new security-related issues and concerns. One {{of them is the}} disclosure of a mobile <b>user's</b> <b>identity</b> during the authentication process, or other procedures specific to mobile networks. Such disclosure allows an unauthorized third-party to track the mobile user's movements and current whereabouts. Depending on the context, access to any information related to a mobile user's location or activity without his consent can be a serious violation of his privacy. This new issue might be seen as a conflicting requirement with respect to authentication: anonymity requires hiding the <b>user's</b> <b>identity</b> while authentication requires the <b>user's</b> <b>identity</b> to be revealed in order to be proved. What is needed is a single mechanism reconciling both authentication and privacy of a mobile <b>user's</b> <b>identity.</b> The basic solution to this problem is the use of aliases. Aliases insure anonymity by hiding the <b>user's</b> <b>identity</b> as well as his relationship with domain authoriti [...] ...|$|R

Then any user may use this master public key and also use the <b>user’s</b> <b>identity</b> to generate the user’s public.
