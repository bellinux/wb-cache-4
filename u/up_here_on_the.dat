6000|$|... "It's queer {{this spring}} is away <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} hill," [...] remarked Spouter. [...] "That water must flow {{underground}} from the mountains yonder." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame Muller {{went down}} for lunch," [...] Felicia answered. [...] "I said that I had a headache, and stole <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chance of seeing you." ...|$|E
50|$|The town {{is said to}} {{have been}} named after the Mughal general Raja Man Singh as he is {{believed}} to have set <b>up</b> camp <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> banks of the Gouriganga River, while on his way to Orissa on a military expedition.|$|R
60|$|Up {{the stairs}} to a {{marvelous}} bathroom with tempting shower-baths, a small gymnasium, and, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof, a garden and loggia and basket-ball court. It was cool and fresh <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> even <b>the</b> hottest summer evenings, and here the girls were permitted to lounge in negligées till after ten, Mrs. Fike remarked, with a half-smile.|$|R
6000|$|There was a {{wry smile}} on Ormond's face when he spoke again: [...] "It's {{certainly}} a perilous position, and a somewhat unusual one. You and I--of all men--to be hung <b>up</b> <b>here</b> together <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brink of eternity. Still I, at least, am doubtful whether I'll ever get out again; there's something badly broken inside of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} why," [...] said Miss Panney, sharply, as {{she rose}} [...] "for it is not of any use in any other way, lying <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{were best}} for ee, for if thou go'st aboot saying thou'st seen men {{with guns and}} clubs <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moor, it ull be the worsest day's work ee've ever done." ...|$|E
60|$|Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, {{drowning}} their grief. A pause by the wayside. Tiptop {{position for}} a pub. Expect we'll pull <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure of it," [...] John {{answered}} earnestly. [...] "I {{appreciate that}} in my heart. Let us talk together, Stephen, as we used. I will admit that I have found most of <b>the</b> time <b>up</b> <b>here</b> wearisome. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, I am beginning to understand that I have been, and still am, very ignorant. There is {{so much in the}} world that one can only learn by experience." ...|$|R
60|$|Here, {{in a new}} shrine--in a hall {{inlaid with}} {{precious}} stones, under a roof supported by pillars of gold--the moon-god was set <b>up</b> and worshipped. <b>Here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> night when the shrine was completed, Vishnu the Preserver appeared to the three Brahmins in a dream.|$|R
50|$|James Grady (author), {{was born}} and grew <b>up</b> <b>here.</b> He was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> staff of Senator Lee Metcalf, a {{research}} columnist for Jack Anderson, author of Six Days of the Condor (filmed as Three Days...)and numerous other spy and crime novels, currently a writer for Politics Daily, resident of Washington DC area.|$|R
6000|$|... "You be {{safe enough}} here to-night, miss. My {{old man is}} snoring sound abed, and there's no other soul ever sets foot here o' nights, except it be the mermaids now and then. Goodness, Father, where's our boat? It ought to be <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pebbles." ...|$|E
60|$|He surged painfully up, {{sometimes}} {{having to}} cross a slope of black rock, that was blown bare of snow. Here {{he was afraid of}} falling, very much afraid of falling. And high <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crest, moved a wind that almost overpowered him with a sleep-heavy iciness. Only it was not here, the end, and he must still go on. His indefinite nausea would not let him stay.|$|E
60|$|It's lonely up here. In the {{old days}} I could have rung a bell and had a drink sent up to the room; but away <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fifteenth floor! Oh, no, they'd never send a drink clean up to the fifteenth floor. Of course, in {{the old days}}, I could have put on my canvas {{slippers}} and {{walked down to the}} bar and had a drink and talked to the bar-tender.|$|E
5000|$|... "The Black Sheep Boy is a fantastical {{character}} that crops <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. In the lyrics pretty much anything in quotes {{is the voice}} of the Black Sheep Boy. I {{think a lot of the}} dirtier, rougher, more obtuse songs are the product of the Black Sheep Boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|She had {{apparently}} a slight shade of hesitation, {{but in an}} instant it was all right; as what he showed {{he wanted to know}} she seemed mostly to give him. [...] "Yes--but far of course from <b>here.</b> <b>Up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill." [...] To which, after another instant, [...] "At The Mount, Castle Terrace," [...] she subjoined.|$|R
5000|$|The Old Post (stará pošta) in Kovalovice is an {{original}} period building dating from 1785, which {{now serves as}} a hotel and restaurant. On 28 November 1805 the French cavalry general Murat set <b>up</b> his headquarters <b>here.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> day of battle, the Russian general Bagration had his headquarters here. After the battle, Napoleon slept in this house and held preliminary negotiations about an armistice. A small museum is dedicated to commemorate these events.|$|R
6000|$|Folsom's {{voice was}} lost in the bustle of getting settled, but Mrs. Folsom's voice rose above the clamor. [...] "I was tellin' him it was about time we got neighborly. I never let anybody come to town a week without callin' on 'em. It does a body a heap o' good to see a face outside the family once in a while, {{specially}} in a new place. How do you like <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was opportune of the band," [...] said March. [...] "It {{must have}} been a telepathic impulse from our patriotism in the director. But a pot pourri of American airs is like that tablet {{dedicating}} the American Park <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Schlossberg, which is signed by six Jews and one Irishman. The only thing in this medley that's the least characteristic or original is Dixie; and I'm glad the South has brought us back into the Union." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} Pupil, [...] "I {{have to stick}} closely to the cave; though I {{have been known to}} go fishing on days when there was no holiday. I have never seen the old man but once, and that was when he first took me. You know it wouldn't do for us to be too sociable. That wouldn't be hermit-like. He comes <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> afternoons I am out, and writes down what I am to do for the next half-week." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dromcollogher {{was one of}} the {{starting}} points for the Irish Co-Op Movement, with the first Co-Operative creamery being set <b>up</b> <b>here</b> in 1889 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> initiative of Horace Plunkett. The listed building has since been restored, and is now the National Dairy Cooperative Museum. Percy French, the renowned Irish Composer, once stayed here and composed the song [...] "There's Only One Street In Dromcollogher". This is in fact untrue as there are many streets in Dromcolligher and if you ask anyone from the area they will be proud to tell you so.|$|R
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1987 regular season, Wiggins spent some time as a {{designated}} hitter (DH) and shared second base duties with Burleson. Rookie second baseman Billy Ripken joined <b>the</b> club <b>on</b> July 10. Burleson was cut, but general manager Hank Peters said, [...] "We're not bringing [...] <b>up</b> <b>here</b> to sit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench." [...] Wiggins was hitting [...]242 on July 10, and he played mostly DH after the rookie's arrival. In early August, Wiggins received a three-day suspension after he got into an altercation with teammate Jim Dwyer and grabbed the shirt of Ripken Sr.|$|R
6000|$|We {{drove through}} the town--a hilly town of desolate clean houses. No living creatures visible behind the jealously-shut windows. No living creatures {{entering}} or departing through the sad-colored closed doors. No theater; no place of amusement except an empty town-hall, with a sad policeman meditating on its spruce white steps. No customers in the shops, and nobody to serve them behind the counter, {{even if they had}} turned <b>up.</b> <b>Here</b> and there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pavements, an inhabitant with a capacity for staring, and (apparently) a capacity for nothing else. I said to Reverend Finch's boy, [...] "Is this a rich place?" [...] Reverend Finch's boy brightened and answered, [...] "That it be!" [...] Good. At any rate, they don't enjoy themselves here--the infamous rich! ...|$|R
6000|$|Day before {{yesterday}} {{was a fine}} summer day away <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit. Aunt Marsh and Cousin May Marsh were here visiting Susie Crane and Livy at our farmhouse. By and by mother Langdon came up the hill in the [...] "high carriage" [...] with Nora the nurse and little Jervis (Charley Langdon's little boy)--Timothy the coachman driving. Behind these came Charley's wife and little girl in the buggy, with the new, young, spry, gray horse--a high-stepper. Theodore Crane arrived a little later.|$|E
6000|$|He tumbled off the seat, {{opened the}} locker, {{and had the}} {{portfolio}} open before him on the folding-table. It was full of drawings done in the peculiar flat style and conventional colours engineers adopt. And, in, addition there were some rather under-exposed photographs, obviously done by an amateur, at close quarters, of the actual machine's mutterings had made, in its shed near the Crystal Palace. Bert found he was trembling. [...] "Lord" [...] he said, [...] "here am I and the whole blessed secret of flying--lost <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof of everywhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I should think, by {{what passed}} to-day," [...] {{returned}} Mildred, laughing. [...] "Mr. Wycherly called {{out for a}} rope, and we just threw him one, {{to help him out}} of his difficulty. The moment he got his rope, though it was only yonder small signal-halyards, he felt himself as secure as if he stood <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> height, with acres of level ground around him. I do not think he was frightened, at any time; but when he got hold of that little rope, he was fairly valiant!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Byrd {{served in}} the Senate Democratic leadership. He succeeded George Smathers as {{secretary}} of the Senate Democratic Conference from 1967 to 1971. He unseated Ted Kennedy in 1971 to become majority whip, or the second highest-ranking Democrat, until 1977. Smathers recalled that, [...] "Ted was off playing. While Ted was away at Christmas, down in the islands, floating around having a good time with some of his friends, male and female, <b>here</b> was Bob <b>up</b> <b>here</b> calling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone. 'I want to do this, and would you help me?' He had it all committed so that when Teddy got back to town, Teddy didn't know what hit him, but it was already all over. That was Lyndon Johnson's style. Bob Byrd learned that from watching Lyndon Johnson." [...] Byrd himself had told Smathers that [...] " [...] I have never in my life played a game of cards. I have never in my life had a golf club in my hand. I have never in life hit a tennis ball. I have—believe it or not—never thrown a line over to catch a fish. I don't do any of those things. I have only had to work all my life. And every time you told me about swimming, I don't know how to swim." ...|$|R
5000|$|O'Flynn {{returned}} to Limerick in the mid-season transfer window on 21 June 2010.O'Flynn {{spoke of his}} delight <b>on</b> returning to <b>the</b> club he regards as home saying, [...] "I'm just delighted to be back. I was out of football for a year with injury when Pat Scully {{gave me a chance}} last year. I did well enough to earn a contract in England. Some of the players here were inexperienced last year but {{have come a long way}} in the last 12 months, I've been around a few years now and <b>the</b> set <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> and off <b>the</b> pitch is absolutely top-class, Pat O'Sullivan can take a lot of credit for that, what he's doing for soccer in Limerick is unbelievable. We're 16 years stuck in this Division and it's time we got back where we belong, rugby and Gaelic have taken over in terms of support in Limerick and it's time we changed that.|$|R
5000|$|Ben Borneman of Sputnikmusic gave a more mixed {{review of}} the album of the album, commenting that the {{individual}} members of [...] "Schoolyard Heroes can call their own shots as they as they experiment with their sound and hone their chops in this yet-to-be-defined genre. Let us hope they learn to play to their strengths, as Abominations is a fun, albeit uneven listen which offers the promise of some interesting material in the future." [...] Kosh Williams of Ultimare Guitar described that the album had parts that are both [...] "metal and punk popping <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record", noting [...] "but {{it would be too}} [...] "pop" [...] for metal lovers and too [...] "heavy" [...] for punks. It’s a great album only for one category of people—those who love experiments and something interesting.” ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit {{there still}} reigned {{comparative}} quietude. True {{that as he}} walked rapidly along Taurus Antinor spied {{from time to time}} groups of excited, chattering men congregated at street corners or under the shelter of a jutting portico; whilst now and then from behind the huge piles of builders' materials, which littered this portion of the Palatine, darkly swathed figures would emerge at sound of the praefect's footsteps on the flagstones, and as quickly vanish again. But to these Taurus Antinor paid no heed; they were but the remote echoes of the angry storm below.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let Jasper manage his own cutter, Mabel. His gift lies that-a-way, and I'll {{answer for}} it, {{no one can}} {{teach him how to}} keep the Scud {{out of the hands of}} the Frontenackers or their devilish Mingo friends. Who cares for round turns in kedges, and for hawsers that are topped too high, Master Cap, so long as the craft sails well, and keeps clear of the Frenchers? I will trust Jasper against all the {{seafarers}} of the coast, <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lakes; but I do not say he has any gift for the ocean, for there he has never been tried." ...|$|E
6000|$|Have {{we never}} our doubts, though, <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hill-tops? Ay, marry, have we! Are we {{so sure that}} these gospels we preach with all our hearts are the true and final ones? Who shall answer that question? For myself, as I lift up my eyes from my paper once more, my gaze falls first on the golden bracken that waves joyously over the {{sandstone}} ridge without, and then, within, on a little white shelf where lies the greatest book of our greatest philosopher. I open it at random and consult its sortes. What comfort and counsel has Herbert Spencer for those who venture to see otherwise than the mass of their contemporaries? ...|$|E
5000|$|Swan {{has also}} been known to {{experiment}} with rap and hip hop in Dance Gavin Dance's music. He first made a rap appearance in the song [...] "Powder to the People", <b>the</b> final track <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album Happiness. He has since rapped occasionally on every album since. In an interview with Substream Magazine, Swan spoke about his rap influences after being asked about his rap verse in the song [...] "Eagle Vs. Crows", from the album Instant Gratification (2015), stating: It literally came out of nowhere. I started on Happiness with a rap kind of inspired by TV <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Radio. Then after I proved that it would sound cool, it became something that would pop <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and there <b>on</b> <b>the</b> records. We never really plan for a rap going into the studio. There will just be a part where I feel a rap would fit best. I write it, show it to everyone and then record.|$|R

And, by George, she is good onshore, but somehow she don't keep <b>up</b> her lick <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water--gets seasick may be. She skips; she runs along regular enough till half-past eleven, and then, all of a sudden, she lets down. I've set that old {{regulator}} up faster and faster, till I've shoved it clear around, but it don't do any good; she just distances every watch in the ship, and clatters along in a way that's astonishing till it is noon, but them eight bells always gets in about ten minutes ahead of her anyway. I don't {{know what to do}} with her now. She's doing all she can--she's going her best gait, but it won't save her. Now, don't you know, there ain't a watch in the ship that's making better time than she is, but what does it signify? When you hear them eight bells you'll find her just about ten minutes short of her score sure." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> podium {{and in the}} subsequent press conference, where Hamilton was overjoyed at being back {{at the front of}} the field: [...] "It’s an incredible feeling to be back here after what feels such a long time away and with such a struggle with me and my team. But as I said <b>on</b> <b>the</b> in lap I am just so proud of the guys, as I go into the factory and I see how hard everyone is pushing. Everyone wants to win just as much as I do and they never gave up. They have never given up which is something very rare to see in such a large group of people. I am very, very proud of them. We didn’t expect to win this weekend. Undoubtedly we have caught up quite a bit but we never felt we had the pace to win. But the car felt fantastic and it is incredibly special to get back <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> not only <b>on</b> <b>the</b> podium, but to get a win. It is amazing." ...|$|R
