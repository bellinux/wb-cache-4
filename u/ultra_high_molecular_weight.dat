2500|$|In centuries past, a ship's rigging was {{typically}} fashioned from rope. In the 19th century this was {{commonly referred to}} as Manilla, a reference to the origin of much good quality rope. Traditionally the running rigging was easily recognized since, for flexibility, it was not coated with tar and therefore of a lighter color than the standing rigging which was tarred for protection from weather and therefore darker or even black in color. On modern vessels, running rigging is likely to be made from synthetic fibers, while the standing rigging is most often fashioned from stainless steel [...] "wire rope". Since the 1990s, several new synthetic fibers have become common, particularly on racing and other high-performance sailing boats. These fibers include <b>Ultra</b> <b>High</b> <b>Molecular</b> <b>Weight</b> Polyethylene [...] (UHMWPE) (also known as Spectra or Dynema), Vectran, and Technora.|$|E
2500|$|The {{replacement}} joint, {{which was}} known as the Low Friction Arthroplasty, was lubricated with synovial fluid. The small femoral head (...) was chosen for Charnley's belief that it would have lower friction against the acetabular component and thus wear out the acetabulum more slowly. Unfortunately, the smaller head dislocated more easily. Alternative designs with larger heads such as the Mueller prosthesis were proposed. Stability was improved, but acetabular wear and subsequent failure rates were increased with these designs. The Teflon acetabular components of Charnley's early designs failed within a year or two of implantation. This prompted a search for a more suitable material. A German salesman showed a polyethylene gear sample to Charnley's machinist, sparking the idea to use this material for the acetabular component. The <b>ultra</b> <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> polyethylene or UHMWPE acetabular component was introduced in 1962. Charnley's other major contribution was to use polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) bone cement to attach the two components to the bone. For over two decades, the Charnley Low Friction Arthroplasty, and derivative designs were the most used systems in the world. It formed the basis for all modern hip implants.|$|E

3000|$|Thus, it {{is found}} that in {{produced}} oil there are <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> paraffin hydrocarbons that are absent in the wax deposits formed in the borehole equipment during production of this crude oil. In other words, the <b>highest</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> n-alkanes do not precipitate out and remain dispersed in the oil. It should be noted that this fact is not surprising for mixture of individual n-alkanes in solvents and is predictable for crude oil. So, previously the polydispersity and cocrystallization of individual n-alkanes in solvents reduce the mass and <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> homolog fraction in a deposit formed using a coldfinger apparatus (Senra et al. 2008). As to crude oils, the share of <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> hydrocarbons in them is very low [a recurrence ratio of C n+ 1 /C n [...] is approximately 0.7 – 0.8 (Senra 2009)]; therefore, the n-alkanes that will crystallize out at the cloud point should not necessarily be the <b>highest</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> n-alkanes present in the crude oil. However, it is known from papers (Philp et al. 1995; Garcia and Carbognani 2001; Paso and Fogler 2004; Yang and Kilpatrick 2005) that paraffin hydrocarbons in the wax deposits are <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> in comparison with those in the oil. The investigation of asphaltenes in which the <b>highest</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> paraffin hydrocarbons are concentrated shows that indeed the wax deposit consists not the most <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> hydrocarbons of crude oils. Evidently, more <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> <b>weight</b> n-alkanes initiate the crystallizing of the more low molecular homologs causing their deposition from crude oil in a greater degree.|$|R
