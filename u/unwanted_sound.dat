5|$|In {{more general}} usage, noise is any <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound</b> or signal. In this sense, even sounds {{that would be}} {{perceived}} as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver. Prevention and reduction of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound,</b> from tape hiss to squeaking bass drum pedals, is important in many musical pursuits, but noise is also used creatively in many ways, and in some way in nearly all genres.|$|E
5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound.</b> Noise {{is an important}} component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E
25|$|In common use, {{the word}} noise means <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound</b> or noise pollution.|$|E
40|$|An {{acoustic}} environment contains sounds from various sound sources, some generally perceived as wanted, others as unwanted. This thesis examines {{the effects of}} wanted and <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> in {{acoustic environment}}s, with regard to masking, stress recovery, and speech intelligibility. In urban settings, masking of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> by sounds from water structures has been suggested {{as a way to}} improve the acoustic environment. However, Study I showed that the <b>unwanted</b> (road traffic) <b>sound</b> was better at masking the wanted (water) sound than vice versa, thus indicating that masking of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> with sounds from water structures may prove difficult. Also, predictions by a partial loudness model of the auditory periphery overestimated the effect of masking, indicating that centrally located informational masking processes contribute to the effect. Some environments have also been shown to impair stress recovery; however studies using only auditory stimuli is lacking. Study II showed that a wanted (nature) sound improve stress recovery compared to unwanted (road traffic, ambient) sounds. This suggests that the acoustic environment influences stress recovery and that wanted sounds may facilitate stress recovery compared to <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds.</b> An additional effect of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> is impeded speech communication, commonly measured with speech intelligibility models. Study III showed that speech intelligibility starts to be negatively affected when the <b>unwanted</b> (aircraft <b>sound)</b> masker have equal or higher sound pressure level as the speech sound. Three models of speech intelligibility (speech intelligibility index, partial loudness and signal–to–noise ratio) predicted this effect well, with a slight disadvantage for the signal–to–noise ratio model. Together, Study I and III suggests that the partial loudness model is useful for determining effects of wanted and <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> in outdoor acoustic environments where variations in sound pressure level are large. But, in environments with large variations in other sound characteristics, models containing predictions of central processes would likely produce better results. The thesis concludes that wanted and <b>unwanted</b> characteristics of <b>sounds</b> in acoustic environments affect masking, stress recovery, and speech intelligibility, and that auditory perception models can predict these effects.

25|$|Noise {{is a term}} {{often used}} to refer to an <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound.</b> In science and engineering, noise is an {{undesirable}} component that obscures a wanted signal.

25|$|Various {{standard}} {{techniques are}} used with microphones used in sound reinforcement at live performances, or for recording {{in a studio}} or on a motion picture set.

50|$|Note {{that when}} using the vibrato bar, string action (the {{distance}} between the strings and the fretboard) is affected, and this can sometimes cause the strings to unintentionally touch the frets and create <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> on instruments set up with extremely low action and heavily recessed vibrato installations.|$|R
25|$|Rumble {{filters are}} high-pass filters {{applied to the}} removal of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> near to {{the lower end of}} the audible range or below.

25|$|Normally, the {{benefits}} of noise reduction far outweigh aesthetic impacts for residents protected from <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound.</b> These benefits include lessened sleep disturbance, improved ability to enjoy outdoor life, reduced speech interference, stress reduction, reduced risk of hearing impairment, {{and a reduction in}} the elevated blood pressure created by noise (that improves cardiovascular health).|$|E
25|$|In many cases, however, {{vibration}} is undesirable, wasting {{energy and}} creating <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound.</b> For example, the vibrational motions of engines, electric motors, or any mechanical device in operation are typically unwanted.

25|$|Active noise control, {{also known}} as noise cancellation, is a method for {{reducing}} <b>unwanted</b> <b>sound</b> through {{the addition of a}} second sound specifically designed to cancel the first. Active noise cancelling headphones were invented by Lawrence J. Fogel, an aerospace engineer working to improve communication in helicopter cockpits, with a patent filed April 2, 1954. His research led to the first five patents in noise cancellation for headphones between 1954-1961.|$|E
40|$|In music {{there are}} many types of {{modifications}} that are done on the sounds such as filters, overdrive, dynamics, volume, pitch and ambience. The noise gate is one such effect which falls {{under the category of}} dynamics. Noise gate is something which helps in cutting of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> be it below a certain level or be it at a particular decibel level. The level from which it can be cut off or from which it should be cut off is called the threshold level. There are three main functions that are present in a noise gate-threshold, attack, decay. The attack and the decay levels can be pre programmed or controlled by different equipment. Let us say that the attack levels are the same as what it is programmed in the other stomp boxes, effects or amplifiers or all three put together. The value of attack does not affect the noise gate. Our primary concern is to attenuate the <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> that are being generated...|$|R

40|$|Acoustical {{engineering}} is {{the branch of}} engineeringdealing with sound and vibration. It is the application ofacoustics, the science of sound and vibration, intechnology. Acoustical engineers are typically concernedwith the manipulation and control of sound. The primary goal of acoustical {{engineering is}} thereduction of <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds,</b> which is referred to asnoise control. Sound can have significant impacts onhuman health and well being, and is therefore importantto control. Noise control principles are implemented intotechnology and design {{in a variety of}} ways. Applicationsinclude the design of noise barriers, sound absorbers,silencers, and buffer zones. The implementation of noisecontrol technology differs in indoor and outdoorenvironments. In addition to reducing <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds,</b> acousticalengineers sometimes produce useful sounds or analyzesound waves to collect information. Examples of thisinclude applications of ultrasonic and infrasonic, whichmake use of sound that cannot be heard by humans. Ultrasonic waves are acoustic waves with frequenciesabove the audible range (approximately 20 kHz). Applications of ultrasonic include sonar and medicalimaging. Infrasonic waves are acoustic waves withfrequencies below the audible range (approximately 20 Hz). Applications of infrasonic include the detectionof earthquakes and volcanic eruptions [1].

40|$|Several underutilized {{concepts}} warrant {{further development}} in soundscape discourse, analysis and design. The {{first set of}} concepts consider the outdoor acoustic environment as a resource, including notions of different beneficial uses of this resource (a term borrowed from water resource management), and maintenance of diversity as a resource management approach. The second set encompass the notion that, underlying human experience of a soundscape, any individual (or group), in any particular context, will invariably {{be able to hear}} sounds that are wanted (by them, in that context) and <b>sounds</b> that are <b>unwanted.</b> This is a fundamental starting point for soundscape analysis and, by extension, soundscape management and design. These wanted and <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> need to be distinguished one from the other in measurements of human perception of a soundscape and measurement of its physical acoustic properties. Identification and quantification of the wanted and <b>unwanted</b> <b>sounds</b> allows introduction of acoustic masking as a key determinant of human perception of a particular soundscape, and as a tool for acoustic management and design. These concepts are illustrated through two different acoustic environments: an urban park in which there might be sound from both a water structure and from city noises/road traffic; and a wilderness area in which natural sounds predominate.
