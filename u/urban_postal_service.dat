40|$|In 1995, {{the annual}} meeting of the American Economic Association {{included}} a plenary session about domestic policy issues. One of the panelists was the Nobel laureate MIT economist Robert Solow. In the course of his remarks, Solow said that he did not find school choice appealing. During the question-and-answer period, I asked him why he did not find school vouchers appealing. He replied: “It isn’t for any economic reason; all the economic reasons favor school vouchers. It is because what made me an American is the United States Army and the public school system. ” Admirable in its candor and lucidity, Solow’s reply suggests a solution to a broader conundrum. If government intervention creates an official and common frame of ref-erence, a set of cultural focal points, a sense of togetherness and common experience, then almost any form of government intervention can help to “make us Americans. ” If people see government activism as a singular way of binding society together, then they may favor any particular government intervention virtually for its own sake—whether it be government intervention in schooling, <b>urban</b> transit, <b>postal</b> <b>services,</b> Social Security, or anything else—because they love the way in which it makes them American.

No area is this made more manifest than the environment where various types of corporeal property such as land and house constitute a critical factor of shelter and socio-economic growth. Governments, for instance, collate data on buildings for proper street-naming, house numbering and to determine the prospects of internally generated revenue (IGR) from that direction. The property owner also ensures that the house, bought or built with hard earned money, is well maintained in order to enhance its rent and lease value. Similarly, marketers develop clever strategies regularly to sell their products and services, using the most appropriate medium that gives the best mileage in terms of sales and goodwill. The House Sign 1 is an advertising design medium through which the marketer can showcase a brand in an attractive and a favorable way on a site provided by the property owner. The House Sign has a design concept that features three basic elements - house number, street name and a message. Street names and house numbers provide the easiest way of identifying or describing a building in a civilized society where no street should exist without a name and a house without a number. Street naming and house numbering are key issues in <b>urban</b> development. <b>Postal</b> <b>services</b> and police rely on the proper identification of buildings for distributing mails and securing lives and property. The House Sign provides yet another innovative dimension to house numbering in the area of advertising. ...|$|R
