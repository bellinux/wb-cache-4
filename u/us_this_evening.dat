Some rebels climbed the houses of the neighbors and then jumped into the house of Uthman. It was July 17, 656 C.E. and Uthman was fasting that day. The previous night he had seen Muhammad in a dream. Muhammad had said,"If you wish help can be sent to you and if you want you can break your fast with <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> We will welcome you. Uthman opted for the second. That made Uthman know that it was his last day of life.He was assassinated while reciting the Quran, The ayat of Surah Baqarah [...] "137. So if they believe in the like of that which you believe, then they are rightly guided, but if they turn away, then they are only in opposition. So Allah will suffice you against them. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower". According to some traditions, the blood-stained Quran he was reciting from is still preserved in a museum in Tashkent today. Other copies of the Quran, preserved in other cities, are also claimed to be [...] "Uthman's Quran" ...|$|E

60|$|WAITER (at the door). Seven, ma'am? Certainly, ma'am. It {{will be a}} {{convenience}} to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> busy <b>evening,</b> ma'am. There will be the band and the arranging of the fairy lights and one thing or another, ma'am.|$|R

6000|$|... "It is {{doubtful}} whether he joins <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> at all," [...] he declared. [...] "My sister, however, is wholly of my disposition. Monsieur le Baron will permit that I present him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She's been {{fretting}} here,' I continued, 'and eating scarcely anything, {{and never}} complaining: she would admit none of <b>us</b> till <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> {{and so we}} couldn't inform you of her state, as we {{were not aware of}} it ourselves; but it is nothing.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It is a pity Mrs. Bloomfield was {{not with}} <b>us,</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> at Mrs. Jarvis's," [...] said Eve, laughing. [...] "She might then have {{increased}} her knowledge, by listening to a few cantos from the epic of Mr. Dodge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{certainly}} have got that. Lady Amelia thinks {{you would be}} more comfortable if you would come up to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> You can't go out, of course; but Lady Amelia said, very good-naturedly, that you need not mind with her." ...|$|E

60|$|And let <b>us</b> beseech God <b>this</b> day, graciously {{to behold}} his family, {{the nations of}} Christendom, for which our Lord Jesus Christ was {{contented}} to be betrayed {{into the hands of}} wicked men, and suffer death upon the cross. Let <b>us</b> ask <b>this,</b> <b>even</b> though we do not fully understand what Christ's death on the cross did for mankind. That was the humble, childlike, really believing spirit of the early Christians. God grant us the same spirit; we need it much in these very times.|$|R
40|$|The Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) {{matching}} {{model with}} all wages negotiated each period is shown inconsistent with macroeconomic wage dynamics in the <b>US.</b> <b>This</b> applies <b>even</b> when heterogeneous match productivities, {{time to build}} vacancies and credible bargaining are incorporated. Wage rigidity consistent with micro evidence that wages of job changers are more flexible than those of job stayers allows the model to capture these dynamics and is not inconsistent with parameter calibrations in the literature. Such wage rigidity affects only the timing of wage payments over the duration of matches, so conclusions about characteristics based on calibrations continue to apply...|$|R
25|$|It was {{revealed}} by Matthew Reilly that the Black Knight {{was meant to}} be a dark double to Scarecrow; he also has an eye problem and has had his disagreements with the <b>US</b> government. <b>This</b> is <b>even</b> mentioned in the book, when Mother (upon hearing his biography) remarks that he sounds like a Shane Schofield gone wrong.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never met}} him, you see. He only wrote to me. When {{he came to}} the station to meet <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> he looked startled to see me; so I suppose he remembers my appearance. But Aline will have told him that my name is Simpson." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is what Monsieur Selingman himself says," [...] she remarked, with {{a little}} sigh. [...] "'Enjoy your Ostend to-day, my little ones,' he said, when he first met <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> 'One never knows how long these days will last.'

6000|$|... "All {{this is very}} interesting," [...] Captain Edwards said. [...] "I {{should like}} much to see the boy. Will you come and dine with <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> on board the Euphrates--Mr. Reynolds, here, is coming--and have the boy sent on board--say, at nine o'clock--when we can have him in, and have a chat with him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd better thank Providence," [...] Julian replied sternly, [...] "that {{there is}} {{time for you to}} rat, too--that is, if you have any care for your country. Now, Mr. Fenn, I am going to ask you a question. You led <b>us</b> to believe, <b>this</b> <b>evening,</b> that, {{although}} all letters had been destroyed, you were in constant communication with Freistner. When did you hear from him last--personally, I mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Hunt," [...] said Dr. Herbert Warner, [...] "I {{only wish}} {{to offer you}} my warm thanks and admiration.

6000|$|... "As I imagined," [...] he murmured, [...] "I {{see that}} my sister is impatient. You will forgive me, Caroline," [...] he went on, turning to the Duchess. [...] "Mr. Thain's {{conversation}} was most interesting.

6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} evident that this man, whoever he is, is an accomplice. He is a gentlemanly-looking man, and I fancy that {{he sat in}} the stalls near to <b>us</b> one <b>evening</b> <b>this</b> spring. However, it is quite clear that he is a confederate of Simcoe. Just repeat his words over again. They were in answer to his remark that I would give ten {{thousand}} pounds to be able to checkmate him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe it," [...] Staunton {{answered}} quietly. [...] "Several mysterious {{things have}} happened {{during the last few}} days, and late this afternoon, consols began to fall in a most extraordinary fashion.

6000|$|... "Females don't sport, Leo, my lad," [...] Terrence, {{with a wink}} to the others, {{answered}} him. [...] "Females are conservative. They {{keep the}} type true. They fix it and hold it, and are the everlasting clog on the chariot of progress. If it wasn't for the females every blessed mother's son {{of us would be}} a sporting dominant.

6000|$|... "Mamma and I {{wish to see}} you, and beg {{that you}} will come up to <b>us</b> <b>this</b> <b>evening.</b> We have tidings for you which I hope you will receive with joy.

[...] No answer; he changed the subject--he offered Felicia the money repaid to him for the bracelet. [...] "Buy one for yourself, my dear, this time." [...] Felicia handed him back the money, rather too haughtily, perhaps. [...] "I don't want a bracelet," [...] she said; [...] "I want your company in the evening." ...|$|E
40|$|I {{need not}} {{underscore}} my pleasure at {{being asked to}} join you in honoring Dorothy Nyswander. Most of <b>us</b> here <b>this</b> <b>evening</b> have honored her for many years, but it is pleasant to have annually a public and formal opportunity that serves to punctuate our continuing esteem. But the very purpose of this occasion places serious responsibility on a speaker. The title selected nonchalantly last fall is a further challenge.
