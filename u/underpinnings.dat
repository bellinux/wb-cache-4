5|$|Approximately once a year, Haake writes {{most of the}} band's lyrics, {{with the}} {{exception}} of finished tracks. His lyrical inspirations are derived from books and films. Although Meshuggah does not record concept albums, the band prefers strong conceptual <b>underpinnings</b> in the background.|$|E
5|$|The {{fundamental}} <b>underpinnings</b> {{are based}} on the mainstream VE Commodore models of the same years. The car is powered by GM's 6.2-litre LS3 V8 engine, with a maximum power output of 442 PS (325kW). Buyers have the option of a six-speed manual transmission or six-speed automatic transmission; the manual is capable of reaching 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.5 seconds and the automatic is capable of 0–100km/h (0–62mph) in 5.6 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The <b>underpinnings</b> of {{the local}} economy are based on Moncton's {{heritage}} as a commercial, distribution, transportation, and retailing centre. This is due to Moncton's central location in the Maritimes: it has the largest catchment area in Atlantic Canada with 1.6 million people living within a three-hour drive of the city. The insurance, information technology, educational, and health care sectors also are major factors in the local economy with the city's two hospitals alone employing over five thousand people.|$|E
5|$|Though these {{theories}} of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were not {{equipped with the}} neurophysiological techniques necessary for elucidating the biological <b>underpinnings</b> of learning in animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, {{at about the same}} time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.|$|E
5|$|By {{the years}} of unification, German Jews played an {{important}} role in the intellectual <b>underpinnings</b> of the German professional, intellectual, and social life. The expulsion of Jews from Russia in the 1880s and 1890s complicated integration into the German public sphere. Russian Jews arrived in north German cities in the thousands; considerably less educated and less affluent, their often dismal poverty dismayed many of the Germanized Jews. Many of the problems related to poverty (such as illness, overcrowded housing, unemployment, school absenteeism, refusal to learn German, etc.) emphasized their distinctiveness for not only the Christian Germans, but for the local Jewish populations as well.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{mentioned}} evolutionary {{interactions between}} flowering plants and insects in On the Origin of Species (1859). The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964. The theoretical <b>underpinnings</b> of coevolution are now well-developed, and demonstrate that coevolution {{can play an}} important role in driving major evolutionary transitions such as the evolution of sexual reproduction or shifts in ploidy. More recently, it has also been demonstrated that coevolution influences the structure and function of ecological communities as well as the dynamics of infectious disease.|$|E
5|$|Far Side Virtual was {{met with}} {{polarizing}} but generally positive reviews, with most critics commending its conceptual <b>underpinnings</b> and noting its ambiguous relationship to its subject. It was named {{album of the year}} by UK magazine The Wire, a decision which {{was met with}} contention from some journalists and readers. The album has since been cited as one of the original releases and catalysts of vaporwave, an Internet-based electronic music microgenre that covers much of the same sonic and conceptual territory.|$|E
5|$|Heather moor {{containing}} ling, bell heather, cross-leaved heath, {{bog myrtle}} and fescues is everywhere abundant. The high Black Cuillins weather too slowly {{to produce a}} soil that sustains a rich plant life, but each of the main peninsulas has an individual flora. The basalt <b>underpinnings</b> of Trotternish produce a diversity of Arctic and alpine plants including alpine pearlwort and mossy cyphal. The low-lying fields of Waternish contain corn marigold and corn spurry. The sea cliffs of Duirinish boast mountain avens and fir clubmoss. Minginish produces fairy flax, cats-ear and black bog rush. There is {{a fine example of}} Brachypodium-rich ash woodland at Tokavaig in Sleat incorporating silver birch, hazel, bird cherry, and hawthorn.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, PSA {{decided that}} their new small Talbot {{would also be}} based on the 104 rather than the Horizon. Keeping the common <b>underpinnings</b> allowed the new model, known {{internally}} as project C15 (later renamed to T15 to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In order not to create too much internal competition, a wheelbase between the 3 door and 5 door versions of the 104 was chosen. This made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular superminis such as the Ford Fiesta, but above the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.|$|E
5|$|The Principia was {{published}} on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion. Together, these laws describe {{the relationship between}} any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. Many of these advancements {{continue to be the}} <b>underpinnings</b> of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.|$|E
5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific <b>underpinnings</b> of AS or factors that distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 the Prison Commissioners {{agreed to}} declare Clifford's Tower a {{national}} monument and to conserve it as a historic location. In 1902 Clifford's Tower {{was given to}} the York Corporation, together with a grant of £3,000 (£242,000 at 2009 prices) arranged by Lord Wenlock for conservation and repairs. The removal of the talus and the damage to the castle stonework in the 16th century had put excessive pressure on the supporting motte, causing a recurrence of the 14th century subsidence. Sir Basil Mott, a leading Victorian engineer, installed concrete <b>underpinnings</b> to stabilise the structure beneath the gatehouse. By the early 20th century, Clifford's Tower was regularly open to visitors, and in 1915 it was passed to the Office of Works as a national monument.|$|E
5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical <b>underpinnings</b> (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E
25|$|Below are {{the classic}} {{arguments}} bearing upon the dilemma and its <b>underpinnings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of {{molecular}} <b>underpinnings</b> of the process of replication, transcription and translation of the genetic material.|$|E
25|$|The E150 version appears {{identical}} to the E140 wide-body, but it has different, more sophisticated <b>underpinnings</b> based on the New MC platform.|$|E
25|$|In all a {{total of}} 3,867,932 2CVs were produced. Including the {{commercial}} versions of the 2CV, Dyane, Méhari, FAF, and Ami variants, the 2CV's <b>underpinnings</b> spawned 8,830,679 vehicles.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, G. K. Chesterton {{published}} , {{in which}} he developed and articulated many creationist ideas and criticisms of the philosophical <b>underpinnings</b> and perceived logical flaws of evolution.|$|E

25|$|McKay was {{an outspoken}} critic of communism, {{opposing}} its perceived atheist <b>underpinnings</b> and denial of freedom of choice. Similarly, communist nations generally forbid proselytizing by the LDS Church and most other religions.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the {{practical}} lessons in city design and planning that Death and Life offers, the theoretical <b>underpinnings</b> {{of the work}} challenge the modern development mindset. Jane Jacobs defends her positions with common sense and anecdotes.|$|E
25|$|VW {{expanded}} its product line in 1961 {{with the introduction}} of four Type 3 models (Karmann Ghia, Notchback, Fastback, and Variant) based on the new Type 3 mechanical <b>underpinnings.</b> The name 'Squareback' was used in the U.S.A for the Variant.|$|E
25|$|Colajanni {{continued}} {{to reject the}} ideological <b>underpinnings</b> of classical Marxism, which he {{considered to be a}} contradiction to democracy. He remained a social-Darwinist throughout his life, convinced that socialism would be a product of a natural process of evolution and social selection.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{statistical}} <b>underpinnings</b> of twin research are invalid. Such statistical critiques argue that heritability estimates used for most twin studies rest on restrictive assumptions that are usually not tested, and if they are, they are often contradicted by the data.|$|E
25|$|Progress toward women's {{suffrage}} {{was slow}} {{in the period}} after the split, but advancement in other areas strengthened the <b>underpinnings</b> of the movement. By 1890, {{tens of thousands of}} women were attending colleges and universities, up from zero a few decades earlier.|$|E
25|$|Jane Jacobs {{goes on to}} {{describe}} what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed, showing the work <b>underpinnings</b> of the Mafia and communism, {{and what happens when}} New York subway Police are paid bonuses here – reinterpreted slightly {{as a part of the}} larger analysis.|$|E
25|$|The {{intellectual}} <b>underpinnings</b> {{for independence}} {{were provided by}} the English pamphleteer Thomas Paine. His Common Sense pro-independence pamphlet was anonymously published on January 10, 1776 and became an immediate success. It was read aloud everywhere, including the Army. He pioneered a style of political writing that rendered complex ideas easily intelligible.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory was}} {{developed}} by John Turner and colleagues, and along with social identity theory it is a constituent {{part of the social}} identity approach. It was in part developed to address questions that arose in response to social identity theory about the mechanistic <b>underpinnings</b> of social identification.|$|E
25|$|The {{perceived}} {{bitterness of}} cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli varies {{from person to}} person, but the functional <b>underpinnings</b> of this variation are not known. Some research reports that the gene TAS2R38 {{may be responsible for}} bitter taste perception in broccoli. Other factors, such as isothiocyanates and polyphenols, are also likely involved in bitterness perception.|$|E
25|$|The updated P601 was {{introduced}} in 1964. It was essentially a facelift of the P60, with a different front fascia, bonnet, roof and rear and the original P50 <b>underpinnings.</b> The model remained nearly unchanged {{until the end of}} its production except for the addition of 12V electricity, rear coil springs and an updated dashboard for later models.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{research}} into the neurological <b>underpinnings</b> of narcissistic personality disorder. However, recent research has identified a structural abnormality in the brains of those with narcissistic personality disorder, specifically noting less volume of gray matter in the left anterior insula. Another study has associated the condition with reduced gray matter in the prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|He championed {{a switch}} in {{focus for the}} school from {{classical}} biology to molecular biology, stating that disciplines such as ecology, developmental biology, taxonomy, physiology, etc. had stagnated and could progress only once the underlying disciplines of molecular biology and biochemistry had elucidated their <b>underpinnings,</b> {{going so far as}} to discourage their study by students.|$|E
25|$|Neuroscientific {{studies are}} {{examining}} the physiological <b>underpinnings</b> of observable attachment style, such as vagal tone which influences capacities for intimacy, stress response which influences threat reactivity (Lupien, McEwan, Gunnar & Heim, 2009), {{as well as}} neuroendocrinology such as oxytocin,. These types of studies underscore the fact that attachment is an embodied capacity not only a cognitive one.|$|E
25|$|Næss and Fox do {{not claim}} to use logic or {{induction}} to derive the philosophy directly from scientific ecology but rather hold that scientific ecology directly implies the metaphysics of deep ecology, including its ideas about the self and further, that deep ecology finds scientific <b>underpinnings</b> {{in the fields of}} ecology and system dynamics.|$|E
25|$|Scholars have {{commented that}} {{the failure of the}} Security Council efforts of {{mediation}} owed {{to the fact that the}} Council regarded the issue as a purely political dispute without investigating its legal <b>underpinnings.</b> Declassified British papers indicate that Britain and US had let their Cold War calculations influence their policy in the UN, disregarding the merits of the case.|$|E
25|$|Wikipedia {{began with}} its launch on 15 January 2001, {{two days after}} the domain was {{registered}} by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger. Its technological and conceptual <b>underpinnings</b> predate this; the earliest known proposal for an online encyclopedia was made by Rick Gates in 1993, but the concept of a free-as-in-freedom online encyclopedia (as distinct from mere open source) was proposed by Richard Stallman in December 2000.|$|E
