Consumers are focused on adding fiber and whole grains to be healthy and want the benefits of whole grain with the taste and appearance of refined flour. A review of current commercial whole wheat flour in the marketplace indicated many options for food processors to use. However, many of these options required processing changes and added ingredients to provide the consumer with a quality product. A milling and baking study was done to compare commercially and experimentally milled whole wheat flours from both white and red wheat varieties. Both white and red wheat varieties were kept identity preserved. Experimental milling was done with a hammer <b>mill</b> and a <b>roll</b> <b>stand</b> to closely replicate the commercial milling process. Baking was done using a sponge and dough method to closely replicate commercial baking conditions. The results showed both particle size and wheat variety impact bake performance of whole wheat flour. The most significant impact appeared to be dependent on the variety of wheat being milled. The milling process also had an impact. As particle size decreased, bake functionality improved. However, some decreased functionality was seen when particle size became very fine. It was concluded that additional work on a commercial flour mill needed to be done to determine if an optimal particle size for milling whole wheat flour exists. Experimental milling equipment was not adequate enough to replicate particle size distributions of commercial whole wheat mills...|$|R

From the investigation of the actual hot rolling <b>mill</b> <b>roll,</b> it was proven that the small spalling was generated by heat crack initiation by thermal cycling and Mode II fatigue crack growth. The crack due to the thermal cycling was initiated in the oxide area.

That roll was made of mottled cast iron. Its microstructure consisted of modular graphite, transformed ledeburite and a matrix composed of bainite and martensite. Metallographic investigations were performed nearby the fracture in the roll. Observations were conducted on polished sections, first not etched, and then etched, which allowed us to trace carefully the propagation of the fracture. There was found a strict correlation between the microstructure of the roll and the progress occurring in the crack. It was ascertained that the basic reason for the damage to the roll was banded precipitations of ledeburitic cementite. In addition, cementite formed a continuous network. Another microstructure defects of that roll are also precipitations of secondary carbides on the boundaries of former grain of austenite as well as the occurrence of upper bainite in its matrix.

The TEC and elastic modulus of corresponding phases were similar for all investigated steels despite the difference in their chemical composition.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of the {{microstructure}} in the tribological wear processes occurring in a cast iron <b>mill</b> <b>roll.</b> For this purpose, a piece of a broken roll, made in Italy, was collected. Its microstructure consisted of modular graphite, transformed ledeburite and a matrix composed of bainite and martensite. Metallographic investigations were performed on the roll working surface in conjunction with metallographic tests effected within its surface layer. There was established the relation between the microstructure of the roll and the process of its tribological wear. The following was ascertained: micro-shrinkages or graphite precipitations nearby the working area cause cracks between those places and the working area; in the surface layer, cracks occur usually in the zone of ledeburitic cementite. At places of considerable precipitations of ledeburitic cementite, the tribological wear intensity of the roll is lower. A banded layout of precipitations of ledeburitic cementite facilitates a selective spalling of some parts of the roll material. The results of this study allow broadening the data base related to the effect of the microstructure on tribological wear of <b>mill</b> <b>rolls,</b> which in future will permit one to design their proper microstructure of cast iron <b>mill</b> <b>rolls...</b>|$|R

This defect is usually intermittent over time, {{and in some}} extent, unrelated with the chemical composition and the process parameters used. To study this phenomenon, a metallographic analysis {{has been carried out}} on two real 5. 5 -ton chilled iron <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> made of the same chemical composition, manufactured with quite similar process parameters, but giving two very different results in practice: one of the two <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> exhibited a macroscopic crack. Because of the different metallurgical structures observed, especially regarding graphite content, a three-dimensional (3 D) numerical analysis has been adopted to predict the thermal-mechanical behavior of the casting during the solidification and cooling stages. Special attention has been dedicated to the influence of the graphite expansion on mechanical stresses occurring in the casting skin. Numerical results point out that graphite expansion notably affects the evolution of stress-strain fields within the casting to an extent that it could lead to the formation of macroscopic cracks {{in the early stages of}} the casting solidification. Furthermore, the numerical analysis highlights that the thermal deformation of the permanent mold contributes to increase the risk of cracks to occu...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{role of the}} {{chemical}} composition of cast irons for <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> in tendencies of diffusionless transformations in the matrix was determined. The investigations of {{the chemical}} composition, microstructure and hardness influence on tribological properties of mottled cast iron {{is presented in the}} paper. Design/methodology/approach: The research stand is generally used in the tribological tests, and the counter sample of the material also common in such tests. Bearing steel 100 Cr 6, of a hardness of 57 HRC, was applied as a counter sample. The tribological tests were performed at a load of 100 N. Samples for tests were taken from seven <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> made by various producers. Mottled cast irons had a different chemical composition. Findings: The role of individual alloying elements in a tendency of the diffusionless transformations in the matrix, hardness, wear resistance and friction coefficient of mottled cast irons used for the <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> was estimated. The hardness increase rather increases the wear resistance of the investigated cast irons. Research limitations/implications: The possibility of designing the chemical composition of mottled cast iron {{in such a way as}} to obtain the low tribological wear at retaining, at the same time, the high friction coefficient was found. The relationship between the hardness resulting from the chemical composition and the wear resistance of the investigated mottled cast irons was presented. Practical implications: The obtained results can be utilised in designing the chemical compositions of the cast iron <b>mill</b> <b>rolls</b> and to obtain materials characterised by the high wear resistance at the assumed friction coefficient. Originality/value: Surprisingly, the increased chromium content seems to decrease the wear resistance of the investigated cast irons and the wear resistance of the investigated mottled cast irons is rather decreasing when the coefficient of friction increases...|$|R
