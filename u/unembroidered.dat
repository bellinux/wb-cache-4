"All day {{yesterday}} I {{was very}} busy, and {{very happy in}} my ceaseless bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, because I love you. No, sir, don't caress me now--let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good and mine: {{it was a fine}} day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your journey. I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence. I thought of the life that lay before me--your life, sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own strait channel. I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose. Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly. I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress. I thought how I would carry down to you the square of <b>unembroidered</b> blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections. I saw plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet." ...|$|E

5000|$|In the Evening Standard, Nicholas de Jongh {{began his}} 4-star review by saying, [...] "It may {{be set in}} a Norfolk village last year but Molly Davies's highly promising, first {{full-length}} play reminds me irresistibly of Edward Bond's 44-year-old Saved without the violence. In 28 scenes and 80 minutes Miss Davies offers a rural complement to Bond's landscape-vision of down-and-out south Londoners. She shows a flair for creating believable characters, who speak in a terse, <b>unembroidered</b> Norfolk dialect that left me wishing for surtitles". He praised both [...] "Kate O'Flynn's beautiful rendering of passivity, selfishness and vulnerability" [...] and the [...] "fine, lumbering incoherence" [...] of Russell Tovey's portrayal of Gary. De Jongh also noted the [...] "alienated aggression" [...] brought to the part of Gary's father by Gerard Horan, adding [...] "Sorcha Cusack's believable Gran offers the only ray of cheerfulness". He judged that [...] "Lyndsey Turner's in-the-round production on a stage needlessly carpeted with turf offers annoyingly impeded views, though scenes flow with seamless ease" [...] but concluded his review by saying simply [...] "Compelling".|$|E
5000|$|Two preceptive {{works in}} Arabic are {{ascribed}} to Ibn al-Muqaffa', al-Adab al-kabīr and al-Adab al-saghir , {{but only the}} first, now known as Kitāb al-ādāb al-kabīr , can be accepted as his [...] The first of its four parts is a very brief rhetorical retrospect on the excellence of the ancients’ legacy, clearly Sasanian, of spiritual and temporal knowledge. The second is a miniature mirror for princes. The addressee, seemingly the caliph’s son, is apostrophized as one {{in pursuit of the}} rule of seemly conduct (adab). He is to give strict priority to the mastery of fundamentals, examples of which are given along with illustrations {{of the ways in which}} they can be applied. The author then turns to pitfalls before a prince (e.g., the love of flattery and the fault of allowing others to detect it). More positively, he urges the prince to cultivate men of religion and moral perfection as potential aides and intimates, to take advice, even if unpalatable, from those best qualified to give it, to keep abreast of his officials’ conduct, to be sparing with his favors, and so on. Having defined, very much in a Sasanian vein, the bases of kingship, he discusses particular circumstances calling for caution and prudence. After exhortation to seemly conduct and sundry observations on statecraft he ends by stressing the pivotal role in government of power and a seemly public image. The Ādāb’s third part, longer than the second, is a pragmatic guide to survival for a ruler’s intimates and highly, but precariously, placed officers of state. It offers advice in a high moral vein, but it rests on no philosophical, ethico-religious, or spiritual basis: it rests on familiarity with age-old vagaries of oriental despots and their entourages. The fourth and longest part of the Ādāb treats of a man’s relations with colleagues in what we may take to be the secretarial fraternity. The main theme is friendship and the avoidance of enmity. For Ibn al-Muqaffa', the ideal is a permanent relationship, sustained by fidelity, loyalty, and devotion, and proof against all corrosive forces. As always, his treatment of the subject is didactic and heavily dependent on aphorisms. He remains pragmatic: A friendship should be formed, not with an inferior, but with a superior, for to make friends of inferiors bespeaks envy, which is reprehensible. To shed a friend is a threat to honor—unlike a divorce. To women and their allure he makes certain disparaging references, but they are only incidental to his main interest,promoting companionship and amity in the circles that concern him. One can detect in the Ādāb as a whole certain ideas known to Sasanian Persia from pre-Islamic translations of Greek works [...] The Ādāb is cast in the parallelistic mode of expression born of the early Khotba and expanded and elaborated in Omayyad hortatory compositions, <b>unembroidered</b> with contrived rhyming of the sort found in later Abbasid prose literature. To point contrasts and enforce parallels, full use is made of devices well known to the ancient schools of rhetoric.|$|E

Researchers have found that effectiveness of personnel {{evaluation system}} of Bangladesh is not satisfactory compared to expectancy. Unproductive personnel evaluation system of Bangladesh is liable for insufficient efficiency of civil servants. This study will emphasize the realization of effective personnel evaluation system to ascertain accountability and the enrichment of efficiency of civil servants. Running personnel evaluation system of Bangladesh is unskilled to employ the ability of civil servants, to give appropriate ways to perform work by civil servants, to guarantee proper utilization of working time of civil servants, and to produce the sense of belongingness among civil servants. It has no alignment strategy with organizational goals and objectives. Armstrong M. & Baron A. (2005) have stated {{that the success of}} personnel evaluation system notably depends on the alignment with clear organizational goals which are produced from organizational evaluation. Organizational performance indicators assist to create clear and <b>unembroidered</b> performance indicators for civil servants. Advanced and internal performance indicators of organization strengthen alignment strategy. Alignment strategy inspires personnel to move in the same way with the organization to accomplish common goals. Bangladesh needs strategies to ascertain alignment betwee...|$|E
