In 851AD the Danes planned a full scale invasion, after raiding the country regularly for many years. The Danes invaded up the Thames and burnt Canterbury and then London. The next target was Winchester, but on their march towards Winchester they met the army of Ethelwulf, father of Alfred the Great. Ethelwulf, it seems, took up {{a position on the}} slopes of Leith Hill - an ancient mass grave found in 1882 seems to point to this area as the site of battle (Stories of the Surrey Hills published by the Surrey Society).

50|$|To avoid {{needing to}} do an {{expensive}} implicit solution {{of a system of}} ODEs, many real-time cloth simulators (notably PhysX, Havok Cloth, and Maya nCloth) <b>use</b> <b>position</b> based dynamics (PBD), an approach based on constraint relaxation. The mass-spring model is converted into a system of constraints, which demands that the distance between the connected nodes be equal to the initial distance. This system is solved sequentially and iteratively, by directly moving nodes to satisfy each constraint, until sufficiently stiff cloth is obtained. This is similar to a Gauss-Seidel solution of the implicit matrix system for the mass-spring model. Care must be taken though to solve the constraints in the same sequence each timestep, to avoid spurious oscillations, {{and to make sure that}} the constraints do not violate linear and angular momentum conservation. Additional position constraints can be applied, for example to keep the nodes within desired regions of space (sufficiently close to an animated model for example), or to maintain the body's overall shape via shape matching.|$|E
5000|$|Priming isn’t always unintentional, as Jacobs and Shapiro {{demonstrate}} in {{a quantitative}} and historical analysis of John F. Kennedy’s 1960 presidential campaign. Their research extends {{the application of}} priming theory from its original focus of how individuals form attitudes and make decisions {{to the study of}} candidate behavior. This new approach, they say, [...] "changes the analytic focus from unintentional priming to intentional priming, namely, the deliberate strategies that candidates pursue to influence voters". Priming can be an effective campaign strategy for presidential candidates, the authors indicate, by a process of carefully calculated uses of public opinion on policy issues to influence voters’ standards for assessing the candidates’ attributes. In this study, the authors focus on the 1960 election because innovative public opinion surveys were incorporated into Kennedy’s campaign strategy that enabled him to <b>use</b> <b>position</b> taking to shape his image. Their research was based on primary evidence drawn from archival records and interviews, as well as a combination of interpretative and quantitative analysis. They found that a relationship exists between Kennedy’s positions on policy matters and results from his private public opinion surveys. His campaign combined image building with position taking on issues that responded to perceived public opinion. Though this study does neglect questions concerning how and why real politicians use polling results to prime voters, Jacobs and Shapiro effectively demonstrate that the priming process is powerful enough to be used intentionally by political candidates as a tool to influence public opinion during election campaigns.|$|E
