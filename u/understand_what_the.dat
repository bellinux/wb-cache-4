5|$|In the episode, Amy Pond, Rory and River Song are {{summoned to}} Utah, United States, by the Eleventh Doctor, who is {{killed by a}} mysterious figure in a space suit. The dead Doctor is {{revealed}} to be an older self, after his younger version returns. They try to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> future Doctor said and are sent to Washington D.C. The team deals with the Silence, a race of aliens {{with the ability to}} make people forget their encounter with them when they look away.|$|E
5|$|The {{plan called}} for the units to {{maintain}} strict radio silence and secrecy {{in order to maintain}} surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to get across the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> operation was about, or what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front, and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis.|$|E

5|$|The boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously {{awaiting}} the night's episode of Terrance and Phillip, {{which ended in}} a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all the boys to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the Queef Sisters, about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They {{are very similar to}} Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> problem is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.|$|E

25|$|For example, most {{insurance}} {{policies in the}} English language today have been carefully drafted in plain English; the industry {{learned the hard way}} that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> policies are saying. Typically, courts construe ambiguities in {{insurance policies}} against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policy.|$|E

25|$|In prehistoric State of Mexico, the Tepexpan Man is an {{important}} finding for Mexican and foreign anthropologists; it is {{an important}} key to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Valley of Mexico area was like, 5000 years ago, as well as helping establish the occupation chronology of the region. Currently some scholars attribute an age of 11 thousand years, others 8 thousand, and some have suggested 5 thousand years old. This individual was originally identified as a male, but recent research confirms a female identity, although this is still a subject of discussion.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is {{it to say that}} he ought to have foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E
500|$|The {{first time}} Homer travels back in time, he was {{originally}} supposed to state [...] "I'm the first non-fictional character to travel backwards through time". The line was later changed from [...] "non-fictional" [...] to [...] "non-Brazilian". Groening was confused {{as to the}} reason for the change, since he liked the original so much. In fact, he did not even <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> new line implied.|$|E

[...] However, she stated that if Schwartz and Savage were interested in creating a different Gossip Girl spin-off, CW would [...] "of course [...] be open to it." ...|$|E
500|$|After 30 days, on 27 July, {{the staff}} at Penetanguishene still deemed him unfit to stand trial, but by 27 August 1966 his state had {{improved}} enough for the doctors to allow his return to custody at Windsor. The doctors reported that he could now face the court—they said {{that the young man}} was now able to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> proceedings against him meant, and capable of working alongside a legal advisor. Because Lamb could not afford legal counsel, Justice Saul Nosanchuk was assigned by a local legal aid plan to advise him in the upcoming trial. Nosanchuk says that Lamb had [...] "no hesitation" [...] in signing a paper authorising the justice to represent him.|$|E
500|$|One-third of the world's bishops petitioned for the canonization of Escrivá. During the canonization, {{there were}} 42 {{cardinals}} and 470 bishops {{from around the}} world, generals superior of many religious institutes, and representatives of various Catholic groups. During those days, these Church officials commented on the universal reach {{and validity of the}} message of the founder. For his canonization homily, John Paul II said: With the teachings of St. Josemaría, [...] "it is easier to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Second Vatican Council affirmed: 'there is no question, then, of the Christian message inhibiting men from building up the world ... on the contrary it is an incentive to do these very things' (Vatican II, Gaudium et spes, n. 34)." ...|$|E

500|$|The siege was {{captured}} by Pathé News cameras—one of their earliest stories and the first siege to be captured on film—and it included footage of Churchill in attendance. When the newsreels were screened in cinemas, Churchill was booed with shouts of [...] "shoot him" [...] from audiences. His presence was controversial to many and the Leader of the Opposition, Arthur Balfour, remarked, [...] "He [...] was, I understand, in military phrase, in {{what is known as}} the zone of fire—he and a photographer were both risking valuable lives. I <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> photographer was doing, but what was the right hon. Gentleman doing? That I neither understood at the time, nor do I understand now." [...] Jenkins suggests that he went simply because [...] "he could not resist going to see the fun himself".|$|E
500|$|The promotional album Wipeout: The Music was {{released}} on CD and vinyl in 1996, and features the aforementioned three tracks by Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers and Orbital, as well as additional tracks by New Order and The Prodigy. Burcombe explained that the choice of genres {{was based on an}} experience he had while playing Super Mario Kart: he had just finished in first place but had [...] "Age of Love" [...] playing instead of the game's soundtrack, and thought it fitted the moment. Persuading record companies to get involved with the promotional album proved difficult as they did not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> development team wanted. Notable, however, is the omission of tracks by CoLD SToRAGE. This surprised some, as Wright's contributions were popular with players, and the omission of his songs in favor of more established acts seemed an affront to video game music as a burgeoning art form.|$|E
500|$|Strength of mind, {{by which}} Wollstonecraft meant [...] "the {{degree to which}} [...] can {{independently}} reach its own conclusions" [...] (emphasis in original), is central to her idea of the female genius. Merely imitating others is not enough, even if one imitates the [...] "correct" [...] actions and thoughts. Reason, for Wollstonecraft, is what controls the emotions; without reason, she contends, people would fail to understand their own feelings. Moreover, reason allows for the distinction between a useful sensibility and a harmful sensualism. She writes: [...] "sensibility is indeed the foundation of all our happiness; but these raptures are unknown to the depraved sensualist, who is only moved by what strikes his gross senses." [...] Useful sensibility allows Mary to embark upon charity projects. Yet, this highly attuned sensibility separates the classes along emotional lines: only the middle-class Mary is able to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> poor around her require.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{generally}} agreed that Ensemble re-created the Halo universe's aesthetic well. Gillen said knowledge of the game universe could alleviate some issues of player ignorance regarding units' actions: [...] "It's not just the geek thrill of seeing a Scarab in action—it's that you <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Scarab means on the battlefield (trouble)," [...] he wrote. [...] "We know which characters are best against tanks, and which are probably best in special vehicles." [...] Nguyen said that, although the core units meshed well, the inclusion of Ensemble-developed units gave Halo Wars {{the feeling of a}} generic science-fiction title. While giving the game a mixed review, Anderson said that the authentic-looking units and environments went a long way to integrating the game {{with the rest of the}} series. Wilcox commented that with the Halo-inspired menu system and Rippy's score, [...] "before the campaign even begins, the message is clear: this is still very much a Halo game." [...] Overall, Halo Wars was judged a fitting final game for Ensemble.|$|E
500|$|During {{the morning}} of September 18, Eric Burdon arrived at the Samarkand {{sometime}} before the ambulance crew and found that Hendrix was already dead. Burdon immediately became concerned that police would find drugs at the apartment, and as he was collecting incriminating evidence, he found the poem that Hendrix had written hours earlier, [...] "The Story of Life". Burdon, {{who said he had}} previously discussed suicide and death with Hendrix, assumed the poem was a suicide note. Under this assumption, he made comments to the press regarding his belief that Hendrix had committed suicide that he has since recanted: [...] "I made false statements... I simply didn't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> situation was. I misread the note... I thought it was a goodbye". Dannemann said Hendrix told her: [...] "I want you to keep this [...] forever [...] I don't want you to forget anything that is written. It's a story about you and me".|$|E
500|$|The new {{script was}} then pitched to the BBC. The pitch tape they made {{was based on}} the same pitch used by The Muppet Show. This was done as a tribute to it, with Miller arguing that when The Muppet Show did it, [...] "it just must have just knocked the socks off the people who saw it, because it's like nothing you've ever seen before, and we thought: 'Why fix what ain't broke, so we did our own very British version of that." [...] The {{producers}} liked it but did not fully <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> show was about. Miller, Brown and a third writer, Daniel Peak began to write scripts over a period of four years. A pilot was eventually filmed and the BBC commissioned a full series, targeted at adults. Despite the adult nature, Miller did not want to make the show too crude. Eight episodes were filmed so as to spread the cost of making the series over each episode.|$|E

25|$|This is <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Chinese room thought {{experiment}} {{is intended to}} prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around).

Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.|$|R
