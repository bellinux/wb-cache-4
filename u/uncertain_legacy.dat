500|$|Brundage leaves an <b>uncertain</b> <b>legacy.</b> On the {{question}} of amateurism, Maraniss suggests that Brundage was [...] "caught in a vise" [...] between communist and capitalist states pursuing dissimilar goals; nations following either system were not willing to accept Brundage's vision of pure amateurism, and broke those rules, each system in its own way. Guttmann notes that in the 1960s, Brundage may have been better-known as an art collector than for his sports activities, and [...] "there are those who maintain {{that he will be}} remembered not for his career in sports but for his jades and bronzes." [...] Andrew Leigh, a Member of the Australian House of Representatives, criticizes Brundage for expelling the two athletes in Mexico City, calling him [...] "a man who'd had no difficulty with the Nazi salute being used in the 1936 Olympics". Dick Pound believes Brundage to {{have been one of the}} IOC's great presidents, along with deCoubertin and Samaranch, but concedes that by the end of his term, Brundage was out of touch with the world of sports. While Pound credits Brundage with holding the Olympic movement together in a period when it was beset by many challenges, he notes that this might not be fully appreciated by those who remember Brundage for the final years of his term, and for Munich.|$|E
40|$|National parks {{have always}} been an emotive and iconic symbol, ever since the first parks of the modern era were created in the mid-nineteenth century. This book, based on {{original}} research, delves deeply into their character and significance, and the larger {{context in which they}} developed. The book celebrates the deserved attractiveness of the parks as wilderness or "spectacle" to millions of visitors, but also emphasises how there was nothing inevitable, self-sustaining or without cost in their magnificence and accessibility. Those early parks were a powerful unifying force as national 'playgrounds', especially as motor transport democratised their use. However they also provoked bitter conflict in their dispossession of local communities and perhaps deliberate segregation of people from scenery and wildlife. That first century of national parks, which concluded with the significant break of the Second World War and the subsequent development of more international approaches to conservation, left an <b>uncertain</b> <b>legacy.</b> It was a fragile foundation from which to build what became an integral part of today's conservation movement...|$|E
40|$|During the First World War, Conrad {{believed}} himself peripheral to {{a transitional}} historical moment. In November 1914, he wrote: 'the thoughts {{of this war}} sit on one's chest like a nightmare. I am painfully aware of being crippled, of being idle, of being useless {{with a sort of}} absurd anxiety' (CL 5, 427). In August 1915, Conrad felt the 'world of 15 years ago is gone to pieces; what will come in its place God knows, but I imagine doesn't care' (CL 5, 503). The political forces of nineteenth-century Europe that had fashioned Conrad's literature, notably imperialism and nationalism, were undermined and unleashed anew by the violence of the Great War and the <b>uncertain</b> <b>legacy</b> of the conflict. Conrad closely observed Poland's fate throughout the war in his relationship with Polish activist Józef Retinger, which inspired 'A Note on the Polish Problem' (1916) and 'The Crime of Partition' (1919). While 1918 saw the political rebirth of Poland, antagonisms provoked by the redrawing of Europe's historical boundaries made Conrad uneasy. On Armistice Day, he wrote: 'The great sacrifice is consummated - and what will come of it to the nations of the earth the future will show. I can not confess to an easy mind. Great and very blind forces are set free catastrophically all over the world' (CL 6, 302) ...|$|E

As a result, Morocco would spin off into an independent future, and never again come {{under the rule of}} an eastern caliphate.|$|R
5000|$|The Presbyterian Church {{used the}} money from the sale to found Chamberlain-Hunt Academy in nearby Port Gibson in 1879. C.H.A. transitioned to the {{military}} routine in 1915 and was a military college preparatory school until 1971, when girls were admitted and the military discipline was greatly relaxed. Many of David Hunt's descendants or relatives attended Chamberlain-Hunt over the years and until quite recently. The old school did not open in August 2014 and the future is <b>uncertain.</b> [...] The <b>legacy</b> of Oakland College was named to honor Presbyterian minister Reverend Jeremiah Chamberlain (1794-1851), the founding president of Oakland College, and David Hunt, who had been Oakland's most generous benefactor.|$|R
5000|$|Nightcrawler has {{received}} positive reception as {{a comic book}} character and {{as a member of}} the X-Men. Nightcrawler was ranked as the 133rd greatest comic book character of all time by Wizard magazine. IGN also ranked Nightcrawler as the 80th greatest comic book hero of all time describing Nightcrawler as a mutant with the appearance of a demon and the heart of a preacher; IGN also states that as the X-Men enter one of their most <b>uncertain</b> periods, his <b>legacy</b> still looms large. In 2006, IGN also rated Nightcrawler at #7 on their list of Top 25 X-Men from the past forty years stating that religion is one of the few commonalities that could bring mutants and humans together and it is through his faith that Nightcrawler has stayed true to the X-Men for so long. In 2008, Marvel rated their top ten X-Men of all time. Nightcrawler ranked #4 on their list stating that far from a character consumed by doom and gloom, Nightcrawler's chivalry, flair for the dramatic and sense of humor have made him one of the most likable X-Men ever, a character you genuinely look forward to seeing leap into action. In 2013, ComicsAlliance ranked Nightcrawler as #19 on their list of the [...] "50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics".|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} hours of Friday 8 July 1994, Kim Il-sung, North Korea’s {{president}} and ‘Great Leader’ died. For a regime and a country which had known only one leader since the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea had been founded in 1948, his death eas a profound shock. After his death was finally announced, the following day, the streets of the capital were filled with apparently genuinely grieving North Koreans (1). Kim had spent the last years of his life elaborately preparing for Kim Jong-il, the son of his first wife, to succeed him. But, despite his extraordinary efforts to ensure the first ever-and probably the last-dynastic succession in the communist world, Kim Il-sung has left an <b>uncertain</b> <b>legacy</b> for his son and his people. Moreover, six months after his father’s death, Kim Jong-il has yet to be officially confirmed in either of his father’s two major posts-state president and general secretary of the ruling Korea Workers Party (KWP). This paper attempts to analyse the dominant trends of the confusing, transitional political and economic situation in North Korea, by focusing on Kim Jong-il and the immediate succession issue, on the medium—term challenge to the regime in both political and economic terms, and on the attitudes and roles of South Korea and the surrounding powers. The likely impact on the prospects for reunification on the Korean peninsula will be discussed in conclusion...|$|E
40|$|In a democracy, every {{individual}} {{is thought to}} have the potential to achieve what Matthew Arnold considers the supreme characteristic of intellectual freedom, "the intellectual maturity of man himself; the tendency to observe facts with a critical spirit; to search for their law, not to wander among them at random; to judge by the rule of reason, not by the impulse of prejudice or caprice" (The Complete Prose Works of Matthew Arnold, Vol. 1, p. 21). But Arnold finds a critical opposition between man's instinctive efforts to develop "fully and freely" and the economic forces of the industrial culture of modern democracies, consumed with work and wealth accumulation. He maintains that in the aesthetic experience of literature we behold the being we are capable of. First in his poetry, and later in his critical prose, Arnold confronts the malaise of modernity and the spiritual fragmentation at the heart of contemporary literature. The hope for his project for education is that it can free us to find new critical consciousness and recover the moral authority of aesthetic judgment. In this study I try to explicate Arnold's conviction that collapsing the duality of literature and science expands our knowledge of the world and that cultivating humanity through the experience of ideas in literature affirms the integrity of the individual and reconciles his or her relation to nature and the human community. The aim of this work is twofold. First it recasts Arnold's <b>uncertain</b> <b>legacy</b> among philosophers of education in the perspective of philosophy as a way of life. I hope it also invites further inquiry into his synthesis of intellect and imagination in the aesthetic phenomenon and its capacity to critique conditions of existence...|$|E
40|$|Ephemeron is a hybrid, Deleuzian creature, {{a product}} of two {{creative}} mediums, two languages and two cultures. Comprising a feature-length film script {{and a collection of}} poetry (written in French and English, respectively), it embodies the chief characteristics of Deleuze’s second semiotic, l’image-temps. These characteristics may be broadly described as non-linear narrative and the absence of both causation and resolution. The resultant ambiguity, though destabilising, is ultimately liberating insofar as it gives rise to possibility, to an ongoing coming-into-being, as opposed to closure. Accordingly, Ephemeron’s bilingual, script-poetry interface seeks to express the possibility inhering in creative dialogue, in the layering of meaning across time and space. The script is set on an unnamed francophone island in the Mediterranean beset by unexplained ecological disturbances. Against this backdrop, three generations of a small family (granddaughter, mother, grandfather) negotiate the complexities of intergenerational trauma and memory loss, while a fourth ‘silent’ character - a seer – investigates environmental anomalies. While the script and poetry are physically separate, poems are linked to specific scenes, generating a ‘crystalline’ structure of meaning. The poems are further divided into ‘cycles’ which explore particular themes (such as civilizational and environmental decline), the backstories of particular characters, memory loss and my own personal encounters with art, place and culture. As a consequence (and in keeping with the core features of Deleuze’s second semiotic), the links between scenes and poems are generally non-linear, and at times elliptical. Put differently, the poems perform an archaeological function, acting as the script’s memory, enabling ‘fossilised’ knowledge, ideas and emotions to emerge, thereby forming a multiplicity of epistemological and ontological circuits. Consistent with Deleuze’s notion of the ‘perfect crystal’, the poetry also carries traces of possible futures, again generating open-ended networks of meaning and possibility. The script-poetry interface is supported by an exegetical work, ‘Between two Worlds’, which examines connections between French Symbolist poetry and post-war time-image cinema. While Deleuze focuses on links between the war and the emergence of time-image film, I broaden the field to include another, possible dynamic: a dynamic that relies on the idea of a creative gene pool, which by definition is diffuse, and its <b>legacy</b> <b>uncertain.</b> Specifically, I argue that the ancestral gene pool of post-war, time-image cinema includes late nineteenth century French poetry, in particular the work of Arthur Rimbaud. This argument is based on the assertion that Rimbaud revolutionised creative practice by undermining formalism, destabilising the subject and rejecting rhetoric. As such, his prose poems and free verse not only reimagined the linguistic vehicle for poetry, but the act of communication itself. The echoes of this revolution were felt some 80 years later in time-image cinema, characterised in the first instance by Italian neorealism. The films of Claire Denis, many of which are meditations on time and space, also embody this cinematic form. The exegesis therefore includes a case study examining the links between Rimbaud’s seminal collections, Illuminations and Une saison en enfer, and Denis’ 1999 film, Beau Travail. It also includes a reflective component (incorporating a brief conclusion) examining my creative process and the structure of Ephemeron. Thesis (Ph. D.)
