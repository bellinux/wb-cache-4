50|$|Metals with {{sufficiently}} low hydrogen diffusion can {{be turned}} into deuterium targets by bombardment of deuterons until the metal is saturated. Gold targets <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> show four times higher efficiency than titanium. Even better results can be achieved with targets made of a thin film of a high-absorption high-diffusivity metal (e.g. titanium) on a substrate with low hydrogen diffusivity (e.g. silver), as the hydrogen is then concentrated on the top layer and can not diffuse away into the bulk of the material. Using a deuterium-tritium gas mixture, self-replenishing D-T targets can be made. The neutron yield of such targets is lower than of tritium-saturated targets in deuteron beams, but their advantage is much longer lifetime and constant level of neutron production. Self-replenishing targets are also tolerant to high-temperature bake-out of the tubes, as their saturation with hydrogen isotopes is performed after the bakeout and tube sealing.|$|E

5000|$|Adult flukes {{are known}} to be quite harmless, as they do not attack on the host tissue. It is the {{immature}} flukes which are most damaging as they get attached to the intestinal wall, literally and actively sloughing off of the tissue. This necrosis is indicated by haemorrhage in faeces, which in turn is a sign of severe enteritis. <b>Under</b> <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> the animals become anorexic and lethargic. It is often accompanied by pronounced diarrhoea, dehydration, oedema, polydipsia, anaemia, listlessness and weight loss. In sheep profuse diarrhoea usually develops two to four weeks after initial infection. If infection is not properly attended death can ensue within 20 days, and in a farm mortality can be very high. In fact there are intermittent reports of mortality as high as 80% among sheep and cattle. [...] Sometimes chronic form is also seen with severe emaciation, anaemia, rough coat, mucosal oedema, thickened duodenum and oedema in the sub maxillary space. The terminally sick animals lie prostrate on the ground, completely emaciated until they die. In buffalos, severe haemorrhage was found to be associated with liver cirrhosis and nodular hepatitis.|$|E
5000|$|Writing logic [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0" [...] {{is done by}} {{charging}} and discharging the floating gate in an FJG cell. It is done through current flowing through the pn diode under different voltage stress conditions at different contact nodes. When charging the floating gate, the pn diode is reverse biased, causing large band bending at the floating gate/channel junction. Band-to-Band tunneling will occur <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> causing electrons tunnel from the floating gate to the channel(Fig.3(a)). Discharging the floating gate is realized by forward biasing the pn diode and draining the charges out of the floating gate(Fig.3(b)). Both processes can be done within a few nano seconds, which enables ultra high speed operation.Fig. 4 illustrates the transient characterization of the read and write operations of an FJG device, wherein the write logic [...] "1" [...] and [...] "0" [...] operations take 5 ns including 1ns rising/falling edge of the signal pulse.

The Hindu Marriage Act, in 1955 which legally permitted divorce to Hindus and other communities who chose to marry under these acts. The Indian Divorce Act 1869 is the law relating to the divorce of person professing the Christian religion. Divorce can be sought by a husband or wife on grounds including adultery, cruelty, desertion for two years, religious conversion, mental abnormality, venereal disease, and leprosy. Divorce is also available based on mutual consent of both the spouses, which can be filed after {{at least one year}} of separated living. Mutual consent divorce can not be appealed, and the law mandates a minimum period of six months (from the time divorce is applied for) for divorce to be granted. Contested divorce is when one of the spouse is not willing to divorce the other spouse, <b>under</b> <b>such</b> <b>condition</b> the divorce is granted only on certain grounds according to the Hindu marriage act of 1955.
