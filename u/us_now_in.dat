2500|$|As a performer, he {{was known}} for his {{flamboyant}} style and showmanship. He came to be regarded as a sex symbol for his androgynous, amorphous sexuality, play with signifiers of gender, and defiance of racial stereotypes. His [...] "audacious, idiosyncratic" [...] fashion sense made use of [...] "ubiquitous purple, alluring makeup and frilled garments." [...] His androgynous look has been compared to that of Little Richard and David Bowie. In 2016, Reynolds described it as [...] "Prince’s ’80s evasion of conventional gender definitions speaks to <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> this trans-aware moment. But it also harks backwards in time to the origins of rock 'n' roll in racial mixture and sexual blurring".|$|E

The danger of idolatry is scarcely so great among Europeans of our time that we need feel it a duty to protest with our lives against it. I have better uses to which to put my life myself.

It’s with <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> these days of steam engines and {{magazine}} rifles. Those old‐ time men wore their labels—the monk’s girdle, the red‐cross shield, the palmer’s shell, and some, according to the pictures, the nimbus too; but can’t modern men, even those who play poker, which is a game of nerve as well as chance, and smoke green cigars, {{be as good as}} they?

"Therefore my {{officers}} and I {{have believed it}} wisest to say to ourselves {{that it is not}} reasonable to expect aid from the outside can come to us for four or five weeks, even if Colonel Willett and Lieutenant Stockwell finally succeed in finding General Schuyler, because it must arrive in sufficient force to break through the lines St. Leger will throw around <b>us.</b> <b>Now</b> <b>in</b> order that we may safely count on having sufficient food to sustain life during at least five weeks, it has been decided, after due deliberation, to put the entire garrison, the commandant as well as the men, on short allowance." ...|$|E
60|$|Behold <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> our frail tenement, {{hemmed in}} by hungry, roaring waves, buffeted by winds. In the inky east two vast clouds, sailing {{contrary}} ways, met; the lightning leapt forth, and the hoarse thunder muttered. Again in the south, the clouds replied, and the forked stream of fire running along the black sky, shewed us the appalling piles of clouds, now met and obliterated by the heaving waves. Great God! And we alone--we three-- alone--alone--sole dwellers on the sea and on the earth, we three must perish! The vast universe, its myriad worlds, and the plains of boundless earth which we had left--the extent of shoreless sea around--contracted to my view--they and all that they contained, shrunk up to one point, even to our tossing bark, freighted with glorious humanity.|$|E

60|$|By this {{glittering}} and imperfect brightness, {{about four}} bells {{in the first}} watch we made our third atoll, Raraka. The low line of the isle lay straight along the sky; so that I was at first reminded of a towpath, and we seemed to be mounting some engineered and navigable stream. Presently a red star appeared, about the height and brightness of a danger signal, and with that my simile was changed; we seemed rather to skirt the embankment of a railway, and the eye began to look instinctively for the telegraph-posts, and the ear to expect the coming of a train. Here and there, but rarely, faint tree-tops broke the level. And {{the sound of the}} surf accompanied <b>us,</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> a drowsy monotone, now with a menacing swing.|$|E
6000|$|... "So!" [...] cried Mr. Scherer, triumphantly, [...] "or it {{is close}} up. We are not fools, no, {{we will not}} lie down and be eaten like lambs for any law. Dickinson can {{put his hand on}} the capital, and I--I have already bought a tract on the lakes, at Bolivar, I have already got a plant {{designed}} with the latest modern machinery. I can put the ore right there, I can send the coke back from here in cars which would otherwise be empty, and manufacture tubes at eight dollars a ton less than they are selling. If we can make tubes we can make plates, and if we can make plates we can make boilers, and beams and girders and bridges.... It is not like it was but where is it all leading, my friend? The time will come--is right on <b>us</b> <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> respect to many products--when the market will be flooded with tubes and plates and girders, and then we'll have to find a way to limit production. And the inefficient mills will all be forced to shut down." ...|$|E
6000|$|The more I have {{contemplated}} {{that ancient}} {{story of the}} Fall, the more it has seemed to me {{within the range of}} probability, and even of experience.

It has happened, as far as I can ascertain, in every race, and every age, and every grade of civilisation. It is happening round <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> every region of the globe. Always and everywhere, it seems to me, have poor human beings been tempted to eat of some [...] "tree of knowledge," [...] that they may be, even for an hour, as gods; wise, but with a false wisdom; careless, but with a frantic carelessness; and happy, but with a happiness which, when the excitement is past, leaves too often--as with that hapless pair in Eden-- depression, shame, and fear. Everywhere, and in all ages, as far as I can ascertain, has man been inventing stimulants and narcotics to supply that want of vitality of which he is so painfully aware; and has asked nature, and not God, to clear the dull brain, and comfort the weary spirit.|$|E
