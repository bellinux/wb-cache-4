5000|$|Sometimes {{the term}} <b>underpopulation</b> {{is applied to}} a {{specific}} economic system. It does not refer to carrying capacity, {{and is not a}} term in opposition to overpopulation, which deals with the total possible population that can be sustained by available food, water, sanitation and other infrastructure. [...] "Underpopulation" [...] is usually defined as a state in which a country's population has declined too much to support its current economic system. Thus the term {{has nothing to do with}} the biological aspects of carrying capacity, but is an economic term employed to imply that the transfer payment schemes of some developed countries might fail once the population declines to a certain point. An example would be if retirees were supported through a social security system which does not invest savings, and then a large emigration movement occurred. In this case, the younger generation may not be able to support the older generation.|$|E
50|$|Little is {{directly}} {{known from the}} economic structures of the region due to the paucity of Arab sources. It is however possible to advance a few assertions. The constant warfare between Muslims and Christians and among Muslims certainly costed the region dearly and must have participated to the rampant problems of <b>underpopulation</b> experienced by the Gharb Al-Andalus. As a matter of example, several attempts to repopulate the regions north of Coimbra to guarantee a {{line of defense against}} the Christian kingdom failed. The economy was heavily influenced both by structural Islamic habits (creation of cities) and the direction chosen by the dominating Muslim ruler of the Maghrib and al-Andalus. For instance, the great interest paid by the Almohad dynasty to the Atlantic helped develop the military and civilian (trade, fishery) activities of the western Iberian ports such as Sevilla, Lisbon, etc. Despite a general impression of sustained development, specially during the 10th and 11th centuries when the area witnessed a noticeable demographic expansion, the Gharb al-Andalus also underwent some dramatic episodes such as the great famine of 740 which decimated the Berber colonists of the Douro region.|$|E
5000|$|Spain legally amassed {{approximately}} 180 tons of {{gold and}} 8200 tons of silver through its endeavors in the New World, and another unknown amount through smuggling, spending this money to finance wars and the arts. The spent silver, suddenly being spread throughout a previously cash starved Europe, caused widespread inflation. The inflation was worsened by a growing population but a static production level, low employee salaries and a rising cost of living. This problem, combined with <b>underpopulation</b> (caused by the Black Death), affected the system of agriculture. The landholding aristocracy suffered under the inflation, since they depended on paying small, fixed wages to peasant tenants that were becoming able to demand higher wages. [...] The aristocracy made failed attempts to counteract this situation by creating short-term leases of their lands to allow periodic revaluation of rent. The manorial system (manor system of lord and peasant tenant) eventually vanished, and the landholding aristocrats were forced to sell pieces of their land {{in order to maintain}} their style of living. [...] Such sales attracted the rich bourgeois (from the French word referring to this dominant class, emerging with commerce), who wanted to buy land and thereby increase their social status. Former [...] "common lands" [...] were fenced by the landed bourgeois, a process known as [...] "enclosure" [...] which increased the efficiency of raising livestock (mainly sheep's wool for the textile industry). This [...] "enclosure" [...] forced the peasants out of rural areas and into the cities, resulting in urbanization and eventually the industrial revolution.|$|E

40|$|Due to long {{chemical}} equilibration times within standard hadronic reactions {{during the}} hadron gas phase in relativistic heavy ion collisions {{it has been}} suggested that the hadrons are "born" into equilibrium after the quark gluon plasma phase. Here we develop a dynamical scheme in which possible Hagedorn states contribute to fast chemical equilibration times of baryon anti-baryon pairs (as well as kaon anti-kaon pairs) inside a hadron gas and just below the critical temperature. Within this scheme, we use master equations and derive various analytical estimates for the chemical equilibration times. Applying a Bjorken picture to the expanding fireball, the kaons and baryons as well as the bath of pions and Hagedorn resonances can indeed quickly chemically equilibrate for both an initial overpopulation or <b>underpopulation</b> of Hagedorn resonances. Moreover, a comparison of our results to (B+B̅) /π^+ and K/π^+ ratios at RHIC, indeed, shows a close match. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We present spectroscopic {{measurements}} of plasma parameters (electron density ne, electron temperature Te, gas temperature Tg, <b>underpopulation</b> factor b) in the hot-core region {{in front of}} the cathode of a low-current, free-burning arc discharge in argon under atmospheric pressure. The discharge is operated in the hot-core mode, creating a hot cathode region with plasma parameters similar to high-current arcs {{in spite of the fact}} that we use comparatively low currents (less than 20 A). We use continuum emission and (optically thin) line emission to determine ne and Te. We apply relaxation measurements based on a power-interruption technique to investigate deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). These measurements let us determine the gas temperature Tg. All measurements are performed side-on with charge-coupled-device cameras as detectors, so that all measured plasma parameters are spatially resolved after an Abel inversion. This yields the first ever spatially resolved observation of the non-LTE phenomena of the hot core in the near-cathode region of free-burning arcs.

There have been measures of social amelioration in rural areas, notably during the last fifty years, that have left a vivid mark on the landscape and raised the standard of living throughout the country. Whether this would have been possible without emigration, or with emigration on a less widespread scale, is a debatable point that need only draw the comment here that if the middle nineteenth century was a period of overpopulation in Eire it is not inconceivable that the middle twentieth century may be a period of <b>underpopulation,</b> at least in the rural areas.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the formation of}} neutral and singly ionized scandium lines in the solar photospheres. The research is aimed derive solar gfϵ_(Sc) values for scandium lines, which will later be used in differential abundance analyses of metal-poor stars. Extensive statistical equilibrium calculations were carried out for a model atom, which comprises 92 terms for Sci and 79 for Scii. Photoionization cross-sections {{are assumed to be}} hydrogenic. Synthetic line profiles calculated from the level populations according to the NLTE departure coefficients were compared with the observed solar spectral atlas. Hyperfine structure (HFS) broadening is taken into account. The statistical equilibrium of scandium is dominated by a strong <b>underpopulation</b> of Sci caused by missing strong lines. It is nearly unaffected by the variation in interaction parameters and only marginally sensitive to the choice of the solar atmospheric model. Abundance determinations using the ODF model lead to a solar Sc abundance of between ϵ_ = 3. 07 and 3. 13, depending on the choice of f values.

40|$|In {{previous}} work (astro-ph/ 0306228) we have established {{that a particular}} quasi-classical theoretical viewpoint {{about the nature of}} gravitation in galaxy discs provides extremely high concordance (comparable with MOND) with the observed dynamics in optical discs. In this paper, we consider the possibility that the optical disc and the flat radio disc represent distinct dynamical regions which are inherently described by distinct phases of the same over-arching theory of which the quasi-classical theory is but one phase. This is a defining moment for the theory under discussion since the only natural generalization available is that from the existing quasi-classical (one-clock) model into a quasi-relativistic (two-clock) model. The quasi-relativistic disc {{turns out to be a}} stationary hyperbolic disc within which information propagates along characteristics and within which the rotation curve is necessarily exactly flat. The transition between the two components of the disc is managed by physically determined jump conditions which are represented by a set of non-linear algebraic equations.

40|$|The {{population}} {{increase in the}} Netherlands {{in the years after}} the first World War caused the author to study its consequences, particularly in relation to Dutch agriculture. The concepts 'overpopulation and <b>underpopulation</b> and optimum population' were discussed {{in the light of the}} theories of Malthus and many others. As definition the standard of living, measured by average income per head, was chosen. The population density and the possibilities of changing the agricultural production were also judged from an economic aspect. Employment in agriculture could be diminished by planning and mechanization; intensification and reclamation could increase employment. In the 1920 's the prices of land and the rent of farms increased sharply and did not respond to the decline in prices of agricultural products. This led to a partial overpopulation that may be ascribed to the large number of farmer's sons, born during prosperity, who had been waiting for a farm. Besides the possibilities of extending agricultural employment, emigration of farmers and farmer's sons was considered one of the best remedies for this problem.

40|$|Non-local {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium (NLTE) line formation for neutral and singly-ionized iron is considered through {{a range of}} stellar parameters characteristic of cool stars. A comprehensive model atom for Fe I and Fe II is presented. Our NLTE calculations support the earlier conclusions that the statistical equilibrium (SE) of Fe I shows an <b>underpopulation</b> of Fe I terms. However, {{the inclusion of the}} predicted high-excitation levels of Fe I in our model atom leads to a substantial decrease in the departures from LTE. As a test and first application of the Fe I/II model atom, iron abundances are determined for the Sun and four selected stars with well determined stellar parameters and high-quality observed spectra. Within the error bars, lines of Fe I and Fe II give consistent abundances for the Sun and two metal-poor stars when inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms are taken into account in the SE calculations. For the close-to-solar metallicity stars Procyon and β Vir, the difference (Fe II - Fe I) is about 0. 1 dex independent of the line formation model, either NLTE or LTE. We evaluate the influence of departures from LTE on Fe abundance and surface gravity determination for cool stars.
