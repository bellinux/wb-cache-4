40|$|A {{technology}} of puffed-salted rice processing has been studied. Five rice varieties (IR 64, IR 42, IR 48, Cisadane and Gemar) were used. Salt solution was sprayed onto the <b>rice</b> prior to <b>puffing,</b> at level of 10 % of <b>rice</b> weight. <b>Puffed</b> salted <b>rice</b> {{were compared to}} puffed unsalted-rice. The results showed that either rice varieties or salting affected the <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> characteristics. <b>Puffed</b> <b>rice</b> of Gemar variety had the highest whiteness and volume expansion, and lowest hardness. Protein quality decreased in the <b>puffed</b> <b>rice,</b> indicated by decreasing in amino acids composition. Aromatics and S-amino acid were more susceptible to degradation during puffing than the others. Salt spraying before puffing resulted in <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> with lower whiteness and volume expansion, and higher water solubility and gel consistency. Salting also increased amino acids susceptibility to degradation during puffing. Salting, however, decreased {{in the ability to}} absorb water and increased hardness, therefore the treatment would keep <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> crispy for longer lime rather than puffed, unsalted-rice. Organoleptics evaluation also showed that <b>puffed</b> <b>rice</b> of Gemar variety had the high score of color, appearance, taste and crispiness, though poor in flavor. Rice salting decreased in the panelist acceptability of color and appearance, but increased in the crispiness, taste and flavor acceptability...|$|R
