25|$|From 75th Street south Naperville {{numbered}} east-west streets roughly {{follow the}} same grid layout as the City of Chicago. In other words, if 75th Street continued east past its terminus at Illinois Route 83, in Willowbrook, it would eventually be the same 75th Street as found in Chicago city limits. However, the older part of Naperville has a second numerical grid, starting downtown at Main and Benton, with 4th and 5th Avenues {{just north of the}} BNSF tracks, and continuing through 15th Avenue. The difference is that the numbers in the older system go up from downtown, traveling south to north, and the other grid's numbers go <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> travel north to south. There is also a geographical-based naming system, with West Street and North Street defining the older boundaries of the city. Along with these are streets named after the city they lead to, i.e., Naper/Plainfield Road heads towards Plainfield, while Aurora Avenue leads to Aurora and Chicago Avenue to Chicago (it becomes Maple Ave. in neighboring Lisle before becoming 55th Street in Downers Grove).|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood {{published}} {{a series of}} short articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon magazine, {{the first of which}} was about a monster known as the curst. Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, and assigned Jeff Grubb {{to find out more about}} the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him [...] "Do you just make this stuff <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> go, or do you really have a huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered [...] "yes" [...] to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD 2nd Edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published. Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee. Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, [...] "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".|$|E

The website's panel of reviewers also voted Chocolate Castle their Game of the Month for May 2007. Simon Carless, {{a video game}} journalist and developer writing for Kotaku said [...] "The art style is adorable and the gameplay twistedly interestingâ€”thumbs up". IndieGames.com writer Tim W. described it as [...] "one of the better puzzle games I've ever played". Independent game developer Derek Yu praised the attention to detail in the game, in particular [...] "the windows in the castle that light <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> complete stages, {{and the way the}} chocolate gets munched up and leaves crumbs".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, papa, {{there was}} so much talking going on, that the {{professor}} gave it <b>up</b> <b>as</b> hopeless. <b>You</b> have heard the news, of course?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'All right, old woman,' I says, 'I'll git <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> say I must, and I'll smash him. Get me {{something}} to put on,' I says.|$|E
6000|$|... "We are, but I see {{a way out}} of the difficulty. Don't {{distress}} yourself, Joe; {{we shall}} have everything squared <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> call it in a few days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{now that}} you have stood <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> call it, what do you count on doing?" [...] Horry asked with a sneer, and Saul, shaking him vigorously, replied threateningly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're not {{bringing}} me <b>up</b> properly--not <b>as</b> <b>you</b> ought to," [...] explained Ann. [...] "You {{give way to}} me too much, and you never scold me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With {{no signs}} of letting up," [...] {{finished}} John Barrow. [...] "Boys, I am afraid we are snowed in, or snowed <b>up,</b> just <b>as</b> <b>you</b> feel like calling it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have as {{much right}} {{to look for a}} mine <b>up</b> here <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have," [...] put in Sol Blugg. [...] "If you own a mine, where are your stakes or other landmarks?" ...|$|R
60|$|GAYNOR. Well, perhaps I {{can get the}} Society to pay {{half for}} your daughter--if you're really as hard <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> pretend. They're {{willing to do that}} where it seems necessary.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who can say? She was {{not very}} long in taking <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> call it, with Captain Marrable. I should be happier if she were here, even if I did not see her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see what}} it means !" [...] cried Ham Spink, in a great rage. [...] "While {{we were at the}} other camp those fellows came here and fixed things <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> see!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, don't {{make such}} a fuss about it. People do get over these things, you know. She {{probably}} isn't so wrapped <b>up</b> in <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> think, either. One's always rather apt to exaggerate the passion one's inspired other people with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could have}} got up the rope, Holland, but I could not have gone <b>up</b> straight, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did, without {{stopping}} for a bit to take breath. You don't look so very strong, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I? Oh, I {{was saying}} nothing,' {{answered}} the fox drearily. 'Just carry me to your cave and eat me <b>up</b> <b>as</b> quick <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I feared as much,' said he, 'when I sounded her. Poor Dick, poor Dick. And yet I believe I am as much cut <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are. I {{was born}} to see others happy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{care whether}} it was fair or not," [...] replied the girl with a wilful shake of her head. [...] "And was it fair of you to back me <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> did?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I feared as much," [...] said he, [...] "when I sounded her. Poor Dick, poor Dick! And yet I believe I am as much cut <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> are. I {{was born}} to see others happy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll try. I'll {{think over}} {{what you have}} said, and try to believe it. And you'll come <b>up</b> <b>as</b> often <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can, won't you, Anne?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Denton laughed. [...] "I haven't {{much more}} to do," [...] she answered. [...] "Just tidying <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> see; {{and two or three}} half-finished things I shall try to complete. After that, I'll perhaps take a rest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has as much}} idea {{of giving}} <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> or I have," [...] said Lord Cantrip to his friend Mr. Gresham, as they walked arm-in-arm {{together}} from the Treasury Chambers across St. James's Park towards the clubs.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you would}} have me give <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> seem to have done, the sublime, the beautiful, the heavenly, for a dry and barren chain of dialectic--in which, for aught I know,--for after all, Raphael, I cannot cope with you--I am a woman--a weak woman!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Dearest Clara, {{you know}} what I mean. You must be aware that a girl of your rank, and brought <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have been, cannot be a fitting wife {{for a man who}} will now have to {{struggle}} with the world at every turn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three times, as you say. And I {{wonder that}} a girl brought <b>up</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> have been, by moral force, should be capable of repeating such a falsehood. But we had an awful row, really and truly. She lost her temper. Fortunately, I never lose mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I {{care about}} down or up? It makes no difference, as he's gone. If {{he had lived}} one might have cared about being <b>up,</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> call it. Eh, deary; I'll be going after him before long, {{and it will be}} no matter then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Would {{you care}} to turn over your suits and guns?" [...] the A-class leady asked politely. [...] "The suits are uncomfortable and you'll have no need for weapons. The Russians have given <b>up</b> theirs, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> can see." ...|$|R
60|$|The brigadiers {{are not all}} <b>up</b> north <b>as</b> <b>you</b> suspect. I know of but one, Hurlbut, who is there. General McClernand is at Cairo, Prentiss at Ironton, and I presume Curtis will be {{with the}} command under me.|$|R
