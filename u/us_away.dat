5|$|Although Christ, like man, {{is made in}} {{the image}} of God, he alone shares the {{likeness}} of God the Father. Christ is both sinless and apathetic, and thus by striving to imitate Christ, man can achieve salvation. To Clement, sin is involuntary, and thus irrational , removed only through the wisdom of the Logos. God's guidance of <b>us</b> <b>away</b> from sin is thus a manifestation of God's universal love for mankind. The word play on λόγος and αλόγον is characteristic of Clement's writing, and may be rooted in the Epicurean belief that relationships between words are deeply reflective of relationships between the objects they signify.|$|E

[...] In a Rolling Stone interview in 1972, Morrison told John Grissim, Jr.: [...] "I was really pretty happy with the album. [...] The only complaint I had was that it was rather rushed.

[...] A moderate Social Democrat, Väinö Voionmaa agonised in 1919: [...] "Those who still trust {{in the future of}} this nation must have an exceptionally strong faith.

It came about when Orson had {{an idea for a}} song. [...] They played it to us – it was just a verse and a bridge and we completely changed the format of the song to make it our own and the result is this incredibly provocative sexy number that we love." [...] She elaborated in a separate interview: [...] "When we started working with the guys from Orson the sound just blew <b>us</b> <b>away</b> – it's completely fresh sounding {{but at the same time}} has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career, so it's perfect for this album!" ...|$|E
500|$|For the film's director, King {{wanted someone}} [...] "who would steer <b>us</b> <b>away</b> from the {{traditional}} BBC-type costume drama," [...] and [...] "make a period film for an MTV audience". By chance, someone recommended King watch the 2005 film C.R.A.Z.Y. by French-Canadian filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallée, and became immediately interested in hiring him. King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting. Though at first expressing disinterest, Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script. He commented, [...] "When I read the script, I saw it's a family drama, a romance, a political plot at the same time." [...] Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because [...] "she has this attitude, which is you make noise, you want to yell and yell loudly to your parents and all the people, to authority...

500|$|... "Northern Lites" [...] {{was written}} by singer Gruff Rhys about [...] "the weather", and was {{particularly}} inspired by coverage of the [...] "terrifying, worldwide, seven-year phenomenon" [...] of the west Pacific El Niño climate pattern on [...] "weather channels" [...] in 1998. The song's title refers to the Aurora Borealis, a natural light display which can be observed particularly in the polar regions, and usually at night. The band were convinced that they had seen the lights before the track was written but, as no-one else was present, they could not get confirmation that what they had witnessed {{was not simply a}} [...] "Furry fantasy". Rhys has claimed that he would have called the song [...] "Aurora Borealis" [...] but [...] "Latin song titles are out of the question". Although Rhys has said that the song is [...] "about asking Jesus if he decides to seek his revenge on us, {{to get it over with}} as soon as possible and blow <b>us</b> <b>away</b> to the Northern Lights" [...] he has also stated that, although some critics have interpreted the track as being about [...] "questioning one's faith", it is really [...] "just a song about the weather".|$|E

500|$|In 1929, at {{the second}} UAHC convention, Witt had {{asserted}} that America [...] "by its very pleasantness and friendliness lures <b>us</b> <b>away</b> from our ancient loyalties. Its secularism is so delightful, its mutuality so penetrative, its universalism so delightful, that by a sort of sheer spiritual osmosis it incorporates us into itself and makes us look and {{become more and more}} like itself". Witt argued that Jews had to resist this pull. Ten years later, however, in a 1939 article in The Christian Century, he argued that Jews should celebrate Christmas. In his view, Christians were now more liberal and celebrated [...] "the inherent humanness and universalism" [...] of Christmas, rather than any specifically Christian doctrine. Stating that his children had been deprived of the holiday's pleasures, Witt asserted that Judaism was already a syncretic religion, and that celebrating the holiday was an ecumenical act which did not indicate that he was [...] "thereby drawn even by the breadth of a hair nearer to the worship of an ecclesiastical Christ". He concluded by asking [...] "Is it neither treason of Jew nor triumph of Christian but partnership of Jew and Christian in the making of a better world in which the Christ can have part only by energizing and perpetuating and hallowing the partnership?" ...|$|E
500|$|The Sugababes {{collaborated with}} members from Orson to produce two brand new tracks for the album, [...] "Easy" [...] and [...] "Good to Be Gone". Buchanan spoke upon the collaboration, saying: [...] "When we {{started working with}} the Orson guys the sound just blew <b>us</b> <b>away</b> – it's so fresh, but has the same qualities as the biggest songs of our career.

After leaving the studio, she called {{the other members of the}} group and spoke of her dissatisfaction with [...] "Easy". Range realised she enjoyed the song after listening to it the following day, and later named it one of her favourite songs by the group.

[...] "Red Dress" [...] was re-recorded to feature the vocals of Berrabah instead of Buena following the latter's departure from the group.|$|E
500|$|... "Fast Lane" [...] was {{received}} favorably by critics. Upon the release on the EP, , Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz published a track-by-track review. According to Lipshutz, [...] "Fast Lane" [...] is [...] "G-funk on steroids, with sing-song refrain breaking up crushing mic-trading bout between Royce da 5'9" [...] and Eminem." [...] He {{also referred to}} [...] "Fast Lane" [...] {{as one of the}} highlight songs of the album. Rolling Stone gave a positive review. According to Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone, [...] "Eminem kicks 'Fast Lane' 1999-style, reconnecting with the hungry young lunatic who sounded like he only had a stanza to blow <b>us</b> <b>away</b> or it was back to the auto plant." [...] Dolan also commented on the infamous lyric [...] "I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this, Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus," [...] saying that Eminem has been much more heinous before. According to Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly, Royce da 5'9" [...] performs extremely well on the [...] "hard-hitting" [...] song, even calling him a [...] "lyrical beast". Although music website Consequence of Sound gave a rather mixed review on the EP as a whole, editor Winston Robbins favored [...] "Fast Lane" [...] and said that it is [...] "hands down one of the best hip-hop tracks of 2011" [...] and that the rapping is [...] "second to none".|$|E

She assures him {{that there will be no}} other like her. [...] "Miles De Voces" [...] (""), a hip hop track from Buddha's Family (2001), contains simple harmonic progressions, synthesizers, affronted lyrics and a sociopolitical theme while alternating between major and minor key. [...] "La Abusadora" [...] ("The Abuser") originates from Iván Joy's Diamond Hits (2004). While reviewing the compilation Reggaeton Diamond Hits (2006), Steve Leggett, from Allmusic, named the song the highlight of the album. [...] "Aunque La Distancia" [...] ("") was originally included on the compilation release Romances Del Ruido 2 (2003) by Baby Rasta & Gringo as [...] "Llora Mi Corazón" [...] (""). Queen's rap contributes to a hip hop beat accompanied by Gran Omar. It is also known by the name of [...] "Eres Mi Hombre" [...] (""). [...] "Yo Lamento" [...] (Salsa Version), also from Contra La Corriente, is essentially the same track only re-recorded and mixed into salsa with a duration of four minutes and sixteen seconds; the longest on the album and only salsa track. In the song, Queen sings to her friend about loving her friend's man. She tells her that she had never intended to hurt her. Queen assures that she loves her friend, but acknowledges the fact that their friendship was lost. [...] "He looked at me and we started dancing while the music took <b>us</b> <b>away.</b> Dancing, he touched me. My mind wasn't thinking, passion was leading.

500|$|It's {{human nature}} to look to {{external}} forces when faced with our own inadequacies but the ethicist is against this. Comparison is an esthetic exercise and {{has nothing to do}} with ethics and religion. He says, [...] "Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person’s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy." [...] He also asks if a person [...] "absolutely in love can know if he is more or less in love than others." [...] He completes this thought later in his Concluding Unscientific Postscript and expands on looking inward in Practice in Christianity.The ethical and the ethical-religious have nothing to do with the comparative. … All comparison delays, and that is why mediocrity likes it so much and, if possible, traps everyone in it by its despicable friendship among mediocrities. A person who blames others, that they have corrupted him, is talking nonsense and only informs against himself. Concluding Unscientific Postscript p. 549-550Comparison is the most disastrous association that love can enter into; comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance love can make; comparison is the worst of all seductions. Søren Kierkegaard, Works of Love (1847), Hong, p. 186 Lord Jesus Christ, our foolish minds are weak; they are more than willing to be drawn-and there is so much that wants to draw us to itself.

[...] But you, who are the truth, only you, Savior and Redeemer, can truly draw a person to yourself, which you have promised to do-that you will draw all to yourself. Then may God grant that by repenting we may come to ourselves, so that you, according to your Word, can draw us to yourself-from on high, but through lowliness and abasement.

[...] It is from the fourth century onwards that we can gather a more precise Idea as to the composition of the hour of Terce. Most of John Cassian's Institutes III.3 is an exegetical justification for the offices of Terce, Sext, and None, in which he relates each hour to a scriptural passage in which an important event occurs at that hour. In this way, by directing the monks to scripture, the hours acquired an educational benefit. This was also the view held in Ireland, where the psalms selected for Terce focused on the glorification of the risen Christ.|$|E
