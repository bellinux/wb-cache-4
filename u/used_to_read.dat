5|$|Baeyertz {{was born}} as Emilia Louise Aronson on 29 March 1842 in Bangor, North Wales. Her family were wealthy {{orthodox}} Jews, {{and she was}} brought up to strict Jewish ideals. She attended school for a while but, {{by the time that}} she reached thirteen, her family removed her from formal education and she remained at home due to her ill health. Instead, she spent her time with her mother, who <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Shakespeare to her, and would spend time in her family's library practising reading aloud.|$|E
5|$|Early in the game, {{the player}} is {{provided}} with a personal data assistant (PDA). PDAs contain security clearance levels, allowing the player to access certain areas that are otherwise locked and off-limits. Additionally, the PDA can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> e-mails and play videos that the player's character acquires during the game. Whenever the player picks up {{any of the other}} PDAs found throughout the game, its contents are automatically downloaded to the player's own device. Other PDAs often contain e-mails and audio logs for other characters, which can provide useful information such as storage or door key codes, as well as significant plot details.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to and {{independent of the}} division into suras, there are various ways of dividing the Quran into parts of approximately equal length for convenience in reading. The 30 juz' (plural ajzāʼ) can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> through the entire Quran in a month. Some of these parts are known by names—which are the first few words by which the juzʼ starts. A juz is sometimes further divided into two ḥizb (plural aḥzāb), and each hizb subdivided into four rubʻ al-ahzab. The Quran is also divided into seven approximately equal parts, manzil (plural manāzil), {{for it to be}} recited in a week.|$|E

25|$|Some drives use special {{techniques}}, such as Plextor's GigaRec or Sanyo's HD-BURN, {{to write}} more data onto a given disc; these techniques are inherently {{deviations from the}} Compact Disc (Red, Yellow, and/or Orange Book) standards, making the recorded discs proprietary-formatted and not fully compatible with standard CD players and drives. However, in certain applications where discs will not be distributed or exchanged outside a private group {{and will not be}} archived for a long time, a proprietary format may be an acceptable way to obtain greater capacity (up to 1.2GiB with GigaRec or 1.8GiB with HD-BURN on 99 minute media). The greatest risk in using such a proprietary data storage format, assuming that it works reliably as designed, is that it may be difficult or impossible to repair or replace the hardware <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the media if it fails, is damaged, or is lost after its original vendor discontinues it.|$|E
25|$|The method <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> NANDflash memory {{can cause}} nearby {{cells in the}} same memory block to change over time (become programmed). This is known as read disturb. The {{threshold}} number of reads is generally {{in the hundreds of}} thousands of reads between intervening erase operations. If reading continually from one cell, that cell will not fail but rather one of the surrounding cells on a subsequent read. To avoid the read disturb problem the flash controller will typically count the total number of reads to a block since the last erase. When the count exceeds a target limit, the affected block is copied over to a new block, erased, then released to the block pool. The original block is as good as new after the erase. If the flash controller does not intervene in time, however, a read disturb error will occur with possible data loss if the errors are too numerous to correct with an error-correcting code.|$|E
25|$|Gamelan {{music is}} {{traditionally}} not notated and {{began as an}} oral tradition. In the 19th century, however, the kraton (palaces) of Yogyakarta and Surakarta developed distinct notations for transcribing the repertoire. These were not <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the music, which was memorized, but to preserve pieces in the court records. The Yogyanese notation is a checkerboard notation, which uses six or seven vertical lines to represent notes of higher pitch in the balungan (melodic framework), and horizontal lines which represent the series of beats, read downward with time. The fourth vertical line and every fourth horizontal line (completing a gatra) are darkened for legibility. Symbols on the left indicate the colotomic or metric structure of gongs and so forth, while specific drum features are notated in symbols to the right. The Solonese notation reads horizontally, like Western notation, but does not use barlines. Instead, note values and rests are squiggled between the notes.|$|E

25|$|The writer himself cited Cilibi Moise, a Wallachian Jewish peddler and aphorist, as {{an early}} influence, recalling how, as a child, he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> his one-liner jokes, and treasured them as {{exceptional}} samples of concise humor. He was similarly impressed by the works of Moise's contemporary, the prolific author Anton Pann, whose accomplishments he praised during talks with his fellow Convorbiri Critice contributors, and whose work served {{as a source for}} at least one of his own stories. Nicolae Filimon, whom Caragiale praised on several occasions, was the author of short stories which several authors have identified as less accomplished versions of Rică Venturiano. A similar connection has been traced between the various sketches authored by Ion Heliade Rădulescu, in which Transylvanian writers are the object of ridicule, and Caragiale's character Marius Chicoş Rostogan. Caragiale's late admiration for Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu was also linked to affinities in comedic styles, as was his companionship with Iacob Negruzzi (himself the author of sarcastic pieces ridiculing the liberal politicians and lawyers).|$|E
25|$|A laser is {{a device}} that emits {{electromagnetic}} radiation through a process called stimulated emission. Laser light is usually spatially coherent, {{which means that the}} light either is emitted in a narrow, low-divergence beam, or can be converted into one with the help of optical components such as lenses. Lasers are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> compact discs and bar codes, guide missiles, remove ulcers, fabricate steel, precisely measure the distance from Earth to the Moon, record ultradefined images of brain tissue, entertain people in light shows and do thousands of other things. In 1957, American physicist Gordon Gould first theorized the idea and use of laser technology. Despite a 20-year battle with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, Gould is now widely associated as the original inventor of laser. In addition, Charles H. Townes and Arthur L. Schawlow, scientists at Bell Laboratories, wrote a paper, Infrared and Optical Masers in 1958 that was enormously influential on the theory of lasers. Ironically, Gould, Townes, or Schawlow never built the first working laser. On July 7, 1960, American physicist Theodore H. Maiman created and built the first laser. The core of his laser consisted of a man-made ruby as the active medium, a material that had been judged unsuitable by other scientists who rejected crystal cores in favor of various gases.|$|E

500|$|Jabara {{joined the}} Boy Scouts, {{eventually}} becoming an Eagle Scout. At an early age, {{he was set}} on becoming a pilot, [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> articles about [...] Rickenbacker and all these novels you read about air combat, and I guess from the sixth grade it was my ambition to be a fighter pilot." [...] He worked at his parents' grocery store and graduated from Wichita North High School in Wichita, Kansas in May 1942. Standing five feet, five inches (165cm) tall, Jabara was short for a potential fighter pilot (and was reportedly required to wear corrective eyewear), but this did not prevent him from immediately enlisting as an aviation cadet of the United States Army Air Corps at Fort Riley, Kansas. In an attempt to improve his eyesight for flying, he ate 20 carrots {{a day in the}} mistaken belief that this would improve his vision. After attending four flying schools in Texas, he received his pilot's wings and a commission as second lieutenant at Moore Field, Texas in October 1943. Jabara with his wife, Nina, had four children: James William (b. 1949), Carol Ann (b. 1950), Cathy (b. 1952), and Jeanne (b. 1957).|$|E
500|$|Levin {{was born}} in London, the second child and only son of Philip Levin, a tailor of Jewish Bessarabian descent, and his wife, Rose, née Racklin. Philip Levin {{abandoned}} the family and moved to South Africa when Levin was three. The two children were brought up {{with the help of}} their maternal grandparents, who had emigrated from Lithuania {{at the turn of the}} 20th century. Levin wrote of his childhood, [...] "My home was not a religious one; my grandfather read the scriptures to himself silently and struggled through a little English; my grandmother, who could read no language at all, lit a candle on the appropriate days, as did my mother, though for her it was not really a religious sign. My uncles were quite secular ... and had hardly anything to do with the religion of their father and grandfathers". In The Guardian after Levin's death, Quentin Crewe wrote, [...] "His illiterate grandparents' stories about life in Russia must have instilled in him the passionate belief in the freedom of the individual that lasted his whole life. In return, as he grew older, he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> to them. Bernard could not read Hebrew, but he could get by in Yiddish".|$|E
500|$|The novelist Evelyn Waugh {{had been}} {{familiar}} with the Diary since his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—Arthur Waugh <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> passages aloud to his family, and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household. Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, {{to the extent of}} writing in his 1930 essay [...] "One Way to Immortality" [...] that it was [...] "the funniest book in the world". He added: [...] "Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years". [...] Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world. In his 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited, Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the Diary [...] "with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression". Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, {{and the way in which}} the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.|$|E
