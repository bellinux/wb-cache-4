25|$|Guanyin is revered in {{the general}} Chinese {{population}} due to her <b>unconditional</b> <b>love</b> and compassion.

An old Chinese superstition involves a woman who, wishing to have a child, offers a shoe to Guanyin. In Chinese culture, a borrowed shoe sometimes is used when a child is expected. After the child is born, the shoe is returned to its owner along with a new pair as a thank you gift.|$|E
25|$|Guanyin is {{immensely popular}} among Chinese Buddhists, {{especially}} those from devotional schools. She is generally {{seen as a}} source of <b>unconditional</b> <b>love</b> and, more importantly, as a saviour. In her bodhisattva vow, Guanyin promises to answer the cries and pleas of all sentient beings and to liberate them from their own karmic woes. Based on the Lotus Sutra and the Shurangama sutra, Avalokitesvara is generally seen as a saviour, both spiritually and physically. The sutras state that through his saving grace even those who have no chance of being enlightened can be enlightened, and those deep in negative karma can still find salvation through his compassion.|$|E
40|$|Although passionate or erotic love {{continues}} {{to receive the}} most attention from relationship scholars, {{there is a growing}} interest in a variety of love variously referred to as altruistic, compassionate, self-giving, or agapic love. Because this type of <b>unconditional,</b> other-oriented <b>love</b> appears to have important implications for the interpersonal dynamics and overall quality of close romantic relationships, there has been increased interest in delineating its correlates and possible causal antecedents. The goal of the present empirical investigation was to explore three potential demographic correlates of <b>unconditional</b> or agapic <b>love</b> – age, gender, and ethnicity. A large, multi-ethnic community sample of adult men and women (N = 697) individually completed the 7 -item Agapic subscale of the Love Attitudes Scale (Hendrick & Hendrick, 1990). Although age was not associated with agapic love scores, a significant overall gender difference was obtained such that men scored higher than women. Ethnic differences also were found. Specifically, African American participants reported lower levels of agapic love than did Latino/a, Asian/Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic White participants...|$|R
5000|$|Every {{human being}} yearns for love. From childhood, {{that was the}} {{tremendous}} desire of my heart; to me, there is no meaning to life without love. But I had the notion that I could never be content with imperfect love. The love that would satisfy me was a <b>love</b> <b>unconditional,</b> a <b>love</b> that would never disappoint me. My reason told me that in seeking perfect love, I {{must go to the}} Source; I must go to the One who alone is capable of giving such love. Thus began my search for God.I was a girl of seventeen when, in 1931, my quest led to a meeting that forever changed my life. I {{had the good fortune to}} attend a series of lectures given in my hometown of Salt Lake City by a great man of God, Paramahansa Yogananda. In the years that followed, I learned from him the way to total fulfillment of the lifelong yearning of my heart: perfect love, divine love—the all-consuming love experienced in communion with the Eternal Beloved of our souls.|$|R

25|$|Experiences in a person's {{life are}} {{a major source of}} how {{self-esteem}} develops. In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have. <b>Unconditional</b> <b>love</b> from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older. Students in elementary school who have high self-esteem tend to have authoritative parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards for their child and allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, {{after making}} a guest {{appearance}} in the Vijay starrer Rajavin Parvaiyile, Ajith appeared in his first major success; Aasai.

The film became a big success and established Ajith as an upcoming actor in the Tamil film industry. He later played the lead in Kalloori Vaasal, co-starring Prashanth and Pooja Bhatt. Ajith's second successful film {{came in the form}} of National Award winning Kadhal Kottai, in which Ajith reunited with Agathiyan, the director of the earlier project Vaanmathi, the film which told the tale of two people falling in <b>unconditional</b> <b>love</b> without seeing each other until the climax. The film paired him opposite Devayani, with Heera Rajgopal playing a supporting role. Heera, Ajith's then girlfriend, played a major role in shaping Ajith's career.|$|E
25|$|Imonida, {{the love}} of Oroonoko’s life, is a {{beautiful}} African woman who is sold into slavery after Oroonoko attempts to rescue her. When Oroonoko meets Imonida, they instantly fall in love. His first encounter with her is described as, “a beauty, that to describe her truly she was female to the noble male, the beautiful black Venus to our young Mars, as charming in her person as he, and of delicate virtues” (Behn, 9). Oroonoko is smitten by her, instantly asks her for her hand in marriage, and without hesitation she agrees. Although the African tradition of having more than one wife is still prevalent during this time, Oroonoko assures Imonida that he will never take on another wife. It {{is evident in the}} novella that Oroonoko and Imonida’s love for one another is unconditional. Once the King, Oroonoko’s grandfather, hears different rumors of how beautiful Imoinda is, he becomes adamant on making her one of his women. Despite his grandson’s deep affection and love for Imonida, the King gives her a royal veil which officially marks Imoinda as one of the King’s women. This is an honor that is nearly impossible to refuse and Oroonoko is angered by his grandfather’s actions. Imonida becomes a vital character by becoming the heart and center of this tragic travel narrative alongside Oroonko. Her beauty, strength, and flawless characteristics attract Oroonoko, the King, and even the reader for that matter. Oroonoko and Imoinda were constantly being separated once Imoinda gets sold into slavery. Regardless of how long they were a part, their love remained strong and eventually they are reunited. This never ending love between Oroonoko and Imoinda is evident throughout the novella. Both characters are willing to announce their love, make brutal sacrifices, and remain passionate for one another which helps solidify the strength of their <b>unconditional</b> <b>love.</b>|$|E

[...] Blogger Mark Fisher states that Bruce's search for justice requires him to learn from a proper father figure, with Thomas Wayne and Ra's al Ghul being the two counterpoints.

500|$|According to Hoshino, the series' main theme {{focuses on}} tragedy. Many {{characters}} such as Allen across the series suffer poor fates such as losing {{a loved one}} and being tempted to revive them by the Earl. Although this works, the people are revived as Akumas who consume the skin of their loved ones. This has led to state that an initial theme is that people should not be brought back to life. Although some characters like Kanda express <b>unconditional</b> <b>love</b> to Alma, their happiness is short-lived due to Alma dying shortly after this with another writer finding fitting for the series' dark narrative. Additionally, Allen's life becomes sadder across the series as he is forced to abandon the Black Order due to the Pope removing his rights as an exorcist and he is treated as Noah due to his connections with these characters. Nevertheless, Hoshino still {{tried to make it}} fun for the readers, stating that Allen will always have allies.|$|E
30|$|For axiology, {{problems}} such as wicked or perverse love, malicious pleasure, suffering because of another person’s pleasure, or compassion have divided theorists. What seem to be <b>unconditional</b> values (<b>love,</b> pleasure) may become part of something bad; {{what seems to be}} an unconditional disvalue (suffering) may become part something good (suffering because of the other’s suffering). Values and disvalues appear to form complexes or wholes whose axiological index may be different from that of its components. But how is this possible? Simply declaring that there can be such a difference is not an explanation. A more convincing answer is needed. The present attempt relies on a realist account of values and directs the focus on instantiation which is considered responsible for these differences.|$|R
