2500|$|The Voyages {{station is}} themed as a 17th-century ship, with the {{basement}} being the cargo hold, {{the second level}} being the deck, and the ride operator's controls being the [...] "Captain's Quarters". The station has three levels: a ground floor, a second floor, and a basement. Before entering the station, guests may be redirected to several outdoor queue switchbacks. Once the switchbacks have been navigated, guests enter {{the ground floor of}} the station. The ground floor includes two staircases to the basement; however, most of it is composed of maintenance areas. Depending {{on the size of the}} line, the park may or may not open the basement. If the basement is open, guests will walk down the stairs immediately after entering the ground floor of the station. The basement is filled with nothing but queue switchbacks. Once these switchbacks have been navigated, guests will walk up the stairs to the ground floor before continuing up the stairs to the second floor. The second floor of the station holds the roller coaster's loading and unloading areas, as well as the two transfer tracks and maintenance bays. On the loading side of the station there are fourteen air-powered queue gates, one for each row of the train. On the <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> of the station there are free shelves and lockers that riders may use to hold their belongings for the duration of the ride. The <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> is also home to the ride operator's controls and two exit gates: a sliding gate near the front of the train and a swinging gate near the rear of the train. Beyond the <b>unloading</b> <b>side</b> of the station is an area that holds two maintenance bays. These allow unused trains to be stored during normal operation and also provides an additional area for maintenance crews to inspect the roller coaster trains.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{people with}} lateralized disorders, such as stroke, Weight-Bearing Asymmetry (WBA) is common. It is {{associated}} with postural instability, however, WBA {{is one of several}} abnormalities that may affect postural stability in these disorders. Therefore, we investigated the isolated effects of WBA on dynamic postural stability in healthy individuals. METHODS: Ten young participants were subjected to multidirectional stance perturbations by support surface translations at three levels of WBA (0, 10 and 20 % of body weight unloading of one leg). The stepping threshold was determined iteratively for each condition and in four perturbation directions (forward, backward, leftward and rightward). The stepping threshold was defined as the highest perturbation intensity recovered from with a feet-in-place response. The Margin of Stability (MOS) at the stepping threshold was defined as the smallest distance between the vertical projection of the Extrapolated Center of Mass (XCOM) and the edge of the base of support. RESULTS: WBA decreased the stepping threshold (stability decreased) for perturbations towards the loaded side (translations towards the <b>unloaded</b> <b>side),</b> whereas it increased stepping thresholds for perturbations towards the <b>unloaded</b> <b>side.</b> No significant effects of WBA were found on the MOS. WBA increased the frequency of stepping with the unloaded leg upon forward and backward perturbations. CONCLUSION: WBA increased dynamic stability towards the unloaded leg following external balance perturbations and resulted in a greater probability of stepping with this leg. Future studies are needed to evaluate the functional significance of these WBA-related effects on postural stability in people with lateralized disorders...|$|R

Typical stress variations as the gear tooth moves through mesh are illustrated. At the tooth root location of the thin rimmed sun gear, a significant stress was produced by a phenomenon other than the passing of a planet gear. The load variation among the planets was studied. Each planet produced its own distinctive load distribution on the ring and sun gears. The load variation was less for a three planet, nonsequential design as compared to that of a four planet, sequential design.

40|$|It is well {{accepted}} that the non-contact buckling response of long rectangular plates subjected to compressive or shearing loadings is {{solely dependent on}} material and section properties, as well as boundary conditions along the two <b>unloaded</b> <b>side</b> edges. In addition, the boundary conditions at the loaded ends do not influence the critical load. The above rule was also applied to the analysis and design of plates in unilateral contact with elastic or rigid mediums although without any reasonable verification. The results contained in this paper reveal that the boundary condition at the loaded edges (end conditions) significantly affects the contact buckling performance. To investigate the end condition effect, a transfer function method is employed herein to study the initial buckling behaviour of thin plates with different boundary conditions resting on tensionless elastic or rigid foundations. For very long plates with both ends clamped, the buckling mode {{can be considered as}} a series of periodically repeating buckling waves and an infinite plate model with only one buckle wave being effective to predict the buckling behaviour. However, for long plates with simply supported loaded ends, local effects dominate the buckling mode and the buckling loads can be reduced by up to 18 % compared to long plates with clamped loaded ends. Experimental tests and ABAQUS modelling also verify that the critical stresses for plates with simply supported loaded ends are lower than those for plates with clamped loaded ended plates...|$|R
40|$|Biological protein {{interactions}} networks such as {{signal transduction}} or gene transcription networks are often treated as modular, allowing motifs {{to be analyzed}} in isolation {{from the rest of}} the network. Modularity is also a key assumption in synthetic biology, where it is similarly expected that when network motifs are combined together, they do not lose their essential characteristics. However, the interactions that a network module has with downstream elements change the dynamical equations describing the upstream module and thus may change the dynamic and static properties of the upstream circuit even without explicit feedback. In this work we analyze the behavior of a ubiquitous motif in gene transcription and signal transduction circuits: the switch. We show that adding an additional downstream component to the simple genetic toggle switch changes its dynamical properties by changing the underlying potential energy landscape, and skewing it in favor of the <b>unloaded</b> <b>side,</b> and in some situations adding loads to the genetic switch can also abrogate bistable behavior. We find that an additional positive feedback motif found in naturally occurring toggle switches could tune the potential energy landscape in a desirable manner. We also analyze autocatalytic signal transduction switches and show that a ubiquitous positive feedback switch can lose its switch-like properties when connected to a downstream load. Our analysis underscores the necessity of incorporating the effects of downstream components when understanding the physics of biochemical network motifs, and raises the question as to how these effects are managed in real biologica...|$|R

In 1938, the 7th Air Division had five air transport groups with 250 Ju 52s. The Luftwaffe had 552 Ju 52s at the start of World War II. Even though it was built in great numbers, the Ju 52 was technically obsolete. Between 1939 and 1944, 2,804 Ju 52s were delivered to the Luftwaffe (1939: 145; 1940: 388; 1941: 502; 1942: 503; 1943: 887; and 1944: 379). The production of Ju 52s continued until approximately the summer of 1944; when the war came to an end, there were still 100 to 200 available.

40|$|This article {{explains}} {{the physics of}} weight transfer.

Likewise, accelerating shifts weight to the rear, inducing understeer, and cornering shifts weight to the opposite <b>side,</b> <b>unloading</b> the inside tires. But why does weight shift during these maneuvers? How can weight shift when everything is in the car bolted in and strapped down? Briefly, the reason is that inertia acts through the center of gravity (CG) of the car, which is above the ground, but adhesive forces act at ground level through the tire contact patches. The e#ects of weight transfer are proportional to the height of the CG o# the ground. A flatter car, one with a lower CG, handles better and quicker because weight transfer is not so drastic as it is in a high ca...|$|R
40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{characterize}} the biomechanics and neuromuscular control of the human trunk in response to asymmetric lateral loading. The pulling force and strength capacities as well as muscle activation patterns, trunk kinematics and postural balance in relation to lateral trunk flexion and loading were given special consideration. The experiments were carried out on 39 healthy volunteers. Asymmetric lateral loading was provided by an isokinetic dynamometer or by free weights, either attached to a handle and pulley system or held directly in one hand along the side. Lifting, lowering and eccentric and concentric muscle strength was studied as well as compensations to a sudden lateral translation of the support surface, simulating a slip. Measurements included movement recordings with goniometers, video or optoelectronic systems, balance evaluation via centre of pressure calculations from force plate recordings, abdominal pressure measured intra-gastrically with a pressure transducer, and muscle activities obtained via intra-muscular fine-wire techniques from both deep and superficial trunk muscles potentially contributing to the movements and stabilization of the lumbar spine. Lowering and eccentric muscle actions were always accompanied by higher maximal voluntary force and strength outputs than lifting and concentric muscle actions, irrespective of movement speed And position {{in the range of}} motion. Extrapolating the strength measurements and relating them to the balance requirements and differences in the utilization of frictional forces could explain differences in position for optimal force output observed between lowering and lifting. Most of the trunk muscles on the side opposite to the load, including the transversus abdominis, psoas, and quadratus lumborum, showed an increased activation with increased load and degree of lateral flexion to the loaded side. The simultaneous activation of muscles on the same side as the load was lower and decreased with load. This bilateral co-activation was greater for the ventral than for the dorsal muscles, particularly in the lowering situation. The range of motion of the spine in lateral flexion was largest in the upper lumbar and lower thoracic regions. The response to a sudden sideways translation of the support surface during asymmetric loading of the trunk with a hand-held load differed depending on the direction of the perturbation. When the translation occurred towards the <b>unloaded</b> <b>side</b> the postural correction was delayed and associated with multiple changes in direction of movement of the trunk and the centre of pressure. This reduced accuracy could be explained either by a conflict between motor commands for the ongoing voluntary task and the postural response or by a mechanical effect of the addition of the asymmetric load to the trunk. These studies have presented new knowledge about the movements and stabilization of the human trunk, and spine, under different asymmetric lateral loading conditions in healthy adult subjects. The results elucidate basic interactions between biomechanical parameters and motor control in the steering of the human trunk. In addition, the data obtained should contribute to forming a better basis for understanding the mechanisms underlying malfunction and pain in the region of the lumbar spine and thereby also to improving methods for diagnosing, curing and, ultimately, preventing these types of disorders...|$|R

Flumes are thought to encourage funnel flow throughout {{the height of the}} bin while reducing the dynamic loads and moments associated with plug flow and <b>side</b> <b>unloading.</b> Discharge outlets from the flume can be placed at any location along the vertical line of the flume. Tests were performed with soft red winter wheat in a smooth-walled, model grain bin 2. 44 m in diameter and 7. 44 m tall, constructed of galvanized steel. Tests were conducted both with and without the flume. During unloading, the wall flume created an Ã¢Â€ÂœartificialÃ¢Â€Â funnel flow regime within all parts of the bin which produced wall loads smaller than those measured during filling, other than at the onset of discharge in which a small load spike was observed. However, in unloading through the flume unbalanced wall loads were observed around the circumference of the bin, which produced overturning moments in the plug flow zone. Tests were conducted in which flow was transferred from the wall flume to the center discharge gate. This switch in the discharge position created wall loads significantly larger than those measured during filling at the flume location where the switch occurred. Operator caution should be used in performing these types of flow switches within bins when using wall flumes...|$|R
25|$|The most {{successful}} freight service was the uncrushed ballast service. Following withdrawal of War Department operations over their siding near Maddieson's Camp, the railway utilised the infrastructure to operate ballast trains. In 1937 a subsidiary ballast company was formed. Tipper wagons (skips) were loaded with shingle and transported along the branch line {{and then up}} the main line to Hythe, often lying over in the sidings at Dymchurch to prevent delay to passenger trains using the same tracks. At Hythe the wagons were originally pushed by the locomotive up a concrete ramp and the wagons tipped into a large concrete holding bin or directly into waiting lorries, a precarious practice which was later replaced by mechanical haulage up the ramp. After the war the Hythe workings were cut back and the wagons were <b>unloaded</b> in a <b>siding</b> (in what is now New Romney station car park), the remnant of which is now used for loading coal into loco tenders. This practice didn't last long and a purpose built siding and ramp was installed south of New Romney on the Dungeness line. The fence line can still be seen. In 1951, after 14 years, the subsidiary company switched to entirely road transport and the company closed the branch and the freight incline. At Hythe, the concrete pillars were still visible until the early 1980s when they were demolished to allow access to the car park extension along the former platform 4 and engine release siding.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{contributors}} to the aerodynamic drag of a heavy vehicle is tractor-trailer gap drag, which arises when the vehicle operates within a crosswind. Under this operating condition, freestream flow is entrained into the tractor-trailer gap, imparting a momentum exchange to the vehicle and subsequently increasing the aerodynamic drag. While a number of add-on devices, including side extenders, splitter plates, vortex stabilizers, and gap sealers, have been previously tested to alleviate this source of drag, side extenders remain the primary add-on device of choice for reducing tractor-trailer gap drag. However, side extenders are not without maintenance and operational issues. When a heavy vehicle pivots sharply {{with respect to the}} trailer, as can occur during loading or <b>unloading</b> operations, the <b>side</b> extenders can become crushed against the trailer. Consequently, fleet operators are forced to incur additional costs to cover the repair or replacement of the damaged side extenders. This issue can be overcome by either shortening the side extenders or by devising an alternative drag reduction concept that can perform just as effectively as side extenders. To explore such a concept, we investigate tractor base bleeding as a means of reducing gap drag. Wind tunnel measurements are made on a 1 : 20 scale heavy vehicle model at a vehicle width-based Reynolds number of 420, 000. The tractor bleeding flow, which is delivered through a porous material embedded within the tractor base, is introduced into the tractor-trailer gap at bleeding coefficients ranging from 0. 0 - 0. 018. To determine the performance of tractor base bleeding under more realistic operating conditions, computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed on a full-scale heavy vehicle within a crosswind for bleeding coefficients ranging from 0. 0 - 0. 13...|$|R
50|$|The same {{sequence}} in reverse order is effected for loading, {{with the side}} slots being replaced by the retaining pins on the wagon.In the <b>unloading</b> cycle, the <b>side</b> slots of the corner fitting are as an achievement of the VIT project also partly funded by the European Union.Operating under the catenary, though disconnected during the operation for safety reasons, Metrocargo eliminates the cost and time associated with shunting (coupling and decoupling wagons, transfer to marshalling yards by diesel locos, train breakdown and composition) {{that take place in}} traditional terminals, where trains need to be removed from the electrified line for unloading. Metrocargo was originally developed as a technical means necessary for creating a network for the intermodal transport of containers and swap bodies, distributed over a territory. In the process, it proved to be very fast (projections show a 40 wagon train can be unloaded and reloaded in less than one hour), which opened up new business possibilities, typically shuttling load units between ports and dry-ports. The construction technology being modular, equipment can be planned according to available space and number of containers to be handled, and increased as necessary. Today the system is fitted with a stand-alone active safety system detecting human presence in the work area, (which means that sound alarms {{do not have to be}} used). This system has been developed within the VIT project.Metrocargo is perfectly consistent with the goal of minimising environmental impact, because both atmospheric and acoustic pollution are almost totally eliminated by the electrically powered automation system. There are no local GHG emissions other than by trucks servicing the terminal, and noise level is very low.Electro-mechanical parts and plant automation software for load/unload were subjected to an exhaustive stress test under the control of an independent entity with specific knowledge of automated plants: Functionality and performance of all components were analysed and data collected and validated. The two main applications of Metrocargo are distributed intermodality and Port to dry-port shuttling.|$|R
40|$|Background Asymptomatic local bone {{resorption}} of the tibia {{under the}} baseplate can occasionally be observed after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Its occurrence {{is not well}} documented, and so far no explanation is available. We report the incidence of this finding in our practice, and investigate whether it {{can be attributed to}} specific mechanical factors. Methods The postoperative radiographs of 500 consecutive TKA patients were analyzed to determine the occurrence of local medial bone resorption under the baseplate. Based on these cases, a 3 D FE model was developed. Cemented and cementless technique, seven positions of the baseplate and eleven load sharing conditions were considered. The average VonMises stress was evaluated in the bone-baseplate interface, and the medial and lateral periprosthetic region. Results Sixteen cases with local bone resorption were identified. In each, bone loss became apparent at 3 months post-op and did not increase after one year. None of these cases were symptomatic and infection screening was negative for all. The FE analysis demonstrated an influence of baseplate positioning, and also of load sharing, on stresses. The average stress in the medial periprosthetic region showed a non linear decrease when the prosthetic baseplate was shifted laterally. Shifting the component medially increased the stress on the medial periprosthetic region, but did not significantly <b>unload</b> the lateral <b>side.</b> The presence of a cement layer decreases the stresses. Conclusion Local bone resorption of the proximal tibia can occur after TKA and might be attributed to a stress shielding effect. This FE study shows that the medial periprosthetic region of the tibia is more sensitive than the lateral region to mediolateral positioning of the baseplate. Medial cortical support of the tibial baseplate is important for normal stress transfer to the underlying bone. The absence of medial cortical support of the tibial baseplate may lead to local bone resorption at the proximal tibia, {{as a result of the}} stress shielding effect. The presence of a complete layer of cement can reduce stress shielding, though. Despite the fact that the local bone resorption is asymptomatic and non-progressive, surgeons should be aware of this phenomenon in their interpretation of follow-up radiographs. status: publishe...|$|R
