40|$|The {{observations}} {{that form the}} basis of this thesis were made mainly between 1969 and 1971, following a study of <b>urine</b> <b>acidifying</b> mechanisms in a group of patients, most of whom had renal stones. The patients generally had a substantial reduction in glomerular filtration rate, a <b>urine</b> <b>acidifying</b> defect, and a number had clinically apparent osteomalacia. However, the association of the osteomalacia with the chronic metabolic acidosis seemed at least as strong as with the degree of uraemia, raising again the old question of whether a causal connection existed between acidosis and renal bone disease. We know that most creatures exposed to direct sunlight have evolved a metabolism that far from accumulating Vitamin D, tends rather to inactivate and excrete it, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} toxic effects. Perhaps for similar reasons, the hydroxylating enzyme in the kidney seems to have a relatively limited capacity for increasing production of 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol. A greater capacity for 1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol production would require the existence of a stronger counter-regulatory mechanism than appears to be provided by calcitonin, for example. Thus if evolution has given any consideration to the patient with chronic renal failure, it is to ensure protection against toxic hypercalcaemia, and it is clear that the effects of 1 -hydroxylation failure of Vitamin D may appear in non-fatal uraemia. This does not mean that acidosis is irrelevant, however, because any adverse effect that it might have would be of critical importance in a situation where synthesis of the active metabolite of Vitamin D were already impaired. ...|$|R

50|$|Drugs are {{excreted}} {{from the}} kidney by glomerular filtration and by active tubular secretion {{following the same}} steps and mechanisms as the products of intermediate metabolism. Therefore, drugs that are filtered by the glomerulus are also subject {{to the process of}} passive tubular reabsorption. Glomerular filtration will only remove those drugs or metabolites that are not bound to proteins present in blood plasma (free fraction) and many other types of drugs (such as the organic acids) are actively secreted. In the proximal and distal convoluted tubules non-ionised acids and weak bases are reabsorbed both actively and passively. Weak acids are excreted when the tubular fluid becomes too alkaline and this reduces passive reabsorption. The opposite occurs with weak bases. Poisoning treatments use this effect to increase elimination, by alkalizing the urine causing forced diuresis which promotes excretion of a weak acid, rather than it getting reabsorbed. As the acid is ionised, it cannot pass through the plasma membrane back into the blood stream and instead gets excreted with the <b>urine.</b> <b>Acidifying</b> the <b>urine</b> has the same effect for weakly basic drugs.|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} Abstract: Over {{the past}} two decades, substantial reductions in the deposition of <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> (primarily sulphur) have occurred {{in most parts of}} Europe and, following recent agreements, this trend is likely to continue. The question arises as to how have sensitive ecosystems reacted, and will react in the future, to these reduced inputs of acidity? In this paper, the SMART dynamic acidification model predicts the possible recovery of 36 acid-sensitive Finnish headwater lakes, for which both catchment soil and water quality measurements were available. The model was calibrated to measurements by adjusting poorly known parameters; it was then used to simulate soil and water chemistry until 2030 under the ?current legislation scenario' resulting from implementing current European emission reduction agreements. Whereas most of the catchment soils show very little change in base saturation, the positive trends in lake ANC and the negative trends in lake sulphate concentrations, observed over the past decade, continue into the future, albeit at a slower pace. The model predicts that, during 2010 ? 30, all lakes will have reached a positive ANC, a pre-requisite for the recovery of fish populations.

The main conclusion of this first electoral environmental outlook is that when the proposed environmental measures are fully implemented and enforced, environmental pressures will be further reduced. However, the intended measures of GroenLinks and D 66 are insufficient to achieve the targets for all areas of environmental concern within the fixed time. However, the environmental policy proposals of GroenLinks have more impact than those mentioned in NEPP- 1 and NEPP- 2, both in 2000 and 2010.

The same vaginal environment playg a fundamental role to guarantee tho survival of resident microorganisms. Several factors, like changes of temperature and oxygenation, can interfere on vaginal ecosystem, but the residQnt vaginal microorganisms are the main factors to stabilize the vaginal ecosystem. The Doderlein's lactobacillus is the predominant vaginal microorganism. It is capable of fermenting the glycogen deriving from {{the decline of the}} eutrophic vaginal mmucosa, to lactic acid with release of hydrogen ions. The final result of that metabolism is an acid pH with values between 4 - 4. 5. Vaginal pH undergoes physiologically changes from birth to menopause, according to changes of ovarian steroids occurring during woman's life. Adequate levels of estrogens play a fundamental role in the trophism of vaginal mucosa. In fact, estrogens increase the cellular content of glycogen. Exogenous acbvities on vaginal pH can be exerted by several factors,such as sexual activily, oral contraceptives, systemic diseases, vaginal infections (candidosis, thrichomonias, vaginosis), systemic or local therapies. They incrcase vaginal pH by acting through different mechanisms. The increase of vaginal pH is detrimental for the survival of Doderlein's lactobacillus, but not for the pathogenetic microorganisms whose replication, on the contrary, is favored by the absence of countraction exerted by Doderlein's bacillus.

This study attempts to derive a consistent set of damage-based values based on estimation of willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid damages. Where possible we compile existing damage cost estimates from different sources. Currently, there are no generic damage costs available for eutrophication and acidification. We derive damage values for eutrophying and <b>acidifying</b> <b>substances</b> using WTP estimates from available valuation studies. For eutrophication, we derive benefit transfer functions for eutrophication that allows calculation of site-specific values. We compare the derived ecosystem damage values to existing estimates of the cost for reducing nitrogen and phosphorus emissions to water. The analysis indicates that many abatement measures for nitrogen have a positive net benefit while most measures to reduce phosphorus cost more than the benefit achieved when estimated on a general level and should, instead, be assessed on a case-specific level. Moreover, a comparison of the existing environmental taxes on nitrogen, nitrogen oxides and phosphorus in Sweden show that the current tax rates do not reflect the externalities from these pollutants. Subsequently, we construct a weighting set by combining the derived values with existing generic damage values for human toxicity, photochemical oxidants and global warming.

However, analysis of TUN losses is not readily available in many hospital laboratories. Because ammonia is the major fluctuating component of urinary nonurea nitrogen and equipment to measure urinary ammonia is available in most hospitals, this study was undertaken to determine whether urinary ammonia plus UUN provides a clinically useful approximation of TUN.

40|$|First-void urine {{samples were}} {{obtained}} from 24 elderly, asymptomatic men (median age 62. 9 years). The headspace above pH adjusted urine samples were extracted using a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane solid phase micro-extraction fibre and the volatile organic compounds analysed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. A total of 147 compounds were identified in the headspace of <b>urine.</b> The <b>acidified</b> samples recorded a total of 92 compounds, 27 of which were ubiquitous, basified samples 70 compounds, with 12 ubiquitous and unmodified pH samples 49, with 6 ubiquitous. Five compounds were ubiquitous irrespective of pH: acetone, methylene chloride, 4 -heptanone, 2 -pentanone and 2 -butanone. A comparative analysis of unfrozen and frozen–thawed urine (stored {{at room temperature for}} 0, 1 and 8 h) showed that samples retained the same number of compounds although variations in the peak areas for some compounds were observed...|$|R
