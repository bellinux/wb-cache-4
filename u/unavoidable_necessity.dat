Like Sir Gawain in [...] "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight", Norman Kent takes on threats made to his Lord, wholly and without reservation. Not only physical threats to life and limb, but also the sometimes <b>unavoidable</b> <b>necessity</b> to perform dishonorable acts which would have reflected badly on the reputation of King Arthur/Simon Templar are taken unflinchingly by Sir Gawain/Norman Kent.|$|E

50|$|A tampon tax {{refers to}} a {{condition}} in sales tax law under which tampons—and other feminine hygiene products used to absorb menstrual flow—are not tax exempt like some other medical necessities. Proponents argue that tampons, sanitary napkins, and comparable products form basic, <b>unavoidable</b> <b>necessities</b> for women and thus should be made tax exempt. The tax in Canada was removed in mid-2015 and women protested in the United Kingdom later that year. Other countries later followed suit.The BBC estimates that women—half of the global population—need to use tampons or other feminine hygiene products to absorb menstrual flow for about a week each month for about 30 years. While sales tax policy varies across jurisdictions, these products were typically taxed {{at the same rate as}} non-essential goods, such as in the United States, while other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland, reduced or eliminated their general consumption tax on sanitary products.

For it can never be inferred, from the lawfulness of resistance at a time when a total subversion of the government both in Church and State was intended, that a people may take up arms and call their sovereign to account at pleasure; and therefore, since the Revolution could be of no service in giving the least color for asserting any such wicked principle, the Doctor could never intend to put it into the mouths of those new preachers and new politicians for a defence,--unless it be his opinion that the resistance at the Revolution can bear any parallel with the execrable murder of the royal martyr, so justly detested by the whole nation." ...|$|E

Lady Osprey, in a costume of mauve and lace, sat on a chintz sofa and played an elaborately spread-out patience by the light of a tall shaded lamp; Beatrice, in a whiteness that showed her throat, smoked a cigarette in an armchair and read with a lamp at her elbow. The room was white-panelled and chintz-curtained. About those two bright centres of light were warm dark shadow, in which a circular mirror shone like a pool of brown water.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use and}} implications of using coercive measures within a high security hospital. High security hospitals are unique environments where challenges are often faced in balancing care with safety and security. The use of coercive measures, namely, restraint, seclusion, rapid tranquillisation and segregation, are considered <b>unavoidable</b> <b>necessities</b> in preventing and/or limiting harm. Yet coercive measures are deemed ethically, morally and professionally controversial. This study explores patient, staff and environmental factors that influence variations in attitudes and experiences towards the use of coercive measures using a sequential mixed methods design. Stage one {{examines the}} rates, frequencies and demographic characteristics of patients experiencing coercive measures.. Stage two uses standardised questionnaires to elicit and analyse staff and patient attitudes towards aggression (ATAS), containment measures (ACMQ) and hospital environment (EssenCES). Stage three uses a constructivist grounded theory approach to conducting semi-structured interviews with staff using institutional and emotional work theories. Findings revealed that younger, newly admitted females were those most likely to experience coercion. Aggression was viewed as being significantly more destructive on the pre-discharge ward, {{in comparison with the}} admission, ICU and treatment ward. Discrepancies were found between staff and patient perceptions of the least acceptable containment measures. Patients experienced the hospital environment as more supportive and cohesive than staff. Finally, findings from the staff interviews uncovered a complex interplay between personal and institutional expectations, values and actions. Further research is required into examining i) the attitudes and implications regarding the least restrictive methods, ii) the internal dynamics within high secure hospitals warrant and what it means for staff to be working in an environment where patients feel more supported by being contained than staff do when containing them, and iii) {{what can be done to}} relieve the tensions of healthcare professionals expected to care, coerce and contain...|$|R

40|$|This essay presupposes, due to <b>unavoidable</b> {{theoretical}} <b>necessities,</b> some {{definitions of}} a stipulative nature. These are fundamental, {{on the one}} hand, to identify the interdisciplinary framework {{in which we are}} working. On the other hand, they are essential in order to define the terms of a form of embedded analysis. By this we mean a contextual analysis from a hermeneutic viewpoint within the same framework of cognitive reference and scientific investigation. This context can only be the ‘Occident’, a term indicating a categorial, symbolical and historical constellation to be declined very much in the plural (the same also applying, clearly, to the ‘Orient’). Firstly, we shall establish, through the lens of some appropriate disciplines, a minimal clarification of the main concepts at issue – pragmatics, alterity, identity, asymmetry, cartography - and, by means of these, render the context more explicit (Chapter I). Then we shall move on to present the outline of a philosophical method, of a reflective-interpretative kind. With this there will be an attempt to put the five terms into practice. This is specifically with the aim of strictly defining the social and political challenges as regards a non-violent co-existence within the ‘European’ Occident (particularly in Chapters II and III) ...|$|R

I was {{getting used to the}} war before, but now I've got back to my {{original}} amazement at the whole business. I find myself wondering what we are really up to, why the war began, why we were caught into this amazing routine. It looks, it feels orderly, methodical, purposeful. Our officers give us orders and get their orders, and the men back there get their orders. Everybody is getting orders. Back, I suppose, to Lord Kitchener. It goes on for weeks with the effect of being quite sane and intended and the right thing, and then, then suddenly it comes whacking into one's head, 'But this--this is utterly mad!' This going to and fro and to and fro and to and fro; this monotony which breaks ever and again into violence--violence that never gets anywhere--is exactly the life that a lunatic leads. Melancholia and mania.... It's just a collective obsession--by war. The world is really quite mad. I happen to be having just one gleam of sanity, that won't last after I have finished this letter. I suppose when an individual man goes mad and gets out of the window because he imagines the door is magically impossible, and dances about in the street without his trousers jabbing at passers-by with a toasting-fork, he has just the same sombre sense of <b>unavoidable</b> <b>necessity</b> that we have, all of us, when we go off with our packs into the trenches....|$|E
60|$|The young lord, a most gallant youth, was for {{fighting}} {{to the last}} also; and my old pilot was of opinion {{that we were able}} to resist them all in the situation we were then in. Thus we spent the day in debates of what we should do; but towards evening we found that the number of our enemies still increased, and we did not know but by the morning they might still be a greater number: so I began to inquire of those people we had brought from Tobolski if there were no private ways by which we might avoid them in the night, and perhaps retreat to some town, or get help to guard us over the desert. The young lord's Siberian servant told us, if we designed to avoid them, and not fight, he would engage to carry us off in the night, to a way that went north, towards the river Petruz, by which he made no question but we might get away, and the Tartars never discover it; but, he said, his lord had told him he would not retreat, but would rather choose to fight. I told him he mistook his lord: for that he was too wise a man to love fighting for the sake of it; that I knew he was brave enough by what he had showed already; but that he knew better than to desire seventeen or eighteen men to fight five hundred, unless an <b>unavoidable</b> <b>necessity</b> forced them to it; and that if he thought it possible for us to escape in the night, we had nothing else to do but to attempt it.

6000|$|Now {{the same}} {{difficulty}} which affects {{the work of}} Bernard Shaw affects also any book about him. There is an <b>unavoidable</b> artistic <b>necessity</b> to put the preface before the play; that is, there is a necessity to say something of what Bernard Shaw's experience means before one even says what it was. We have to mention what he did when we have already explained why he did it. Viewed superficially, his life consists of fairly conventional incidents, and might easily fall under fairly conventional phrases. It might be the life of any Dublin clerk or Manchester Socialist or London author. If I touch on the man's life before his work, it will seem trivial; yet taken with his work it is most important. In short, one could scarcely know what Shaw's doings meant unless one knew {{what he meant by}} them. This difficulty in mere order and construction has puzzled me very much. I am going to overcome it, clumsily perhaps, but in the way which affects me as most sincere. Before I write even a slight suggestion of his relation to the stage, I am going to write of three soils or atmospheres out of which that relation grew. In other words, before I write of Shaw I will write of the three great influences upon Shaw. They were all three there before he was born, yet each one of them is himself and a very vivid portrait of him from one point of view. I have called these three traditions: [...] "The Irishman," [...] "The Puritan," [...] and [...] "The Progressive." [...] I do not see how this prefatory theorising is to be avoided; for if I simply said, for instance, that Bernard Shaw was an Irishman, the impression produced on the reader might be remote from my thought and, what is more important, from Shaw's. People might think, for instance, that I meant that he was [...] "irresponsible." [...] That would throw out the whole plan of these pages, for if {{there is one thing that}} Shaw is not, it is irresponsible. The responsibility in him rings like steel. Or, again, if I simply called him a Puritan, it might mean something about nude statues or [...] "prudes on the prowl." [...] Or if I called him a Progressive, it might be supposed to mean that he votes for Progressives at the County Council election, which I very much doubt. I have no other course but this: of briefly explaining such matters as Shaw himself might explain them. Some fastidious persons may object to my thus putting the moral in front of the fable. Some may imagine in their innocence that they already understand the word Puritan or the yet more mysterious word Irishman. The only person, indeed, of whose approval I feel fairly certain is Mr. Bernard Shaw himself, the man of many introductions.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the sun, disencumbered {{from his}} strange satellites, paced with its {{accustomed}} majesty towards its western home. When--we dared not trust our eyes late dazzled, {{but it seemed}} that--the sea rose to meet it--it mounted higher and higher, till the fiery globe was obscured, and the wall of water still ascended the horizon; it appeared as if suddenly the motion of earth was revealed to us--as if no longer we were ruled by ancient laws, but were turned adrift in an unknown region of space. Many cried aloud, that these were no meteors, but globes of burning matter, which had {{set fire to the}} earth, and caused the vast cauldron at our feet to bubble up with its measureless waves; the day of judgment was come they averred, and a few moments would transport us before the awful countenance of the omnipotent judge; while those less given to visionary terrors, declared that two conflicting gales had occasioned the last phaenomenon. In support of this opinion they pointed out the fact that the east wind died away, while the rushing of the coming west mingled its wild howl with the roar of the advancing waters. Would the cliff resist this new battery? Was not the giant wave far higher than the precipice? Would not our little island be deluged by its approach? The crowd of spectators fled. They were dispersed over the fields, stopping now and then, and looking back in terror. A sublime sense of awe calmed the swift pulsations of my heart--I awaited the approach of the destruction menaced, with that solemn resignation which an <b>unavoidable</b> <b>necessity</b> instils. The ocean every moment assumed a more terrific aspect, while the twilight was dimmed by the rack which the west wind spread over the sky. By slow degrees however, as the wave advanced, it took a more mild appearance; some under current of air, or obstruction in the bed of the waters, checked its progress, and it sank gradually; while the surface of the sea became uniformly higher as it dissolved into it. This change took from us the fear of an immediate catastrophe, although we were still anxious as to the final result. We continued during the whole night to watch the fury of the sea and the pace of the driving clouds, through whose openings the rare stars rushed impetuously; the thunder of conflicting elements deprived us of all power to sleep.|$|E
