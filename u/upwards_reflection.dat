We prove several {{reflection}} theorems on D-spaces, {{which are}} Hausdorff topological spaces X in which for every open neighbourhood assignment U {{there is a}} closed discrete subspace D such that {U(x) : x ∈ D} = X. The <b>upwards</b> <b>reflection</b> theorems are obtained {{in the presence of}} a forcing axiom, while most of the downwards reflection results use large cardinal assumptions. The combinatorial content of arguments showing that a given space is a D-space, can be formulated using the concept of discrete families. We note the connection between non-reflection arguments involving discrete families and the well known question of the existence of families allowing partial transversals without having a transversal themselves, and use it to give non-trivial instances of the incompactness phenomenon in the context of discretisations. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{documents}} a {{large number}} of large km-scale fluid escape pipes with complex seismic expression and a diatreme-like geometry from the mapping of a 3 D seismic survey, offshore Namibia. These pipes are crudely cylindrical, but occasionally have steep conical geometry either narrowing upwards or downwards. They are generally ovoid in planform and their ellipticity varies with pipe height. Vertical dimensions range from ca. 100 to > 1000 m and diameters range between 50 and 600 m. The lower part of the typical pipe is characterised by a sag-like or collapse type of structure, but this is only imaged well in the wider pipes. The upper part of the typical pipe is characterised by gently concave <b>upwards</b> <b>reflections,</b> with a negative relief of tens of metres. There is some evidence (pipe cross-section geometrical variations and amplitude anomalies) that these concave <b>upwards</b> <b>reflections</b> are vertically stacked palaeo-pockmarks. A conceptual model for pipe formation is proposed that involves hydraulic fracturing and localisation of focused vertical fluid escape with volume loss {{at the base of the}} pipe inducing collapse within the pipe. Continuing episodic fluid migration through the pipe produces further collapsing of the core of the pipe and pockmark structures at the top of the pipe. Longer term seepage through pipes is manifested in zones of amplification of reflections above the top of the pipe. © 2010 The Authors.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} {{to assess the impact of}} different placement methods, with different packing densities, on the stability of double layered Antifer-block armour layers. This was done by experimental research in the wave-flume of the Fluid mechanics laboratory of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences at Delft University of Technology. 17 experiments were performed with packing densities between 44. 8 and 61. 1 percent. For every experiment the under layer, toe and armour layer were rebuilt. The placed Antifer layer was tested with eight irregular wave series with increasing significant wave heights from 9 cm up to 20 cm. From these experiments followed that regular placement methods behave more stable than irregular placement methods with a similar packing density. Also the more irregular (less accurate) positioning of blocks within a regular placement method caused a decrease in stability. Higher packing densities for equal placement methods lead to higher stabilities and higher reflection coefficients. The resulting -values were between 4. 0 and 23. 7. If the reflection coefficients during the first wave series were high, this resulted in more overtopping during the latest wave series, which indicates that there is a positive correlation between the reflection and the overtopping. Overall it could be concluded that, when the under layer and the toe are smooth and the blocks can be placed accurately, the best performing placement methods are the closed pyramid placement method for packing densities around 45 % and 50 % and the double pyramid placement method for packing densities around 55 % and 60 %. The size of the openings to the under layer, of the double pyramid placement method, influenced the reflection coefficients. When the second layer was shifted half a nominal diameter <b>upwards</b> the <b>reflection</b> coefficients were minimal. It is recommended to investigate the possible negative influence of oblique incoming waves on the stability of the double pyramid placement method. The eventual choice of the placement method and packing density depends on the allowed reflection and/or overtopping and the construction costs. The construction costs can be divided into the production costs, the placement costs and the constant costs. For equal constant costs and equal or small differences in placement costs the placement with the higher packing density and accompanying stability value is cheaper for high design wave heights. When the placement costs decrease for both placements or only for the placement with the higher packing density, then the placement with the higher packing density becomes also cheaper for lower wave heights.
