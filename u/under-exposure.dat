40|$|Although solar {{ultraviolet}} (UV) yields favourable health effects, chronic (occupational) UV {{exposure is}} responsible of most epithelial skin cancers. The dose-response between sun exposure and skin cancer occurrence {{is not yet}} fully understood. Exposure data is limited because individual exposure assessment is tedious, costly and challenging (prone to epidemiological bias, limited to short-term exposure and specific exposure setting, and cannot account for the large intra-individual (anatomical) variations in UV doses received). A multidisciplinary team gathering competencies in meteorology, 3 D computing sciences, public health and exposure sciences, developed a numeric simulation tool (SimUVEx) to predict anatomical UV exposure. SimUVEx uses 3 D computer graphics techniques to compute UV doses based on postural information and ambient UV measurements. It allows assessment of specific exposure scenarios, taking into account body surface inclination, orientation to the sun, shading from other body parts, and radiation component (direct, diffuse, reflected). Selected applications of SimUVEx to estimate the contribution of occupational UV exposure to the burden of squamous cell carcinoma, to measure the contribution of diffuse UV radiation to exposure patterns of various body sites, {{and to develop a}} regression model for predicting UV exposure ratios without individual measurements by anatomical site are presented. So far, outputs from SimUVEx have enabled to (i) build exposure scenarii (using for instance population-based survey of frequent outdoor occupations), (ii) produce body site-specific reference doses for common outdoor occupational and leisure activities and (iii) identify high-risk situations with respect to over- and <b>under-exposures</b> to sunlight. SimUVEx has contributed to improve our understanding of exposure patterns and identify potential shortcomings in current sun protection recommendations. Current developments, perspectives and limitations of SimUVEx will be discussed...|$|R

5000|$|If the {{resulting}} shadows {{are unable to}} be processed to acceptable noise or tonal range, one has simply encountered a situation that cannot be taken with a single shot, and consideration could be given to HDR (High Dynamic Range) techniques requiring multiple exposures. If the latter is infeasible due to scene or camera motion, on may revert to the technique of exposing to the important highlights (abbr. ETTIH), which is in fact just a slight generalization of ETTR. With ETTR, exposure is maximized up to the constraint of preserving all highlights at the right edge of the histogram (a constraint implied by the hard saturation of the digital sensor). With ETTIH, exposure is maximized a bit further; the constraint is relaxed so that only the highlights deemed important are preserved before the right edge of the histogram, and the highlights deemed unimportant may fall into the saturation zone of the sensor. Typical examples of unimportant highlights include the sun, other very bright light-sources, and sharp-edged specular highlights like chrome car bumpers in the sun; however, one should avoid blowing areas with smooth luminosity gradients, for instance the sky around the sun, because these likely lead to visible sensor saturation artefacts (banding). Many cameras have over-exposure [...] "blinkies", showing the location of blown highlights which is not evident from the histogram. Some cameras also have <b>under-exposure</b> [...] "blinkies" [...] as an exposure aid.

Patients included in this study underwent TDM of linezolid trough concentration (Cmin) during treatment with conventional doses of 600 mg every 12 hr in the period between January 2007 and June 2016. The desired range of Cmin was set between 2 and 7 mg/L (<b>under-exposure,</b> Cmin 7 mg/L). Multivariate logistic regression analysis investigated variables potentially correlated with linezolid Cmin. One thousand forty-nine patients had 2484 linezolid Cmin assessed during treatment with conventional doses. Median (IQR) linezolid Cmin was 5. 08 mg/L (2. 78 - 8. 52 mg/L). Linezolid Cmin were within the desired range in 50. 8 % of cases (1262 / 2484).

Linezolid over-exposure was significantly associated with CrCLC-G estimates ≤ 40 mL/min (OR 1. 463; 95 % CI 1. 124 - 1. 904, P = 0. 005).

Moreover, our simple translation network can automatically hallucinate plausible HDR details {{in the presence of}} total occlusion, saturation and <b>under-exposure,</b> which are otherwise almost impossible to recover by conventional optimization approaches.

40|$|A common {{component}} in the mispricing of ETFs can arise from limits to arbitrage. I find strong evidence of commonality among of international country ETFs. Differences in systematic risk between an ETF and its underlying index can explain some of this effect. While non-synchronicity alone cannot explain it, it does amplify the effect. I then investigate whether this commonality can be a channel of contagion between ETFs. Consistent with this hypothesis I find that extreme shocks to financial markets are followed by large changes in the systematic risks of ETFs. Extreme shocks to U. S. market returns or volatility generally amplify the over- and <b>under-exposure</b> to subsequent U. S. and regional market movements that already exists in normal times.

30|$|However, as {{in other}} feature-based methods, the ZNCC shows {{meaningful}} differences only for well-contrasted and highly textured regions. Hence, feature-based methods often give incorrect results in low-contrast regions where the pixel values {{are about to be}} saturated due to over- or <b>under-exposure</b> and also in low-textured regions. For these regions, we exploit the IMF between the images, which was successfully used in [13, 14, 24, 25]. In this paper, the IMF is estimated from regions having high ZNCC only, because other regions are saturated or moving object regions that have low credibility in estimating the IMF. Then, the pixels lying outside the IMF tolerance are considered pixels on the faint moving objects. To determine the ghost map in this region, we also develop an optimization technique, which yields less noisy results than conventional IMF-based thresholding methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method constructs plausible ghost maps and hence yields pleasing HDR images without noticeable ghost artifacts.|$|E

This thesis describes a method to predict whether a given tonal rendition is acceptable for a photograph, which we use to characterize its range of acceptable adjustments. We gathered a dataset of image "acceptability" over brightness and contrast adjustments. We find that unacceptable renditions can be explained in terms of over-exposure, <b>under-exposure,</b> and low contrast. Based on this observation, we propose a machine-learning algorithm to assess whether an adjusted photograph looks acceptable.

40|$|In {{the field}} of still and moving {{pictures}} digital imaging {{one of the most}} important factors affecting the quality of the acquisi-tion is a correct exposure. This factor is especially important for video surveillance. It is particularly applicable in the case of CCTV cameras often operating in low-light conditions or blinded by an external light source. It is quite common that the lighting conditions are well below the adaptive capacity of a camera. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously monitor the level of exposure to determine image quality. It should be noted that the level of exposure is not expressed using quan-titative parameters of acquisition (being sometimes meaning-less from the perceived quality assessment point of view) but is measured directly on the image. The purpose of the pre-sented research was to develop a No Reference (NR) metric assessing video Quality of Experience (QoE) affected with the exposure distortion. It was presumed that both over- and <b>under-exposure</b> degrade QoE, so the research task was to de-rive a proper mapping function between QoE and exposure.

40|$|Single image dehazing {{has been}} a {{challenging}} problem due to its ill-posed nature. While most of the existing single image based dehazing algorithms address this issue by introducing certain assumptions and priors into the haze imaging model, the imaging process of imaging devices has been seldom taken into account, such as white balance and metering. In general, consumer photos are taken with AWB (Auto White Balance). Hence, color temperature in a foggy scenario may not be correctly detected, which results in color distortion; and the whole scene looks brighter, which leads to <b>under-exposure</b> during the imaging process. In this paper, we propose to handle these two issues by applying white balance correction and decomposing an image into two component images, reflex lightness image and ambience illumination image. We devise an improved dark channel prior based algorithm to dehaze the reflex lightness image and the exposure adjustment is estimated from the ambience illumination image. Finally, a high quality haze- free image is produced by refining {{the brightness of the}} preliminarily dehazed image with the estimated exposure adjustment.

I suggest that each article published in a top scientific journal can get tagged (online) with attempts to replicate. As such, a future reader of an article will also be able to see whether replications have been attempted and how these turned out. Editors and/or reviewers decide whether a replication is of sound quality. The authors of the main article have the option to review the replication and can provide a supplementary comment with each attempt that is added. After 5 or 10 years, and provided enough attempts to replicate, the authors of the main article get the opportunity to discuss/review their original study in light of the outcomes of the replications. This approach has two important strengths: 1) The approach would provide researchers with the opportunity to show that they deliver scientifically thorough work, but sometimes just fail to replicate the result that others have reported. This can be especially valuable for the career opportunities of promising young researchers; 2) perhaps even more important, the visibility of replications provides an important incentive for researchers to publish findings only if they are sure that their effects are reliable (and thereby reduce the influence of "experimenter degrees of freedom" or even outright fraud).

Malnourished children, the elderly, and pregnant or lactating females may be susceptible for Cu deficiency. Cu status and exposure in the population can currently not be easily measured, as neither plasma Cu nor plasma cuproenzymes reflect Cu status precisely. Some blood markers (such as ceruloplasmin) indicate severe Cu depletion, but do not inversely respond to Cu excess, and are not suitable to indicate marginal states. A biomarker of Cu is needed that is sensitive to small changes in Cu status, and that responds to Cu excess as well as deficiency. Such a marker will aid in monitoring Cu status in large populations, and will help to avoid chronic health effects (for example, liver damage in chronic toxicity, osteoporosis, loss of collagen stability, or increased susceptibility to infections in deficiency).

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effects of image acquisition control (IAC) of a digital X-ray system on the radiodensity quantification under different exposure time settings. Materials and Methods Three 1 -mm thick restorative material samples with various opacities were prepared. Samples were radiographed alongside an ASW using one of three digital radiographic modes (linear mapping (L), nonlinear mapping (N), and nonlinear mapping and automatic exposure control activated (E)) under 3 exposure time settings (underexposure, normal-exposure, and overexposure). The ASW eRD of restorative materials, attenuation coefficients and contrasts of ASW, and the correlation coefficient of linear relationship between logarithms of gray-scale value and thicknesses of ASW were compared under 9 conditions. Results The ASW eRD measurements of restorative materials by three digital radiographic modes were statistically different (p = 0. 049) but clinically similar. The relationship between logarithms of background corrected grey scale value and thickness of ASW was highly linear but attenuation coefficients and contrasts varied significantly among 3 radiographic modes. Varying exposure times did not affect ASW eRD significantly. Conclusions Even though different digital radiographic modes induced large variation on attenuation of coefficient and contrast of ASW, E mode improved diagnostic quality of the image significantly under the <b>under-exposure</b> condition by improving contrasts, while maintaining ASW eRDs of restorative materials similar.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm for compositing a {{high dynamic range}} (HDR) image from multi-exposure images, considering inconsistent pixels for the reduction of ghost artifacts. In HDR images, ghost artifacts may appear when there are moving objects while taking multiple images with different exposures. To prevent such artifacts, {{it is important to}} detect inconsistent pixels caused by moving objects in consecutive frames and then to assign zero weights to the corresponding pixels in the fusion process. This problem is formulated as a binary labeling problem based on a Markov random field (MRF) framework, the solution of which is a binary map for each exposure image, which identifies the pixels to be excluded in the fusion process. To obtain the ghost map, the distribution of zero-mean normalized cross-correlation (ZNCC) of an image with respect to the reference frame is modeled as a mixture of Gaussian functions, and the parameters of this function are used to design the energy function. However, this method does not well detect faint objects that are in low-contrast regions due to over- or <b>under-exposure,</b> because the ZNCC does not show much difference in such areas. Hence, we obtain an additional ghost map for the low-contrast regions, based on the intensity relationship between the frames. Specifically, the intensity mapping function (IMF) between the frames is estimated using pixels from high-contrast regions without inconsistent pixels, and pixels out of the tolerance range of the IMF are considered moving pixels in the low-contrast regions. As a result, inconsistent pixels in both the low- and high-contrast areas are well found, and thus, HDR images without noticeable ghosts can be obtained.|$|E

Combination regimens including AmBisome and miltefosine are safe and effective in India, {{but there are no}} published data from trials of combination therapies including these drugs from Africa. Methods: A phase II open-label, non-comparative randomized trial was conducted in Sudan and Kenya to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three treatment regimens: 10 mg/kg single dose AmBisome plus 10 days of SSG (20 mg/kg/day), 10 mg/kg single dose AmBisome plus 10 days of miltefosine (2. 5 mg/kg/day) and miltefosine alone (2. 5 mg/kg/day for 28 days). The primary endpoint was initial parasitological cure at Day 28, and secondary endpoints included definitive cure at Day 210, and pharmacokinetic (miltefosine) and pharmacodynamic assessments. Results: In sequential analyses with 49 – 51 patients per arm, initial cure was 85 % (95 % CI: 73 – 92) in all arms. At D 210, definitive cure was 87 % (95 % CI: 77 – 97) for AmBisome + SSG, 77 % (95 % CI 64 – 90) for AmBisome + miltefosine and 72 % (95 % CI 60 – 85) for miltefosine alone, with lower efficacy in younger patients, who weigh less.

Results Seafood (n= 13 (3. 8 %)) was significantly underrepresented as a main-meal product compared to poultry (103 (30. 2 %)), meat (121 (35. 5 %)) and vegetables (104 (30. 5 %)). Similarly, seafood-based main-meal recipes were significantly lower than vegetable recipes however were not significantly different to poultry and meat recipes. Cautionary claims in the cookbooks were significantly higher for seafood than other food types. Conclusions Parents who predominantly wean their infant using commercial products are may face challenges in sourcing a suitable range of products to enable the inclusion of seafood. Parents who predominantly home-cook have greater exposure to seafood in recipes however, this may be counteracted by the prominence of negative seafood messages, deterring them from including this healthful food into the diet of their infant.

40|$|SSG&PM over 17 days is {{recommended}} as {{first line treatment}} for visceral leishmaniasis in eastern Africa, but is painful and requires hospitalization. Combination regimens including AmBisome and miltefosine are safe and effective in India, {{but there are no}} published data from trials of combination therapies including these drugs from Africa. A phase II open-label, non-comparative randomized trial was conducted in Sudan and Kenya to evaluate the efficacy and safety of three treatment regimens: 10 mg/kg single dose AmBisome plus 10 days of SSG (20 mg/kg/day), 10 mg/kg single dose AmBisome plus 10 days of miltefosine (2. 5 mg/kg/day) and miltefosine alone (2. 5 mg/kg/day for 28 days). The primary endpoint was initial parasitological cure at Day 28, and secondary endpoints included definitive cure at Day 210, and pharmacokinetic (miltefosine) and pharmacodynamic assessments. In sequential analyses with 49 - 51 patients per arm, initial cure was 85 % (95 % CI: 73 - 92) in all arms. At D 210, definitive cure was 87 % (95 % CI: 77 - 97) for AmBisome + SSG, 77 % (95 % CI 64 - 90) for AmBisome + miltefosine and 72 % (95 % CI 60 - 85) for miltefosine alone, with lower efficacy in younger patients, who weigh less. Miltefosine pharmacokinetic data indicated <b>under-exposure</b> in children compared to adults. No major safety concerns were identified, but point estimates of definitive cure were less than 90 % for each regimen so none will be evaluated in Phase III trials in their current form. Allometric dosing of miltefosine in children needs to be evaluated. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01067443...|$|E
30|$|We have {{proposed}} an HDR image fusion algorithm with reduced ghost artifacts, by detecting inconsistent pixels in the high-contrast and low-contrast regions separately. To detect inconsistent pixels in high-contrast areas, a ZNCC measure is used {{based on the}} observation that the ZNCC histogram displays a unimodal distribution in static regions, whereas it has a multimodal shape in dynamic regions. A cost function based on the parameters of these probability distributions is designed, whose minimization yields the ghost map for the highly contrasted region. To detect the ghost map in the low-contrast region, the IMF is first estimated using pixels from the high-contrast regions having no moving objects. Next, a cost function that encodes the IMF compliance of the pixel pairs is designed, whose minimization gives the ghost map for the low-contrast areas. The overall ghost map {{is defined as the}} logical operation of these two maps, and the ghost pixels are excluded from the fusion process. Since the proposed algorithm can find faint moving objects in areas where the pixel values are about to be saturated due to over- and <b>under-exposure,</b> it provides satisfactory HDR outputs with no noticeable ghost artifacts. However, the proposed method has limitations in correcting moving foreground object when it is saturated in the reference frame (Figure  15), because they are simply excluded from the fusion process. In this case, we have to manually select a reference frame that has well-exposed foreground objects, which can degrade the fusion results due to the narrower well-exposed background region than in the reference. Otherwise, we need to correct the inconsistent pixels instead of simply excluding them, which is a very challenging problem, especially when the moving foreground object is not consistently detected in each frame due to saturation, noise, or non-rigid motion.|$|E
