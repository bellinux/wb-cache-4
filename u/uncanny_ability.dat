5|$|Because of {{the notorious}} laxity of the South Vietnamese {{military}} {{when it came}} to security precautions and the <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> of communist agents to uncover operational information, the planning phase lasted only a few weeks and was divided between the American and Vietnamese high commands. At the lower levels, it was limited to the intelligence and operational staffs of ARVN's I Corps, under Lieutenant General Hoàng Xuân Lãm, who was to command the operation, and the XXIV Corps, headed by General Sutherland. When Lãm was finally briefed by MACV and the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff in Saigon, his chief of operations was forbidden to attend the meeting, even though he had helped to write the very plan under discussion. At this meeting, Lãm's operational area was restricted to a corridor no wider than 15 miles on either side of Route 9 and a penetration no deeper than Tchepone.|$|E
5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E

5000|$|All other supernatural <b>abilities</b> are termed <b>Uncanny</b> <b>Abilities</b> and are {{presented}} in a modular fashion breaking down these abilities into statistics. These powers are based on skill type attribute dependent [...] "power checks". <b>Uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> are built from general categories determining their nature and filling in the varying statistics needed for gameplay. The experience system is point reliant but uses them in a [...] "cash-in" [...] system. That is allowing players to [...] "buy" [...] certain perks such as feats, combat and class levels which expends experience points.|$|R
50|$|Drawn by Solano Lopez, {{there was}} more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the {{departed}} Fantastic Four strip, in Stark's <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities.</b> The strip {{was one of the few}} to survive the merger of Smash into Valiant in 1971, and is still well remembered today.|$|R

25|$|His {{personal}} {{warmth and}} charm were {{combined with an}} <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to inspire confidence {{in a wide range}} of people. No other Irish leader of the time matched his remarkable ability to recruit people of every kind to the movement, win their trust and loyalty, pinpoint their capacities and unite them in coordinated action that was of maximum value to the cause.|$|E
50|$|Despite of his {{enhanced}} natural timing in twisting, Shirai is competent on all individual apparatuses but specialises {{on floor}} exercise and vault, {{which are the}} two particular apparatuses that would show off those <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> and excel even when performing gymnastics most difficult and complex twisting elements and combinations ever created in any direction he faces, taking off or landing: forwards, backwards or sideways.|$|R
50|$|Kalmish {{then went}} on to become the closest of all of Rabbi Elimelech’s students, as well as Rabbi Elimelech’s {{personal}} ‘shamash’ or assistant. Legend has it that as a mere teenager, Kalmish merited to have a vision of the Patriarch, Abraham, together with his Rebbe Elimelech, as well as a nocturnal vision of the Neshama of the holy Baal Shem Tov. Recognizing Kalmish’s extraordinary aptitude, <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> and extreme piety, Rebbe Elimelech sent Rabbi Kalmish to assume the mantle of Chassidic leadership of the great city of Krakow.|$|R
50|$|In the Soviet {{animated}} series Nu Pogodi, the wolf, commonly {{translated into}} English as Volk (Волк), {{is portrayed as}} a hooligan who eagerly turns to vandalism, abuses minors, breaks laws and is a heavy smoker. His adventures revolve around constant failures to capture a Hare. On the other hand, many of Wolf's attempts to catch Hare are often characterized by <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> on his part (including figure skating, ballet and waltzing) which demonstrate his more refined side. Wolf can also play the guitar very well and ride the powerful rocker motorbike, making his character more sophisticated than a normal hooligan.|$|R
25|$|In {{his first}} 120 days in office, Castelli passed {{two pieces of}} {{legislation}}, {{the first of which}} was signed into law by Governor David A. Paterson as Chapter 294 of the Laws of 2010. Castelli showed an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to pass his own prime-sponsored legislation despite {{being a member of the}} Assembly's minority, which has a reputation for legislative powerlessness amid the control of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the reasons}} Hiddink rated Song so highly was his <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to shut down {{opposing}} players - against the highly fancied Portugal, Song was deployed as a wingback and successfully marked a (although injured) Luís Figo {{out of the game}} during Korea's group match, greatly reducing the threat to Korea's defence. Ironically, Song started his professional career as a right winger and Luís Figo was his greatest idol.|$|E
25|$|He was {{a lateral}} thinker, a {{prolific}} reader, especially of military history, and a linguist who was proficient in several languages. A superb conversationalist {{known for his}} disarming charm and excellent social and people skills, he had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to establish rapport and win people over and achieve consensus. Sharaf could be obdurate, refusing {{to comply with the}} instructions of international border officials to postpone his travel till daylight and insisting on his right, as a diplomat, to free and unfettered movement across borders, only to be told of the impossibility of crossing the border at night due to dangers associated with the presence of active mine fields.|$|E
50|$|The even-numbered {{chapters}} tell Nakata's story. Due to his <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities,</b> he {{has found}} part-time work in his old age as a finder of lost cats (Murakami's earlier work The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle also involves searching for a lost cat). The case of one particular lost cat puts him on a path that ultimately takes him far away from his home, ending up {{on the road for}} the first time in his life. He befriends a truck driver named Hoshino, who takes him on as a passenger in his truck and soon becomes very attached to the old man.|$|R

50|$|Daryl {{is found}} by {{an elderly couple}} and taken to an orphanage. He does not {{remember}} who or what he is. Though a normal pre-adolescent boy in most aspects, Daryl begins to exhibit extraordinary talents after he goes to live with foster parents Joyce (Mary Beth Hurt) and Andy Richardson (Michael McKean), including <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> at baseball, interaction with an ATM, and in playing Pole Position, where he can play and react faster than humanly possible. He is also introduced to the neighbors of the Richardsons: Howie (Steve Ryan) and Elaine Fox (Colleen Camp) and their children Sherie (Amy Linker) and Turtle (Danny Corkill). As Daryl was raised in isolation, his social skills are quite limited. His friend Turtle, an unusually vulgar and obnoxious ten-year-old, helps him develop social skills.|$|R
25|$|When Johnson {{arrived in}} a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or {{in front of the}} local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical {{associates}} have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the day– and not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.|$|E
25|$|His uncle soon {{discovered}} that Hamilton had a remarkable ability to learn languages, and from a young age, had displayed an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to acquire them (although this is disputed by some historians, who claim he had only a very basic understanding of them). At {{the age of seven}} he had already made very considerable progress in Hebrew, and before he was thirteen he had acquired, under the care of his uncle (a linguist), almost as many languages as he had years of age. These included the classical and modern European languages, and Persian, Arabic, Hindustani, Sanskrit, and even Marathi and Malay. He retained much of his knowledge of languages {{to the end of his}} life, often reading Persian and Arabic in his spare time, although he had long since stopped studying languages, and used them just for relaxation.|$|E
500|$|According to Susan Zuccotti, Venturi [...] "had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to {{gain access}} where more {{official}} papal diplomats could not" [...] and thus was utilized {{for some of the}} most important papal priorities.

50|$|The other {{staple of}} the new Smash was {{adventure}} serials, and the most successful of these was The Incredible Adventures of Janus Stark, featuring an escapologist in Victorian London {{who appeared to be}} simply an unusual act on the music-hall stage, but who privately used his extraordinary abilities to battle against injustice. Stark had an unusually flexible bone structure, enabling him to get out of an astonishing variety of tight situations, thanks to training received in childhood from his mentor, Blind Largo. Drawn by Solano Lopez, there was more than a touch of Reed Richards, from the departed Fantastic Four strip, in Stark's <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities.</b> The strip {{was one of the few}} to survive the merger of Smash into Valiant in 1971, and is still well remembered today.|$|R

A changed Mr. Cruge brings Tiny over to the child who has been asking for a puppy as a Christmas present. Tiny says her goodbyes to the Buddies and Puppy Paws. After their last delivery, Santa Claus and Santa Paws arrive in Fernfield. Santa puts the Buddies (including Budderball) on top of the nice list, Puppy Paws becomes part of Santa's family, and the Buddies say farewell.|$|R
50|$|George Crompton {{was born}} at Holcombe, Tottington, Lancashire, England on March 23, 1829 to William Crompton and Sarah Low.

500|$|A {{reviewer}} from [...] {{called the}} poems in Diiie [...] "craftsmanlike and powerful though not great poetry", and recommended it for libraries with {{a collection of}} African-American literature. [...] Critic William Sylvester, who says that Angelou [...] "has an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to capture the sound of a voice on a page", places her poems, especially the ones in this volume, in the [...] "background of black rhythms". [...] Chad Walsh, reviewing Diiie in Book World, calls Angelou's poems [...] "a moving blend of lyricism and harsh social observation".|$|E
500|$|The Argos {{reached an}} all-time low in 1981 when they {{finished}} 2–14; this despite having such talented players as quarterback Condredge Holloway, running back Cedric Minter, and receiver Terry Greer. The team began the year 0–10 and {{there was talk of}} a [...] "perfect" [...] losing season. The team had been inept so long by this point (29 seasons without a Grey Cup win) that the notion of an [...] "Argo Bounce" [...] had become inverted; now [...] "it was the unluckiest bounce in the world, the one that usually arose from the Argos' <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to lose critical games in the dying minutes by committing an improbable blunder." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite Douglas' demure appearance—she {{stood at}} [...] and weighed , {{and was always}} immaculately dressed in pearls, a floppy straw hat and gloves—she had an <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to get her point across. She was known for {{speaking}} in perfect, precise paragraphs, and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades. Jeff Klinkenberg, {{a reporter for the}} St. Petersburg Times who interviewed and wrote several stories about Douglas, wrote of her, [...] "She had a tongue like a switchblade and the moral authority to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen." [...] Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions.|$|E
50|$|High {{school senior}} Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson) is {{introduced}} as a stereotypical, shallow cheerleader at Hemery High School in Los Angeles. She is a carefree popular girl whose main concerns are shopping and {{spending time with}} her rich, snooty friends and her boyfriend, Jeffrey. While at school one day, she is approached {{by a man who}} calls himself Merrick (Donald Sutherland). He informs her that she is The Slayer, or Chosen One, destined to kill vampires, and he is a Watcher whose duty it is to guide and train her. She initially rebukes his claims, but is convinced that he is right when he is able to describe a recurring dream of hers in detail. In addition, Buffy is exhibiting <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> not known to her, including heightened agility, senses, and endurance, yet she repeatedly tries Merrick's patience with her frivolous nature, indifference to slaying and sharp-tongued remarks.|$|R
50|$|Most pepla {{featured}} a superhumanly strong man as the protagonist, such as Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Ursus or Italy's own popular folk hero Maciste. These supermen often rescued captive princesses from tyrannical despots and fought mythological creatures. In the cases where a superhuman protagonist was not involved, {{the main character}} would still possess <b>uncanny</b> fighting <b>abilities</b> and a razor sharp wit.|$|R
2500|$|Benton Fraser is {{the archetypal}} Mountie: dogged, polite, and compulsively truthful. The series often {{featured}} his rigid moral code being {{tested by the}} cynical realities of Chicago life. Being overly polite, Fraser's best known short quotes were [...] "thank you kindly"; when {{he found himself in}} trouble, an understated [...] "oh dear"; and, when faced with contradictory circumstances from other characters, an all-knowing and eloquently stated [...] "understood". More unusual is his encyclopedic knowledge of trivia (attributed to his grandparents having been librarians) and a range of <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities.</b> These include his ability to sniff and lick refuse from the streets to gain clues about crimes, the way he can fall into a dumpster or other waste heap and emerge completely spotless and unwrinkled, and the way many women he encounters fall madly in love with him, including his boss Margaret (Meg) Thatcher and Ray's sister Francesca. The fact that he rarely pursues any of the offers the ladies extend to him is part of his charm.|$|R
500|$|In {{reference}} to the song [...] "Secrets of the Sun", Binkelman describes [...] "lush strings and gorgeous new age synths with the piano melody here brimming with a blend of the ethereal and the romantic {{with a dash of}} wistfulness besides". The synth sounds remind him a little of Ray Lynch. [...] Parsons details this as [...] "much calmer and more graceful with a piano melody and keyboard enhancements". [...] Debbage writes that [...] "the remainder of the album is filled with Joseph’s <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to compose elegant and emotive ballads. Back track to 'Secrets Of The Sun' that gently sways in the piano and string arrangements with similar results found on 'The Edge Of My Heart'.|$|E
500|$|Michael {{lives in}} two {{separate}} realities after a car accident. In one reality (where he wears a red wristband), his wife Hannah (Laura Allen) survives the accident; in the other reality (where he wears a green wristband), his son Rex (Dylan Minnette) survives. Michael does not know which reality is real and uses the wristbands to differentiate between the two. He sees two therapists: Dr. Jonathan Lee (BD Wong) in the [...] "red reality" [...] and Dr. Judith Evans (Cherry Jones) in the [...] "green reality". At work, Michael's erratic behavior triggers clashes with his team; {{they do not know}} about Michael's <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to solve crimes using details from both realities.|$|E
500|$|The X-Files {{centers on}} a pair of FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases usually, but not exclusively, linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Agent Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Agent Scully has been {{assigned}} by the FBI to debunk his work. However, the two have developed a close friendship. In [...] "Trevor", Agents Mulder and Scully search for an escaped convict in Mississippi who was suspected of killing his prison warden under mysterious circumstances. They then set out to find and apprehend him, but in doing so, Agents Mulder and Scully quickly discover that he has the <b>uncanny</b> <b>ability</b> to pass through solid, conductive materials.|$|E
50|$|The film {{features}} an ensemble cast, including Allen himself. The {{story is told}} in four separate vignettes: a clerk who wakes up to find himself a celebrity, an architect who takes a trip back to the street he lived on as a student, a young couple on their honeymoon, and an Italian funeral director whose <b>uncanny</b> singing <b>ability</b> enraptures his soon to be in-law, an American opera director.|$|R
40|$|Frederick Schlegel's, {{the leading}} thinker's of German Romanticism, {{interest}} in Poland, {{dates back to}} 1794, when he favourably estimated the „Kosciuszko“ Insurrection. In actuality, the interest in Polish affairs {{was the cause of}} his conversion into Catholicism in 1808. Jn Poles he saw a Catholic nation belonging to a Christian community. The opinion of history of the Polish nation included in „The Lectures about modem history“ (Vienna 1811), seems interesting. He considers Louis d'Anjou to be the greatest Polish King, whose biggest contributions to Polish history were his <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> as a lawgiver. This perspective probably results from his dealings with Hungary and its history, as well as sheer ignorance of Poland and Poles. His opinion of Polish language and literature as exemplified during his „Lectures on the History of Literature Past and Present“ (Vienna 1812) is similar to his previous opinion. This ignorance does not diminish his sympathy for Poland, as one can see by boiling through his private memoirs (the so-called Fragments) which were published posthumously...|$|R
5000|$|The {{television}} series Supergirl {{is set in}} a parallel universe to that of Arrow, The Flash, and Legends of Tomorrow, in which a variant of Earth where Supergirl resides is later coined as Earth-38 by Cisco Ramon. Humanity is aware of superpowered extraterrestrials such as Supergirl and her cousin Superman, but the existence of metahumans is not widely known on Earth-38 until the first season's episode [...] "Worlds Finest," [...] a crossover with The Flash. In this episode, the Silver Banshee and Livewire publicly battle Supergirl and the Flash, revealing the case of human-derived beings with <b>uncanny</b> <b>abilities</b> in the process. Silver Banshee's powers are mystical in origin and nature, while Livewire's are from an anomalous mutagenic accident. Since the inhabitants of Supergirl's Earth have no experience with metahuman threats, the Flash provides National City's authorities with the means to combat and contain them before returning to his world. Later, in season two's episode [...] "We Can Be Heroes", shows that a prison facility at National City is using the Flash's world's metahuman-power dampeners to restrain its superhuman prisoners. Human criminals begin experimenting on metahumans in hopes of acquiring powers for themselves, of which three metahumans were created with Livewire's powers.|$|R
