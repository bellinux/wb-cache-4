25|$|The largest {{manufacturing}} {{industry in the}} Mughal Empire was cotton textile manufacturing, which included the production of , calicos, and muslins, available <b>unbleached</b> and {{in a variety of}} colours. The cotton textile industry was responsible for {{a large part of the}} empire's international trade. India had a 25% share of the global textile trade in the early 18th century. Indian cotton textiles were the most important manufactured goods in world trade in the 18th century, consumed across the world from the Americas to Japan. The most important center of cotton production was the Bengal Subah province, particularly around its capital city of Dhaka.|$|E
500|$|The {{horsehair}} fabric called crinoline {{was first}} noted by 1829, {{when it was}} offered for lining and dress-making. That year, Rudolph Ackermann's Repository of Fashions described the new textile as a [...] "fine clear stuff, not unlike in appearance to leno, but of a very strong and durable description: it is made in different colours; grey, and the colour of <b>unbleached</b> cambric are most in favour." ...|$|E
500|$|Myers {{built his}} first balloon {{in the summer}} of [...] 1878 in Mohawk Valley. It was over [...] in {{diameter}} and could contain 10,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas. The balloon material with its valve weighed almost one hundred pounds. The envelope material was high quality cotton cloth that was <b>unbleached.</b> It was varnished with linseed oil gum thinned with turpentine. Myers invented machinery that applied the coats of varnish onto fabric of silk or cotton. There were several coats of varnish applied to make a balloon envelope impervious to hydrogen. The first of these patented machines, that took fourteen days to construct, was in operation for seven years. Myers made sixty hydrogen balloons in sixty days in 1891. He built a set of ten hydrogen gas balloons in five days in 1892.|$|E
2500|$|The murals {{ended up}} {{approximately}} 7.5 feet by 5.5 feet with dry color on <b>unbleached</b> canvas. [...] Also, because the murals {{were intended to}} last only {{for the duration of}} the fair, Walker painted them with tempera, a water-based and less durable medium, rather than his preferred medium of oils.|$|E
2500|$|Buffing wheels, {{also known}} as mops, are either made from cotton or wool cloth and come {{bleached}} or <b>unbleached.</b> Specific types include: [...] sisal, spiral sewn, loose cotton, canton flannel, domet flannel, denim, treated spiral sewn, cushion, treated vented, untreated vented, string buff, finger buff, sisal rope, mushroom, facer, tampered, scrubbing mushroom, hourglass buff, rag, [...] "B", climax, swansdown, airflow, coolair, and bullet.|$|E
2500|$|Hard Red Winter– Hard, brownish, mellow high-protein wheat {{used for}} bread, hard baked goods {{and as an}} adjunct in other flours to {{increase}} protein in pastry flour for pie crusts. Some brands of <b>unbleached</b> all-purpose flours are commonly made from hard red winter wheat alone. It is primarily traded on the Kansas City Board of Trade. One variety is known as [...] "turkey red wheat", and was brought to Kansas by Mennonite immigrants from Russia.|$|E
2500|$|Between 2002 and 2008, Bowdoin College {{decreased}} its CO2 {{emissions by}} 40%. [...] It achieved that reduction by switching from #6 to #2 oil in its heating plant, reducing the campus set heating point from 72 to 68 degrees, and by adhering {{to its own}} Green Design Standards in renovations. In addition, Bowdoin runs a single stream recycling program, and its dining services department has begun composting food waste and <b>unbleached</b> paper napkins. [...] Bowdoin received an overall grade of [...] "B-" [...] for its sustainability efforts on the College Sustainability Report Card 2009 published by the Sustainable Endowments Institute.|$|E
2500|$|Cloth diapers are {{reusable}} {{and can be}} {{made from}} natural fibers, man-made materials, or a combination of both. They are often made from industrial cotton which may be bleached white or left the fiber’s natural color. Other natural fiber cloth materials include wool, bamboo, and <b>unbleached</b> hemp. Man-made materials such as an internal absorbent layer of microfiber toweling or an external waterproof layer of polyurethane laminate (PUL) may be used. Polyester fleece and faux suedecloth are often used inside cloth diapers as a [...] "stay-dry" [...] wicking liner because of the non-absorbent properties of those synthetic fibers.|$|E
2500|$|Vanessa Nicholson (granddaughter of Vanessa Bell, one of {{the pivotal}} figures of the unconventional, but {{influential}} [...] "Bloomsbury Group" [...] {{in the first half}} of the 20th century) has described it as a [...] "curious slippery adjective". Although the original Bohemians were travellers or refugees from central Europe (the French bohémien translates as [...] "Gypsy or Roma people"), the term has, as Nicholson noted, [...] "attached itself to individuals as disparate as Shakespeare and Sherlock Holmes". The writer and historian A. N. Wilson remarked that, [...] "in his dress-sense as in much else", Winston Churchill was [...] "pre-First World War Bohemian", his <b>unbleached</b> linen suit causing surprise when he arrived in Canada in 1943.|$|E
2500|$|Picasso {{began the}} {{painting}} on 11 May 1937, {{working on a}} piece of <b>unbleached</b> muslin (349 cm x 776 cm). Since the work was so large, Picasso had to use a ladder and a long-handled brush to reach the furthest corners of the canvas. He spent over two months creating Guernica. He used only black and white paint to invoke the truth-telling authority of documentary photography. Yet his Cubist use of fragmented imagery makes his a poetic commentary, rather than strident propaganda. [...] "The protest is found in {{what has happened to the}} bodies, the hands, the soles of the feet, the horse's tongue, the mother's breasts, the eyes in the head—the imaginative equivalent of what happened to them in the flesh. We are made to feel their pain with our own eyes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The FT was {{launched}} as the London Financial Guide on 10 January 1888, renaming itself the Financial Times on 13 February the same year. Describing {{itself as the}} friend of [...] "The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator", it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the City of London, its only rival being the slightly older and more daring Financial News. On 2 January 1893 the FT began printing on light salmon pink paper to distinguish it from the similarly named Financial News: {{at the time it}} was also cheaper to print on <b>unbleached</b> paper (several other more general newspapers such as The Sporting Times had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Of course,' Amy ventures, looking {{perhaps a}} little <b>unbleached</b> even now, 'of course I had my diary, dear, and I do think that, even before Monday, there were things in it of a not wholly {{ordinary}} kind.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--I didn't know THAT was put in!" [...] said Sue quickly. [...] "I didn't mean it to be. Here is a {{different}} one." [...] She handed a new and absolutely plain garment, of coarse and <b>unbleached</b> calico.|$|E
60|$|Pen and ink {{had been}} {{expressly}} forbidden, the only {{book in the}} house was a thumbed and torn primer, but Dame Joan, after much grumbling at fine ladies' whims, vouchsafed to send up a distaff, some wool, a piece of <b>unbleached</b> linen, and a skein of white thread.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So about clothing. If I {{tried to}} do it, I think I could make the people here buy, {{certainly}} accept, and wear, clothing. With what result at present?

"Thank you, I 'll take an <b>unbleached</b> {{cotton shirt}} {{if you have}} such a thing, for {{it is likely to be}} needed before a cambric frock," [...] replied Polly, subsiding into her corner as quickly as possible, for at least six eye-glasses were up, and she did n't enjoy being stared at.|$|E
60|$|Away {{went the}} {{children}} full of anxiety to clothe their beggar; and so well did they plead his cause {{with the good}} neighbors, that Ben hardly knew himself when he emerged from the back bedroom half an hour later, clothed in Billy Barton's faded flannel suit, with an <b>unbleached</b> cotton shirt out of the Dorcas basket, {{and a pair of}} Milly Cutter's old shoes on his feet.|$|E
6000|$|Nevertheless, {{they decided}} to take the risk of these bicycles, and they decided their costumes should be brown {{stockings}} and sandals, and cheap <b>unbleached</b> sheets with a hole cut in the middle, and wigs and beards of tow.

[...] "The Desert Dervishes," [...] they would call themselves, and their chief songs would be those popular ditties, [...] "In my Trailer," [...] and [...] "What Price Hair-pins Now?" ...|$|E
60|$|Brother Pease ground {{away at his}} {{uncooked}} food, or browsed {{over the}} farm on sorrel, mint, green fruit, and new vegetables. Occasionally he took his walks abroad, airily attired in an <b>unbleached</b> cotton poncho, which was the nearest approach to the primeval costume {{he was allowed to}} indulge in. At midsummer he retired to the wilderness, to try his plan where the woodchucks were without prejudices and huckleberry-bushes were hospitably full. A sunstroke unfortunately spoilt his plan, and he returned to semi-civilization a sadder and wiser man.|$|E
60|$|Presently {{another man}} {{came up on}} to the walls, and {{approached}} the group there. He was, like the others, dressed in a small white turban, a short jacket made of <b>unbleached</b> hemp; underneath which was a loose tunic, bound at the waist with a sash, and coming down to the knees. He carried a spear and matchlock, and across his shoulder a small shield was slung. The others did not turn round and, when {{a few yards from}} them, he looked up at Harry; and the latter saw, to his delight, that he was Abdool.|$|E
6000|$|Hanrahan {{went to the}} man of {{the house}} and said, 'I got your message'; but when he had said that, he stopped, for an old mountainy man that had a shirt and {{trousers}} of <b>unbleached</b> flannel, and that was sitting by himself near the door, was looking at him, and moving an old pack of cards about in his hands and muttering. 'Don't mind him,' said {{the man of the}} house; 'he is only some stranger came in awhile ago, and we bade him welcome, it being Samhain night, but I think he is not in his right wits. Listen to him now and you will hear what he is saying.' ...|$|E
60|$|The event, however, {{was most}} joyful; {{and every day}} was giving her fresh reason for {{thinking}} so.--Harriet's parentage became known. She {{proved to be the}} daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy, <b>unbleached</b> by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.|$|E
60|$|It is not needful here {{to enter}} into full details, {{suffice it to say}} that among the things {{purchased}} by Harold, and packed up in portable form, were a number of bales of common <b>unbleached</b> cotton, which is esteemed above everything by the natives of Africa as an article of dress--if we may dignify by the name of dress the little piece, about the size of a moderate petticoat, which is the only clothing of some, or the small scrap round the loins which is the sole covering of other, natives of the interior! There were also several coils of thick brass wire, which is much esteemed by them for making bracelets and anklets; and a large quantity of beads of various colours, shapes, and sizes. Of beads, we are told, between five and six hundred tons are annually manufactured in Great Britain for export to Africa.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Codrington and Mr. Bice {{came back}} in the {{schooner}} early in October, and were landed at Mota, while the Bishop went for a cruise in the New Hebrides; but the lateness {{of the season and}} the state of the vessel made it a short one, and he soon came back with thirty- five boys. Meanwhile, a small harmonium, which was to be left with the Christian settlement, had caused such an excitement that Mr. Bice was nearly squeezed to death by the crowds that came to hear it. He played nearly all day to successive throngs of men, but when the women arrived, they made such a clatter that he was fain to close the instrument. <b>Unbleached</b> calico clothing had been made for such of the young ladies as were to be taken on board for Norfolk Island, cut out by the Bishop and made up by Robert, William, and Benjamin, his scholars; and Mr. Codrington says, 'It was an odd sight to see the Bishop on the beach with the group of girls round him, and a number of garments over his arm. As each bride was brought by her friends, she was clothed and added to the group.|$|E
6000|$|The trade {{carried on}} at Dobbo is very considerable. This {{year there were}} fifteen large praus from Macassar, and perhaps a hundred small boats from Ceram, Goram, and Ke. The Macassar cargoes are worth about £1,000. each, and the other boats take away perhaps about £3,000, worth, so that the whole exports may be {{estimated}} at £18,000. per annum. The largest and most bulky items are pearl-shell and tripang, or [...] "beche-de-mer," [...] with smaller quantities of tortoise-shell, edible birds' nests, pearls, ornamental woods, timber, and Birds of Paradise. These are purchased {{with a variety of}} goods. Of arrack, about equal in strength to ordinary West India rum, 3,000 boxes, each containing fifteen half-gallon bottles, are consumed annually. Native cloth from Celebes is much esteemed for its durability, and large quantities are sold, as well as white English calico and American <b>unbleached</b> cottons, common crockery, coarse cutlery, muskets, gunpowder, gongs, small brass cannon, and elephants' tusks. These three last articles constitute the wealth of the Aru people, with which they pay for their wives, or which they hoard up as [...] "real property." [...] Tobacco is in immense demand for chewing, and it must be very strong, or an Aru man will not look at it. Knowing how little these people generally work, the mass of produce obtained annually shows that the islands must be pretty thickly inhabited, especially along the coasts, as nine-tenths of the whole are marine productions.|$|E
60|$|I didn't {{at first}} see the {{connection}} between systematic social reorganisation and arbitrary novelties in dietary and costume, just as I didn't realise why the most comprehensive constructive projects should appear to be supported solely by odd and exceptional personalities. On one of these evenings a little group of rather jolly-looking pretty young people seated themselves for no particular reason in a large circle {{on the floor of}} my study, and engaged, so far as I could judge, in the game of Hunt the Meaning, the intellectual equivalent of Hunt the Slipper. It must have been that same evening I came upon an <b>unbleached</b> young gentleman before the oval mirror on the landing engaged in removing the remains of an anchovy sandwich from his protruded tongue--visible ends of cress having misled him into the belief that he was dealing with doctrinally permissible food. It was not unusual to be given hand-bills and printed matter by our guests, but there I had the advantage over Lewis, who was too tactful to refuse the stuff, too neatly dressed to pocket it, and had no writing-desk available upon which he could relieve himself in a manner flattering to the giver. So that his hands got fuller and fuller. A relentless, compact little woman in what Margaret declared to be an extremely expensive black dress has also printed herself on my memory; she had set her heart upon my contributing to a weekly periodical in the lentil interest with which she was associated, and I spent much time and care in evading her.|$|E
60|$|I do not, however, advise visiting {{it above}} {{any other place}} in Rome. What I always say is, take your chances with any or every time or place; you cannot fail of some {{impression}} which you will always like recurring to as characteristically delightful. For instance, I once walked home from the Piazza di Spagna with some carnival masks frolicking about me through the sun-shotten golden dust of the delicious evening air, and I had a pleasure from the experience which I shall never forget. It was as rich as that I got from the rosy twilight in which I wandered homeward another time from the Piazza di Venezia and found myself passing the Fountain of Trevi, and lingered long there and would not throw my penny into its waters because I knew I could not help coming back to Rome anyhow. Yet another time I was driving through a certain piazza where the peasants stand night long waiting to be hired by the proprietors who come to find them there, and suddenly the piety of the Middle Ages stood before me in {{the figure of the}} Brotherhood of the Misericordia, draped to the foot and hooded in their gray, <b>unbleached</b> linen. The brothers were ranged in a file at the doors of the church ready to visit the house of sickness or of mourning, barefooted, with their eyes showing spectrally through their masks and their hands coming soft and white out of their sleeves and betraying the lily class that neither toils nor spins and yet is bound, as in the past, to the poorest and humblest through the only Church that knows how to unite them in the offering and acceptance of reciprocal religious duties.|$|E
6000|$|The Fair {{is still}} going on, {{and one of its}} {{principal}} centres is before this church, in the Piazza of the Annunziata. Cloth is the chief commodity offered for sale, and none of the finest; coarse, <b>unbleached</b> linen and cotton prints for country-people's wear, together with yarn, stockings, and here and there an assortment of bright-colored ribbons. Playthings, of a very rude fashion, were also displayed; likewise books in Italian and French; {{and a great deal of}} iron-work. Both here and in Rome they have this odd custom of offering rusty iron implements for sale, spread out on the pavements. There was a good deal of tinware, too, glittering in the sunshine, especially around the pedestal of the bronze statue of Duke Ferdinand, who curbs his horse and looks down upon the bustling piazza in a very stately way. [...] . The people attending the fair had mostly a rustic appearance; sunburnt faces, thin frames; no beauty, no bloom, no joyousness of young or old; an anxious aspect, as if life were no easy or holiday matter with them; but I should take them to be of a kindly nature, and reasonably honest. Except the broad-brimmed Tuscan hats of the women, there was no peculiarity of costume. At a careless glance I could very well have mistaken most of the men for Yankees; as for the women, there is very little resemblance between them and ours,--the old being absolutely hideous, and the young ones very seldom pretty. It was a very dull crowd. They do not generate any warmth among themselves by contiguity; they have no pervading sentiment, such as is continually breaking out in rough merriment from an American crowd; they have nothing to do with one another; they are not a crowd, considered as one mass, but a collection of individuals. A despotic government has perhaps destroyed their principle of cohesion, and crumbled them to atoms. Italian crowds are noted for their civility; possibly they deserve credit for native courtesy and gentleness; possibly, on the other hand, the crowd has not spirit and self-consciousness enough to be rampant. I wonder whether they will ever hold another parliament in the Piazza of Santa Croce! ...|$|E
