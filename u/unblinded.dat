25|$|In cryptography, a blind {{signature}}, as {{invented by}} David Chaum in 1983, {{is a form}} of digital signature in which the content of a message is disguised before it is signed. The resulting blind signature can be publicly verified against the original, <b>unblinded</b> message {{in the manner of a}} regular digital signature. Blind signatures are typically employed in privacy-related protocols where the signer and message author are different parties. Examples include cryptographic election systems and digital cash schemes.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To develop trial {{protocols}} which {{promote the}} achievement of blind outcome assessment. (2) To report outcome assessor beliefs regarding group allocation at follow-up assessments. (3) To document and describe instances of <b>unblinding</b> occurring during the trial to assist and inform rehabilitation researchers and clinicians. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal observational study. SETTING: An NHS Hospital Trust specializing in orthopaedic surgery. SUBJECTS: One hundred and seven patients participating in a prospective pragmatic randomized controlled trial investigating physiotherapy rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty, plus three outcome assessors. INTERVENTIONS: A protocol was developed using available research and designed to minimize instances of <b>unblinding</b> during a physiotherapy rehabilitation trial. Administrative, office, patient and research staff procedures were included. MAIN MEASURES: Trial questionnaires measured blind outcome assessment responses at 3 and 12 months post surgery. The outcome assessor kept a field diary recording the events surrounding instances of <b>unblinding.</b> Data underwent descriptive and content analysis. RESULTS: Blind outcome assessment was believed successful for n[*]=[*] 74 (81. 32 %) assessments at 3 -month follow-up, and n[*]=[*] 83 (91. 21 %) at 12 months. Forty instances (n[*]=[*] 28 participants) of <b>unblinding</b> were described in the field diary. While {{the main cause of}} <b>unblinding</b> was participants telling the outcome assessor, in 12. 5 % of events the assessor drew the wrong conclusion regarding group allocation. Not all <b>unblinding</b> events were remembered at subsequent assessments, even in this relatively small trial. CONCLUSIONS: Blind outcome assessment was considered achievable in this trial. Specific trial protocols enabled blinding beliefs to be reported and instances of <b>unblinding</b> to be described...|$|R

For the 2 analogue-type goniometers users were asked to set the angle using the arms of the devices without looking at the reading, to then remove the device and record the result to reduce <b>unblinding</b> bias as much as possible. For the two digital devices, the result is not shown until the final button press and we therefore feel <b>unblinding</b> is not a significant factor. Users were not aware of their corresponding users’ measurements.|$|R

In a small controlled but <b>unblinded</b> study of 52 men, varicocele was significantly more common in equestrians than in non-equestrians. The {{difference between these two}} groups was small, however, compared to differences reported between extreme mountain bike riders and non-riders, and also between mountain bike riders and on-road bicycle riders. Horse-riding injuries to the scrotum (contusions) and testes (blunt trauma) were well known to surgeons in the 19th century and early 20th century. Injuries from collision with the pommel of a saddle are mentioned specifically.|$|E
25|$|A major {{criticism}} {{has been that}} clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., either the subjects or the therapists in psychotherapy studies are not blind {{to the type of}} treatment). They may be single-blinded, i.e. the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are <b>unblinded).</b> The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.|$|E
2500|$|RCTs without {{blinding}} {{are referred}} to as [...] "unblinded", [...] "open", or (if the intervention is a medication) [...] "open-label". In 2008 a study concluded that the results of <b>unblinded</b> RCTs tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the RCTs' outcomes were subjective as opposed to objective; for example, in an RCT of treatments for multiple sclerosis, <b>unblinded</b> neurologists (but not the blinded neurologists) felt that the treatments were beneficial. In pragmatic RCTs, although the participants and providers are often <b>unblinded,</b> it is [...] "still desirable and often possible to blind the assessor or obtain an objective source of data for evaluation of outcomes." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{fixed sample}} size designs, precise {{knowledge}} about {{the magnitude of the}} outcome variable's variance in the planning phase of a clinical trial is mandatory for an adequate sample size determination. Wittes and Brittain introduced the internal pilot study design that allows recalculation of the sample size during an ongoing trial using the estimated variance obtained from an interim analysis. However, this procedure requires the <b>unblinding</b> of the treatment code. Since <b>unblinding</b> of an ongoing trial should be avoided whenever possible, there should be some benefit of this design compared with blinded sample size recalculation procedures to justify the unveiling of the treatment code. In this paper, we compare several sample size recalculation procedures with and without <b>unblinding.</b> The simulation results indicate that the procedures behave similarly. In particular, breaking of the blind is not required for an efficient sample size adjustment. We also compare these pure sample size adaptation procedures with study designs which additionally allow for early stopping. Evaluation of the cumulative distribution function of the resulting sample sizes shows that the option for early stopping may lead to lower expectation but generally to a higher variability. The procedures are illustrated by an example of a trial in the treatment of depression...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{performance}} characteristics of CT virtual colonoscopy (VC) for detection of colorectal neoplasia {{have not been}} established in an average-risk screening population. We conducted a prospective multicenter VC screening trial using optical colonoscopy (OC) as the reference standard. METHODS: 1233 asymptomatic adults (mean age, 57. 8 years; 728 men, 505 women) underwent VC examination followed by same-day OC. 1201 patients were classified as average risk. Prospective VC interpretation immediately preceded OC, with segmental <b>unblinding</b> of VC results at OC. Radiologists relied primarily on the three-dimensional (3 D) endoluminal display for polyp detection. RESULTS: VC sensitivity by patient for adenomatous polyps was 93. 8 % (45 / 48), 93. 9 % (77 / 82), and 88. 7 % (149 / 168) for size thresholds of 10, 8, and 6 mm, respectively. At the same size thresholds, OC sensitivity by patient for adenomatous polyps (prior to <b>unblinding)</b> was 87. 5 %, 91. 5 %, and 92. 3 %, respectively. VC specificity by patient for adenomatous polyps was 96. 0 % (1138 / 1185), 92. 2 % (1061 / 1151), and 79. 6 % (848 / 1065), respectively, and for all polyps (regardless of histology) was 97. 4 % (1131 / 1161), 95. 0 % (1050 / 1105), and 84. 5 % (826 / 978), respectively. VC sensitivity by polyp for adenomas was 92. 2 % (47 / 51), 92. 6 % (88 / 95), and 85. 7 % (180 / 210) at 10, 8, and 6 mm thresholds, respectively.

40|$|The use of point-of-care {{ultrasonography}} (POC US) in paediatrics is increasing. This {{study investigated}} the diagnostic accuracy of POC US in children accessing the emergency department (ED) when performed by paediatricians under the remote guidance of radiologists (TELE POC). Children aged 0 to 18 years accessing the ED of a third level research hospital with eight possible clinical scenarios and without emergency/severity signs at the triage underwent three subsequent US tests: by a paediatrician guided remotely by a radiologist (TELE POC); by the same radiologist (<b>UNBLIND</b> RAD); by an independent blinded radiologist (BLIND RAD). Tele-radiology was implemented using low cost "commercial off-the-shelf" (COTS) equipment and open-source software. Data were prospectively collected on predefined templates. Fifty-two children were enrolled, {{for a total of}} 170 ultrasound findings. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of TELE POC were: 93. 8, 99. 7, 96. 8, 99. 4 when compared to <b>UNBLIND</b> RAD and 88. 2, 99. 7, 96. 8, 98. 7 when compared to BLIND RAD. The inter-observers agreement between the paediatricians and either the <b>unblind</b> or blind radiologist was excellent (k = 0. 93). The mean duration of TELE POC was 6. 3 minutes (95 % CI 4. 1 to 8. 5). Technical difficulties occurred in two (3. 8 %) cases. Quality of the transmission was rated as fair, good, very good and excellent in 7. 7 %, 15. 4 %, 42. 3 % and 34. 6 % of cases respectively, while in no case was it rated as poor. POC US performed by paediatricians in ED guided via tele-radiology by an expert radiologist (TELE POC) produced reliable and timely diagnoses. Findings of this study, especially for the rarer conditions under evaluation, need further confirmation. Future research should investigate the overall benefits and the cost savings of using tele-ultrasound to perform US "at children's bedsides", under remote guidance of expert radiologists...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{analysis}} on double charmonium {{production at the}} energy of the Υ(4 S), with the data is documented. The aim of this analysis is to understand the mechanism of production of double charmonium states fro annihilation, in particular after the discrepancies which at the beginning of these studies appeared. With successive studies, these discrepancies have been almost solved. This analysis was already performed by collaboration shuwei, and in this thesis we want to update that work, with a luminosity early four times higher (468 fb^ 1. In the mean time, also Belle collaboration published on this analysis bellecccc, obtaining results compatible with and finding out a new charmonium state, named X(3940).
