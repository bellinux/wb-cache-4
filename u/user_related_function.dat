40|$|This memo {{provides}} {{information for the}} Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. This paper presents a classification for e-mail routing issues. It clearly defines commonly used terminology such as static routing, store-and-forward routing, source routing and others. Real life examples show which routing options are used in existing projects. The goal is to define all terminology in one reference paper. This will also help relatively new mail system managers to understand the issues and make the right choices. The reader is expected to already have a solid understanding of general networking terminology. In this paper, the word Message Transfer Agent (MTA) is used to describe a routing entity, which can be an X. 400 MTA, a UNIX mailer, or any other piece of software performing mail routing functions. An MTA processes the so called envelope information of a message. The term User Agent (UA) is used to describe a piece of software performing <b>user</b> <b>related</b> mail <b>functions.</b> It processes {{the contents of a}} message’s envelope, i. e., the header fields and body parts...|$|R

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} thesis was to study user {{activities}} {{in a business}} system, MediusFlow. The overall objective was to identify <b>user</b> <b>related</b> problems and to analyse which of the usability data gathering methods {{to use in the}} future development process of the company Medius. The outcome of this study indicated that a cognitive <b>related</b> <b>user</b> problem was the most important problem to solve. A Star Life Cycle method was preferred. Two low-fidelity prototypes were developed to exemplify an alternative design solution to the identified cognitive user problem. Furthermore, the two best methods to use when gathering <b>user</b> <b>related</b> requirements were heuristic evaluation and expert review. In addition a company specific Style Guide was created with generic guidelines as a foundation for development of future applications within Medius...|$|R

40|$|Objective – This study {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of the <b>related</b> search <b>functions</b> in Web of Science and Scopus. Web of Science has one <b>related</b> search <b>function</b> (searching by references) whereas Scopus has three <b>related</b> search <b>functions</b> (searching by references, authors, or keywords). Methods – Thirty queries were searched in both Web of Science and Scopus. For each query, the most relevant document was retrieved and its first thirty related documents were assessed for relevancy to the original query. Results for both databases were compared using the median values of precision. For Scopus the three different methods of relevance were compared using median precision values. Results – The median precision value for the related documents retrieved from Web of Science was 0. 63, while the median for those retrieved from Scopus using the <b>related</b> by references <b>function</b> was 0. 62. A Wilcoxon test showed {{no significant difference in the}} two medians. In the comparison of the three <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> in Scopus, the median precision values were 0. 62, 0. 42, and 0. 43 for the <b>related</b> search <b>functions</b> by references, authors, and keywords respectively. A Friedman’s test showed that the median precision value for relatedness by references was significantly higher than the median vales for the other two <b>related</b> <b>functions.</b> In Scopus, {{the effectiveness of}} the <b>related</b> search <b>function</b> using all keywords was not as effective when compared to the effectiveness using select keywords. The median precision value with select keywords was 0. 17. Conclusions – The <b>related</b> search <b>functions</b> by references for both Web of Science and Scopus were moderately effective in retrieving additional relevant documents on a given topic, and there was no significant difference in their performance. When comparing the three methods available in Scopus, the <b>related</b> search <b>function</b> by references was found to be more effective than the system’s <b>related</b> <b>functions</b> by authors and keywords...|$|R
