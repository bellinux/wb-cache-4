5|$|Although {{five times}} more {{elements}} are metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the observable Universe, and one—oxygen—makes <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.|$|E
5|$|Pianist McCoy Tyner, {{who grew}} <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the Powell {{brothers}} in Philadelphia, {{was influenced by}} their relatively heavy keyboard touch and their liking of percussive piano sounds. Tyner also got some of his inspiration for chord voicings from hearing Richie's use of left-hand fourths. Tyner's voicings became the norm for young jazz pianists.|$|E

5|$|A red-painted {{house for}} the {{signalman}} was put <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the station. Tryvandsbanen also developed plans for building a station house with a waiting shed, but these never materialised. The name of the red-painted house was changed from Nordpolen ("The North Pole") to Norden ("The North") and it was modernised after {{the removal of the}} tracks. The station was included on the Nordmarka maps published in 1913 and 1938.|$|E
5|$|Howe and Queen Charlotte led {{the fleet}} by example, sailing {{directly}} at the French flagship Montagne. Passing between Montagne and the next in line Vengeur du Peuple, Queen Charlotte raked both and hauled <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Montagne {{to engage in a}} close-range artillery battle. As she did so, Queen Charlotte also became briefly entangled with Jacobin, and exchanged fire with her too, causing serious damage to both French ships.|$|E
5|$|Located atop a {{mountain}} in the Gongen Mountain Park, Seto Wind Hill Park {{is located in the}} center of the peninsula and is free and open to the public. From it you can see dozens of Ikata's 29.5-meter, 4.3-ton windmills, and get <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> 11 of them. An actual wing of one of the windmills is on display in the park so visitors can get a better idea of the actual size. Benches and observation decks dot the park and Haikus about the windmills, submitted for Ikata's Windmill Festival, are on display year-round.|$|E

6000|$|... "I see. Say, maybe you've got {{something}} {{you would like to}} sell me," [...] and the man, after speaking to some one in the shanty, stepped <b>up</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the turn-out.|$|R

5|$|Hadji Ali (c.1887–92– November5, 1937) was a {{vaudeville}} performance artist, {{thought to}} be of Egyptian descent, who was famous for acts of controlled regurgitation. His best-known feats included water spouting, smoke swallowing, and nut and handkerchief swallowing followed by disgorgement in an order chosen by the audience. Ali's most famous stunt, and the highlight of his act, was drinking copious amounts of water followed by kerosene, and then acting by turns as a human flamethrower and fire extinguisher as he expelled the two liquids onto a theatrical prop. While these stunts were performed, a panel of audience members was invited to watch the show <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> verify that no trickery was employed.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{had very}} {{little in the way of}} heavy weapons, as they had {{discarded}} most of their artillery and machine guns due to lack of ammunition. Despite the chronic ammunition shortage von Lettow-Vorbeck was able to move four machine guns <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the rifle pits, using them only at close range to ensure his ammunition would not be wasted. The inexperience of the Portuguese proved to be their downfall; despite their firing over 30,000 rounds, German casualties were extremely light, including only one casualty among their officers. Taking heavy casualties, having lost their commanding officer, and finding themselves hopelessly outnumbered, the Portuguese finally surrendered despite the fact that they had enough military supplies to continue the action.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E
40|$|In {{his latest}} book, Knowledge in a Social World, Alvin Goldman {{claims to have}} {{established}} that if a reasoner starts with accurate estimates of the reliability of new evidence and conditionalizes on this evidence, then this reasoner is objectively likely <b>to</b> end <b>up</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the truth. In this paper, I argue that Goldmanâ s result {{is not nearly as}} philosophically significant as he would have us believe. First, accurately estimating the reliability of evidenceâ in the sense that Goldman requiresâ is not quite as easy as it might sound. Second, being objectively likely <b>to</b> end <b>up</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the truthâ in the sense that Goldman establishesâ is not quite as valuable as it might sound...|$|R

5|$|Cotes' {{ship was}} fit only to sail with the wind, {{and the captain}} urged his men to make greater efforts to repair their ship before Uranie {{could come up with}} them again. So engrossed was the British crew with their repairs that it was not until 16:00 that it was {{realised}} that the French frigate was no longer holding station within sight, and had completely disappeared. This led some on the British ship to assume that Uranie had sunk, although in fact the ship had simply turned away {{in an effort to make}} it back to Rochefort to repair the damage suffered in the engagement. Also apparent were a number of sails in the distance. These rapidly approached and were revealed to be a frigate squadron flying the Union Flag. Cotes was unable to manoeuvre his ship or respond to the new arrivals, which were soon identified as French vessels wearing false flags. The leading frigate pulled <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> Thames and fired a broadside at the British frigate. Cotes immediately hailed the French, announcing that he was in no position to fight them due to the damage his ship had suffered and that he was striking his flag.|$|E

5000|$|Boule bretonne is {{very similar}} to bocce in that it {{involves}} one team tossing out a jack, known as the 'petit', and following it with tossing of boules, points being scored for having balls ending <b>up</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the jack. Games are played with varying teams of various sizes, from one to four players per team.|$|R

25|$|From 23 February the {{regiment}} formed part of 5th S/L Brigade, {{which had been}} formed to control most of the S/L units deployed to protect airfields, ports, and the BEF's forward gun areas.

60|$|While pausing he {{distinctly}} {{heard the}} tread {{of a horse}} upon the track behind him, {{and for a moment}} despaired of arriving in time: here, surely, was Reynard! Pulling <b>up</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the densest tree at hand he waited, and found he had retreated nothing too soon, for the second rider avoided the gravel also, and passed quite <b>close</b> <b>to</b> him.

50|$|Religious congregations {{established}} {{themselves at}} the highest point of the hill along with the large homes of the wealthy while middle class cottages and industry sprang <b>up</b> <b>closer</b> <b>to</b> the railway station.

50|$|The first proper {{throwing}} round {{is started}} by the player who has either of his/her balls the furthest away from the jack. Both balls are thrown, one at a time, towards the jack so {{that at least one}} of them ends <b>up</b> <b>closest</b> <b>to</b> the jack. If the player fails to do this on his/her turn, he/she drops out of the game.|$|R

The first immigrant ship, the Aurora, arrived on 22 January 1840, still celebrated every year on the Monday closest as Wellington's Anniversary Day. A settlement, Britannia, grew <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> the mouth of the Hutt River, and settlers set up the infant country's first newspaper and bank.|$|E

Around 1015 percent of motorcyclists in the US are women, while at major African American motorcycle rallies, such as Black Bike Week or the National Bikers Roundup, women make <b>up</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> half of participants.|$|E
