40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of parts with sculptured cavities from prismatic stock, rough machining usually constitutes most of the machining time owing to the {{significant difference between the}} stock and the part shape. When using 21 / 2 -D milling or a contour-map approach to do the rough machining, the appropriate selection of tool-path pattern for each <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> can significantly reduce rough machining time and hence increase productivity. In this paper, the commonly used toolpath patterns are summarised. A knowledge-based parametric approach for optimising the toolpath pattern of a given <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> is proposed. Then, a novel methodology is developed to calculate an arbitrary polygon area and locate the concave cavities in the polygon. Procedures for cutting-layer-shape analysis and the optimal comprehensive tool-path pattern generation are also built and proposed in this paper. These procedures can not only be applied to sculptured cavity parts with simple islands, but also to parts with arbitrarily-shaped islands. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the reasoning process. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|In the {{analytical}} model of cutting force, {{the thickness of}} shear zone {{is the key to}} study the deformation of cutting. For metal-cutting, the thickness of shear zone affects the shear strain rate γ̇ [20]. By the analysis of quick stop micrograph from cutting experiments in Ref. [20], the thickness is regarded as half of the <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. In the sand mould milling process, the <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> thickness is changed to a sinusoid (Sect.  2.4), and the <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> thickness varies from 0 to 1.4  mm per cutting tooth. According to the thickness of shear zone in the metal cutting, the average thickness of shear zone can be approximated by 0.4  mm, meaning the thickness of shear zone is just the thickness of 3 piled sand granules with the average mesh granularity of 100. For the granular system, Oda et al. [12] suggested that the shear zone width of the granular system without binding is about 7 ‒ 8 granules, which was also reported by Vardoulakis [21]. Moreover, Oda et al. [12] pointed out that the thickness reduces if there is the rotational resistance at contacts according to the comparison between the simulation and laboratory tests. To the sand mould, there are some binding bridges among the sands, so its shear zone thickness must be smaller than that of the granular system without binding. Considering both the aspects of shear zone thickness in metal cutting and the bound granular system, the assumption that the shear zone thickness of sand mould cutting is 3 D can be made, in which the thickness of wide zone is 2 D, that of narrow zone is D, as shown in Figure  2.|$|R

50|$|Adventitious {{roots and}} buds are very {{important}} when people propagate plants via <b>cuttings,</b> <b>layering,</b> tissue culture. Plant hormones, termed auxins, are often applied to stem, shoot or leaf cuttings to promote adventitious root formation, e.g. African violet and sedum leaves and shoots of poinsettia and coleus. Propagation via root cuttings requires adventitious bud formation, e.g. in horseradish and apple. In layering, adventitious roots are formed on aerial stems before the stem section is removed {{to make a new}} plant. Large houseplants are often propagated by air layering. Adventitious roots and buds must develop in tissue culture propagation of plants.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A physics-based {{material}} processing simulation is approached {{to reveal the}} distortion law of aerospace monolithic components due to milling. To improve the efficiency of numerical calculation, a simplified <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> model is presented. The cutting force and temperature model are established to gain cutting loads. The cutting loads are applied to the mesh model of the part. The milling process of spar is simulated. Key factors influencing distortion such as initial residual stress, cutting loads, cutting sequence and tool path are considered. The total distortions of the spar are estimated.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a spatial grinding dynamics mathematical model. This model includes a grinding wheel dynamics model, a work-piece dynamics model, and a numerical algorithm of geometric modeling as well. The geometric modeling algorithm {{is based on}} the Z-buffer method with author’s modifications. This algorithm allows us to simulate the formation of a new workpiece surface when removing material and as well as to determine the <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> thickness for each abrasive grain of the grinding wheel. The use of the surface cell bilinear approximation and the simultaneous use of multiple projection directions are the special features of the algorithm. These features improve modeling quality of machined surface. The grinding wheel model is represented as cutting micro-edges (grains) set. Abrasive grains are randomly distributed on the wheel outer surface. Grains size, shape, wheel structure and graininess are taken into account. To determine the uncut chip thickness, which is cut off by each grain of the grinding wheel is used the algorithm, which finds intersection point of uncut work-piece surface with radial ray passing through the grain cutting edge. Grinding forces for each grain are defined based on the <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> thickness value using the phenomenological models described in the literature. Using transformations described in the article, grinding forces determined for each grain are reduced to the total grinding force, which acts on the tool and machined work-piece in the appropriate coordinate systems. Work-piece dynamics is modeled {{with the help of the}} finite element method using quadratic tetrahedral elements. The described model of spatial grinding dynamics makes it possible to evaluate the level of vibration and grinding forces, as well as the shape errors and surface quality of machined work-piece...|$|R
30|$|The {{potential}} {{advantage of}} vegetative propagation is {{the production of}} true-to-type plants on a sustainable basis, which is clearly not feasible with seeds. However, plants raised through vegetative propagation maintain a definite vegetative time period before flowering, due to the physiological age of the mother plant. There is a danger that flowering, and death, could occur soon after propagation (Banik 1985). Therefore, before collecting the propagating material, plant age and relevant physiological details need to be ascertained for each species, noting {{that there may be}} environmental effects which can change this status. Relevant establishment records for the mother plants must be developed and maintained.

40|$|Solar {{cells of}} which the {{efficiency}} is not limited by the Shockley-Queisser limit {{can be obtained by}} integrating a luminescent spectral conversion layer into the cell structure. We have calculated the maximum efficiency of state-of-the-art c-Si, pc-Si, a-Si, CdTe, GaAs, CIS, CIGS, CGS, GaSb, and Ge solar cells with and without an integrated spectral shifting, quantum cutting, or quantum tripling layer using their measured internal quantum efficiency (IQE) curves. Our detailed balance limit calculations not only take into account light in-coupling efficiency of the direct AM 1. 5 spectral irradiance but also wavelength dependence of the refractive index and the IQEs of the cells and the angular dependent light in-coupling of the indirect spectral irradiance. An ideal quantum <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> enhances all cell efficiencies ranging from a modest 2. 9 % for c-Si to much larger values of 4. 0 %, 7. 7 %, and 11. 2 % for CIGS, Ge, and GaSb, respectively. A quantum tripling layer also enhances cell efficiencies, but to a lesser extent. These efficiency enhancements are largest for small band gap cells like GaSb (7. 5 %) and Ge (3. 8 %). Combining a quantum tripling and a quantum <b>cutting</b> <b>layer</b> would enhance efficiency of these cells by a factor of two. Efficiency enhancement by a simple spectral shifting layer is limited to less than 1 % in case the IQE is high for blue and UV lights. However, for CdTe and GaSb solar cells, efficiency enhancements are as high as 4. 6 % and 3. 5 %, respectively.

Vegetation propagates through clump division, by rhizome, stem and branch <b>cutting,</b> <b>layering,</b> and marcotting. The easiest and most practised cultivation method is culm or branch cutting. In the Philippines, the best results were obtained from one-node cuttings from the lower parts of six-month-old culms. When a stem dies, the clump usually survives. A clump can grow out of stem used for poles, fences, props, stakes, or posts. Its rhizomes extend up to 80 cm before turning upward to create open, fast-spreading clumps. The easy propagation of B. vulgaris explains its seemingly wild occurrence.|$|R
