5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> some sort of third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E
25|$|It is not <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to {{the sphere}} of the {{separate}} daemonical powers of nature that the opposition {{between good and evil}} begins, and the daemonical power is appeased by means of a stubbornness which it finds there congenial to it; the good daemonical power makes happy those in whom it takes up its abode, the bad ruins them; for eudaimonia is the indwelling of a good daemon, the opposite the indwelling of a bad one.|$|E
500|$|Other {{artists have}} become {{agitated}} {{due to the}} Orb sampling their work, though Paterson jokingly suggests that [...] "hey don't know the half of it." [...] Paterson says that he finds a [...] "beauty" [...] and a [...] "cleverness" [...] with slipping unlicensed samples into compositions without anyone recognizing it. Even though fans often try to guess the origins {{of many of the}} samples, Paterson states that they are rarely correct and that they would [...] "die" [...] if they discovered, for example, where the drums on [...] "Little Fluffy Clouds" [...] originated from. He has said that record labels have cautioned him, [...] "Don't tell anyone where you got your samples <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> them cleared!".|$|E

500|$|Early in {{the writing}} process, Donegan created guitar riffs. The rest of the band then listened to the riffs, and wrote {{the rest of the}} music, with the riffs being the base. As Donegan commented, [...] "The writing process is... pretty much the same since the beginning... of this band. It's always been riffs; {{something}} musically that I'll come up with [...]" [...] Wengren commented, [...] "We're always tossing around riffs and beats, but it isn't really <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> home and we are able to clear our minds, decompress for a little bit, and then hit it, especially Danny and I, and just start throwing the riffs and the beats out, that the music starts to finally come to life." [...] Bassist John Moyer left the studio during the recording process, due to his wife being pregnant. Donegan and Wengren sent him demos through e-mail, and he continued to write bass lines for the songs from his home studio. Regarding electronics on the album, Donegan said, [...] "When the basic guitar, bass, [...] drums were being laid down, at first I didn't really see a whole lot of room for some of the electronics, but as the songs were starting to develop, I was just in that frame of mind to try and toy around with some of the electronics." ...|$|E
2500|$|For boat families, {{there was}} very little medical care. One father stated, [...] "We never need a doctor. We just stay sick <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> well." [...] It was {{practically}} impossible to get a doctor in the mountains at {{the upper end of the}} canal or on the long levels.|$|E
2500|$|Chaput echoed {{this thought}} in an interview, {{saying that the}} phrase “intrinsically disordered” turns people off and [...] "probably isn’t useful anymore." [...] While making clear that any new {{language}} adopted should make clear the Church's teaching, he said that this particular phrase should be put [...] "on the shelf for a while, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> over the negativity related to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancy {{that this}} ridge dies out somewhere to the left. We'll follow {{the crest of}} it <b>until</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> around the end," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sure! That's what we'll go after," [...] {{declared}} the detective. [...] "Even if we locate our man, we won't arrest him <b>until</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> {{him with the}} goods." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now we {{will lie}} here in ambush <b>until</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> news, for it doth behoove {{us to be}} cunning and wary if we would bring our friend Will Stutely off from the Sheriff's clutches." ...|$|R
2500|$|To {{actually}} {{solve this}} problem, we work backwards. For simplicity, {{the current level}} of capital is denoted as [...] [...] is already known, so using the Bellman equation once we can calculate , and so on <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> to , which is the value of the initial decision problem for the whole lifetime.

2500|$|Though NMPs may {{in effect}} be {{insignificant}} {{as a check}} on the executive, they can present alternative viewpoints which the Government may consider and even choose to respond to, particularly where they concern socially significant issues. As NMP Paulin Tay Straughan has said: [...] "The day when we move into a two-party system where opposing voices are more visible, we will not need NMPs or NCMPs anymore. But <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> there, the NMPs have a role to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Addressing the couple's {{possibility}} of marriage, children, and divorce, Hansis pondered [...] "why can't people on soaps just date?" [...] He said [...] "maybe five {{years down the}} line {{they should have a}} kid, but not now" [...] and that [...] "ollege has a whole slew of potential soap-worthy storylines. I think a lot of cool stories could come out of that". Silbermann voiced not knowing what the writers may have planned for the couple, but that [...] "the audience can assume it won't be smooth sailing". Hansis clarified: [...] "We have no idea what's happening <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> the scripts, which happens about a week in advance. We can talk to the producers if we want. I have done that once or twice, but they keep the writers and actors pretty separate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we {{will leave}} him to you, Doctor; {{there are a lot}} of these fellows in the water, and I suppose they must be brought on board <b>until</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> a boat to take them ashore." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Let's {{take a look}} at that press, my dears," [...] said Mr. Merrick. [...] "I'm {{something}} of a mechanic myself, or was in my young days, and I may be able to work this thing <b>until</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> a new pressman." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rumors of a David Lee Roth reunion re-emerged and on January 3, 2006, Roth {{explained}} {{during an}} interview that he had spoken to Alex Van Halen the previous week and a reunion was [...] "inevitable." [...] However, he also said that Eddie Van Halen was [...] "off in his own little world" [...] recently. When asked if any problems occurred with Sammy Hagar during the 2004 tour Eddie Van Halen answered, [...] "Sammy is Sammy, {{and for the most part}} that's just fine." [...] Roth persisted with suggestions of a reunion, saying, [...] "People want the reunion," [...] and [...] "No one will pay respect to what any of us do [...] <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> the reunion out of the way." [...] In May 2006, he told Billboard.com, [...] "There's contact between the two camps." ...|$|E
2500|$|Author Robert Lacey {{quotes a}} fatwa by bin Baz urging caution towards {{claims that the}} Americans had landed on the moon. [...] "We must make careful checks {{whenever}} the kuffar [...] or faseqoon [...] tell us something: we cannot believe or disbelieve them <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>get</b> sufficient proof on which the Muslims can depend." [...] Lacey states that [...] "after extensive research" [...] of bin Baz's fatawa, he (Lacey) had only {{been able to find}} this one fatwa on the subject, and no statement in it that the earth was flat. Lacey does however say that according to his source, Bin Baz gave an interview after publishing the article [...] "in which he mused on how we operate day to day on the basis that the ground beneath us is flat ... and it led him to the belief that he was not afraid to voice and for which he became notorious." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Bradley, who {{was still}} {{watching}} him, here rose potentially. [...] "You ought to take more care of yourself," [...] she said.

6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what we might do!" [...] cried Roger. [...] "Supposing four of us fellows jump into the four-oared boat and row up to the Appleby camp? I am sure they have plenty of provisions, and they'll lend us some <b>until</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> in a new lot from Carpen Falls.

6000|$|... "We have caulked all hatches and {{gratings}} forward, {{and stopped}} the ventilators," [...] he said. [...] "I reckon the water will leave the deck {{long enough for the}} pump to give her fore-end some buoyancy. If she rises with the flood tide, well heave the cables aft, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> can <b>get</b> a hold that will lift her bow from the ground. Then you can pump out the fore hold and we'll make a fresh start aft. We'll soon know if Cartwright's notion is correct." ...|$|R

60|$|Where he {{was obliged}} to order a private conveyance, there was no {{objection}} to Alicia and Mrs. Baggs following it. Where we got into a coach, there was no harm in their hiring two inside places. I gave my watch, rings, and last guinea to Alicia, enjoining her, on no account, to let her box of jewels see the light <b>until</b> <b>we</b> could <b>get</b> proper advice on the best means of turning them to account. She listened to these and other directions with a calmness that astonished me.|$|R

If we were late paying bills <b>we</b> would <b>get</b> threatening phone calls.
