25|$|Air drying is {{the drying}} of timber by exposing {{it to the}} air. The {{technique}} of air drying consists mainly of making a stack of sawn timber (with the layers of boards separated by stickers) on raised foundations, in a clean, cool, dry and shady place. Rate of drying largely depends on climatic conditions, and on the air movement (exposure to the wind). For successful air drying, a continuous and <b>uniform</b> <b>flow</b> of air throughout the pile of the timber needs to be arranged (Desch and Dinwoodie, 1996).|$|E

In this way, butane leaks can easily be identified. While hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans are toxic, they are present in levels so low that suffocation and fire hazard by the butane becomes a concern far before toxicity. Most commercially available butane also contains {{a certain amount of}} contaminant oil which can be removed through filtration but which will otherwise leave a deposit at the point of ignition and may eventually block the <b>uniform</b> <b>flow</b> of gas. Contaminants are not used in fragrance extraction and butane gasses can cause gas explosions in poorly ventilated areas if leaks go unnoticed and are ignited by spark or flame.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Discrete Particle Method (DPM) is used {{to model}} {{granular}} flows down an inclined chute with varying basal roughness, thickness and inclination. We observe three major regimes: arresting <b>flows,</b> steady <b>uniform</b> <b>flows</b> and ac-celerating flows. For flows over a smooth base, other (quasi-steady) regimes are observed: for small inclinations the flow can be highly energetic and strongly layered in depth; where-as, for large inclinations it can be non-uniform and oscillat-ing. For steady <b>uniform</b> <b>flows,</b> depth profiles of density, ve-locity and stress are obtained using an improved coarse-graining method, which provides accurate statistics even {{at the base of}} the flow. A shallow-layer model for granular flows is completed with macro-scale closure relations ob-tained from micro-scale DPM simulations of steady flows. We obtain functional relations for effective basal friction, shape factor, mean density, and the normal stress anisotropy as functions of layer thickness, flow velocity and basal rough-ness...|$|R
