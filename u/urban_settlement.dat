5|$|The first {{documented}} <b>urban</b> <b>settlement</b> at Ashdod {{dates to}} the Canaanite culture of the 17th century BCE, making the city {{one of the oldest}} in the world. Ashdod is mentioned 13 times in the Bible. During its pre-1956 history the city was settled by Philistines, Israelites, Greek colonists coming in the wake of Alexander's conquests, Romans and Byzantines, Arabs, Crusaders, and Ottoman Turks.|$|E
5|$|The A3, or the Enugu-Port Harcourt highway, {{was opened}} in the 1970s and links the two cities {{together}} by passing through Aba, a major <b>urban</b> <b>settlement.</b> The A3 goes further on past Enugu's north to link {{to the city of}} Jos via Makurdi. Two more highways, the A232 from Benin City, Asaba and Onitsha to Enugu's east and the A343 from Abakaliki to Enugu's west, makes Enugu the site of a major junction.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>urban</b> <b>settlement</b> {{in the area}} of modern-day Dhaka dates to the first millennium. The region was part of the ancient {{district}} of Bikrampur, which was ruled by the Sena dynasty. Under Islamic rule, it became part of the historic district of Sonargaon, the regional administrative hub of the Delhi and the Bengal Sultanates. The Grand Trunk Road passed through the region, connecting it with North India, Central Asia and the southeastern port city of Chittagong.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Hashemite emir {{and later}} king, Abdullah I, {{designated}} Amman instead of al-Salt {{to be the}} capital of the newly created state, the Emirate of Transjordan, which became the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in 1950. Its function as {{the capital of the}} country attracted immigrants from different Levantine areas, particularly from al-Salt, a nearby city that had been the largest <b>urban</b> <b>settlement</b> east of the Jordan River at the time. The early settlers who came from Palestine were overwhelmingly from Nablus, from which many of al-Salt's inhabitants had originated. They were joined by other immigrants from Damascus. Amman later attracted people from {{the southern part of the}} country, particularly Al Karak and Madaba. The city's population was around 10,000 in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Empire conquered Dacia in AD 101 and 106, {{during the}} rule of Trajan, and the Roman {{settlement}} Napoca, established thereafter, is first recorded on a milestone discovered in 1758 {{in the vicinity of}} the city. Trajan's successor Hadrian granted Napoca the status of municipium as municipium Aelium Hadrianum Napocenses. Later, in the 2nd century AD, the city gained the status of a colonia as Colonia Aurelia Napoca. Napoca became a provincial capital of Dacia Porolissensis and thus the seat of a procurator. The colonia was evacuated in 274 by the Romans. There are no references to <b>urban</b> <b>settlement</b> on the site for the better part of a millennium thereafter.|$|E

40|$|During the Middle Bronze II B-C period (1800 - 1500 B. C.) Palestine {{underwent}} {{an unprecedented}} period of urban development. This urban development had several spatial consequences, {{which may be}} divided into three categories: (1) Spatial relationships between <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> and features of the local and regional environment, (2) Spatial patterns in the internal organization of <b>urban</b> <b>settlements,</b> and (3) Spatial patterns {{in the distribution of}} <b>urban</b> and rural <b>settlements</b> across the landscape. These three categories form the basis of this dissertation. With respect to the relationship between <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> and environmental features, it is demonstrated that <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> are associated with productive agricultural land, ample natural water sources, and natural routes of travel. They are also found only in regions where rainfall is sufficient for successful dry farming. The internal spatial organization of Middle Bronze <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> is found to be characterized by both agglomeration and centrality. Zones of land-use related to various urban functions are identified, and the similarity of these cities to other pre-industrial cities is demonstrated. Examination of the distribution of <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> across the land-scape suggests that these cities were not integrated into a regional urban system, but rather were independent city-states, each with its own supporting region. An examination of rural settlements within the hypothetical supporting region of each urban center supports this conclusion, although the inadequacies of survey within each of these regions preclude definitive conclusions...|$|R

5|$|Until the 18th century, Bombay {{consisted}} of seven islands separated by shallow sea. These seven islands {{were part of}} a larger archipelago in the Arabian sea, off the western coast of India. The date of city's founding is unclear—historians trace back <b>urban</b> <b>settlement</b> to the late 17th century after the British secured the seven islands from the Portuguese to establish a secure base in the region. The islands provided the British with a sheltered harbour for trade, in addition to a relatively sequestered location that reduced the chances of land-based attacks. Over the next two centuries, the British dominated the region, first securing the archipelago from the Portuguese, and later defeating the Marathas to secure the hinterland.|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} on {{the coast}} of China has attracted much attention. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore the differences in dynamics and related driving forces between <b>urban</b> and rural <b>settlements.</b> Applying the quantitative method, we demonstrate that substantial heterogeneity in settlement growth, landscape pattern metrics, change, land sources and driving forces is exhibited across the different types of <b>urban</b> and rural <b>settlements.</b> The spatial growth of <b>urban</b> <b>settlements</b> is dominated by in situ expansion, while rural settlements tend to be scattered and shrinking rapidly. The sprawl of human settlements has mainly occupied farm land, but reclamation projects are increasingly becoming important land sources for <b>urban</b> <b>settlements.</b> Local government has played a critical role in <b>urban</b> <b>settlements,</b> while the expansion of rural settlements is mainly driven by individual choice and village collective organizations. Such differences may account for differential options for the management of human settlements scientifically...|$|R

It {{represented}} {{the central and}} eastern portions of Lot M1513 and the northeastern corner of Lot M1506 on Swan Location 1370. The name Heathridge, chosen for the ground-cover vegetation growing on the sand ridges in the area, was first proposed by the developer, Kaiser Aetna, and was accepted by the government's Nomenclature Advisory Committee on 8 November 1974. It was officially gazetted in October 1975.|$|E

25|$|The party {{walls that}} {{separate}} most shophouses from their neighbours are generally constructed out of masonry (usually locally manufactured baked clay bricks) {{and they are}} structural, load-bearing walls, i.e. they transfer {{the weight of the}} roof and upper floors down to the ground. Party walls marked a major shift from traditional timber post-and-beam frame construction of pre-colonial Southeast Asia. Masonry was used to bear the heavy loads, to provide privacy and security and, importantly, to serve as a barrier to the spread of fire in a crowded <b>urban</b> <b>settlement.</b> Modern shophouses use similar materials but additionally include reinforced concrete beams.|$|E
