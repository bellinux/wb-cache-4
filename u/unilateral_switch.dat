We evaluate unilateral and uniform switches to proportionality both from Colorado’s perspective and from an impartial perspective {{on the basis of}} a priori and a posteriori voting power measures. The present system is to be preferred to a <b>unilateral</b> <b>switch</b> from any perspective on any measure. A uniform switch is to be preferred to the present system from Colorado’s perspective on an a priori measure, and from an impartial perspective on an a posteriori measure. The present system is to be preferred to a uniform switch from Colorado’s perspective on an a posteriori measure (with some qualifications), and from an impartial perspective on an a priori measure. We conclude with a discussion of the appropriateness of these measures...|$|E
40|$|Internal debt {{financing}} {{can be used}} by multinational firms to shift profits from high-tax to low-tax countries. Governments apply thin capitalization rules (TCRs), which limit the deductibility of interest expenses, to restrict this behavior. TCRs fall in two main categories: safe haven rules and earnings stripping rules. We derive the locally and the socially optimal type of TCR in a general equilibrium two country model. A <b>unilateral</b> <b>switch</b> from safe haven to earnings stripping rules is welfare improving, because it allows governments to tax at different effective rates domestic and multinational firms. Thus, we provide an explanation for the recently observed trend to replace safe haven rules with earnings stripping rules. Depending on the degree of transfer price manipulation undertaken by multinational enterprises, a prisoner dilemma result emerges, as local governments may have a dominant strategy to choose earnings stripping, even when it is not mutually welfare maximizing...|$|E

H 577 P LMS 2016 Liaoviii, 178 pages :color illustrationsThe thesis {{consists}} of four projects {{under the umbrella of}} revenue maximization with limited capacity. The topics are motivated from real practices of revenue management and competition in the airline industry, hotel industry, and property market, etc. The first two projects are motivated by the increasing popularity of the travel package and emerging impact of the new third-party channel on the hotel's traditional dynamic pricing. They consider a monopolistic framework in which the supplier owns limited inventory of perishable resource, and dynamically controls the selling process in a finite planning horizon. The first project considers a revenue-maximizing supplier who holds two resources and sells a line of products made up of individual components and a package comprising these two resources. In every period, three streams of consumers arrive: one stream for each component and one for the package. We adopt both quantity-based and price-based controls to maximize the expected revenue. The results show that the optimal solutions behave monotonically with respect to time and inventory level. Finally, we numerically compare the performances between quantity-based and price-based controls. The second project studies a dynamic dual-channel pricing problem. In the travel industry, suppliers usually use both their own direct channel and Online Travel Agency (OTA) channel to distribute services. In particular, we consider the OTA-supplier contract's rate stipulation which prohibits the price of the direct channel be lower than that of OTA channel. We formulate a dynamic pricing model, where a monopolistic supplier with limited capacity faces consumer arrivals from direct and OTA channels in every period. We show that the rate stipulation leads the direct channel's consumers to <b>unilateral</b> <b>switch</b> to the OTA channel. We also obtain the structural properties of optimal prices and the supplier's optimal channel policy with respect to time and inventory level. The last two projects are motivated respectively by the firms' products-size design problems such as the TV stations' advertisement duration decision in the prime time, and the use of Commission Override Model to mitigate the capacity competition between the Online Travel Agency and the hotels. They consider the revenue maximization with limited inventory in a competitive framework. The third project studies whether capacitated suppliers should introduce a small-size product or large-size product in a competitive environment. We study a model where symmetric duopoly capacitated suppliers can either choose to sell the small or large product. We demonstrate that the equilibrium product strategy depends on the decision sequence between the suppliers, and the relative capacity compared to the extent of increasing marginal utility experienced by the consumer when consuming an additional unit of the inventory. The fourth project considers a commonly used allocation scheme in the hotel industry: Commission Override Model (COM), which uses both wholesale contract and consignment contract to sell hotel rooms, allowing the hotel to more flexibly allocate rooms among channels. We study two firms, a hotel that has a direct channel and an OTA that owns the OTA channel. We formulate a two-period stochastic model and obtain the game equilibrium. Our results show that COM is able to benefit the two firms more than the traditional wholesale or consignment contract in a more uncertain scenario. Department of Logistics and Maritime StudiesPh.

40|$|The pain {{cries and}} squeals: recognition, {{influence}} on the individual behaviour and interhemisphere asymmetry of its cortex control of the rats have been investigated. The work is aimed at studying the dynamics and sexual dimorphism of the interhemisphere asymmetry in the ensurance of the pain vocalizations to the series of the nociceptive stimula. The peculiarities of participation of the cortex of {{the right and left}} hemispheres in the control of the latent period, the percent of appearance, the amplitude of the pain cries and squeals, the interhemisphere asymmetry, its dynamics and sexual dimorphism have been studied. The complex evaluation of the characteristics of the rat's pain vocalizations under the conditions of the intact brain and with the <b>unilateral</b> its <b>switching</b> off has been developed, which is essential for the control of the voice signals generation system and for the determination of the pain sensitivity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In many {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients both hippocampi are seizure onset zones. These patients are unsuitable candidates for epilepsy surgery {{but may be}} amenable to hippocampal deep brain stimulation (DBS). The optimal DBS parameters for these patients are unknown. Recent observations suggest that even in patients with a <b>unilateral</b> focus <b>switching</b> from <b>unilateral</b> hippocampal DBS to bilateral hippocampal DBS could improve seizure control. OBJECTIVE: Compare the effect of unilateral with bilateral hippocampal DBS on seizures in a rat model for TLE. METHODS: In the post status epilepticus (SE) kainic acid rat model for TLE continuous EEG monitoring was performed for 50 days during which rats were subjected to 10 days of unilateral and 10 days of bilateral Poisson-distributed high frequency hippocampal DBS in a cross-over trial. During bilateral DBS, each hippocampus was stimulated with a separate stimulator and its own generated Poisson distribution with a mean and variance of 1 / 130 s. RESULTS: Electrographic seizure rate was 23 % lower during bilateral compared to unilateral hippocampal DBS (P < 0. 05). No effect of unilateral nor bilateral hippocampal DBS was observed on seizure duration. When bilateral hippocampal DBS was applied, lower stimulation intensities were required to evoke after discharges (P < 0. 05), reflecting a higher potency of bilateral hippocampal DBS compared to unilateral hippocampal DBS to affect hippocampal networks. CONCLUSIONS: Superior outcome in seizure control with bilateral compared to unilateral hippocampal DBS indicates that targeting larger regions of the hippocampal formation {{with more than one}} stimulation electrode may be more successful in suppressing seizures in TLE...|$|R
40|$|With {{slim and}} legless body, {{particular}} ball articulation and rhythmic locomotion, a nature snake adapted itself to many terrains {{under the control}} of neuron system. Based on analyzing the locomotion mechanism, the main functional features of the motor system in snakes are specified in detail. Furthermore, a bidirectional cyclic inhibitory CPG model is firstly applied to imitate the pattern generation for the locomotion control of the snake-like robot, and its characteristic is discussed particularly for the generation of different kinds rhythmic locomotion. Besides, we introduce the neuron network organized by the bidirectional cyclic inhibitory CPGs connected in line with <b>unilateral</b> excitation to <b>switch</b> automatically locomotion pattern of a snake-like robot under different command from high level neuron, and present the necessary condition for the CPG neuron network to sustain a rhythmic output. The validity for the generation of different kinds of rhythmic locomotion modes by the CPG network are verified by the dynamic simulations and experiments. This research provided a new method to model the generation mechanism of the rhythmic pattern of the snake.
