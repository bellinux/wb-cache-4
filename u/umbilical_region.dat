5|$|Continuous zonal {{patterns}} {{can take}} the form of whitish subsutural bands (A. similis), heavy subperipheral pigmentation (A. perversus var. infraviridis), subsutural color lines (A. columellaris), broad spiral color bands (A. metabletus, A. webbi), or narrow spiral bands (A. laevus). Interrupted zonation can consist of the interruption of bands into spots in (A. maculatus); highly irregular splitting of zones (A. perversus vars. sultanus and interruptus); formation of oblique radial streaks which run parallel to (in A. inversus) or cross (in A. latestrigatus) the incremental growth lines; or almost every conceivable combination and variation of these factors. Often the pattern will change radically from the apex to the body whorl (in A. quadrasi vars.). The aperture, parietal callus, columella, lip, and <b>umbilical</b> <b>region</b> are variously marked with pink, brown, purple, white, or black. Haniel (1921) includes several color plates which clearly demonstrate the extent of color variation within two species of the Syndromus type. A. perversus and A. maculiferus of the subgenus Amphidromus are equally variable, whereas species such as A. inversus and A. similis are almost uniform in coloration.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY A single oral dose of {{ivermectin}} paste {{was administered}} to 12 horses with dermatitis and clinical signs typical of onchocerciasis. Two of the horses also had lesions of Queensland itch. Microfilarias of Onchocerca cervicalis were identified in fresh, macerated, skin biopsies from the neck, brisket or <b>umbilical</b> <b>regions</b> of all horses and microfilarias of O. gutturosa from the neck of 2. Eight of the horses developed skin reactions 4 to 24 h after {{the administration of the}} ivermectin, notably weals over the neck, shoulders and flanks and pitting oedema of the ventral midline and intermandibular space. Regression of the onchocerciasis lesions was evident within 7 days of treatment and affected skin had returned to normal within 3 months. The lesions of Queensland itch were not affected by the ivermectin treatment. Microfilarias were present in biopsies of skin, particularly in the superficial dermis, before treatment, but were absent from all skin biopsies taken one week after treatment. In some horses transient skin sensitivity reactions developed. Microfilarias began to reappear in the biopsies of some of the horses 2 months after treatment. It is concluded that the oral paste formulation of ivermectin, although not effective against adult onchocerca, is useful for the therapeutic control of microfilarias in the skin lesions of equine onchocerciasis.

40|$|International audienceDesigners {{frequently}} draw curvature {{lines to}} convey bending of smooth surfaces in concept sketches. We present {{a method to}} extrapolate curvature lines in a rough concept sketch, recovering the intended 3 D curvature field and surface normal at each pixel of the sketch. This 3 D information allows us to enrich the sketch with 3 D-looking shading and texturing. We first introduce the concept of regularized curvature lines that model the lines designers draw over curved surfaces, encompassing curvature lines and their extension as geodesics over flat or <b>umbilical</b> <b>regions.</b> We build on this concept to define the orthogonal cross field that assigns two regularized curvature lines to each point of a 3 D surface. Our algorithm first estimates the projection of this cross field in the drawing, which is non-orthogonal due to foreshortening. We formulate this estimation as a scattered interpolation of the strokes drawn in the sketch, which makes our method robust to sketchy lines that are typical for design sketches. Our interpolation relies on a novel smoothness energy that we derive from our definition of regularized curvature lines. Optimizing this energy subject to the stroke constraints produces a dense non-orthogonal 2 D cross field, which we then lift to 3 D by imposing orthogonality. Thus, one central concept of our approach is the generalization of existing cross field algorithms to the non-orthogonal case. We demonstrate our algorithm {{on a variety of}} concept sketches with various levels of sketchiness. We also compare our approach with existing work that takes clean vector drawings as input...|$|R

The avermectin B 1 was a 1 % solution in a propylene glycolglycerol formal base. Faecal strongyle egg counts were performed before, and 14, 28, 42, 56 and 70 d, after treatment. Full-thickness skin biopsies from the neck, pectoral and <b>umbilical</b> <b>regions</b> were examined for Onchocera microfilaria before treatment, and again 14 and 70 d later. Ivermectin therapy produced a significant (P less than 0. 01) decrease in mean strongyle egg counts 14, 28, 42 and 56 d after treatment. Avermectin B 1 therapy resulted in significant (P less than 0. 01) decreases in mean strongyle egg counts 14, 28 and 42 d after treatment. All horses given ivermectin or avermectin B 1 had zero strongyle egg counts 14 and 28 d after treatment. Fenbendazole failed to significantly decrease strongyle egg counts. Both ivermectin and avermectin B 1 resulted in zero microfilaria counts in all horses 14 d after treatment. On day 70 the percentage decrease in microfilaria counts were 100 % and 99. 6 % respectively. Fenbendazole failed to significantly decrease microfilaria counts. The oral administration of this formulation of avermectin B 1 appeared to be highly efficacious against intestinal strongyles and Onchocera microfilaria.

Biomechanical {{studies have shown that}} the LA has elastic properties, which display regional variation. This study describes the pattern of distribution of elastic fibres in the LA in 18 young adults. Five millimetre transverse sections were taken from the supraumbilical, <b>umbilical</b> and infraumbilical <b>regions</b> of the LA. These sections were processed for paraffin embedding, sectioned, then stained with Weigert’s resorcin and fuchsin and counter-stained with Van Gieson in order to visualize elastic and collagen fibres. Under light microscopy, a substantial amount of elastic fibres is present in the LA with higher amounts in the anterior, caudal and lateral parts. The elastic fibres are longitudinally and obliquely disposed in the entire length of the LA. These elastic fibres are more abundant in the anterior lamina, in the lateral and caudal parts of the LA. The elastic fibres demonstrated probably confer reversible pliability to the LA. The regional variations in their distribution may reflect differences in function of the parts of the LA: namely an upper respiratory and a lower visceral support...|$|R

40|$|Background: Abdominoplasty {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} performed cosmetic procedures, and its combination with liposuction has become more common. Seroma {{is one of the}} most common complications in abdominoplasty. the aim of this study was to compare the rate of seroma formation in patients who underwent either abdominoplasty with or without the use of quilting sutures or lipoabdominoplasty. Methods: Fifty-eight female patients were divided into three groups and underwent one of the following procedures: group A (n = 21), abdominoplasty without quilting sutures; group B (n = 17), abdominoplasty with quilting sutures; and group C (n = 20), lipoabdominoplasty. To investigate seroma formation, abdominal ultrasound was performed in five regions of the abdominal wall (epigastrium, umbilical, hypogastrium, right iliac fossa, and left iliac fossa) at two postoperative periods (P 1, between postoperative days 11 and 14; and P 2, between postoperative days 18 and 21). Results: the rate of seroma formation at both P 1 and P 2 was significantly higher in group A. It was observed that in group A at P 1, the regions of right iliac fossa and left iliac fossa developed larger fluid collections. in group B, there were no significant differences with respect to fluid collections among the five study regions at both P 1 and P 2. in group C, there were significantly larger fluid collections in the hypogastrium region at P 1 and in the <b>umbilical</b> and hypogastrium <b>regions</b> at P 2. Conclusion: Abdominoplasty with quilting sutures and lipoabdominoplasty are effective techniques for the prevention of seromas compared with abdominoplasty without quilting sutures. (Plast. Reconstr.
