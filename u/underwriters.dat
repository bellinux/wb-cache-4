5|$|Although once {{dominated}} by large public and multilateral <b>underwriters,</b> private insurance firms accounted for {{approximately half of}} the political risk insurance market in 2007. As a result, MIGA has paid closer attention to exceptionally risky countries that have little appeal to foreign investors, and has insured projects among nations in the global south. MIGA conducted a survey in 2010 which showed that political risk is the most important deterrent of long-term foreign direct investment in developing countries, even more than economic uncertainty and poor public infrastructure. MIGA's Council of Governors amended the agency's convention in 2010 in an attempt to improve the organization's effectiveness by expanding the range of investments eligible for political risk insurance.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the interaction between <b>underwriter</b> reputation and market activities during the initial public offering (IPO) process. <b>Underwriter</b> reputation is a significant determinant of premarket <b>underwriter</b> activities, weakly related to aftermarket price stabilization activities, and unrelated to issuer returns. Premarket <b>underwriter</b> activities are a significant determinant of issue-date returns and aftermarket <b>underwriter</b> activities but are unrelated to longer-run returns. Aftermarket <b>underwriter</b> activities are significantly related to longer-run returns. The results suggest that simultaneous consideration of <b>underwriter</b> reputation and market activities is important if proper inferences about the IPO process and investor returns are to be drawn.

Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} evidence using Japanese {{data that}} shows that the principal-agent problem between <b>underwriter</b> and issuing firms {{is the cause of}} the underpricing of initial public offerings. We find that the initial return is lower when the venture capital is a subsidiary of the lead <b>underwriter</b> and directly invested into the issuing firm rather than via a limited partnership fund. We also find that the initial return is larger when one of the top three security firms is the <b>underwriter.</b> This means that underpricing is more serious when the bargaining power of the <b>underwriter</b> is large. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that an equity investment in issuing firms by the <b>underwriter</b> improves the alignment between the <b>underwriter</b> and the issuing firm, and thus helps to increase the offer price. The principal-agent problem between the <b>underwriter</b> and issuers {{is one of the reasons}} for the underpricing. Principal-agent problem IPO in Japan Underpricing...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the optimal design of mortgage backed securities (MBS) in dynamic setting with moral hazard. A mortgage <b>underwriter</b> with limited liability {{can engage in}} costly effort to screen for low risk borrowers and can sell loans to a secondary market. Secondary market investors cannot observe the effort of the mortgage <b>underwriter,</b> but they can make their payments to the <b>underwriter</b> conditional on the mortgage defaults. We find the optimal contract between the <b>underwriter</b> and the investors involves a single payment to the <b>underwriter</b> after a waiting period. We also show how to implement the optimal contract using a credit default swap (CDS). The dynamic setting of our model admits three new findings. First, unlike static models that focus on <b>underwriter</b> retention {{as a means of}} providing incentives, our model show that the timing of payments to the <b>underwriter</b> is the key incentive mechanism. Specifically, we show the optimal contract delivers substantial gains in efficiency over other standard contracts which require the <b>underwriter</b> to retain a fraction of the pool of mortgages or a “first loss piece. ” Second, the maturity of the optimal contract can be short even though the mortgages are long-lived. Third, selling mortgages in a pool is more efficient that selling mortgages individually, because it allows investors to learn about <b>underwriter</b> effort more quickly (information enhancement effect). ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the cross-sectional determinants of the role of the <b>underwriter</b> in aftermarket price discovery. Design/methodology/approach - The paper estimates Gonzalo-Granger common factor weights across <b>underwriter</b> and non-underwriter execution channels in the IPO aftermarket and investigates the cross-sectional determinants of these CFWs. Findings - The first novel result is that verifiable facts are not a substitute for, but a complement to, <b>underwriter</b> certification and advice. Specifically, the <b>underwriter's</b> contribution to price discovery increases with the number of supplier and customer contracts reported in the prospectus. Second, the <b>underwriter's</b> role in price discovery declines when the IPO is first in a new technology or product space. These findings indicate that the verification process, not de novo information production, is the key function of the <b>underwriter.</b> Research limitations/implications - Research design is applicable to IPOs in the USA and elsewhere. Originality/value - Previous research examining IPO aftermarket trading has been largely limited to the first day of trading.

Third, we find that large block trades receive worse execution through the bookrunner than through non-syndicate market makers, so differential execution quality cannot explain the net buy imbalances.
