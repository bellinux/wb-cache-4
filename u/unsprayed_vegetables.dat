40|$|We have {{conducted}} bioassays {{to assess the}} response of some Italian strains of T. urticae {{to a number of}} acaricides. These include compounds that were widespread and frequently used in the past, but also some recently registered compounds. We investigated two T. urticae strains collected from rose growers where control failures were reported (SAN and PSE), together with a strain collected from <b>unsprayed</b> <b>vegetables</b> (BOSA). Adult females of the rose strains (SAN and PSE) were resistant to tebufenpyrad and fenpyroximate when compared to the susceptible BOSA strain. Lethal concentrations for these products were higher than the registered field rate. The PSE strain proved to be highly resistant to abamectin. Variation in bifenazate susceptibility was detected amongst strains, but LC 90 values of SAN and PSE were still in the range of the registered field rate. In egg bioassays, the SAN and PSE strains exhibited high resistance levels to clofentezine, hexythiazox and flufenoxuron. But the recently introduced ovi/ larvicides etoxazole and spirodiclofen exhibited high activity on all strains. The activity of detoxifying enzymes such as esterases, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (MFOs) was determined in these strains as a preliminary attempt to identify potential resistance mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae and its {{predator}} Phytoseiulus persimilis are widely {{spread in the}} Mediterranean area. Predator–prey interactions may be affected by pesticides used to control various pests, and knowledge of pesticide side-effects is essential when managing spider mite populations following IPM tactics. Toxicological studies evaluating the effects of pesticides on both predator and prey can better predict their impact in field conditions. A number of botanical and reduced-risk insecticides were evaluated on T. urticae and P. persimilis in the laboratory. Mite populations were collected on <b>unsprayed</b> <b>vegetables.</b> Females were treated by micro-immersion and then reared on treated leaves in holding cells. Then the survival, fecundity and fertility of mites were assessed. All pesticides affected mite survival and/or fecundity. Some of them (e. g. pyrethrins and rotenone) were more toxic to P. persimilis than to T. urticae. Azadirachtin, B. bassiana and pymetrozine showed opposite results. Imidacloprid had a similar impact on predator and prey. Toxicological trials were conducted with T. urticae and P. persimilis eggs. Beauveria bassiana reduced dramatically the hatching of T. urticae treated eggs and rotenone significantly affected P. persimilis egg hatching. Implications for IPM are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Problems with Tetranychus urticae are {{frequently}} reported in protected crops in Italy, particularly in roses where many introduced acaricides show a progressive loss of effectiveness. We have conducted bioassays {{to assess the}} response of some Italian strains of T. urticae {{to a number of}} acaricides. These include compounds that were widespread and frequently used in the past, but also some recently registered compounds. We investigated two T. urticae strains collected from rose growers where control failures were reported (SAN and PSE), together with a strain collected from <b>unsprayed</b> <b>vegetables</b> (BOSA). Adult females of the rose strains (SAN and PSE) were resistant to tebufenpyrad (Resistant Ratio—RR, RR 50 = 48. 4 and 163. 6) and fenpyroximate (RR 50 = 74. 1 and 25. 9) when compared to the susceptible BOSA strain. Lethal concentrations for these products were higher than the registered field rate. The PSE strain proved to be highly resistant to abamectin (RR 50 = 1, 294. 1). Variation in bifenazate susceptibility was detected amongst strains, but LC 90 values of SAN and PSE were still in the range of the registered field rate. In egg bioassays, the SAN and PSE strains exhibited high resistance levels to clofentezine (RR 50 = 66, 473 and 170, 714), hexythiazox (RR 50 = 70, 244 and 159, 493) and flufenoxuron (RR 50 = 61. 9 and 117. 9). But the recently introduced ovi/larvicides etoxazole and spirodiclofen exhibited high activity on all strains. The activity of detoxifying enzymes such as esterases, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (MFOs) was determined in these strains as a preliminary attempt to identify potential resistance mechanisms. Enzymatic assays showed that the rose strains exhibited 2. 66 and 1. 95 -fold increased MFOs activity compared to the susceptible strain. Assays for GSTs revealed that only the SAN strain exhibited a significantly higher activity. In contrast, only the PSE strain showed a significant higher hydrolysis of 1 -naphthyl acetate...|$|E
