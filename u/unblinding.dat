40|$|OBJECTIVES: (1) To develop trial {{protocols}} which {{promote the}} achievement of blind outcome assessment. (2) To report outcome assessor beliefs regarding group allocation at follow-up assessments. (3) To document and describe instances of <b>unblinding</b> occurring during the trial to assist and inform rehabilitation researchers and clinicians. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal observational study. SETTING: An NHS Hospital Trust specializing in orthopaedic surgery. SUBJECTS: One hundred and seven patients participating in a prospective pragmatic randomized controlled trial investigating physiotherapy rehabilitation following total knee arthroplasty, plus three outcome assessors. INTERVENTIONS: A protocol was developed using available research and designed to minimize instances of <b>unblinding</b> during a physiotherapy rehabilitation trial. Administrative, office, patient and research staff procedures were included. MAIN MEASURES: Trial questionnaires measured blind outcome assessment responses at 3 and 12 months post surgery. The outcome assessor kept a field diary recording the events surrounding instances of <b>unblinding.</b> Data underwent descriptive and content analysis. RESULTS: Blind outcome assessment was believed successful for n[*]=[*] 74 (81. 32 %) assessments at 3 -month follow-up, and n[*]=[*] 83 (91. 21 %) at 12 months. Forty instances (n[*]=[*] 28 participants) of <b>unblinding</b> were described in the field diary. While {{the main cause of}} <b>unblinding</b> was participants telling the outcome assessor, in 12. 5 % of events the assessor drew the wrong conclusion regarding group allocation. Not all <b>unblinding</b> events were remembered at subsequent assessments, even in this relatively small trial. CONCLUSIONS: Blind outcome assessment was considered achievable in this trial. Specific trial protocols enabled blinding beliefs to be reported and instances of <b>unblinding</b> to be described...|$|E
40|$|Background Blinding is {{the process}} of keeping {{treatment}} assignment hidden and is used to minimise the possibility of bias. Trials at high risk of bias have been shown to report larger treatment effects than low risk studies. In dermatology, one popular method of blinding is to have independent outcome assessors who are unaware of treatment allocation assessing the end point using digital photographs. However, this can be complex, expensive and time-consuming. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the effect of blinded and <b>unblinded</b> outcome assessment on the results of the STOP GAP trial. Methods The STOP GAP trial compared prednisolone to ciclosporin in treating pyoderma gangrenosum. Participants’ lesions were measured at baseline and 6 weeks to calculate the primary outcome, speed of healing. Independent blinded assessors obtained measurements from digital photographs using specialist software. In addition, <b>unblinded</b> treating clinicians estimated lesion area by measuring length and width. The primary outcome was determined using blinded measurements where available, otherwise <b>unblinded</b> measurements were used (method referred to as trial measurements). In this study, agreement between the trial and <b>unblinded</b> measurements was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The STOP GAP primary analysis was repeated using <b>unblinded</b> measurements only. We introduced differential and non-differential error in <b>unblinded</b> measurements and investigated the effect on the STOP GAP primary analysis. Results 86 (80...|$|R

Introduction The concept of blind signature schemes was introduced by Chaum in 1982 [Chau 82]. These schemes can be used in payment systems [Chau 85] or for electronic voting schemes [FuOO 92]. In a blind signature scheme an owner Alice wants to obtain a digital signature on a message choosen by herself from the notary Nancy, but Nancy shouldn't have any idea which message she signs. If she gets the message and the signature later, it must not be possible that Nancy can find a relationship between some blinded and <b>unblinded</b> parameters. Additionally there are other classes of blind signatures, hidden or weak blind signature [HoPe 94], in which the notary can find a relationship between some blinded and <b>unblinded</b> parameters if she gets a signed <b>unblinded</b> message [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|In {{fixed sample}} size designs, precise {{knowledge}} about {{the magnitude of the}} outcome variable's variance in the planning phase of a clinical trial is mandatory for an adequate sample size determination. Wittes and Brittain introduced the internal pilot study design that allows recalculation of the sample size during an ongoing trial using the estimated variance obtained from an interim analysis. However, this procedure requires the <b>unblinding</b> of the treatment code. Since <b>unblinding</b> of an ongoing trial should be avoided whenever possible, there should be some benefit of this design compared with blinded sample size recalculation procedures to justify the unveiling of the treatment code. In this paper, we compare several sample size recalculation procedures with and without <b>unblinding.</b> The simulation results indicate that the procedures behave similarly. In particular, breaking of the blind is not required for an efficient sample size adjustment. We also compare these pure sample size adaptation procedures with study designs which additionally allow for early stopping. Evaluation of the cumulative distribution function of the resulting sample sizes shows that the option for early stopping may lead to lower expectation but generally to a higher variability. The procedures are illustrated by an example of a trial in the treatment of depression...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{performance}} characteristics of CT virtual colonoscopy (VC) for detection of colorectal neoplasia {{have not been}} established in an average-risk screening population. We conducted a prospective multicenter VC screening trial using optical colonoscopy (OC) as the reference standard. METHODS: 1233 asymptomatic adults (mean age, 57. 8 years; 728 men, 505 women) underwent VC examination followed by same-day OC. 1201 patients were classified as average risk. Prospective VC interpretation immediately preceded OC, with segmental <b>unblinding</b> of VC results at OC. Radiologists relied primarily on the three-dimensional (3 D) endoluminal display for polyp detection. RESULTS: VC sensitivity by patient for adenomatous polyps was 93. 8 % (45 / 48), 93. 9 % (77 / 82), and 88. 7 % (149 / 168) for size thresholds of 10, 8, and 6 mm, respectively. At the same size thresholds, OC sensitivity by patient for adenomatous polyps (prior to <b>unblinding)</b> was 87. 5 %, 91. 5 %, and 92. 3 %, respectively. VC specificity by patient for adenomatous polyps was 96. 0 % (1138 / 1185), 92. 2 % (1061 / 1151), and 79. 6 % (848 / 1065), respectively, and for all polyps (regardless of histology) was 97. 4 % (1131 / 1161), 95. 0 % (1050 / 1105), and 84. 5 % (826 / 978), respectively. VC sensitivity by polyp for adenomas was 92. 2 % (47 / 51), 92. 6 % (88 / 95), and 85. 7 % (180 / 210) at 10, 8, and 6 mm thresholds, respectively.

The trial was unblinded and placebo patients were offered letrozole. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An intent-to-treat analysis of all outcomes, before and after <b>unblinding,</b> {{on the basis of}} the original randomization was carried out. RESULTS: In all, 5187 patients were randomly allocated to the study at baseline and, at <b>unblinding,</b> 1579 (66 %) of 2383 placebo patients accepted letrozole. At median follow-up of 64 months (range 16 - 95), 399 recurrences or contralateral breast cancers (CLBCs) (164 letrozole and 235 placebo) occurred. Four-year DFS was 94. 3 % (letrozole) and 91. 4 % (placebo) [HR 0. 68, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 55 - 0. 83, P = 0. 0001] and showed superiority for letrozole in both node-positive and -negative patients. Corresponding 4 -year distant DFS was 96. 3 % and 94. 9 % (HR 0. 80, 95 % CI 0. 62 - 1. 03, P = 0. 082). Four-year overall survival was 95. 1 % for both groups. The annual rate of CLBC was 0. 28 % for letrozole and 0. 46 % for placebo patients (HR 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 39 - 0. 97, P = 0. 033). CONCLUSIONS: Patients originally randomly assigned to receive letrozole within 3 months of stopping tamoxifen did better than placebo patients in DFS and CLBC, despite 66 % of placebo patients taking letrozole after <b>unblinding.</b> Journal ArticleRandomized Controlled TrialResearch Support, N.

Interobserver reliability in distinguishing hemorrhagic transformation of infarction from intracerebral hemorrhage may depend on delays to CT but has not been reported previously despite the clinical importance of this distinction. METHODS: Initial CT scans with intraparenchymal hematoma from the first 1000 patients with stroke in the Oxford Vascular Study were independently categorized as intracerebral hemorrhage or hemorrhagic transformation of infarction by 5 neuroradiologists, both blinded and unblinded to clinical history. Thirty scans were reviewed twice. Agreement was quantified by the kappa statistic. RESULTS: Seventy-eight scans showed intraparenchymal hematoma. Blinded pairwise interrater agreements for a diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage ranged from kappa= 0. 15 to 0. 48 with poor overall agreement (kappa= 0. 35; 95 % CI, 0. 15 to 0. 54) even after <b>unblinding</b> (kappa= 0. 41; 0. 21 to 0. 60).

40|$|Abstract Background Maintenance of the blind-to-treatment {{allocation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important means of avoiding bias in randomised controlled clinical trials. Commonly used methodologies to determine whether patients have become unblinded to treatment allocation are imperfect. This may be of particular concern in studies where outcomes are patient-reported, and with products which have a characteristic adverse event profile. We report the results of an evidence-based statistical approach to exploring the possible impact of <b>unblinding</b> to a cannabis-based medicine (Sativex®) in people with muscle spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Methods All 666 patients included in three Phase III placebo-controlled studies were included in this analysis. The relationship between factors that might permit patients to identify their treatment allocation and the effect of treatment on the self-reported primary outcome measure was investigated using a general linear model where the dependent variable was the change from baseline in patient self-reported spasticity severity, and the various possible explanatory factors were regarded as fixed factors in the model. Results There was no significant relationship between the effect of Sativex® on spasticity and the prior use of cannabis or the incidence of ‘typical’ adverse events. Nor was there any significant relationship between the prior use of cannabis and the incidence of ‘typical’ adverse events, nor between prior use of cannabis and dose of Sativex®. Conclusions There is no evidence to suggest that there was widespread <b>unblinding</b> to treatment allocation in these three studies. If any patients did become unblinded, then there is no evidence that this led to bias in the assessment of the treatment difference between Sativex® and Placebo for efficacy, adverse events or study drug dosing.
