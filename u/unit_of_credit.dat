Majority control of Aurora National was sold to Groupe Artémis in 1994. In July 1998, an anonymous French whistle-blower told the California Insurance Department that Crédit Lyonnais was the real buyer of the insurance company and controlled it through secret agreements. In early 1999, the California Insurance Department sued the bank and other parties, alleging fraud and seeking $2 billion in restitution.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{interaction}} between asset market and current account in a small open economy. In an overlapping generations economy in which land and money are available assets, {{the interaction between}} the land price and current account dynamics is shown to generate a plausible (asset price) specie-flow mechanism. We apply them to a number of issues. Domestic credit policy is neutral in the long run: one unit of foreign reserve increase offsets one <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> reduction. Next, the association between the endowment of land and foreign asset accumulation depends on parameters of the model. Finally, we examine the dynamic adjustment s following a once-and-for-all capital inflow. When the adjustment involves running current account deficit, the recipient country's foreign reserve position is permanently lowered. Furthermore, the steady state level of national wealth is permanently reduced. [E 4, F 3]...|$|E

" He called the first goal "the essence of MENC's agenda" and vowed that MENC would pursue that objective vigorously and persitently. "We {{can take advantage of}} the nations current enthusiasm for excellence to make dramatic progress toward these goals," he said, but warned that the goals impose special responsibilities on music educators. As is generally known, the Crisis in Music Education in the United States happened in 1981. For the sake of the federal government budget cuts signed into law by President Regan in the August, hundreds of music education position have been eliminated. The cuts affected school budgets and when school budgets are cut, music program and personnel used to be often one of the first to be proposed for curtailment or elimination. In the preceding treatise, an overview of the music curricula innovation movements of the United States was presented. As the conclusion of the study, writer could condense the basic idea of the music curricula innovation movements to such slogan "Music for every child, every child for music.

Second, in addition, the ideas and methods which have been supporting American music educators were examined.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} novel urban system {{equilibrium}} model for {{design of a}} tradable location tax credit scheme to balance traffic congestion and environmental externalities. In the proposed model, {{the interaction between the}} location tax credit scheme and households' residential location choices is explicitly considered. It is assumed that the authority initially allocates the credits to all households in a uniform way, and the households pay a certain amount of credits for housing consumptions, relying on the traffic congestion and environmental externalities that they cause. The credits are traded among households through a free market, and the tax revenue due to credit trading is considered as a part of household's income to be redistributed through household's income budget constraint. For a given credit scheme, households' residential location choices and housing market structure in terms of housing prices and space can be endogenously determined by the urban system equilibrium and the price per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is governed by the credit market equilibrium. A social welfare maximization model is presented to determine the total amount of credits issued. The results show that implementation of the tradable location tax credit scheme can rationalize the urban residential density and promote the efficiency of the urban system in terms of social welfare.

40|$|We {{present a}} regularized {{logistic}} regression model for evaluating player contribu-tions in hockey. The traditional metric {{for this purpose}} is the plus-minus statistic, which allocates a single <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> (for or against) to each player on the ice for a goal. However, plus-minus scores measure only the marginal effect of players, do not account for sample size, and provide a very noisy estimate of performance.

Due to the large-p (number of players) and imbalanced de-sign setting of hockey analysis, {{a major part of}} our contribution is a careful treatment of prior shrinkage in model estimation.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to examine the impacts of risk {{characteristics}} on equity pricing of tax credits issued under the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program (LIHTC). The results indicate that credit pricing is not correlated with most traditional real estate risk factors. We hypothesize that risks are mitigated by the services of syndicators, who act as intermediaries between developers and investors, thus managing the perceived risk of the investment. We tested this theory by examining the impact of individual syndicators on credit prices. Additionally, we tested the effect of syndicator fees and other syndicator-specific fixed effects on credit prices. Findings suggest that syndicator fixed effects and fees impact pricing, as do certain tax structure characteristics of the LIHTC developments. Developers appear to be less pricesensitive than investors, reflecting perhaps different levels of negotiating power in their relationships with syndicators, as well as lack of perfect information. Investors appear {{to focus more on}} internal rate of return than on price per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> in their investment decisions, thereby confusing the relationship between syndicator effects and credit prices for investors.
