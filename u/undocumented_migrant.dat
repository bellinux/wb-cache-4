Due to their irregular status, such migrants are an under-researched group and are not included in the country’s Cause of Death Register (CDR). Objective: To determine the causes of death among <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> in Sweden and to ascertain whether there are patterns in causes of death that differ between residents and <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants.</b> Design: This is a cross-sectional study of death certificates issued from 1997 to 2010 but never included in the CDR from which we established our study sample of <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants.</b> As age adjustments could not be performed due to lack of data, comparisons between residents and <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> were made at specific age intervals, based on the study sample’s mean age at death 9 a half standard deviation.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{rights of}} <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> are {{frequently}} overlooked. Denmark has ratified several international conventions recognizing {{the right to}} {{health care for all}} human beings, but has very scanty legislation and no existing policies for providing health care to <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants.</b> This study focuses on how health professionals navigate and how they experience providing treatment for <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> in the Danish health care system. Methods The study was carried out as part of an EU-project on European Best Practices in Access, Quality and Appropriateness of Health Services for Immigrants in Europe (EUGATE). This presentation is based on 12 semi-structured interviews with general practitioners (9) and emergency room physicians (3) in Denmark. Results The emergency room physicians express that treatment of <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> is no different from the treatment of any other person. However, care may become more complicated due to lack of previous medical records and contact persons. Contrary to this, general practitioners explain that <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> will encounter formal barriers when trying to obtain treatment. Additional problems in the treatment of <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> include language issues, financial aspects for general practitioners, concerns about how to handle the situation including possibilities of further referrals, and an uncertainty as to whether to involve the police. Conclusions The health professionals in our study describe that <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> experience an unequal access to primary care facilities and that great uncertainties exist amongst health professionals as how to respond in such situations. The lack of official policies concerning the right to health care for <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> continue to pass on the responsibility to health professionals and, thereby, leaves it up to the individual to decide whether treatment can be obtained or not. </p...|$|R

According {{to the local}} flood and drought relief headquarters, 4,452 homes were destroyed and 184,800 hectares were submerged in flood waters. In Sanmen County, where the storm made landfall, nearly 100 villages lost power. In the province alone, economic losses were estimated in excess of ¥10 billion (US$1.57 billion). Additionally, an estimated 4.03 million people were affected by the storm. In Shanghai, two {{people were killed and}} seven others were injured in storm-related accidents. Around 4:00 a.m. local time on the morning of August 10, the Shenjiakeng Reservoir in Zhoushan collapsed, destroying one-third of Zhangtu township and killing at least ten people.

40|$|This article {{considers}} recent legal {{developments on}} <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrant</b> workers, finds {{the acceptance of}} international legal standards unsatisfactory and argues that the private law rights derived from the "semi-legal" employment contract between the employer and the <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrant</b> worker generates a solid base for significant legal claims. It further monitors {{the promotion of the}} position of the <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrant</b> workers under recent EU law and calls for a re-focusing on the employment contract in the reading of a relevant EC Directive, with a particular emphasis on the issue of access to justice for the migrant workers. The increased number of undocumented migrants who leave their countries of origin for reasons outside the scope of the asylum procedure, as well as the circumstances under which this migration is undertaken and the working conditions of these individuals in the host countries, have brought about legal activities from governments and institutions such as the EU. The aim has in general been to establish sanctions against employers of <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrant</b> workers, but a shift towards a compensatory, employee protective, attitude has recently emerged, both in EU legislation and in a broader perspective in US case law.

A further assertion is that global relations and distributions of power determine the operation of this fragmented framework. Social vulnerability is reflected in and reinforced by it. As such, the <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrant</b> worker challenges, in many senses of the term, the margins of global governance and international law: the boundaries reflected in sovereign territoriality which continue to undergird international law, and to represent the limits of its permissible jurisdiction, and yet which are challenged by the aspiration towards globalization embodied physically in the person of the <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrant</b> worker.

Measures taken {{to control the}} influx of immigrants include policies that restrict access to publicly funded health care for <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants.</b> These restrictions to health care access are controversial, and evidence suggests they do not always have the intended effect. This study provides a comparative analysis of institutional, actor-related, and contextual factors that have influenced health care policy development on <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> in England and the Netherlands. For <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants,</b> England restricts its access to care {{at the point of}} service, while the Netherlands restricts through the payment system for services.

The {{aim of this}} study is to describe and analyse undocumented migrants' experiences of access to healthcare, use of alternative health-seeking strategies; and ER nurses' experiences in encounters with <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants.</b> Methods Qualitative design using semi-structured interviews and observations. The participants included ten <b>undocumented</b> South Asian <b>migrants</b> and eight ER nurses. Results <b>Undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> reported difficulties accessing healthcare. The barriers to healthcare were: limited medical rights, arbitrariness in healthcare professionals' attitudes, fear of being reported to the police, poor language skills, lack of network with Danish citizens, lack of knowledge about the healthcare system and lack of knowledge about informal networks of healthcare professionals. These barriers induced alternative health-seeking strategies, such as self-medication, contacting doctors in home countries and borrowing health insurance cards from Danish citizens. ER nurses expressed willingness to treat all patients regardless of their migratory status, but also reported challenges in the encounters with <b>undocumented</b> <b>migrants.</b> The challenges for ER nurses were: language barriers, issues of false identification, insecurities about the correct standard procedures and not always being able to provide appropriate care. Conclusions <b>Undocumented</b> <b>migrants</b> face formal and informal barriers to the Danish healthcare system, which lead to alternative health-seeking strategies that may have adverse effects on their health.
