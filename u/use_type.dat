25|$|Botulinum toxin {{injections}} into affected muscles {{have proved}} quite successful in providing some relief for around 3–6 months, {{depending on the}} kind of dystonia. Botox or Dysport injections have the advantage of ready availability (the same form is used for cosmetic surgery) and the effects are not permanent. There is a risk of temporary paralysis of the muscles being injected or the leaking of the toxin into adjacent muscle groups, causing weakness or paralysis in them. The injections have to be repeated, as the effects wear off and around 15% of recipients will develop immunity to the toxin. There is a Type A and a Type B toxin approved for treatment of dystonia; often, those that develop resistance to Type A may be able to <b>use</b> <b>Type</b> B.|$|E

25|$|City Hall was {{constructed}} using mainly cast-in-place and precast Portland cement concrete and some masonry. About {{half of the}} concrete used in the building was precastroughly 22,000 separate componentsand the other half was poured-in-place concrete. All of the concrete used in the structure, excluding that of the columns, is mixed with a light, coarse rock. While {{the majority of the}} building is created using concrete, precast and poured-in-place concrete are distinguishable by their different colors and textures. For example, cast-in-place elements are coarse and grainy textured because the concrete was poured into fir wood frames to mold it, while precast elements, such as trusses and supports, were set in steel molds to gain smooth, clean surfaces. This distinction can also be seen {{in the fact that the}} exterior poured-in-place pieces are of type I cement, a lightly colored cement, while the exterior precast components <b>use</b> <b>type</b> II cement, a dark colored cement. The base of the building is dark with brick, Welsh quarry tiles, mahogany walls, and darker concrete. As the building ascends, the overall color lightens, as lighter concrete is used.|$|E

500|$|Investigators also {{focused on}} deicing {{practices}} at LaGuardia. They {{found that the}} airport was using only Type I deicing fluid, not Type II. Type I fluids are used for the actual deicing of the jet, while Type II fluids are used for preventing buildup of ice. At {{the time of the}} accident, LaGuardia had prohibited the use of Type II deicing fluid because tests suggested that if it fell onto runways it reduced friction. Investigators noted the change had been made because of LaGuardia's shorter runways and the fact that if an aircraft left the vicinity of the runway, it would come to rest in the cold water surrounding Runway 13.

30|$|In {{addition}} to geophysical conditions, soil productivity {{also depends on}} the <b>type</b> of land <b>use.</b> The assessment of the European Environmental Agency (EEA 2006) shows that the three major land <b>use</b> <b>types</b> dominating the land cover of Europe are arable land with a share of 33 %, pastures and mosaics with a share of 23 %, and forests with a share of 29 %. The aggregated share of these three <b>types</b> of land <b>uses</b> sums up to 85 % of the total land and freshwater surfaces of the 24 countries of Europe assessed by the EEA (2006). Besides these major land <b>use</b> <b>types,</b> {{there are a number}} of specific regionally characterized land uses in Europe. There might also be considerable differences in the land utilization within the main land <b>use</b> <b>types.</b> However, for a continental-scale assessment of biomass productivity, the productivity patterns were evaluated according to the three major land <b>use</b> <b>types.</b> Models were therefore developed to describe general orders of soil productivity within the three land <b>use</b> <b>types,</b> namely for pasture/grassland, cropland, and forest.|$|R

40|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} plays an {{important}} role in soil fertility and carbon sequestration. In the North China Plain, soil nutrients and organic carbon are still lacking in salt-affected soil after a successfully reclamation in the 1980 s. Our objectives were to investigate the effects of land <b>use</b> <b>types</b> under different soil management practices on soil fertility, organic carbon pools, and the microbial community at this site. Three land <b>use</b> <b>types</b> were investigated: original land without farming, farmland with residue return, and a vegetable greenhouse with farmyard manure amendment. The carbon stocks were calculated according to the equivalent soil mass method, and microbial community structure was determined by phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Over 30 years, the current concentrations of alkali-hydrolysis nitrogen, available potassium (AK), and available phosphorus increased in the three land <b>use</b> <b>types,</b> except for the AK concentration in farmland, which decreased due to the lack of potassium fertilizer input. The nutrients in the greenhouse were significantly higher than those in the original land and farmland. The carbon stocks in the original land, farmland, and greenhouse were increased by 103 %, 179 %, and 660 %, respectively. Both land <b>use</b> <b>types</b> and seasons influenced particulate organic carbon, chemical-labile organic carbon, and microbial biomass carbon. The microbial community structures were distinctly different between the three land <b>use</b> <b>types.</b> Overall, the soil available nutrients and carbon stocks increased compared to their 1980 levels in the three land <b>use</b> <b>types,</b> and labile carbon pools and microbial community structure exhibited different responses in the three land <b>use</b> <b>types.</b> Compared to spontaneous development, mineral fertilization and organic amendment are more effective for recovering soil fertility in reclaimed soils...|$|R
