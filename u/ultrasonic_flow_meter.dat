40|$|Transit-time <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> {{present some}} {{advantages}} over other <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> for district heating industries. They are both accurate and non-intrusive. It is well-known that <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> {{are sensitive to}} installation effects. Installation effects could be static or dynamic. Among the possible dynamic installation effects is pulsating flow. The influence of pulsating flow on the prediction and the zero-crossing operations is investigated. Expressions are found for the prediction error and the zero-crossing error. The relative errors due to the prediction and the zero-crossing are plotted.

50|$|A common {{ultrasound}} {{application is}} an automatic door opener, where an ultrasonic sensor detects a person's approach {{and opens the}} door.

50|$|One {{advantage}} of ultrasonic flow meters {{is that they}} can effectively measure the flow rates {{for a wide variety of}} fluids, as long as the speed of sound through that fluid is known. For example, ultrasonic flow meters are used for the measurement of such diverse fluids as liquid natural gas (LNG) and blood. One can also calculate the expected speed of sound for a given fluid; this can be compared to the speed of sound empirically measured by an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> for the purposes of monitoring the quality of the flow meter's measurements. A drop in quality (change in the measured speed of sound) is an indication that the meter needs servicing.|$|E
50|$|An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> {{is a type}} of {{flow meter}} that {{measures}} the velocity of a fluid with ultrasound to calculate volume flow. Using ultrasonic transducers, the flow meter can measure the average velocity along the path of an emitted beam of ultrasound, by averaging the difference in measured transit time between the pulses of ultrasound propagating into and against the direction of the flow or by measuring the frequency shift from the Doppler effect. Ultrasonic flow meters are affected by the acoustic properties of the fluid and can be impacted by temperature, density, viscosity and suspended particulates depending on the exact flow meter. They vary greatly in purchase price but are often inexpensive to use and maintain because they do not use moving parts, unlike mechanical flow meters.|$|E

40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} processes rely on accurate <b>flow</b> <b>metering,</b> and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are well established in this area. Most <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> use piezoelectric transducers {{which are not}} very efficient at generating ultrasound in gases, and tend to be highly resonant which then limits their application. Capacitive ultrasonic transducers are an alternative device technology that can generate and detect ultrasound very efficiently in air and other gases, and produce transducers that are inherently broadband, meaning that additional frequency information may then be utilised. Of critical importance is the meter correction factor k, which correlates the ultrasonically measured flow rate with the actual flow rate in the <b>metering</b> section. Most <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> require at least 15 diameters of straight pipe upstream and 5 diameters downstream, to allow the flow profile to become fully developed before it enters the metering section. This means that on-site calibration is usually a necessity.

40|$|In {{the arid}} west, water {{is among the}} most {{valuable}} of resources. Typically, in order to successfully and accurately measure a flow rate using most types of flow meters, it is recommended that a straight section of pipe be installed immediately upstream from the flow meter to avoid distorted flow patterns and extreme turbulence at the metering location. In many field piping situations, however, such flow conditions are impossible to achieve. The performance of ultrasonic flow meters in non-ideal piping scenarios was studied using laboratory experiments and numerical Computational Fluid Dynamics models. A Fuji PortaflowX clamp-on transit-time <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> was calibrated in the laboratory and performed well within the manufacturer’s stated level of accuracy of ± 1 % for straight pipe. The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> was also used downstream of a single 12 -inch long-radius elbow and the error in flow measurement resulting from the flow disturbance was measured. These tests were performed at four locations downstream of the elbow, at three orientations on the circumference of the pipe, and for three flow rates with Reynolds numbers ranging from 250, 000 to 750, 000. Using the same physical conditions, numerical models were built that utilized the realizable k-ε eddy viscosity model for turbulent flows. The resulting downstream velocity profiles from the numerical models were used to integrate the velocity of the flow across the ultrasonic signal path. The resulting velocity profiles were compared to similar profiles for fully developed flow to determine the error in flow measurement. The <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> measurement errors downstream of the elbow were always negative, and were found to be as great as - 16 %. In general, the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> performed less accurately closer to the elbow due to the turbulent fluctuations and flow separation created by the elbow. A correction curve was applied to the results of this study, which provided a method to correct the ultrasonic flow measurement. By applying the correction equation to the laboratory <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> measurements downstream of the elbow, the measurement error was reduced by nearly 90 %.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} that the small micro-controller present in <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> can detect error inducing flow pulsations.

The application targets the district heating industry where the use of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> is growing more and more common as they are accurate, non-intrusive and low cost.

40|$|Abstract—A {{new method}} to {{estimate}} the flow profile correction factor (FPCF) for a transit-time <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> (UFM) having a diametral transducer configuration is introduced in this work. For the adaptation of a diametral UFM for a feedwater measurement, the optimized flow profile correction factor is obtained through experiments and a simulation in actual flow con-ditions. The log function curve fitting is performed on a combined data set; the velocity ratio of UFM reading versus standard fluid measurement at low flow velocity, UFM reading versus standard fluid measurement at medium flow velocity, and UFM reading versus clean Venturi measurement at high flow velocity. Through an uncertainty analysis, {{the uncertainty of the}} FPCF is calculated. The resultant uncertainty of the new FPCF is 0. 335 %. This value is approximately half the value presented by UFM manufacturers. By adaptation of a diametral UFM with the new FPCF proposed in this work, feedwater flow measurement in nuclear power plants (NPPs) can be easily performed at lower cost than either chordal or cross-correlation UFM.

The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> tested were all <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> of sing-around type. The selection of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> contains in total seven meters of three different brands. All <b>meters</b> have a <b>flow</b> range from 0. 015 m 3 /h to 1. 5 m 3 /h. These meters are commonly used in heat meters in small district heating subscriber stations. The <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> are presented without identification. All tests were performed in a <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> calibration facility and in a flow range including the minimum and maximum flow of each <b>flow</b> <b>meter.</b> In the tests three different water tempera-tures and three different installations were investigated. Water temperatures of 20 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C were used. These temperatures are representative for district heating applications. The installations tested involved <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> mounted with long straight pipes both up-and down-stream representing ideal conditions, a single elbow and a double elbow out of plane both generating disturbed flow profiles. All set-ups are in accordance with the <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> specifications. The results demonstrate that both the change in temperature and the disturbed flow profiles introduce errors in the flow measurements. The change from 20 °C to 50 °C and 70 °C can cause a shift in meter performance larger than the specified maximum permissible error. Compared with the ideal installation the installations generating disturbed flow profiles cause errors up to more than 2 %. The errors due to temperature and installation effects have a bias to add when combined. This might lead to even larger errors.
