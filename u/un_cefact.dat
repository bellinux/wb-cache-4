50|$|The EDIFACT {{organisation}} {{was initially}} based on separate, autonomous regions around the globe, i.e. Western Europe, the Americas and Australasia, with Eastern Europe being a non-voting participant. Each approval and amendment {{had to be}} accepted by the three regional communities, each officially represented by a distinct rapporteur. Frequent disputes had to be discussed and sorted out during the semi-annual meetings called JRT (Joint Rapporteur Team) meetings. With the advent of email the EDIFACT organisation was centralised, especially the technical assessment working group, and the regional rapporteurs’ role was eventually reduced to nothing. Over time the EDIFACT organization was constituted by UNECE under its current name <b>UN</b> <b>CEFACT</b> TBG5.|$|E

40|$|Trade {{facilitation}} concerns {{itself with}} the operational quality of the international trade environment; and {{has its roots in}} the frustrations experienced by businesses when moving goods across borders – especially with regard to inefficient border management practices and trade and customs procedures. On 7 December 2013 the WTO reached an agreement on trade facilitation. Now, with trade facilitation at the very heart of contemporary trade policy, trade diplomats are faced with the challenge of having to reach a view about the quality of trade facilitation in any given country. Subsequently, as this paper argues, dedicated institutional mechanism involving the private sector – for example, within the spirit of <b>UN</b> <b>CEFACT</b> Recommendation 4 – need to be developed. Although consultation with the private sector is not without its challenges, they would help ensure that the resources invested into trade facilitation are put to best use, and that the quality of implemented trade facilitation measures are continuously monitored and assessed...|$|E
