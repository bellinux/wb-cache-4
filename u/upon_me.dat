5|$|There {{came to me}} Bowes, by whom I do {{understand}} that my wife is dead and as he sayeth by a fall {{from a pair of}} stairs. Little other understanding can I have of him. The greatness and the suddenness of the misfortune doth so perplex me, until I do hear from you how the matter standeth, or how this evil should light <b>upon</b> <b>me,</b> considering what the malicious world will bruit, as I can take no rest.|$|E
5|$|My lords, the law {{of nature}} moves me to sorrow for my sister; the burden that is fallen <b>upon</b> <b>me</b> makes me amazed, and yet, {{considering}} I am God's creature, ordained to obey His appointment, I will thereto yield, desiring {{from the bottom of}} my heart that I may have assistance of His grace to be the minister of His heavenly will in this office now committed to me. And as I am but one body naturally considered, though by His permission a body politic to govern, so shall I desire you all... to be assistant to me, that I with my ruling and you with your service may make a good account to Almighty God and leave some comfort to our posterity on earth. I mean to direct all my actions by good advice and counsel.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} I visited {{one of our}} Advent sisters, {{and in the morning}} we bowed around the family altar. It was not an {{exciting}} occasion, and there were but five of us present, all females. While praying, the power of God came <b>upon</b> <b>me</b> as I never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God's glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City...|$|E
25|$|I set out alone, having neither fellow-traveller {{in whose}} {{companionship}} I might find cheer, nor caravan whose part I might join, but swayed by an overmastering impulse within {{me and a}} desire long-cherished in my bosom to visit these illustrious sanctuaries. So I braced my resolution to quit my dear ones, female and male, and forsook my home as birds forsake their nests. My parents being yet in the bonds of life, it weighed sorely <b>upon</b> <b>me</b> to part from them, and both they and I were afflicted with sorrow at this separation.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} said by some that I asked for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me -- what quality of {{leadership}} would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many?

500|$|While mostly symbolic, {{the title}} of Heavenly Kaghan shows Taizong's open attitudes towards the {{existence}} of a multicultural and ethnically diverse Tang empire.

[...] The day after the arrival of Holborne, a supply caravan containing food, 2,000 muskets and 40 barrels of gunpowder restocked the town. Fearing further Royalist assaults, Holborne provided 1,000 of his own men as reinforcements for the town's defence.|$|E

But if I were playing again, I would have one wish [...] never to see earing down <b>upon</b> <b>me</b> a more fearsome picture of power than Judy Harlan blocking for Red Barron."

500|$|In September 1940 Le Mesurier's rented {{home was}} hit by a German bomb, {{destroying}} all his possessions, including his call-up papers. In the same bombing raid, the theatre in Brixton in which he was working was also hit. A few days later he reported for basic training with the Royal Armoured Corps; in June 1941 he was commissioned into the Royal Tank Regiment. He served in Britain until 1943 when he was posted to British India where he {{spent the rest of the}} war. Le Mesurier later claimed that he had had [...] "a comfortable war, with captaincy thrust <b>upon</b> <b>me,</b> before I was demobbed in 1946".|$|E

500|$|On 23 May, Barton {{attended}} an FA hearing. Punishing him {{for all three}} counts of violent conduct, Barton was handed a twelve-match ban and fined £75,000. On 25 June, QPR announced {{the results of their}} internal investigation. Barton was stripped of the captaincy and fined six weeks' wages, believed to be around £500,000. Barton was also removed from the club's pre-season tour of Asia, and in a statement the club said that they had [...] "also reached agreement with Barton that if he seriously breaches the club's disciplinary procedures again, the club reserves the right to terminate his contract". Barton responded by saying that [...] "My behaviour was wrong and I accept the punishment that has been imposed <b>upon</b> <b>me</b> as a result." ...|$|E

500|$|Vivekananda {{wanted to}} join, but was {{disappointed}} {{to learn that}} no one without credentials from a bona fide organisation would be accepted as a delegate. Vivekananda contacted Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University, who invited him to speak at Harvard. Vivekananda wrote of the professor, [...] "He urged <b>upon</b> <b>me</b> the necessity {{of going to the}} Parliament of Religions, which he thought would give an introduction to the nation". Vivekananda submitted an application, [...] "introducing himself as a monk 'of the oldest order of sannyāsis ... founded by Sankara,'" [...] supported by the Brahmo Samaj representative Protapchandra Mozoombar, who was {{also a member of the}} Parliament's selection committee, [...] "classifying the Swami as a representative of the Hindu monastic order." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{complexity}} of [...] "the common man" [...] is also explored through the oft-mentioned [...] "life of the mind". While expounding on his {{duty as a}} writer, Barton drones: [...] "I gotta tell you, {{the life of the}} mind... There's no road map for that territory... and exploring it can be painful. The kind of pain most people don't know anything about." [...] Barton assumes that he is privy to thoughtful creative considerations while Charlie is not. This delusion shares the film's climax, as Charlie runs through the hallway of the Earle, shooting the detectives with a shotgun and screaming: [...] "LOOK <b>UPON</b> <b>ME!</b> I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!" [...] Charlie's [...] "life of the mind" [...] is no less complex than Barton's; in fact, some critics consider it more so.|$|E
500|$|In the duet for soprano and alto, [...] "" [...] (When cares press <b>upon</b> <b>me),</b> in [...] "bright E major", as the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff writes, {{the voices}} are {{embedded}} in a [...] "dense quartet texture". He concludes that the movement [...] "banishes human care by means of joyful singing". The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann notes that the obbligato motif, which is later {{picked up by the}} voices, is played by the oboes d'amore and violin in unison, providing [...] "a new and remarkable tone colour". Bach refers to the Cross, as mentioned in the text, by using a cross-motif in the melody and applying double sharp marked by a cross. The voices intensify words such as [...] "dringen" [...] (press) and [...] "singen" [...] (sing) by extended coloraturas.|$|E
