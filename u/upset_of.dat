5|$|Duquesne {{hoped to}} build on the success of the 2008–09 season and began the new year with five {{straight}} victories. Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, the Giants {{were unable}} to build on their {{successful}} 1997 season, and needed a four-game winning streak to close out the season at 8–8. The Giants strength was their defense, which featured two Pro Bowlers in Armstead and Strahan. However, the offense {{continued to be a}} disappointment. Brown had been jettisoned and replaced by Kanell and Kent Graham. Neither quarterback provided Pro Bowl caliber play, although Graham led the Giants to a 5–1 finish (including an <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> the then-undefeated Denver Broncos in Week 15).|$|E
5|$|The Ring named Baldomir's {{victory over}} Judah the <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> {{the year for}} 2006.

Baldomir did win the lineal, WBC and The Ring titles, while the WBA (Super) title was vacated after Judah's loss (WBA (Regular) titleholder Luis Collazo became the sole WBA Champion), but the IBF still {{recognized}} him as their champion.|$|E

Gailey's first team in 2002 managed to win seven games under the quarterbacking of A.J. Suggs. The most notable {{game of the}} 2002 season was an <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> National Title Contender North Carolina State. Georgia Tech rallied {{in the fourth quarter}} to upset NC State and end Philip Rivers's Heisman Trophy hopes. In 2003, eleven Georgia Tech players were found academically ineligible. Despite the academic losses and the playing of true freshman Reggie Ball, Gailey would lead Tech to a seven-win season and humiliation of Tulsa in the Humanitarian Bowl. P.J. Daniels racked up over 300 yards rushing in the effort.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{would remain}} with the Blues until 1995. The 1992–93 NHL season was his most {{successful}} season as he {{played a key role}} in the <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> the Chicago Blackhawks, the reigning Clarence Campbell Conference regular season champions, sweeping them in four games in the first round of the playoffs. The Blues then faced the Toronto Maple Leafs in the second round and thanks to Joseph the series went to seven games. The Leafs eventually prevailed. Because of his efforts, he was nominated as a finalist for the Vezina Trophy that season, finishing third in voting behind winner Ed Belfour and Tom Barrasso.|$|E

Geneva College fans generally consider McMillin among the best coaches in school history. His teams, renowned for playing some of the best teams in college football, prided themselves on a challenging schedule. Geneva opened the 1926 season with a 16–7 <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> Harvard.|$|E

His averages increased as well, to 15.2points per game, a team high, and 4.2rebounds per game, while also being the only Temple player to start all 34games. On December9,2010, Moore scored a season-high 30 points in a 68–65 <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> Georgetown. He shot 12-for-18 in the game, which was coach Fran Dunphy's 400th career victory. During the season, Moore scored in double-digits in 15straight games.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2001 season, Aidoo broke his leg while filming Brian's Song. Although {{initially}} expected to heal in time for training camp, Aidoo's recovery was slower than expected, and he missed the first two games of the season with a broken right fibula. Aidoo returned to the Marauders in mid-September. In his first game back, Aidoo scored two touchdowns and broke the OUA conference record for career touchdowns with 35 total majors. He played a large role in a 27–15 <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> first-ranked Ottawa, scoring two of three touchdowns in the final five minutes of the game. Due to recurring issues with his healing leg, Aidoo missed multiple games in October but returned for the playoffs.|$|E
5|$|Temple Owls {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 26–8 record. Among the highlights of the year was an <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> #10 Georgetown on December 9, in coach Fran Dunphy's 400th victory.

Allen snatched 12 boards to pass Temple Owls' radio analyst Johnny Baum's 1,042 career rebounds. The Owls' 14–2 mark in Atlantic 10 play earned them a two seed in the 2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament, where they lost in the semifinals to Richmond.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe gained {{nationwide}} {{attention for}} the first time in 1911. As a running back, defensive back, placekicker and punter, Thorpe scored all his team's points—four field goals and a touchdown—in an 18–15 <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> Harvard, a top ranked team in those early days of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). His team finished the season 11–1. In 1912 Carlisle won the national collegiate championship largely as a result of his efforts – he scored 25 touchdowns and 198points during the season, according to CNN's Greg Botelho. Steve Boda, a researcher for the NCAA, credits Thorpe with 27 touchdowns and 224 points. Thorpe rushed 191 times for 1,869 yards, according to Boda; the figures do not include statistics from 2 of Carlisle's 14 games in 1912 because full records are not available.|$|E
5|$|Although young, Kennedy was {{successful}} with Toronto from the start. In his first season, the 18-year-old finished {{second on the}} team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto's <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> the record-breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45. He established himself {{as the leader of}} the team and became captain in 1948. Although not the best skater in the league, Kennedy was a fierce forechecker and skilled playmaker. Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's emphasis on defense and positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal. A Sports Illustrated poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as having the best face-off skills in the history of the NHL.|$|E
5|$|During the 2011 preseason, the Giants lost {{tight end}} Kevin Boss, wide {{receiver}} Steve Smith, guard Rich Seubert, linebacker Keith Bulluck, wide receiver Derek Hagan, and Pro Bowl center Shaun O'Hara to free agency. However, the 2011 season {{also saw the}} emerging of second-year wide receiver Victor Cruz and second-year tight end Jake Ballard. The Giants opened the season against the Washington Redskins on the 10th anniversary of the September 11th attacks, with both New York City and Washington being a target of the attacks. The Redskins beat the Giants 28–14, but the Giants won their next three games, against the Rams, Eagles, and Cardinals. After a loss against the Seattle Seahawks, they went on another three-game winning streak. A key victory was an <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> the New England Patriots 24–20 at Gillette Stadium. The victory ended the Patriots' NFL record home-game winning streak, after a touchdown pass from Manning to Ballard with 15 seconds left. However, the Giants lost their next three games, before regaining their position atop the NFC East with a tightly contested 37–34 win over the Dallas Cowboys on December 11. After splitting their next two games against the Redskins and New York Jets, a victory over the Cowboys in the last game {{of the regular season}} clinched a postseason appearance for the Giants.|$|E

5|$|Led by {{a strong}} {{performance}} from Aidoo, the Marauders had their most successful season in 2000. In the season opener against the tenth-ranked Waterloo Warriors, Aidoo was afflicted by leg cramps early in the game.

By the second game of the season, Aidoo had topped his previous season's rushing yardage total with 414 yards. He went on to be named the CIAU Offensive Player Of The Week for scoring three touchdowns and rushing for 209 yards in a 47–15 <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> the third-ranked Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks. The large victory caused the Marauders to rise to third-place in the national rankings.

5|$|The game {{proved to}} be much closer than expected, and much more similar to the <b>upset</b> <b>of</b> 2007 than Michigan desired. On the opening drive, UMass drove to the Michigan 12-yard line, but was forced {{to settle for a}} 29-yard field goal. On Michigan's first possession, Denard Robinson threw an {{interception}} on the second play (and first pass) of the drive. After a defensive stop, Michigan drove 93 yards for a touchdown on a drive that featured passes of 16 yards to Martavious Odoms and 43 yards to Kelvin Grady. Michael Shaw scored the touchdown on a 1-yard run. Thirty-five seconds into the second quarter, UMass retook the lead on a 7-yard touchdown run by Jonathan Hernandez, capping a 67-yard scoring drive. Midway through the second quarter, Michigan drove 64 yards (including 40 rushing yards by Robinson), but Seth Broekhuizen missed a 38-yard field goal attempt. In the closing minutes of the first half, UMass drove 79 yards, capped by the second touchdown run by Hernandez. UMass led 17–7 with 1:17 remaining in the half, but Michigan stormed back in the final 61 seconds of the half. On Michigan's first play from scrimmage after the UMass touchdown, Robinson threw a 66-yard touchdown pass to Darryl Stonum with 1:01 left in the half. On the second play from scrimmage after the kickoff, Jordan Kovacs forced a fumble by Hernandez, and Michigan recovered the ball at their own 45-yard line. Michigan quickly drove 55 yards and scored on a 9-yard touchdown pass from Robinson to Stonum with 16 seconds left in the half. Michigan led 21–17 at halftime on the strength of 259 yards (195 passing yards and 64 rushing yards) of total offense from Denard Robinson.|$|E
