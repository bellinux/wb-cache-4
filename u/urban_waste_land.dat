But due to the spread of city space, a large number of industrial enterprises and produce a large amount of waste railways in the city. Although these railway had made great contributions to the development of city and it is regarded {{as an integral part of}} the city history. But after being abandoned, it not only caused some trouble to the traffic in the city, but also to looks like a waste the land. Weeds growing all around, lack of regulation, abandoned railways have been gradually transformed into a negative space of the city. The urban environmental quality may be affected and many social problems may came out with these railways. How to make the abandoned railway be regenerated, exert its potential value is currently in the planning and construction of many cities is a question that worth to be considered. This paper describes about how to re-establish a new community in an abandoned railway station area without making too much changes. The procedure the present study followed can be briefly described as based on the site research and background analysis to find out a suitable solution to deal with all the problems happening or going to be happen after the railway is abandoned. The author wants to focus on helping these abandoned railways to get a new circulation and get along well with the surrounding topography and social environment. The target of my study is to find out the solution for the social and environmental problems brought by the in industrial decline and urban expansion. Abandoned railway as a corridor to formation and development of city space pattern, is playing a very important role in guide and links. By looking back to the existing condition and over all context and research on the urban historic space and layout of the existing condition, find the characteristics of railway corridor space and its impact on the environment.

In a context of population growth and of long-term environmental changes, the development of a high-frequency monitoring programme of the fluvial-estuarine system of the Gironde, called MAGEST (MArel Gironde ESTuary), had appeared essential to address current and future water-quality issues/evaluations. The objectives of the MAGEST survey program are to establish a reference database to improve the knowledge of the Gironde Estuary functioning, encompassing the aspects of hydrology, sediment dynamics and biogeochemistry. Through examples of results from intratidal to seasonal time scales, we demonstrate how such a long-term, high-frequency monitoring of a fluvio-estuarine system is of valuable interest to extract the main trends of its functioning and of the water quality in relation to external forcings (climatology, <b>urban</b> <b>wastes,</b> <b>land</b> use, [...] .) and to predict the future evolution of an estuary with global and environmental changes...|$|R
