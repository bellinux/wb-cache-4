He walked to the synagogues at times of service, he looked into shops, he observed faces:--a process not very promising of particular discovery. Why did he not address himself to an influential Rabbi or other member of a Jewish community, to consult on the chances of finding a mother named Cohen, with a son named Ezra, and a lost daughter named Mirah? He thought of doing so--after Christmas. The fact was, notwithstanding all his sense of poetry in common things, Deronda, where a keen personal interest was aroused, could not, more {{than the rest of}} us, continuously escape suffering from the pressure of that hard unaccommodating Actual, which has never consulted our taste and is entirely <b>unselect.</b> Enthusiasm, we know, dwells at ease among ideas, tolerates garlic breathed in the middle ages, and sees no shabbiness in the official trappings of classic processions: it gets squeamish when ideals press upon it as something warmly incarnate, and can hardly face them without fainting. Lying dreamily in a boat, imagining one's self in quest of a beautiful maiden's relatives in Cordova elbowed by Jews in the time of Ibn-Gebirol, all the physical incidents can be borne without shock. Or if the scenery of St. Mary Axe and Whitechapel were imaginatively transported to the borders of the Rhine {{at the end of the}} eleventh century, when in the ears listening for the signals of the Messiah, the Hep! Hep! Hep! of the Crusaders came like the bay of blood-hounds; and in the presence of those devilish missionaries with sword and firebrand the crouching figure of the reviled Jew turned round erect, heroic, flashing with sublime constancy in the face of torture and death--what would the dingy shops and unbeautiful faces signify to the thrill of contemplative emotion? But the fervor of sympathy with which we contemplate a grandiose martyrdom is feeble compared with the enthusiasm that keeps unslacked where there is no danger, no challenge--nothing but impartial midday falling on commonplace, perhaps half-repulsive, objects which are really the beloved ideas made flesh. Here undoubtedly lies the chief poetic energy:--in the force of imagination that pierces or exalts the solid fact, instead of floating among cloud-pictures. To glory in a prophetic vision of knowledge covering the earth, is an easier exercise of believing imagination than to see its beginning in newspaper placards, staring at you from the bridge beyond the corn-fields; and it might well happen to most of us dainty people that we were in the thick of the battle of Armageddon without being aware of anything more than the annoyance of a little explosive smoke and struggling on the ground immediately about us.|$|E

5000|$|Consoles {{serve as}} a human {{interface}} and connect to push-to-talk dispatch radio systems. Audio from all channels is processed through audio level compression circuits and is routed to two separate speakers identified as select and <b>unselect.</b> Each has a volume control. The select channel or channels carry the highest priority communications. To prevent missed messages on critical channels, the select volume may be configured so it cannot be set to an inaudible level. <b>Unselect</b> channels {{may be used for}} special events, other agencies, or purposes that do not involve dispatch and may be inaudible. By pressing a button, any channel on the console can be toggled between select and <b>unselect</b> status. Each channel has an independent push-to-talk button, allowing the dispatcher to talk over one channel at a time. For broadcast messages, a single button transmits over all selected channels at the same time. A digital clock and an LED bar-graph or VU meter are included.|$|E

Using the tab key, a player can look inside Laura's backpack and select or <b>unselect</b> items. Using the space bar, Laura can select items that she will need to use in her adventures; these items can be used, given or shown to people in different circumstances.

We report 4 <b>unselect</b> cases of {{small intestine}} diverticulitis; all patients were {{seen by the}} same physician at the Emergency Center at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1999 and 2014. The median age at diagnosis of these patients was 82 years (range, 76 – 87 years). All 4 patients presented with acute onset of abdominal pain, and computed tomography scans showed characteristics of small intestine diverticulitis unrelated to cancer. Most of the diverticula {{were found in the}} region of the duodenum and jejuno-ileal segments of the small intestine. The patients, even those with peripancreatic inflammation and localized perforation, were treated conservatively. Non-Meckel diverticulitis can be overlooked in the initial diagnosis because of the location of the diverticulosis, the age of the patient, and the rarity of the disease. Because patients with non-Meckel small intestine diverticulitis can present with acute abdominal pain, non-Meckel small intestine diverticulitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with acute abdominal pain, and computed tomography scans can help identify the condition. Because of the rarity of non-Meckel small intestine diverticulitis, few studies have been published, and the data are inconclusive about how best to approach these patients. Our experience with these 4 elderly patients indicates that non-Meckel small intestine diverticulitis can be treated conservatively, which avoids the potential morbidity and mortality of a surgical approach...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveInformation {{overload}} is {{a significant}} problem facing online clinical trial searchers. We present eTACTS, a novel interactive retrieval framework using common eligibility tags to dynamically filter clinical trial search results. Materials and methodseTACTS mines frequent eligibility tags from free-text clinical trial eligibility criteria and uses these tags for trial indexing. After an initial search, eTACTS presents to the user a tag cloud representing the current results. When the user selects a tag, eTACTS retains only those trials containing that tag in their eligibility criteria and generates a new cloud based on tag frequency and co-occurrences in the remaining trials. The user can then select a new tag or <b>unselect</b> a previous tag. The process iterates until a manageable number of trials is returned. We evaluated eTACTS in terms of filtering efficiency, diversity of the search results, and user eligibility to the filtered trials using both qualitative and quantitative methods. ResultseTACTS (1) rapidly reduced search results from over a thousand trials to ten; (2) highlighted trials that are generally not top-ranked by conventional search engines; and (3) retrieved {{a greater number of}} suitable trials than existing search engines. DiscussioneTACTS enables intuitive clinical trial searches by indexing eligibility criteria with effective tags. User evaluation was limited to one case study and a small group of evaluators due to the long duration of the experiment. Although a larger-scale evaluation could be conducted, this feasibility study demonstrated significant advantages of eTACTS over existing clinical trial search engines. ConclusionA dynamic eligibility tag cloud can potentially enhance state-of-the-art clinical trial search engines by allowing intuitive and efficient filtering of the search result space...|$|E

In all cases, growth of tolerant callus, {{measured on a}} fresh weight or dry weight basis, was {{greater than that of}} <b>unselected</b> callus, which was also subject to necrosis on high levels of salt. Tissue water potential became more negative in both <b>unselected</b> and tolerant callus grown in the presence of mannitol or Na 2 SO 4. Water potentials in <b>unselected</b> callus were more negative than those of the tolerant tissues; but over a range of Na 2 SO 4 concentrations both cultures displayed osmotic adjustment, maintaining relatively constant turgor. Proline accumulation in both <b>unselected</b> and tolerant callus was low (15 to 20 micromoles per gram dry weight) in the absence of stress, but increased on media supplemented with mannitol, NaCl, or Na 2 SO 4. Increases in proline concentration were approximately linear in tolerant callus, reaching a maximum of 130 to 175 micromoles per gram dry weight. In <b>unselected</b> callus, concentrations were higher, reaching 390 to 520 micromoles per gram dry weight. Proline accumulation was correlated with inhibition of growth, and there was a negative correlation between proline concentration and culture age for tolerant callus...|$|R

At each iteration i, the interference from the <b>unselected</b> streams to the selected stream is reduced by projecting the channel matrices H_kk^ orthogonally to the VRC and the interference to the <b>unselected</b> streams from the selected stream is reduced by projecting the channel matrices H_kk^ orthogonally to the VTC. The reason for projecting all VTCs and VRCs of the <b>unselected</b> streams can be explained as follows. At the beginning, all streams are available for the selection. When a stream is selected, all channels of the <b>unselected</b> streams are orthogonally projected to both VTC and VRC of the selected stream. In this way, when another stream is to be selected, its channel is guaranteed to become orthogonal to the channels of the previously selected streams and, thus, it does not generate any interference to them.|$|R
40|$|Feature {{selection}} {{has been}} studied in machine learning and data mining for many years, and is a valuable way to improve classification accuracy while reducing model complexity. Two main classes of feature selection methods - filter and wrapper - discard those features which are not selected, and do not consider them in the predictive model. We propose that these <b>unselected</b> features may instead {{be used as an}} additional source of information at train time. We describe a strategy called Learning using <b>Unselected</b> Features (LUFe) that allows selected and <b>unselected</b> features to serve different functions in classification. In this framework, selected features are used directly to set the decision boundary, and <b>unselected</b> features are utilised in a secondary role, with no additional cost at test time. Our empirical results on 49 textual datasets show that LUFe can improve classification performance in comparison with standard wrapper and filter feature selection...|$|R
