5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that <b>unscrewing</b> the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E
500|$|Early {{into the}} game, the player learns a new ability {{known as the}} [...] "Spin" [...] technique, which has had {{appearances}} in varying forms throughout the Super Mario franchise. In Super Mario Galaxy, the [...] "spin" [...] is primarily used for melee attacks, as it can stun enemies and shatter objects, and is used to trigger special propellers called [...] "Sling Stars" [...] or [...] "Launch Stars" [...] that launch Mario across large distances through space. The [...] "spin" [...] utility is also used for climbing vines, ice skating, <b>unscrewing</b> bolts, and for activating several power-ups. Other Wii Remote functions are available for smaller quests, such as surfing aboard a manta ray or balancing atop a large ball and rolling it through an obstacle course.|$|E
2500|$|Left-side-drive is {{sometimes}} {{done with a}} fixed gear drivetrain. [...] Because the lock ring prevents the sprocket from <b>unscrewing,</b> {{it can be used}} for left-side drive without requiring special left hand threaded parts.|$|E
5000|$|Second base: Each {{team has}} to <b>unscrew</b> a contraption — in a [...] "sexually suggestive" [...] manner; the male partner is {{positioned}} {{in front of}} and has to <b>unscrew</b> a pair of baseballs, while the female partner is positioned in front of and has to <b>unscrew</b> a baseball bat, and place the parts in a box at the finish line. The three last-place teams (out of nine) are out.|$|R

2500|$|The M3A1 {{modifications}} {{resulted in}} a more reliable, lighter weight, easier to maintain, and easier to field strip submachine gun; the original M3 needed both the trigger guard removed and the cocking crank assembly detached from the receiver housing before <b>unscrewing</b> the barrel, but the M3A1 only required the user unscrew the barrel. [...] To date, only one 9mm conversion kit for the M3A1 has been discovered.|$|E
2500|$|Hand grenades {{were mostly}} of Communist Chinese manufacture. These were stick grenades, with a wood handle {{at the bottom}} of which was a screw cap whereupon <b>unscrewing</b> out fell (if holding right) a porcelain-bead with a thread attached. [...] Pull this and in an unknown time (for these were badly stored and old weapons) it might explode. [...] Despite this there were {{numerous}} troops wounded by this weapon. RPG-2's and RPG-7's were prevalent, sometimes one or two to a section of ten men, though hardly ever used against Fireforce (there was usually only one present and the difficulties of targeting the helicopters was extreme).|$|E
2500|$|Screw extractors are {{essentially}} left-hand bits of specialized shape, used to remove common right-hand screws whose heads are broken or too damaged {{to allow a}} screwdriver tip to engage, making use of a screwdriver impossible. The extractor is pressed against the damaged head and rotated counter-clockwise and will tend to jam in the damaged head and then turn the screw counter-clockwise, <b>unscrewing</b> it. [...] For screws that break off deeper in the hole, an extractor set will often include left handed drill bits of the appropriate diameters so that grab holes can be drilled into the screws in a left handed direction, preventing further tightening of the broken piece.|$|E

2500|$|After the RAF investigative board {{completed}} its {{report on the}} Halifax crash on 1 July 1942, it was distributed to a restricted list of approved recipients, but not publicly divulged. In the interests of wartime secrecy, the announcement of Blumlein's death was not made for another three years. The investigative board, headed by AIB Chief Inspector Vernon Brown – who later also investigated the post-war Star Tiger and Star Ariel disappearances – and assisted by Rolls-Royce, {{who had made the}} Halifax's Merlin engines, found that the crash was caused by engine fire, attributed to the <b>unscrewing</b> of a tappet nut on the starboard outer engine, which had been improperly tightened by an RAF engine fitter while inspecting the engine some three hours prior to the crash.|$|E

60|$|In London {{that night}} poor Henderson's {{telegram}} describing the gradual <b>unscrewing</b> {{of the shot}} was judged to be a canard, and his evening paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no reply--the man was killed--decided not to print a special edition.|$|E

60|$|By way of answer I went on <b>unscrewing.</b> I {{lifted the}} {{circular}} operculum from its place {{and laid it}} carefully on the bale.

Beneath, within a yard of my face, lay the untrodden snow of the moon.|$|E
50|$|A side-effect is {{that the}} quick release, which was {{developed}} to allow the wheel to be removed without having to <b>unscrew</b> any components, no longer works as designed: the skewer must be <b>unscrewed</b> in order to remove the wheel (although tools do remain unnecessary). This means that the tension on refitting must be adjusted again. Some cyclists file off the lawyer tabs so the quick release works as originally intended.|$|R

The Three-Course Nuts are not all exactly alike in flavor or in contents, but they are all good and in each one may be found a complete three-course dinner." ...|$|R
