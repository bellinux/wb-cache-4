This {{building has}} a number of recital halls and a large number of practice rooms, most with <b>upright</b> <b>pianos.</b> The practice rooms are locked and cannot be used by students who are not music majors or in an official UD ensemble. The university employs a tiered access system, with larger rooms and rooms with grand pianos being reserved for certain groups of students. In addition the music department also uses their old building, with offices, classrooms, practice rooms, and recital halls. This building has public-access practice rooms with pianos.|$|E

500|$|In 1974, the Grotrian-Steinweg family {{built a new}} {{factory in}} {{northwest}} Braunschweig on Grotrian-Steinweg Street, very near Bundesautobahn 2, a major east–west highway. After Helmut and Erwin Grotrian-Steinweg supervised the construction they retired, leaving Helmut's son Knut in charge. This factory is the current location of Grotrian-Steinweg production. In 1999, Knut Grotrian-Steinweg stepped down from active supervision of the company, and put day-to-day control {{in the hands of}} Burkhard Stein, an industrial manager and piano builder. As of 2012, the Grotrian-Steinweg company is owned by the daughters of Erwin Grotrian, with sixth-generation Jobst Grotrian (b. 1969), Knut's son, a shareholder. Annually, the company produces about 500 <b>upright</b> <b>pianos</b> in six sizes and 100 grand pianos in five sizes. Some 20 concert grands are made per year—each one requiring 8 months of manufacture. In 2010, the company issued a special 175-year anniversary model, a [...] upright called Composé Exclusif, of which 50 were produced.|$|E

2500|$|One {{theory is}} that the [...] "tonk" [...] portion of the name may have come from the brand name of piano made by William Tonk & Bros., an American {{manufacturer}} of large <b>upright</b> <b>pianos</b> (established 1881), which made a piano with the decal [...] "Ernest A. Tonk". The Tonk brothers, William and Max, established the Tonk Bros. Manufacturing Company in 1873, so such an etymology is possible, however these pianos were not manufactured until 1889, contemporaneous with the first occurrences of honky-tonk in print, at which point the term seems to have already been established.|$|E
2500|$|A humorous story, as told by Tom Greer, was the {{engagement}} a piano player (the outrageous John McDonald) {{to entertain the}} cast on the train {{on the way to}} Melbourne. John could only play <b>upright</b> <b>pianos.</b> The railways rang and said they could not get the upright around the passageway corners of the train so {{it would be impossible to}} get it on board. Tom Greer demanded it be put on the train somehow even if it meant dismantling the piano and putting it back together - [...] "key by key". In desperation, engineers arrived and took off the side of the carriage, loaded the piano on with a forklift, before replacing the carriage wall. The train was christened Spirit of 96.|$|E
6000|$|If {{one looked}} {{steadily}} at the pretty sight, it lost reality as things do when too closely scrutinized, {{and became a}} visionary confluence of lines and colors, a soft stir of bloom like a flowery expanse moved by the air. This ecstatic effect was not exclusive of facts which kept one's feet well on the earth, or {{on the roof of}} one's college barge. Out of that [...] "giddy pleasure of the eyes" [...] business lifted a practical front from time to time, and extended a kind of butterfly net {{at the end of a}} pole so long that it would reach anywhere, and collected pennies for the people in boats who had been singing or playing banjos or guitars or even <b>upright</b> <b>pianos.</b> For, it must be explained, there were many in that aquatic crowd who were there to be heard as well as seen, and this gave the affair its pathos. Not that negro minstrelsy as the English have interpreted the sole American contribution to histrionic art, is in itself pathetic, except as it is so lamentably far from the original; but that any obvious labor which adds to our gayety is sorrowful; and there were many different artists there who were working hard. Sometimes it was the man who sang and the woman who played; but it was always the woman who took up the collection: she seemed to have the greater enterprise and perseverance. Of course in the case of the blackened minstrels, some man appealed to the love of humor rather than the love of beauty for the bounty of the spectators. In the case of an old-time plantation darkey who sang the familiar melodies with the slurring vowels and wandering aspirates of East London, and then lifted a face one-half blackened, the appeal to the love of humor was more effective than the other could have been. A company of young men in masks with a piano in their boat, which one played while another led the singing in an amazing falsetto, were peculiarly successful in collecting their reward, and were all the more amusingly eager because they were, as our English friends believed, undergraduates on a lark.|$|E

50|$|<b>Upright</b> <b>pianos,</b> {{also called}} {{vertical}} pianos, are more compact because {{the frame and}} strings are vertical. <b>Upright</b> <b>pianos</b> are generally less expensive than grand pianos. <b>Upright</b> <b>pianos</b> are widely used in churches, community centers, schools, music conservatories and university music programs as rehearsal and practice instruments, and they are popular models for in-home purchase. The hammers move horizontally, and return to their resting position via springs, which are susceptible to degradation. <b>Upright</b> <b>pianos</b> with unusually tall frames and long strings are sometimes called upright grand pianos. Some authors classify modern pianos according to their height and to modifications of the action {{that are necessary to}} accommodate the height.|$|E
