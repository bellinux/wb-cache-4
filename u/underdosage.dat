The requirement for each plan was that 99 % of the target volume received 95 % of the prescribed dose. Tumor displacements from - 2. 0 cm to 2. 0 cm in each dimension were simulated, using 0. 5 cm increments, resulting in 729 simulations per patient. We assumed that on-line correction for the tumor was applied perfectly.

In addition the margin needed to avoid <b>underdosage</b> was determined and the probability that an <b>underdosage</b> occurs in a real treatment was calculated. Results Adjustments for tumor displacement with perfect on-line position correction resulted in an altered dose distribution. The altered fraction dose to the target varied from 91. 9 % to 100. 4 % of the prescribed dose. The mean D 99 % (± SD) was 95. 8 % ± 1. 0 %.

40|$|The {{individual}} {{leaves of}} a multileaf collimator (MLC) have a tongue-andgroove or stepped-edge design to minimize leakage radiation between adjacent leaves. This design element has a drawback that it creates areas of <b>underdosages</b> in intensity modulated photon beams unless a leaf trajectory is specifically designed such that for any two adjacent leaf pairs, the direct exposure under the tongue-and-groove {{is equal to}} the lower of the direct exposures of the leaf pairs.

40|$|Non-small cell {{lung cancer}} is {{typically}} irradiated with 60 - 66 Gy in 2 -Gy fractions. Local control {{could be improved}} by increasing dose to the more radiation-resistant areas (eg, based on the standardized uptake values of a pretreatment [(18) F]fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography scan). Such dose painting approaches, however, are poorly suited for a conventional planning target volume margin expansion; therefore, typically no margins are used. This study investigates dose deterioration of a dose painting by numbers (DPBN) approach resulting from geometrical uncertainties. For 9 DPBN plans of stage II/III {{non-small cell lung cancer}} patients, the boost dose was escalated up to 130 Gy (in 33 fractions) or until a dose-limiting constraint was reached. Then, using Monte Carlo methods, a probabilistic evaluation of dose endpoints for 99 %, 98 %, and 2 % of gross tumor volume at a 90 % confidence level was performed considering 8 different combinations of systematic (∑) and random (σ) geometric error distributions. Important <b>underdosages,</b> because of geometric uncertainties, of up to 38 Gy with minimal image guidance occur, reducing to 8 Gy with the highest level of image guidance, for a patient where a maximum dose of 119 Gy could be achieved.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For {{stereotactic}} body radiotherapy (SBRT), {{typically a}} scheme of 60 Gy in 3 - 8 fractions is applied, producing local tumour control rates around 90 %. The dose specification {{is in one}} point only and ignores possible <b>underdosages</b> {{at the edge of}} the planning target volume (PTV). We investigated the doses {{at the edge of the}} PTV and correlated this with local tumour control with the aim to shed light on the radiation dose needed to eradicate stage I NSCLC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published data on the freedom from local progression (FFLP) data from SBRT and accelerated high-dose conventional radiotherapy series for stage I NSCLC with a follow up of at least 30 months were included. The EQD(2,T) was calculated from the dose at the periphery of the PTV. RESULTS: Fifteen studies for SBRT (1076 patients) showed a median FFLP of 88. 0 ± 10. 4 % with a median EQD(2,T) of 76. 9 ± 17. 4 Gy. The median FFLP was 87. 6 ± 6. 0 % for the accelerated schedules with an EQD(2,T) of 86. 9 ± 39. 1 Gy, respectively. No significant relation was found between FFLP and the EQD(2,T) (p= 0. 23). CONCLUSIONS: Several fractionated and accelerated schedules with equal biological doses achieve the same tumour control rates as SBRT. Lower, but more uniform doses to the whole PTV may be sufficient to achieve similar control rates, with the possibility to deliver SBRT in adapted schedules, beneficial to centrally located tumours in the vicinity of critical structures like the oesophagus and great vessels. status: publishe...|$|R

The parasite was isolated and used to produce a soluble antigen for antibody-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a protocol derived from a method previously developed for sheep and humans but using protein A conjugate. The animals were treated on three instances, alternatively with melarsomine hydrochloride and quinapyramine and followed up on a monthly basis for 2 years with various diagnostic techniques including parasitological, serological and DNA-based methods. Initially, five animals were detected as being positive using ELISA with 83. 3 % concordance to parasitological tests. Immediately after the first treatment, parasites and DNA disappeared in all animals; antibody levels decreased regularly until ELISA became negative 3 - 4 months later. Ten months after the first treatment, parasites and antibodies were detected again in one of the camels previously found to be infected. A retrospective study indicated that the weight of this animal had been underestimated; consequently, it had received <b>underdosages</b> of both trypanocides.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the potential of MRI for treatment plan simulation and adaptation in ion radiotherapy using a classification-based approach. At first, a tissue classification tool was developed and applied for deriving so-called pseudo CT numbers from MR images. Suitable MR sequences and parameters were evaluated in cross-validation studies of tissue samples and of patients with tumors in the head region. Then, ion radiotherapy treatment plans were optimized by using both MRI-based pseudo CT and reference CT and dose distributions were calculated on the reference CT. Finally, a target volume shift was simulated and employing a hybrid approach, a treatment plan adapted to the shift was optimized on the basis of a so-called corrected CT. The latter consisted of a reference CT, in which a volume around the target was replaced by pseudo CT values. The derivation of pseudo CT values led to mean absolute errors in the range of 21 - 95 HU for tissue samples and 141 - 165 HU for patients. Most significant deviations appeared at transitions between different tissue types and at air cavities as well as compact bones. The former originated from partial volume effects and registration errors whereas the latter resulted from the low signal to noise ratio of bones in MR imaging. Simulations of ion radiotherapy treatment plans using pseudo CT revealed only small <b>underdosages</b> of a target volume compared to reference CT simulations.

The thesis suggests a new {{procedure for implementing}} radiochromic film {{as a tool for}} quality assurance in radiotherapy, in cooperation with the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority (NRPA). GafChromic®EBT type film has been used for the experiments. The procedure is based on the general method first suggested by Devic et al, with several modications. Films have been calibrated using the Co- 60 gammatron at the NRPA Secondary Standard Dosimetry Laboratory, and measurements have been performed on 14 treatment units at 7 different hospitals in Norway. In addition to film irradiation, reference dosimetry according to TRS- 398 protocol using an ionization chamber in a water phantom was performed at 13 of 14 linacs. Measurements show that measured doses for a 10 x 10 cm 2 field at reference conditions with an ionization chamber in a water phantom were within 2 % for all linear accelerators, for both 6 MV and 15 MV photon energies. Radiochromic film measurements were inaccurate for absolute dosimetry due to difficulties in the absolute calibration of the film. However, relative measurements using radiochromic film show that values for field size, penumbra, flatness and symmetry are close to expected clinical values. Different asymmetric field setups are also investigated using radiochromic film. In the case where two asymmetric half-collimated fields are spliced together, high over- and <b>underdosages</b> of more than 20 % are detected in the border between the fields, both with and without collimator rotation. These discrepancies are not corrected for in dose planning software. Studies of fields with overtravel collimator parameters in both x- and y-directions show that field sizes vary within 7 % of the desired values, and measured doses do not fully agree with the calculated doses in treatment planning software.

In the context of radiotherapy of lung tumors, this may affect the minimum dose received by lesions and is particularly important when prescribing dose to covering isodoses. The objective of this work is to quantify <b>underdosage</b> in key regions around a hypothetical target using Monte Carlo dose calculation methods, and to develop a factor for clinical estimation of such <b>underdosage.</b> A systematic set of calculations are undertaken using 2 Monte Carlo radiation transport codes (EGSnrc and GEANT 4). Discrepancies in dose are determined for a number of parameters, including beam energy, tumor size, field size, and distance from chest wall. Calculations were performed for 1 -mm(3) regions at proximal, distal, and lateral aspects of a spherical tumor, determined for a 6 -MV and a 15 -MV photon beam. The simulations indicate regions of tumor underdose at the tumor-lung interface. Results are presented as ratios of the dose at key peripheral regions to the dose {{at the center of the}} tumor, a point at which the treatment planning system (TPS) predicts the dose more reliably. Comparison with TPS data (pencil-beam convolution) indicates such <b>underdosage</b> would not have been predicted accurately in the clinic.

40|$|Purpose: To {{validate}} the “mid-position” approach for lung tumor motion management in helical tomotherapy with 4 D Monte Carlo planning simulation, {{in comparison with}} conventional ITV. Materials & Methods: 8 patients with stage I {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC) treated by SBRT were included, as well as 6 patients with stage II-III NSCLC treated by Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) and participating in a dose escalation protocol. Prior to treatment, a contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) and a 4 DCT (for SBRT) or a combined 4 D FDG-PET-CT (for SIB) were acquired. The GTV, CTV, and OARs were delineated on the CE-CT according to our clinical protocol. Next, 4 D data were used to generate first the ITV and then the MidP volume in its exact time-weighted mean position of the respiratory motion, using a validated Morphon non-rigid registration algorithm. The PTVs were finally drawn according to the margin formula for geometric uncertainties developed by Van Herk et al. and adapted to the specific features of lung tumor tomotherapy. For each patient, two treatments were planned based on margins derived from the ITV and MidP volume. Volumetric and dosimetric parameters, as well as conformity indexes were compared with both strategies. Moreover, dose distributions were computed using a 4 D Monte Carlo (MC) model, in order {{to assess the impact of}} intra-fraction tumor motion on tumor coverage (quantified by D 95), with and without the interplay effect. Results: For SBRT and SIB patients, the PTVs defined with the ITV approach were on average 1. 2 times larger than those derived from MidP. Consequently, the dose to all the OARs was on average lower when using the MidP. Nonetheless, the planned dose conformity to TVs was identical between both strategies (0, 92 ± 0, 03 and 0, 84 ± 0, 05 for DICE and Paddick indexes, respectively). For all SBRT patients, D 95 to the GTV computed from 4 D MC dose distributions complied within 1 % of the planning recommendations when using the ITV approach. In contrast, MidP failed to ensure adequate GTV coverage in 3 patients. For one patient, the simulated interplay effect lowered the D 95 to the GTV by 4. 35 % compared to the planned dose distribution (Fig a). Although the interplay effect did not affect the two other patients, simulated MC calculations demonstrated significant GTV <b>underdosages,</b> with D 95 to GTV reduced by 2. 16 % and 2. 61 % compared to the planned doses (Fig b). 4 D MC computations are ongoing for the SIB group. Conclusion: Compared to the ITV, the MidP strategy significantly reduced the PTV and irradiated volumes in all patients. However, if MidP could safely be applied in helical tomotherapy in most cases, it might lead to insufficient tumor coverage for very small tumors (10 mm). Those particular cases are indeed questioning the fundamental hypothesis underlying the framework of the MidP concept. As SIB treatments are usually delivered to large and centrally located tumors, MidP might allow for a safe reduction of the PTVs and irradiated tissues, although this still needs to be further confirme...|$|R
40|$|Radiotherapy aims {{to deliver}} a lethal {{radiation}} dose to cancer cells immersed in the body using a high energetic photon beam. Due to physiologic motion of the human anatomy (e. g. caused by filling of internal organs or breathing), the target volume is under permanent motion during irradiation, diluting the applied dose into regions around the target volume. Traditionally, the target volume is expanded about margins encompassing the geometric uncertainty in order to retain the target dose. As a result, however, unwanted dose to nearby organs at risk is increased significantly, which effectively limits the use of clinically promising treatment techniques such as hypo-fractionated therapies to treat cancer more effectively and economically. This thesis develops motion compensation techniques for radiotherapy using MR-imaging integrated into a novel treatment device, the MR-linac, which allows to resolve the current anatomy state during ongoing radiation with diagnostic MR-image quality. As a result the geometric uncertainty of the target positions is reduced which enables new, more effective radiotherapy paradigms. In the first chapters of this thesis, integrated MRI is employed to automatically register volumetric changes in the human anatomy. It is described how significant acceleration of this registration process {{can be achieved by}} spatially undersampling volumetric MRI-acquisitions. The calculations showed, that the MR-imaging time speed could theoretically be increased by 300 % with only minor losses in registration quality. The on-line volumetric imaging feature was subsequently used to observe the anatomic motion during simulated delivery of a novel treatment scheme for the therapy of renal cell carcinoma. Significant motion could be revealed, eventually causing target dose variations of more than 10 % and significant migration of the target dose into the adjacent organs at risk. Used on-line, new intra-fraction options, such as replanning or emergency beam stop could be implemented using the constantly refreshed calculation of dose delivered to the patient. The beam shaping unit (multileaf collimator, MLC) integrated in the MR-linac features real-time control of the geometry of the treatment beam. Potentially, optimal target conformity can be achieved by steering the beam in synchrony with the moving target. In order to assess the expected performance of such target tracking on an MR-linac, the Elekta Agility 160 MLC, was assessed using an experimental imaging pipeline. Low mechanic latencies of under 20 ms could be shown, which enables real-time MLC tracking with minimal geometric errors. In order to compensate for residual tracking errors caused by latencies of the mechanical part and software processing, a novel tracking margin generator was designed, which aimed to retain target dose coverage. In experiments, the margin generator could show significant reductions of <b>underdosages</b> caused by MLC tracking errors. Considering the remarkable scalability of the integrated imaging and beam shaping options offered by the MR-linac, a multitude of novel treatment techniques become available. As described in this thesis, rapid target tracking, dose reconstruction and combinations thereof can be implemented using theon-board MR-imaging. In order to apply the described techniques to patients, stringent quality assessment and autonomous feedback processes have to be implemented for the clinical practice...|$|R

Methods and materialsFive postoperative head and neck cancer patients, previously treated with tomotherapy at our institute, were analyzed. The planning study is based on megavoltage (MV) control images. For each patient one IMPT plan and one IMXT plan were generated on the first MV-CT and recalculated on weekly control MV-CTs in the actual treatment position. Dose criteria for evaluation were coverage and conformity of the planning target volume (PTV), as well as mean dose to parotids and maximum dose to spinal cord. ResultsConsiderable dosimetric changes were observed for IMPT and IMXT plans. Proton plans showed a more pronounced increase of maximum dose and decrease of minimum dose with local <b>underdosage</b> occurring even {{in the center of}} the PTV (worst IMPT vs. IMXT coverage: 66. 7 % vs. 85. 0 %). The doses to organs at risk (OARs) increased during the treatment period. However, the OAR doses of IMPT stayed below corresponding IMXT values at any time. For both modalities treatment plans did not necessarily worsen monotonically throughout the treatment.

With real-time control {{it is possible}} to adjust the multileaf collimator (MLC) position to the target position. However, positions are not perfectly matched and position errors arise from system delays and complicated response of the electromechanic MLC system. Although, {{it is possible to}} compensate parts of these errors by using predictors, residual errors remain and need to be compensated to retain target coverage. This work presents a method to statistically describe tracking errors and to automatically derive a patient-specific, per-segment margin to compensate the arising <b>underdosage</b> on-line, i. e. during plan delivery. The statistics of the geometric error between intended and actual machine position are derived using kernel density estimators. Subsequently a margin is calculated on-line according to a selected coverage parameter, which determines the amount of accepted <b>underdosage.</b> The margin is then applied onto the actual segment to accommodate the positioning errors in the enlarged segment. The proof-of-concept was tested in an on-line tracking experiment and showed the ability to recover underdosages for two test cases, increasing [Formula: see text] in the underdosed area about [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. The used dose model was able to predict the loss of dose due to tracking errors and could be used to infer the necessary margins.

Target dose coverage was evaluated by {{the proportion of the}} CTV encompassed by the 95 % isodose. Original plans employed a 1 cm safety margin. Alternative plans assuming a smaller 7 mm margin between CTV and PTV were evaluated in the same way. Rectal and bladder volumes were compared with the initial ones. Rectal and bladder volumes irradiated with doses higher than 75 Gy, 70 Gy, 60 Gy, 50 Gy and 40 Gy were analyzed. ResultsIn 12 % of reconstructed plans the prostate coverage was not sufficient. The prostate <b>underdosage</b> was observed in 5 patients. Coverage of seminal vesicles was not satisfactory in 3 % of plans. Most of the target <b>underdosage</b> corresponded to excessive rectal or bladder filling. Evaluation of alternative plans assuming a smaller 7 mm margin revealed 22 % and 11 % of plans where prostate and seminal vesicles coverage, respectively, was compromised. These were distributed over 8 and 7 patients, respectively. ConclusionSufficient dose coverage of target volumes was not achieved for all patients. Reducing of safety margin is not acceptable. Initial rectal and bladder volumes cannot be considered representative for subsequent treatment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background 4 -dimensional CT (4 DCT) scans are {{increasingly}} used {{to account for}} mobility during radiotherapy planning. As variations in respiratory patterns can alter observed motion, with consequent changes in the generated target volumes, we evaluated the reproducibility of 4 D target volumes generated during repeat uncoached quiet respiration. Methods A retrospective analysis was performed on two successive scans (4 DCT 1 and 4 DCT 2) generated at the same scanning session for 26 patients with peripheral lung cancer treated with stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). The volume and position of planning target volumes (PTV 4 DCT 1 and PTV 4 DCT 2) contoured on both scans were compared, and a dosimetric analysis performed. A SRT plan optimized for each PTV was sequentially applied to the other PTV, and coverage by the 80 % isodose was evaluated. Color intensity projections (CIP) were used to evaluate regions of <b>underdosage.</b> Results No significant volumetric differences were observed between the two PTVs (t -Test p = 0. 60). The average displacement {{of the center of}} mass between corresponding PTVs was 1. 4 ± 1. 0 mm, but differences in position were 2. 0 mm or greater in 5 cases (19 %). Coverage of both PTVs by the 80 % prescription isodose exceeded 90 % for all but one patient. For the latter, the prescription isodose covered only 82. 5 % of PTV 4 DCT 1. CIP analysis revealed that the region of <b>underdosage</b> was an end-inspiratory position occupied by the tumor for only 10 – 20 % of the respiratory cycle. Conclusion In nearly all patients with stage I lung cancer, the PTV derived from a single uncoached 4 DCT achieves dosimetric coverage that is similar to that achieved using two such consecutive scans. </p...|$|E
40|$|To {{provide an}} {{analytical}} {{description of the}} effect of random and systematic geometrical deviations on the target dose in radiotherapy and to derive margin rules. The cumulative dose distribution delivered to the clinical target volume (CTV) is expressed analytically. Geometrical deviations are separated into treatment execution (random) and treatment preparation (systematic) variations. The analysis relates each possible preparation (systematic) error to the dose distribution over the CTV and allows computation of the probability distribution of, for instance, the minimum dose delivered to the CTV. The probability distributions of the cumulative dose over a population of patients are called dose-population histograms in short. Large execution (random) variations lead to CTV <b>underdosage</b> for a large number of patients, while the same level of preparation (systematic) errors leads to a much larger <b>underdosage</b> for some of the patients. A single point on the histogram gives a simple "margin recipe. " For example, to ensure a minimum dose to the CTV of 95 % for 90 % of the patients, a margin between CTV and planning target volume (PTV) is required of 2. 5 times the total standard deviation (SD) of preparation (systematic) errors (Sigma) plus 1. 64 times the total SD of execution (random) errors (sigma') combined with the penumbra width, minus 1. 64 times the SD describing the penumbra width (sigma(p)). For a sigma(p) of 3. 2 mm, this recipe can be simplified to 2. 5 Sigma + 0. 7 sigma'. Because this margin excludes rotational errors and shape deviations, it must be considered as a lower limit for safe radiotherapy. Dose-population histograms provide insight into the effects of geometrical deviations on a population of patients. Using a dose-probability based approach, simple algorithms for choosing margins were derive...|$|E

40|$|The multileaf {{collimator}} (MLC) hardware constraints {{are usually}} neglected {{in the process}} of intensity-modulated beam optimization. Consequently, it is not always possible to deliver planned beam modulation using dynamic MLC. Beam optimization is significantly diminished if the results must be approximated due to limitations imposed by the delivery device. To overcome this problem, an inverse beam optimization method which incorporates the hardware constraints has been developed. The hardware constraints, including the leaf velocity, the dose rate and the minimum required gap between opposing and adjacent leaves, were considered. An iterative search for feasible modulation was conducted alternately in the dosimetric space and the MLC position [...] time space. The optimization algorithm was designed for a unidirectional leaf trajectory and a constant dose rate. A scheme to reduce tongue-and-groove <b>underdosage</b> during optimization was also implemented. Comparisons were made between the solut [...] ...|$|E

A variety of technical approaches are currently available to deliver ionizing irradiation to the vascular target. Basically two kinds of radioactive isotopes are available that emit gamma radiation (photons) or beta radiation (electrons). The pitfalls and solutions for the optimization of dosimetry are discussed. As might be expected, the inhomogeneous dose distribution across the target volume results in recurrence by <b>underdosage</b> or in complications because of overdosage. Moreover, uniformization of the target definition and reporting of the dose distribution in endovascular brachytherapy {{is a prerequisite for}} comparison between the results of the various clinical trials and is absolutely necessary to improve the therapeutic efficacy of this new approach in the prevention of restenosis after coronary angioplasty with or without stenting.

40|$|During {{hyperthermia}} {{the presence}} of a large vessel entering the heated volume and carrying blood at the systemic temperature can be an important source of temperature non-uniformity and possible <b>underdosage.</b> The minimal tumour temperature near a large vessel is determined by the vessel wall temperature: a number of factors influencing the vessel wall temperature are considered [...] effective tissue conductivity, flow type, vessel size, entrance effects and counter-current flow. In some specific cases, especially when tissue perfusion is high, the vessel wall temperature may reach therapeutic levels when the mean blood temperature is still low. In general, well perfused tumours {{have a better chance of}} being heated uniformly. Regional heating improves temperature uniformity by reducing entrance and equilibration effects as blood is heated before entering the tumour.

40|$|We give a scenario-based {{treatment}} plan optimization formulation that {{is equivalent to}} planning with geometric margins if the scenario doses are calculated using the static dose cloud approximation. If the scenario doses are instead calculated more accurately, then our formulation provides a novel robust planning method that overcomes many of the difficulties associated with previous scenario-based robust planning methods. In particular, our method protects only against uncertainties that can occur in practice, it gives a sharp dose fall-off outside high dose regions, and it avoids <b>underdosage</b> of the target in ``easy'' scenarios. The method shares {{the benefits of the}} previous scenario-based robust planning methods over geometric margins for applications where the static dose cloud approximation is inaccurate, such as irradiation with few fields and irradiation with ion beams. These properties are demonstrated on a suite of phantom cases planned for treatment with scanned proton beams subject to systematic setup uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|Ion beams {{exhibit a}} finite and well defined range in matter {{together}} with an “inverted” depth-dose profile, the so-called Bragg peak. These favourable physical properties may enable superior tumour-dose conformality for high precision radiation therapy. On the other hand, they introduce the issue of sensitivity to range uncertainties in ion beam therapy. Although these uncertainties are typically taken into account when planning the treatment, correct delivery of the intended ion beam range has to be assured to prevent undesired <b>underdosage</b> of the tumour or overdosage of critical structures outside the target volume. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} define dedicated Quality Assurance procedures to enable in-vivo range verification before or during therapeutic irradiation. For these purposes, Monte Carlo transport codes are very useful tools to support the development of novel imaging modalities for ion beam therapy.

40|$|Purpose: Field {{matching}} {{poses challenges}} in craniospinal irradiation (CSI) as it leads either to <b>underdosage</b> or overdosage in the junctional area. A simple technique for CSI in pediatric patients is proposed. Materials and Methods: Computed tomography scans were {{performed in the}} prone position. Two lateral cranial fields and a direct posterior spinal field were planned with a common central axis. Half-beam-blocked cranial fields with zero collimator rotation were used for treating the cranium. A half-beam-blocked field defined with jaws was used to treat the spinal column at an extended source-to-surface distance. Before treating the patient, matching of the cranial and spinal field junction along the central axis was verified with an extended dose range film. Results and Conclusion: The technique described is simple and easy to implement and {{can be applied to}} pediatric patients undergoing CSI. This method has the potential to reduce daily setup time and setup errors. This technique is ideally suitable for patients with spinal fields less than 30 cm...|$|E

Of the 78 women whose infants died in 1982 and 1983, 49 had not received anti-Rh immunoglobulin after previous pregnancies with Rh positive infants; most of these deaths would presumably have been prevented had postnatal anti-Rh immunoglobulin been given. In 13 women anti-D was detected during, or immediately after, a first pregnancy, and in 15 women rhesus immunisation developed despite administration of anti-Rh immunoglobulin postnatally. One or two apparent failures of treatment may have been due to <b>underdosage,</b> but it must be concluded that about one third of the deaths in 1982 and 1983 could have been prevented only by giving anti-Rh immunoglobulin antenatally as well as postnatally...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the influence of observer variation and treatment planner variation on the dose delivered to the target and normal structures when irradiating paranasal sinus carcinomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients with paranasal sinus tumors underwent debulking surgery and subsequent radiation therapy. Two observers from two different institutions delineated the clinical target volumes (CTVs) for the elective and the boost volumes. These volumes were expanded in three dimensions with a 5 -mm margin. At both institutions, a three-dimensional conformal treatment plan of 46 Gy to the elective volumes, plus 20 Gy to the boost target volumes, was designed. The delineated volumes and treatment plans were compared. RESULTS: The mean volume ratio between institutions of the elective CTVs was 0. 9 (standard error = 0. 05). The differences were located mainly {{at the bottom of the}} nasal cavity and at the frontal border of the target areas. The differences in boost CTVs were large; the mean volume ratio was 2. 6 (standard error = 0. 58). After expansion of the CTV, the mean distance between the planning target volume (PTV) and the chiasm differed by 0. 5 cm between the two institutions. Cases with smaller distances between the PTV and the chiasm had more <b>underdosage</b> to the PTV. This effect was less pronounced for institution A (1 vol. %/cm) than for institution B (10 vol. %/cm) treatment plans, which were less conformal. When the treatment plan was designed for the PTV of institution B, 23 volume % of the PTV of institution A received < 95 % of the prescribed dose. If the treatment plan was designed for the (on average larger) PTV of institution A, the underdosed volume of PTV at institution B was 17 %. The relative <b>underdosage</b> to the "other" PTV was larger when the original treatment plan was more conformal. CONCLUSION: In the irradiation of paranasal sinus cancer, both the treatment planner and the observer have a significant influence on the dose to the target and organs at risk. Both effects are similar in magnitude. The observer effect increases with more conformal treatment plans. Minimizing the observer variation is important for adequate irradiation of paranasal sinus cance...|$|E
