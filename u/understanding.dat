40|$|Behaviors {{that pose}} threats to safety and health, {{including}} binge drinking and unprotected sex, increase during a week-long break from university. <b>Understandings</b> with peers regarding these behaviors {{may be important}} for predicting behavior and related harms. College students (N = 651; 48 % men) reported having <b>understandings</b> with their friends regarding alcohol use (59 %) and sexual behavior (45 %) during Spring Break. These <b>understandings</b> were to engage in behaviors characterized by risk (e. g., get drunk [23. 5 %], have sex with someone new [5. 2 %]) and protection (e. g., drink without getting drunk [17. 8 %], use condoms [15. 8 %]). After controlling for previous semester behavior and going on a Spring Break trip, Get Drunk <b>Understandings</b> predicted a greater likelihood of binge drinking and alcohol-related consequences; No/Safe Sex <b>Understandings</b> predicted condom use; and Sex <b>Understandings</b> predicted not using condoms. <b>Understandings</b> with friends regarding Spring Break behavior may be important proximal predictors of risk behaviors and represent potential targets for event-specific prevention...|$|R

Quiz, a simple exercise in a classroom, is a method to grasp students’ <b>understandings.</b> We have developed a supporting system for quizzes in descriptive answer type. We focus on typing process for answers. It would contain helpful information related to imperfect <b>understandings.</b> We proposed a method to extract phrases {{that are related to}} imperfect <b>understandings</b> regardless typing skill. The method detects suspended periods of typing process and extracts phrases by comparing answers at these periods.

40|$|The Vietnamese higher {{education}} context is characterised by state control including the state’s development of curriculum frameworks and materials. Institutional autonomy has been {{ratified by the}} government, however, in practice universities seem to have little control over curriculum. In order for universities to develop more ownership of curriculum, {{it is necessary to}} explore the foundational <b>understandings</b> of curriculum held by stakeholders. Thus, this paper explores the <b>understandings</b> of curriculum expressed by a group of senior staff, academics and students at a Vietnamese university. We found a diversity of <b>understandings</b> that tended to be product-focused, teacher-focused and textbook-driven. We propose that our findings {{can be used as a}} starting point for developing more innovative and student-focused <b>understandings</b> of curriculum...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we report}} on an {{investigation}} into initial teacher education students (ITES) <b>understandings</b> of sustainability and the Australian National Curriculum Sustainability Cross Curricular Priority (CCP). We also explore their willingness and capacities to embed the CCP into their own teaching practices. The ITESs (N= 392) completed a quantitative survey {{with a series of}} Likert Scale questions and were asked to list “ 5 words” when they think of sustainability. Analysis reveals that ITESs have generally limited to moderate <b>understandings</b> of sustainability and education for sustainability, but lesser <b>understandings</b> of the Sustainability CCP and the 9 organising ideas. <b>Understandings</b> of sustainability were dominated by an environmental focus. We conclude this paper with a discussion of the implications of narrow environmental <b>understandings</b> of sustainability. We explore factors that limit and enable teacher educators to embed sustainability education more explicitly. We note the importance role teacher educators play in supporting ITESs to better understand sustainability...|$|R

40|$|Even though students’ <b>understandings</b> {{of climate}} change have been {{frequently}} studied, research on students’ views in combination with their teachers’ views is still missing. This study attempts to remedy that by including both ninth-graders and their geography teachers as respondents. The aim is to investigate the respondents’ <b>understandings</b> of the background to climate change and its consequences for biodiversity, human health and own living conditions. The respondents represented eleven secondary schools {{from all parts of}} Swedish-speaking Finland. A mixed methods research design was applied, combining data from questionnaires (549 students) and interviews (13 teachers). Similarities and differences between the <b>understandings</b> of the students and their teachers were examined. The results show that the students’ <b>understandings</b> and to some extent the teachers’ <b>understandings</b> differed from the scientific perspective. A common conception in both groups was that climate change does not affect them. Pedagogical implications for the development {{of climate change}} education are discussed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Using hypersets as an {{analytic}} tool, {{we compare}} traditionally Gibsonian (Chemero 2003; Turvey 1992) and representationalist (Sahin et al. this issue) <b>understandings</b> {{of the notion}} ‘affordance’. We show that representationalist <b>understandings</b> are incompatible with direct perception and erect barriers between animal and environment. They are, therefore, scarcely recognizable as <b>understandings</b> of ‘affordance’. In contrast, Gibsonian <b>understandings</b> are shown to treat animal-environment systems as unified complex systems and to be compatible with direct perception. We discuss the fruitful connections between Gibsonian affordances and dynamical systems explanation in the behavioral sciences and point to prior fruitful application of Gibsonian affordances in robotics. We conclude that it is unnecessary to re-imagine affordances as representations {{in order to make}} them useful for researchers in robotics...|$|R
40|$|PhDThe Lansbury {{estate was}} the LCC's first post-war {{reconstruction}} area, it formed the Exhibition of Architecture during the Festival of Britain, and received considerable media, political, architecutral and planning attention. This coverage articulated hegemonic post-war {{ideas about the}} future, the East End and communities. I have examined this material and the representation and <b>understandings</b> about the estate from non-hegemonic groups. My intention has been to explore these representations and emphasise the complexity associated with the creation and negotiation of <b>understandings</b> about places. While the research is concerned with <b>understandings</b> of the Lansbury estate,I have examined the ways those meanings and <b>understandings</b> are created,and based my work around a conceptual critique of cultural geography. I argue that cultural geography has overly relied on hegemonic discourses produced by the powerful and neglected less powerful groups' <b>understandings.</b> As a result of this, some cultural geographers have over-simplified the complex ways meanings about places are created,reproduced and contested,and failed to address the range of meanings about places. This work, therefore is offered {{as a response to}} these limitations, and aims to show that to appreciate the meanings of places it is necessary to examine the <b>understandings</b> of hegemonic and nonhegemonic groups, and emphasise the relationships between those groups...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2001. A lot of {{scholars}} have {{alluded to the}} existence of indigenous knowledge among community elders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore existence of indigenous science <b>understandings</b> among Zulu elders and determine the impact of these <b>understandings</b> on the indigenous secondary school learners. A group of elders and a group of learners from a selected rural community were interviewed on three phenomena pertaining to biology and physical science. Each phenomenon was chosen according to its relevance to the traditional African practices of the rural community studied. The data from both groups was analysed to determine <b>understandings</b> held by each group. Findings of this study revealed that elders held indigenous science <b>understandings</b> that had an impact on the indigenous secondary school learners. Elders transmit these <b>understandings</b> as views that I chose to call indigenous conceptions and duality explanation conceptions. As a result of the impact of elders' views and school science, learners on the other hand held three types of conceptions, namely, unchanged indigenous conceptions, hybridised conceptions and duality explanation conceptions. The recommendations I made are based on the findings that elders' indigenous knowledge has an impact on learners' science <b>understandings.</b> This then has implications to classroom practices and science education...|$|R
