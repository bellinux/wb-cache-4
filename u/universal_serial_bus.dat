5|$|USB, {{short for}} <b>Universal</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus,</b> is an {{industry}} standard that defines cables, connectors and communications protocols for connection, communication, and power supply between computers and devices.|$|E
5|$|In December 2014, USB-IF {{submitted}} USB3.1, USB Power Delivery 2.0 and USB Type-C specifications to the IEC (TC 100– Audio, {{video and}} multimedia systems and equipment) {{for inclusion in}} the international standard IEC 62680 <b>Universal</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> interfaces for data and power, which is currently based on USB 2.0.|$|E
5|$|The Micro plug {{design is}} rated {{for at least}} 10,000 connect-disconnect cycles, {{which is more than}} the Mini plug design. The Micro {{connector}} is also designed to reduce the mechanical wear on the device; instead the easier-to-replace cable is designed to bear the mechanical wear of connection and disconnection. The <b>Universal</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> Micro-USB Cables and Connectors Specification details the mechanical characteristics of Micro-A plugs, Micro-AB receptacles (which accept both Micro-A and Micro-B plugs), and Micro-B plugs and receptacles, along with a standard-A receptacle to Micro-A plug adapter.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Serial</b> <b>bus</b> is {{a network}} using serial {{communication}} interface. Today’s <b>serial</b> <b>bus</b> {{technology has been}} tremendously speeded up and has a considerable influence on data communication for the computer peripherals. In this paper, serial buses such as RS- 232, RS- 422, RS- 423, RS- 485, USB(Universal <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus)</b> and IEEE 1394 are compared and analyzed especially in viewpoint of the speed, the electrical interface and the operating mechanism. And the trend of researches in these <b>serial</b> <b>bus</b> is discussed...|$|R

50|$|The Lost Special was <b>Universal's</b> 84th <b>serial.</b> In {{terms of}} <b>Universal's</b> <b>serials</b> {{in the sound}} era, it was the 16th. The series was written by veteran <b>Universal</b> <b>serial</b> writers, {{including}} Basil Dickey, George Morgan, and George Plympton. The director was Henry MacRae. By the time he directed The Lost Special, MacRae had directed more than 100 short films and feature films.|$|R

25|$|During the 1990s, Intel Architecture Labs (IAL) was {{responsible}} {{for many of the}} hardware innovations for the PC, including the PCI Bus, the PCI Express (PCIe) bus, and <b>Universal</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> (USB). IAL's software efforts met with a more mixed fate; its video and graphics software was important in the development of software digital video, but later its efforts were largely overshadowed by competition from Microsoft. The competition between Intel and Microsoft was revealed in testimony by then IAL Vice-President Steven McGeady at the Microsoft antitrust trial (United States v. Microsoft Corp.).|$|E
25|$|A kernel must {{maintain}} {{a list of}} available devices. This list may be known in advance (e.g. on an embedded system where the kernel will be rewritten if the available hardware changes), configured by the user (typical on older PCs and on systems that are not designed for personal use) or detected by the operating system at run time (normally called plug and play). In a plug and play system, a device manager first performs a scan on different hardware buses, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) or <b>Universal</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> (USB), to detect installed devices, then searches for the appropriate drivers.|$|E

50|$|IEEE 1394 is a <b>serial</b> <b>bus</b> {{architecture}} for high-speed data transfer. FireWire is a <b>serial</b> <b>bus,</b> {{meaning that}} information is transferred one bit at a time. Parallel buses utilize {{a number of different}} physical connections, and as such are usually more costly and typically heavier. IEEE 1394 fully supports both isochronous and asynchronous applications.|$|R
25|$|In October 2008, Beechcraft {{announced}} updated {{versions of}} the B300 series, the King Air 350i, with improvements to the passenger cabin. The manufacturer claims that the noise level and overall comfort of the King Air 350i, 350iER, 350iC and 350iCER are now competitive with those of light jets. The cabin of the B300 series has been updated with controllers {{in the passenger seat}} armrests that dim the LED lights, darken the windows and control an iPod dock and a high-definition video monitor. The cabin also includes <b>Universal</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> (USB) ports, AC electrical receptacles and fold-out tables for each passenger in the eight seats fitted. Deliveries commenced in December 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Cosmos {{encompasses}} an AOT compiler named IL2CPU {{to translate}} Common Intermediate Language (CIL) into native instructions. [...] Cosmos compiles user-made programs and associated libraries using IL2CPU {{to create a}} bootable native executable that can be run with no support. [...] The resulting output can be booted from a USB flash drive, CD-ROM, over a network via Preboot Execution Environment (PXE), or inside a virtual machine. Recent releases also allow deploying to certain x86 embedded devices over <b>Universal</b> <b>Serial</b> <b>Bus</b> (USB). [...] While C# is the primary language used by developers (both on the backend and by end users of Cosmos), many CLI languages can be used, provided they compile to pure CIL {{without the use of}} Platform Invocation Services (P/Invokes).
