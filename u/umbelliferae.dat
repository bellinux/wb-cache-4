5|$|Part of the {{disparity}} in genus sizes is attributable to historical factors. According to a hypothesis published by Max Walters in 1961, the size of plant genera {{is related to the}} age, not of the taxon itself, but of the concept of the taxon in the minds of taxonomists. Plants which grew in Europe, where most of the early taxonomy was based, were therefore divided into relatively small genera, while those from the tropics were grouped into much larger and more heterogeneous genera. Likewise, plants which shared common medicinal properties, such as the many species of Euphorbia, were united into a single genus, while plants of diverse uses, such as the grasses, were split into many genera. Where there were many classical names for groups of plants, such as in Apiaceae / <b>Umbelliferae</b> or Brassicaceae / Cruciferae, small genera were defined, whereas groups not subdivided by classical authors remained as larger genera, such as Carex. A number of biological factors also influence the number of species. For instance, the occurrence of apomixis allows the recognition of large numbers of agamospecies, and such taxa have helped to bolster genera such as Ranunculus and Potentilla.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species in}} the family Apiaceae or <b>Umbelliferae</b> are superficially similar to fennel, and some, such as poison hemlock, are toxic, so it is unwise, and {{potentially}} extremely dangerous, to use any part {{of any of these}} plants as an herb or vegetable unless it can be positively identified as being edible.|$|E
25|$|The {{caterpillars}} {{of various}} swallowtail butterfly species feed {{on a wide}} range of different plants, most depending on only one of five families: Aristolochiaceae, Annonaceae, Lauraceae, <b>Umbelliferae</b> (Apiaceae) and Rutaceae. By eating some of these toxic plants, the caterpillars sequester aristolochic acid which renders both the caterpillars and the butterflies of some of these as toxic, thus protecting them from predators. Swallowtail tribes Zerynthiini (Parnassiinae), Luehdorfiini (Parnassiinae) and Troidini (Papilioninae) almost exclusively use the Aristolochiaceae family as their host plants.|$|E

50|$|Long {{before the}} {{connection}} was {{made between the}} nonlichenized agaric fruitbodies and the lichenized thalli, botanists and lichenologists named the asexual lichen thalli of Lichenomphalia species several times {{in a number of}} genera. Linnaeus in 1753 described the lichen thallus of L. <b>umbellifera</b> as an 'alga' named Byssus botryoides while simultaneously including the fruitbodies of L. <b>umbellifera</b> within his concept of Agaricus umbelliferus, the basionym for the name L. <b>umbellifera.</b> Byssus botryoides is the type species of the now officially rejected generic names Phytoconis and Botrydina. Acharius in 1810 described the thalli of L. hudsoniana as a lichen, Endocarpon viride, which is the type of another officially rejected name, Coriscium. The names 'Botrydina' and 'Coriscium' are often used to describe the thalli of different Lichenomphalia even though they are rejected names listed in the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (Appendix V). Prior to officially rejecting these names, the names Botrydina and Phytoconis were both applied to describe Lichenomphalia species. Hence literature on these lichenized agarics appears under a myriad of names, such as Omphalina, Gerronema, Phytoconis, Botrydina and Coriscium.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{leaves of}} {{tropical}} forest trees {{are most likely}} to suffer herbivore damage during the period of expansion. Herbivore selection on young leaves has given rise to a variety of leaf developmental strategies and age-specific chemical defense modes. We are studying correlations between leaf developmental types and chemical defenses in the Neotropical genus Inga. We have characterized defense metabolites in Inga goldmanii and Inga <b>umbellifera,</b> two species that co-occur in the lowland moist forest of Panama. These congeners have markedly different young-leaf developmental pheno-types but suffer approximately equal rates of herbivory. Bioassays of whole and fractionated leaf extracts using larvae of Heliothis virescens show that I. goldmanii chemical defenses are nearly three times more inhibitory than those of I. <b>umbellifera.</b> In both species, most of the inhibitory activity resides in complex mixtures of monomeric and polymeric flavan- 3 -ols. This group comprises> 30 % of young leaf dry weight in both I. goldmanii and I. <b>umbellifera.</b> The species _ phenolic chemistry differs markedly, however, both {{in the structure of the}} monomeric units and in the distribution of polymer sizes. The differences in chemical structure have pronounced ef-fects on their bioactivities, with I. goldmanii flavans being twice as in-hibitory to H. virescens larvae as I. <b>umbellifera</b> flavans, and more than three times more efficient at protein binding. Given the extraordinarily high poly-phenol concentrations that are found in the young leaves of these species, protein precipitation could be an important mechanism of growth inhibition. Nevertheless, our data show that another mode of phenolic action, possibly oxidative stress, occurs simultaneously...|$|R

60|$|The cases {{hitherto}} mentioned {{relate to}} hermaphrodite species which bear differently constructed flowers; {{but there are}} some plants that produce differently formed seeds, of which Dr. Kuhn has given a list. (Introduction/15. 'Botanische Zeitung' 1867 page 67.) With the <b>Umbelliferae</b> and Compositae, the flowers that produce these seeds likewise differ, and the differences {{in the structure of the}} seeds are of a very important nature. The causes which have led to differences in the seeds on the same plant are not known; and it is very doubtful whether they subserve any special end.|$|E
60|$|On the {{following}} morning, {{we crossed the}} Islumbo pass over Singalelah into Sikkim, the elevation being 11,000 feet.

60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{development}} of the corolla, Sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly advantageous, or necessary for the fertilisation of these plants, is highly probable; and if so, natural selection may have come into play. But with {{respect to the}} seeds, it seems impossible that their differences in shape, which are not always correlated with any difference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial; yet in the <b>Umbelliferae</b> these differences are of such apparent importance--the seeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers--that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions in the order on such characters. Hence modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to the laws of variation and correlation, without being, as far as we can judge, of the slightest service to the species.|$|E
60|$|It is so {{necessary}} {{to appreciate the}} important effects {{of the laws of}} growth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely of differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in relative position on the same plant. In the Spanish chestnut, and in certain fir-trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ, according to Schacht, in the nearly horizontal and in the upright branches. In the common rue and some other plants, one flower, usually the central or terminal one, opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five divisions to the ovarium; while all the other flowers on the plant are tetramerous. In the British Adoxa the uppermost flower generally has two calyx-lobes with the other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding flowers generally have three calyx-lobes with the other organs pentamerous. In many Compositae and <b>Umbelliferae</b> (and in some other plants) the circumferential flowers have their corollas much more developed than those of the centre; and this seems often connected with the abortion of the reproductive organs. It is a more curious fact, previously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of the circumference and centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and other characters. In Carthamus and some other Compositae the central achenes alone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head yields achenes of three different forms. In certain <b>Umbelliferae</b> the exterior seeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one coelospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De Candolle to be in other species of the highest systematic importance. Professor Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in {{the lower part of the}} spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and in the upper part of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded siliques. In these several cases, with the exception of that of the well-developed ray-florets, which are of service in making the flowers conspicuous to insects, natural selection cannot, as far as we can judge, have come into play, or only in a quite subordinate manner. All these modifications follow from the relative position and inter-action of the parts; and it can hardly be doubted that if all the flowers and leaves on the same plant had been subjected to the same external and internal condition, as are the flowers and leaves in certain positions, all would have been modified in the same manner.|$|E
60|$|Autumnal tints reigned at Yeumtong, and {{the flowers}} had {{disappeared}} from its heath-like flat; a small eatable cherry with a wrinkled stone was ripe, and acceptable in a country so destitute of fruit.* [The absence of Vaccinia (whortleberries and cranberries) and eatable Rubi (brambles) in the alpine regions of the Himalaya is very remarkable, {{and they are not}} replaced by any substitute. With regard to Vaccinium, this is the more anomalous, as several species grow in the temperate regions of Sikkim.] Thence I descended to Lachoong, on the 1st of October, again through heavy rain, the snow lying on the Tunkra mountain at 14,000 feet. The larch was shedding its leaves, which turn red before they fall; but the annual vegetation was much behind that at 14,000 feet, and so many late flowerers, such as <b>Umbelliferae</b> and Compositae, had come into blossom, that the place still looked gay and green: the blue climbing gentian (Crawfurdia) now adorned the bushes; this plant would be a great acquisition in English gardens. A Polygonum still in flower here, was in ripe fruit near Momay, 6000 feet higher up the valley.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} {{reasonably}} common in cultivation as a decorative tree in New Zealand, {{especially in the}} northern North Island. Two variegated cultivars are sold as P. brunoniana in New Zealand nurseries, although one of these, which has leaves extensively marbled with white, {{may in fact be}} P. <b>umbellifera,</b> a similar species which occurs throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific.|$|R
50|$|Type I: Elaeocarpus-Ardisia mesic {{forest is}} found in the moist lowland areas with deep soils. The forests have a closed canopy with a height of about 15 m, {{dominated}} by Ardisia sieboldii. Elaeocarpus photiniaefolius, Pisonia <b>umbellifera,</b> and Pouteria obovata are other important canopy species. These forests were almost completely destroyed by clearing for agriculture before 1945.|$|R
50|$|In Hawaii, {{where it}} is known as pāpala kēpau, P. brunoniana is most common in dry to mesic habitats. Although {{abundant}} in certain locations, such as Kīpuka Puaulu, it has a relatively restricted distribution compared to the related species P. sandwicensis and P. <b>umbellifera.</b> The sticky fruits were employed by the Hawaiian kia manu (bird catchers) to trap birds in order to collect feathers for capes and other objects.|$|R
60|$|With {{respect to}} the {{difference}} in the corolla of the central and exterior flowers of a head or umbel, I do not feel at all sure that C. C. Sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of these two orders, is so far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if it be advantageous, natural selection may have come into play. But in regard to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the seeds, which are not always correlated with any differences in the flowers, it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the <b>Umbelliferae</b> these differences are of such apparent importance--the seeds being in some cases, according to Tausch, orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers,--that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences. Hence we see that modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, {{as far as we can}} see, of the slightest service to the species.|$|E
60|$|Isolated {{patches of}} {{vegetation}} {{appeared on the}} top of the pass, where I gathered forty kinds of plants, most of them being of a tufted habit characteristic of an extreme climate; some (as species of Caryophylleae) forming hemi-spherical balls on the naked soil; others* [The other plants found on the pass were; of smooth hairless ones, Ranunculus, Fumitory, several species of Stellaria, Arenaria, Cruciferae, Parnassia, Morina, saxifrages, Sedum, primrose, Herminium, Polygonum, Campanula, <b>Umbelliferae,</b> grasses and Carices: of woolly or hairy once, Anemone, Artemisia, Myosotis, Draba, Potentilla, and several Compositae, etc.] growing in matted tufts level with the ground. The greater portion had no woolly covering; nor did I find any of the cottony species of Saussurea, which are so common on the wetter mountains to the southward. Some most delicate-flowered plants even defy the biting winds of these exposed regions; such are a prickly Meconopsis with slender flower-stalks and four large blue poppy-like petals, a Cyananthus with a membranous bell-shaped corolla, and a fritillary. Other curious plants were a little yellow saxifrage with long runners (very like the arctic S. flagellaris, of Spitzbergen and Melville Island), and the strong-scented spikenard (Nardostachys).|$|E
60|$|Still, {{the absence}} or rarity at this {{elevation}} of several very large natural families,* [Ranunculaceae, Fumariae, Cruciferae, Alsineae, Geranicae, Leguminosae, Potentilla, Epilobium, Crassulaceae, Saxifrageae, <b>Umbelliferae,</b> Lonicera, Valerianeae, Dipsaceae, various genera of Compositae, Campanulaceae, Lobeliaceae, Gentianeae, Boragineae, Scrophularineae, Primulaceae, Gramineae.] which have numerous representatives at and much below {{the same level}} in the inner ranges, and on the outer of the Western Himalaya, indicate a certain peculiarity in Sikkim. On the other hand, certain tropical genera are more abundant in the temperate zone of the Sikkim mountains, and ascend much higher there than in the Western Himalaya: of this fact I have cited conspicuous examples in the palms, plantains, and tree-ferns. This ascent and prevalence of tropical species {{is due to the}} humidity and equability of the climate in this temperate zone, and is, perhaps, the direct consequence of these conditions. An application of the same laws accounts for the extension of similar features far beyond the tropical limit in the Southern Ocean, where various natural orders, which do not cross the 30th and 40th parallels of N. latitude, are extended to the 55th of S. latitude, and found in Tasmania, New Zealand, the so-called Antarctic Islands south of that group, and at Cape Horn itself.|$|E
