5|$|In 324, Constantine I chose Byzantium {{to be the}} {{new capital}} of the Roman Empire, {{renaming}} it New Rome. Following the death of Theodosius I in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly {{come to be known as}} Constantinople, became the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. This empire, which would later be branded by historians as the Byzantine Empire, ruled most of the territory of present-day Turkey until the Late Middle Ages; although the eastern regions remained in firm Sasanian hands <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half of the seventh century. The frequent Byzantine-Sassanid Wars, as part of the centuries long-lasting Roman-Persian Wars, fought between the neighbouring rivalling Byzantines and Sasanians, took place in various parts of present-day Turkey and decided much of the latter's history from the fourth century <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> half of the seventh century.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong studied whether {{replacing}} the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting {{to sell the}} ship. In the tension building <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> World War, many countries, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, were interested in purchasing the ship. While Russia quickly dropped out, Italy and the rival Greeks and Ottomans were all highly interested. The Italians seemed close to purchasing the ship until the French government decided to back the Greeks—rather than allow the Italians, who were the principal naval rivals of the French, to obtain the ship. The Grecian government made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional £50,000, but as the Greeks worked to obtain an initial installment, the Ottoman government was also making offers.|$|E

5|$|Born in Blackpool, {{a coastal}} town in north-west England, Swift's first club was Blackpool Gas Works, {{where he worked}} as a coke-keeper. A spell at nearby Fleetwood followed, during which Swift {{attracted}} interest from a number of Football League clubs. Potential suitors included Blackpool (where Frank's elder brother Fred was the goalkeeper), Blackburn Rovers, Bradford City and Manchester City. The first to offer Swift a contract were Manchester City, who played in the First Division, the highest level of English football. Initially signed as an amateur in October 1932, eighteen-year-old Swift turned professional the following month, receiving a wage of ten shillings (50p) per week. The following December he was called <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> team, having previously made only three reserve team appearances.|$|E
5|$|Despite advance {{sales of}} 40,000 tickets, only 4,919 fans showed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> strike game played by {{replacement}} players. Neither team had {{any of its}} regular players on the roster. Detroit punter Mike Black's 3rd-quarter fumble on the 3-yard line set up Harold Ricks' game-winning touchdown run. The Buccaneers' three second-quarter touchdowns overcame the Lions' early 17-point lead. 17 of the Buccaneers' points resulted from Lions turnovers. Around 1,000 union members, including UAW president Owen Bieber, joined the Lions on the picket lines. Attendance was also likely influenced by a baseball game taking place the same day, in which the Detroit Tigers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays to win the A.L. East Championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the {{commission}} submitted a threefold plan of {{proposal to the}} government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and restoring several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by restoring floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.|$|E

5|$|During the 2004–05 season, Messi was a {{guaranteed}} starter for the B team, playing 17 games {{throughout the campaign}} and scoring on six occasions. Since his debut the previous November, {{he had not been}} called <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> team again, but in October 2004, the senior players asked manager Frank Rijkaard to promote him. Since Ronaldinho already played on the left wing, Rijkaard moved Messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot. Messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 October, against Espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute. At 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent Barcelona in an official competition. As a substitute player, he played only 77 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the UEFA Champions League against Shakhtar Donetsk. He scored his first senior goal on 1 May 2005, against Albacete, from an assist by Ronaldinho, becoming – at that time – the youngest-ever scorer for the club. Barcelona, in their second season under Rijkaard, won the league {{for the first time in}} six years.|$|E
5|$|On lap 155, {{the third}} caution was given; Gugelmin's engine failed on the frontstretch {{and stopped at}} turn one. Course {{officials}} were required to clear the track <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> turn. All of the leaders, including Fernández, made pit stops for fuel. Most of the teams instructed their drivers to conserve fuel in the hope they could {{reach the end of}} the race. Moreno's car billowed smoke on lap 160 but continued. Da Matta gained the lead for the restart on lap 167. After restarting from third, Papis moved into the lead two laps later. Kannan took over the first position on the 171st lap, before Junqueira passed him on the next lap. A section of front wing became disloged from Moreno's car while entering turn three on lap 176, which triggered the fourth caution. During the caution, CART Chief Stewart Chris Kneifel announced the distance of the event would be reduced from 250 to 230 laps because of fading sunlight, and the leaders elected to make pit stops. Moreno remained the leader at the lap-183 restart but was overtaken by Junqueira in turn one. After restarting third, Tagliani fell to sixth. Carpentier passed Junqueira for the lead two laps later.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} lap, Newman became the leader, as Logano drove to pit road. On the 173rd lap, Menard {{moved to the}} third position, after having {{assistance}} from Stewart. Two laps later, Ragan became the leader, but two laps later, Bowyer reclaimed the position. On lap179, Newman moved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> position, as Earnhardt moved to eleventh. Three laps later, Kahne collided into the wall, prompting the caution to come out. On the same lap, McMurray had one cylinder to fail. At the lap185 restart, Newman remained the leader. On the following lap, Earnhardt and Stewart moved into {{the third and fourth}} positions. On lap192, Bowyer moved up to the third position, then to the first position. Three laps later, Smith moved into the first position. On lap197, the fifteenth caution was given after Smith spun sideways, as Bowyer was also involved and sustained major damage. During the caution, Earnhardt made a pit stop because of a possible deflating tire. At the lap202 restart, for a green-white-checker finish, Ragan was the leader, ahead of Bayne.|$|E

5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The NHL Entry Draft is {{held each}} June, {{allowing}} teams to select {{players who have}} turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order {{is determined by the}} previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. The NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 14 non-playoff teams, allowing the winner to move <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> overall pick. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges. Detroit's first draft pick was Peter Mahovlich, taken second overall in the 1963 NHL Amateur Draft. The Red Wings have chosen first overall three times, selecting Claude Gauthier in 1964, Dale McCourt in 1977, and Joe Murphy in 1986. McCourt and Murphy both spent some time in the NHL with Detroit, but Gauthier never played in the league. Twelve picks went on to play over 1,000 NHL games, while two of these, Nicklas Lidström and Steve Yzerman, played in over 1,500 games, both spending their entire NHL careers in Detroit.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, the Belgian {{provinces of}} the Netherlands revolted in the Belgian Revolution and {{declared}} their independence. Despite widespread {{international support for}} Belgian independence, fighting between Belgium and the Netherlands continued {{under the rule of}} King Leopold I. Belgian independence was finally recognized by the Dutch in 1839. Under Leopold I's reign, Belgium remained relatively stable and was only lightly affected by the Revolutions of 1848. On his death in 1865, his son Leopold II was inaugurated as King. Leopold II's reign was dominated by the rise of the Socialist party and calls for reform to the voting system and military as well as the Schools' War between Liberal and Catholic political factions. Although Belgian independence was briefly threatened during the Franco-Prussian War, under Leopold II's reign the country reached an unprecedented level of industrialization and prosperity, becoming the second most industrialized state in the world after Great Britain. The period was also marked by the creation of a personal colony by Leopold II, the Congo Free State. The subsequent international outcry over human rights abuses forced the Belgian state to annex the region in 1908, forming the Belgian Congo. In 1909, after his uncle's death, Albert I began his reign, which lasted until 1934. In the years leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> World War, the process of military and voting reform begun in the 1880s was finally completed. Despite declaring neutrality, Belgium was invaded by the German Empire in August 1914, beginning the country's involvement in World War I.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Kills walking {{around on a}} bridge, as she reminisces about her {{relationship}} with her boyfriend. As the song builds <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> verse, they are depicted {{in the living room of}} a hazy-looking apartment, and Kills smiles at him, who kisses her. They start to involve physically, however he pushes her away and opts to smoke a cigar; Kills, simultaneously, takes several pills. As they start to hallucinate, images of dilated pupils appear quickly on the screen and they are shown on the same setting dressed formally. They leave the apartment and drive to a bar—still smoking—and as they reach there, Kills observes an empty stage and decides to sing there. She keeps hallucinating and sees herself in a golden dress as opposed to what she is actually dressing—a black T-shirt. As she continues to sing, a short-haired man who is watching her performance smiles at her and hits on her. Kills' on-screen boyfriend walks up to him and they start a fight while Kills sings. A few moments after, Kills—who was oblivious to the fight—tries to break them up but gets hit by her boyfriend, and leaves the bar crying. He pursues her and they both argue inside their car. They abruptly stop arguing and begin having sexual intercourse. As the song reaches its end, Kills and her boyfriend are again in their apartment, where she spills a bottle of vodka on the ground. After looking at him, she lights it which causes the apartment to burn.|$|E
