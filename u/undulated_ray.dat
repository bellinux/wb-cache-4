50|$|Because of its late sexual {{maturity}} and {{low rate of}} population growth, <b>undulate</b> <b>ray</b> is extremely vulnerable to exploitation by fisheries. In the north Atlantic, populations have declined severely from the Irish area, {{and there are no}} longer records of catches of this species in the English Channel. Since 2009 it has been illegal to keep <b>Undulate</b> <b>Rays</b> fished in EU waters due to concerns over the decreasing size of stocks. They must be returned unharmed if possible.|$|R
5|$|Notable {{marine species}} include the ormer, conger, bass, <b>undulate</b> <b>ray,</b> grey mullet, ballan wrasse and garfish. Marine mammals include the bottlenosed dolphin and grey seal.|$|R
50|$|The <b>undulate</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja undulata) is {{a species}} of ray and {{cartilaginous}} fish found in the Mediterranean and East Atlantic from southern Ireland and England to the Gulf of Guinea. It is found in areas with mud or sand, and may occur as deep as 200 m, though it prefers shallower depths. It is considered endangered due to overfishing.|$|R
40|$|An <b>undulate</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja undulata) tagging {{survey was}} carried out {{from the end of}} 2011 to mid- 2014 in the Bay of Biscay with the {{partnership}} of the fishing industry. It demonstrates that the <b>undulate</b> <b>ray</b> can be found all along the French coast from the Loire estuary to the Spanish boarder, forming several isolated units, the more important being likely in {{the central part of the}} Bay of Biscay (Pertuis Charentais – Gironde area). Even in this latter limited area, the population is structured in sub-units with a low exchange rate between them. This population structure allowed to estimate abundance by mark-recapture in the Gironde estuary, using a Petersen estimate. The conditions that must be respected for such closed population abundance estimate are analysed. The conclusions are that as long i) long-line catch of rays longer than 65 cm are used to the be sure to have an equal capture probability and no recruitment effect, ii) recaptures are within 4. 5 month from the tagging date in winter to neglect tag losses and iii) number of tagged rays is corrected for emigration and mortality, an abundance estimate can be provided. The biomass of <b>undulate</b> <b>rays</b> longer than 65 cm in the inner Gironde estuary can thus be estimated to range from 51 to 70 t in the 2013 - 2014 winter (95 % confidence interval is 30 - 124 t). This first trial allows to have some guidelines for future mark-recapture estimates of the abundance of a species for which the use of other methods may be difficult...|$|R
40|$|Aspects of the {{population}} dynamics of the <b>undulate</b> <b>ray,</b> Raja undulata (Chondrichthyes: Rajidae), {{one of the more}} abundant elasmobranch fish captured along the Portuguese south coast (Algarve), were studied for the first time. Some traditional elasmobranch vertebral enhancing techniques were compared and the most precise for this species determined to be the cedar wood oil immersion and the alizarin red S stain. The sample consisted of 14 age-classes, with age-classes 3 to 8 being the most represented. Evidence of an annual deposition pattern of a pair of bands (one opaque and one translucent) was found by marginal increment analyses. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated and no differences found between males and females (all data: L-inf= 110. 22 cm, K= 0. 11 y(- 1) and t(0) =- 1. 58 y) ...|$|R
5000|$|Branching {{off from}} Monkey Temple, this {{attraction}} opened in 2013 as a 225,000-litre naturally themed display which {{is home to}} a colony of captive-bred Humboldt penguins. Visitors can watch the penguins from above as well as below the water, through giant viewing windows, as they swim at speeds of up to 30 mph. At certain times of the year the penguins are allowed outside into a large walk-through area where visitors can get up close to the penguins. Adjacent to this is Stingray Bay, a large open-topped display housing a selection of marine stingray species including thornback stingrays and <b>undulate</b> <b>rays.</b> In September 2016 an outbreak of avian malaria killed a large number of the penguin colony. Also found in Stingray Bay is the column-shaped display which is home to 2 species of seahorses which isSpiny seahorse and Short-snouted seahorse ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>undulate</b> <b>ray</b> {{features}} a disc-shaped body, triangular {{in the front}} and near-circular in the rear, and dermal denticles developed as spines for protection. Median spines are scattered in adults, regular on young. The males have one lateral row each side, whereas the females have three. The eyes are medium-sized and followed by spiracles. The mouth is on the ventral surface and is slightly arched, followed by the five pairs of small gill slits. Tail is as long as body, and has two well separated dorsal fins near its end, usually with two spines between them. The colouring of the dorsal surface varies from light brown to citrine or grey, with darker waved bands and numerous small white patches. Snout and margins are frequently clearer with dark spots. The underside is creamy-white with a greyish margin. It typically weighs about 10 lb, but can reach to as much as 22.13 lb and 100 cm in length.|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} <b>undulate</b> <b>ray,</b> Raja undulata, {{one of the most}} important elasmobranch fishes captured along the Portuguese south coast (Algarve), was studied. Cedar wood oil immersion and alizarin red S techniques were used to enhance vertebral growth bands and estimate age. The parameters of the Von Bertalanffy growth function were estimated and no differences between males and fema les were found. The estimated parameters for all data were: Linf = 110. 22, K = 0. 11 and t 0 =- 1. 58. Evidence of an annual deposition pattern of a pair of bands (one opaque and one hyaline) was found by marginal increment analyses. The total mortality rate for age classes fully recruited to a trammel net fishery was estimated to be 0. 469. Natural mortality rate varied between 0. 200 and 0. 219 and fishing mortality rate varied between 0. 250 and 0. 269, depending on the method used to estimate natural mortality. The parameters estimated in this study will be useful for evaluating the state of the stock and assessing risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{maturity}} of the <b>undulate</b> <b>ray,</b> Raja undulata, {{one of the}} most important by-catch elasmobranch species captured in south Portugal, was studied for the first time. Females ranged in total length (TL) from 19. 4 to 88. 2 cm and males from 23. 0 to 83. 2 cm. The gonadosomatic index for females was higher during the winter, meaning that this species reproduces during this season. Females matured at significantly larger sizes and older ages than males, with 50 % of the females mature at 76. 2 cm TL at an age of 8. 98 years while 50 % maturity for males was achieved at 73. 6 cm TL and 7. 66 years. Females were mature at 86. 3 % of the maximum observed size and 69. 1 % of the maximum observed age while males matured at 88. 5 % of the maximum observed size and 63. 8 % of the maximum observed age, making this a very late maturing species, with important consequences in terms of fisheries management and conservation.

40|$|The present work {{provides}} {{a detailed analysis}} of the reproductive strategy of the <b>undulate</b> <b>ray</b> Raja undulata in Portuguese mainland waters. The species was found mostly between 30 and 40 m deep on sandy bottoms. Egg-laying sites were observed in the north, centre and south-west regions, mainly at depths below 30 m. The peak of the reproductive season occurred from December to May. Asynchrony between reproductively active females and males appeared to occur, although most adult males were capable of reproducing throughout the year. The estimated length at 50 % maturity was 862 cm (87 years) and 768 cm (76 years) total length for females and males, respectively. The maximum potential fecundity was estimated to be 698 follicles per female per reproductive season, which are released in 47 batches of 15 follicles. The life-history and demographic parameters of R. undulata {{are similar to those of}} other skate species, while the potential rate of population increase (049) is above the published values for other elasmobranch species. With these new findings, this study makes an important contribution to the understanding of the life history of R. undulata, and {{provides a}} first evaluation of the productivity and susceptibility of the species to exploitation...|$|R
40|$|The 2 m {{beam trawl}} and 1. 5 m push net {{were used to}} sample the small epibenthic fish {{assemblage}} during September on the east and south coasts of England. Fishing stations were distributed along the entire coast within four depth bands to 20 m. A total of 104 species were caught between 1973 and 1995, and these included infrequent Lusitanean species such as the big-scale sand-smelt (Atherina boyeri), and the <b>undulate</b> <b>ray</b> (Raja undulata), and infrequent boreal species such as the Norway haddock (Sebastes viviparus). Fifty-four taxa were selected as representative of the small, demersal inshore fish community that would be most vulnerable to capture by the two sampling gears, and were used in subsequent analyses of community structure. The north-east coast assemblage was the least diverse (H*= 1. 58) and least even (J*= 0. 47). It also supported the least number of species (55), and the variation in catch of the only dominant genus, Pomatoschistus spp., was partly responsible for large year-to-year variations in diversity and in the total population abundance of selected demersal species. On the east and south-east coasts, both diversity (H*= 1. 78 and 1. 93) and evenness (J*= 0. 50 and 0. 51) were greater than in the north, {{as a result of}} large...|$|R
40|$|Maximum {{total length}} 85 cm. • One row of 20 – 55 thorns along midline on males, three on females. • Upper surface from light yellow to black. • Pattern of dark wavy bands lined with twin row of white spots. • Other larger white spots add to pattern. • Lower surface white with dark margins. The {{leading edge of}} the disc undulates from the snout to the wingtips, giving the species its name. The dorsal surface, except for the rear quarters, is covered with small prickles with a dense patch on the snout region. The dorsal fins are widely spaced, {{normally}} with two dorsal spines between them. Median spines are scattered in adults, regular on young. Males have one row of 20 - 55 median thorns while females have three (Whitehead et al., 1986). Colouration ranges from almost black to light yellow-brown with dark wavy bands lined by a twin row of white spots. Other white spots add to the complex pattern. The underside is white with dark margins (Barnes, 2008). Some sources claim total lengths for the <b>Undulate</b> <b>Ray</b> of up to 100 cm but the largest reliable reports are closer to 85 cm. Coelho et al (2005) found the maximum total length for males was 88. 2 cm and 83. 2 cm for females (Coelho et al., 2005). This suggests that there is little sexual dimorphism...|$|R
