2500|$|This is an {{exciting}} portion of the race for dogs and musher, as {{it is one of}} the few portions of the race where there are spectators, and the only spot where the trail winds through an urban environment. However, in [...] "Iditarod Dreams", DeeDee Jonrowe wrote, [...] "A lot of mushers hate the Anchorage start. They don't like crowds. They worry that their dogs get too excited and jumpy. The time for covering this portion of the race does not count toward the official race time, so the dogs, musher, and Idita-Rider are free to take this all in at a relaxed pace. The mushers then continue through several miles of city streets and city trails before reaching the foothills to the east of Anchorage, in Chugach State Park in the Chugach Mountains. The teams then follow Glenn Highway for two to three hours until they reach Eagle River, [...] away. Once they arrive at the Veterans of Foreign Wars building, the mushers check in, <b>unharness</b> their teams, return them to their boxes, and drive [...] of highway to the restart point.|$|E

500|$|The Icelandic {{government}} {{also believes that}} there are many more untapped geothermal sources throughout the country, estimating that over 20 TWh per year of <b>unharnessed</b> geothermal energy is available. This is about 3.3% of the 600TWh per year of electricity used in Germany. [...] Combined with the <b>unharnessed</b> feasible hydropower, tapping these sources to their full extent would provide Iceland another 50 TWh of energy per year, all from renewable sources.|$|R
50|$|At Sentosa, teams {{rode the}} MegaZip, a 1476 ft long zip-line. After <b>unharnessing</b> from the MegaZip, teams {{received}} their next clue.|$|R
60|$|So Mr. George and Rollo dismounted, and the hostlers {{came out}} from the stable to <b>unharness</b> the horses.|$|E
60|$|He halted {{near the}} camp-fire, and, clambering down, began to <b>unharness</b> the team. Florence leaped out {{and turned to}} help Madeline.|$|E
6000|$|From the /jacals/ came a cry of: [...] "El Amo! El Amo!" [...] Four Mexican youths {{raced to}} <b>unharness</b> the greys. The cowpunchers gave a yell of {{greeting}} and delight.|$|E
50|$|Driving {{with a dog}} or any pet can be very dangerous. An uncaged or <b>unharnessed</b> animal can be a {{constant}} distraction.|$|R
60|$|Half an hour later, {{the hill}} was climbed {{and the dogs}} <b>unharnessed</b> at the cabin door, the sixty stampeders grimly attendant.|$|R
60|$|So they <b>unharnessed</b> Jim {{and took}} the saddle off the Sawhorse, and the two queerly matched animals were stood side by side for the start.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{cried the}} Englishman, seizing the reins {{near the mouth}} of the terrified animal and holding its head {{forcibly}} down, while Le Rue assisted the owner to <b>unharness.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Will <b>unharness</b> my horse!" [...] went on Job Haskers. [...] "Will {{throw me}} on {{my head in the}} snow! Oh, you imp!" [...] And he {{continued}} to shake poor Nat until the latter's teeth rattled.|$|E

60|$|The {{horses were}} <b>unharnessed</b> and the {{carriage}} backed {{in among the}} trees, where {{it would not be}} seen by any one who might pass during the night.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the mice}} were <b>unharnessed</b> {{from the truck}} and scampered away through the grass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice {{was the last to}} leave.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] said Miss Ashley, {{taking the}} reins from {{my hands in}} a way not to be disputed. [...] "I always <b>unharness</b> Charley myself. No one understands him half so well. Besides, I'm used to it. Didn't I tell you I'd always been Father's boy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{descending}} short steep pitches, <b>unharness</b> the cattle, and [...] "fasten a rope {{round the}} axle of the wagon; then passing {{the other end}} round a tree or rock as a check, you may let her slide, which she will do without any further trouble on your part." [...] (F. Marryat.) ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{an awkward}} mix-up. The sled was upside down and jammed between a tree-trunk and a huge rock, and {{they were forced to}} <b>unharness</b> the dogs in order to {{straighten}} out the tangle. The two men were bent over the sled and trying to right it, when Henry observed One Ear sidling away.|$|E
60|$|The hunters saw sharply defined hoof-marks, {{not unlike}} the tracks of reindeer, except that they were longer. The tepee was {{set up on the}} spot and the dogs <b>unharnessed.</b>|$|R
60|$|So Zeb <b>unharnessed</b> Jim, {{and several}} of the {{servants}} then led the horse around to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that he could have all to himself.|$|R
60|$|The Wizard got out {{his sword}} at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip. Dorothy {{climbed into the}} buggy, {{although}} Jim had been <b>unharnessed</b> from it and was grazing some distance away.|$|R
60|$|Zeb {{walked down}} again to <b>unharness</b> Jim, who, {{when he found}} himself free, rolled over {{a few times and}} then settled down to sleep, with Eureka {{nestling}} comfortably beside his big, boney body. Then the boy returned to one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glass bench was soon deep in slumberland.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once {{across the}} desert, mother," [...] he said, as the sorry-looking team was {{drawn up by}} the side of the pool, and he began to <b>unharness</b> the horses while his father went in search of game for supper, [...] "and then we shall be well on our way to the old home we had no {{business}} to leave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's {{where we}} eat," [...] he announced. [...] "I thought it'd {{be better to}} have a lunch by {{ourselves}} than atop {{at one of these}} roadside dinner counters. An' now, just to make everything safe an' comfortable, I'm goin' to <b>unharness</b> the horses. We got lots of time. You can get the lunch basket out an' spread it on the lap-robe." ...|$|E

60|$|Reuben and I <b>unharnessed</b> our {{horses and}} saw them cared for in silence. We then {{entered the house}} and ascended to our chambers, still without a word. Outside his room door my friend paused.|$|R
60|$|Hare {{saw that}} they {{had come up with}} the other wagons. George Naab was leading a team down a rocky declivity to a pool of yellow water. The other boys were <b>unharnessing</b> and unsaddling.|$|R
60|$|They {{spoke in}} low tones {{as they passed}} around the house under great oak trees {{and came to a}} stop before a small barn. They did not wait to <b>unharness.</b> Tying the horses, they started to explore. The pitch from the bench to the meadow was steep yet thickly wooded with oaks and manzanita. As they crashed through the {{underbrush}} they startled a score of quail into flight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your father {{meant that}} I would look after you," [...] she said, [...] "and I mean to, but I can't {{afford to keep}} you here. You'll have a good place at Mr. Robins', if you behave yourself. I'm {{going to take you}} down now, before I <b>unharness</b> the pony, so go and wash your face while I put up your things. Don't look so woebegone, for pity's sake! I'm not taking you to prison." ...|$|E
60|$|When we returned, Pomona saw us drive in,--she had {{not known}} of our ride,--and {{when she heard the}} news she was as wild with proud delight as anybody. She wanted to <b>unharness</b> him, but this I could not allow. We did not wish to be selfish, but after she had seen and heard what we thought was enough for her, we were obliged to send her back to the kitchen {{for the sake of the}} dinner.|$|E
60|$|They had not <b>unharnessed</b> their horses, but {{had slipped}} the bridles from {{them that they}} might make a dinner from the rich grass, and yet be ready for a start at a moment's notice.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By all means. I shall {{enjoy the}} walk after--:' and she stopped. [...] In {{a moment the}} dog-cart had rattled off, with a parting curse from the squire to the servants, who were <b>unharnessing</b> the horses.|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} the mail-cart man had joined her, and began {{dragging}} and <b>unharnessing</b> the hot form of Prince. But he was already dead, and, seeing that nothing more could be done immediately, the mail-cart man returned to his own animal, which was uninjured.|$|R
