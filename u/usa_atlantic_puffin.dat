5|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> is {{a species}} of seabird in the order Charadriiformes. It is in the auk family, Alcidae, which {{includes}} the guillemots, typical auks, murrelets, auklets, puffins and the razorbill. The rhinoceros auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata) and the puffins are closely related, together composing the tribe Fraterculini. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> is the only species in the genus Fratercula {{to occur in the}} Atlantic Ocean. Two other species are known from the northeast Pacific, the tufted puffin (Fratercula cirrhata) and the horned puffin (Fratercula corniculata), the latter being the closest relative of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Puffins {{breed in}} colonies on coasts and islands; several {{current or former}} island {{breeding}} sites {{are referred to as}} Puffin Island. The male <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> builds the nest and exhibits strong nest-site fidelity. Both sexes of the horned puffin help to construct their nest. Horned puffin burrows are usually about [...] deep, ending in a chamber, while the tunnel leading to a tufted puffin burrow may be up to [...] long. The nesting substrate of the tufted and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffins</b> is soft soil, into which tunnels are dug; in contrast the nesting sites of horned puffins are rock crevices on cliffs. The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> burrow is usually lined with material such as grass, leaves and feathers but is occasionally unlined. The eggs of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> are typically creamy white but the odd egg is tinged lilac.|$|R

500|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> is the {{official}} bird symbol of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. In August 2007, the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> was proposed as {{the official}} symbol of the Liberal Party of Canada by its deputy leader Michael Ignatieff, after he observed a colony of these birds and became fascinated by their behaviour. The Norwegian municipality of Værøy has an <b>Atlantic</b> <b>puffin</b> as its civic emblem. Puffins are viewed with affection because they are colourful and full of character. They {{have been given a}} number of endearing names including [...] "clowns of the sea" [...] and [...] "sea parrots", and juvenile puffins may be called [...] "pufflings".|$|R

40|$|Barrett, R. T. 2001. The {{breeding}} demography and egg size of North Norwegian <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Puffins</b> Fratercula arctica and Razorbills Alca torda during 20 {{years of}} climatic variability. Atlantic Seabirds 3 (3) : 97 - 112. The mean egg-laying dates of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Puffins</b> Fratercula arctica and Razorbills Alca torda in north-eastern 'orway varied between 13 - 30 May and 21 May- 2 June respectively {{in the years}} 1980 - 1982 and 1988 - 2000. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Puffins</b> laid on average 7 days before Razorbills, and the mean spread of laying dates each year was larger (22 days) for the former than the latter (19 days). There were significant correlations between egg-laying dates and air and sea temperatures in April and May, with lower temperatures resulting in delays in laying {{at a rate of}} 1 - 4 days °C- 1. Late access to nesting sites due to snow and ice in burrows might explain some of the delay in egg-laying during cold springs. Such variation should be considered when planning field trips to monitor breeding populations. There was no inter-annual variation in the mean volumes of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Puffin</b> eggs. Although Razorbill egg volume did vary between years, it was not influenced by either sea or air temperatures. This suggests that neither species adjusted egg size in order to advance laying dates...|$|R

40|$|Determining which {{demographic}} and ecological parameters contribute to variation in popu-lation growth rate {{is crucial to}} understanding the dynamics of declining populations. This study aimed to evaluate the magnitude and mechanisms of an apparent major decline in an <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Puffin</b> Fratercula arctica population. This was achieved using a 27 -year dataset to estimate changes in population size and in two key demographic rates: adult survival and breeding success. Estimated demographic variation was then related to two ecological fac-tors hypothesised to be key drivers of demographic change, namely the abundance of the main predator at the study site, the Great Skua Stercorarius skua, and <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Puffin</b> chick food supply, over the same 27 -year period. Using a population model, we assessed whether estimated variation in adult survival and reproductive success was sufficient to explain the population change observed. Estimates of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Puffin</b> population size decreased considerably during the study period, approximately halving, whereas Great Skua population estimates increased, approximately trebling. Estimated adult Atlantic Puf-fin survival remained high across all years and did not vary with Great Skua abundance...|$|R
