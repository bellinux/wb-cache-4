However, as of September 2006, the <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> have never fallen below national average, indicating improvement. In the second quarters of both 2005 and 2007, the firms' wages were increased by 21%, twice more than national increases, indicating even further improvement, although the gains were varied across the sectors.|$|E

Endara's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also high <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates.</b> His administration was marked by internal fighting and corruption scandals, and his popularity plummeted. He was succeeded by opposition candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares on September 1, 1994.|$|E

5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s {{by the collapse}} of the northern cod fishery, which had been the driving force of the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E

In 1886 the Chamberlain Circular encouraged the Local Government Board to set up work projects when <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> were high rather than use workhouses. In 1905 the Conservatives passed the Unemployed Workman Act which provided for temporary employment for workers in times of unemployment.|$|E
5|$|A dam on Nescopeck Creek was {{destroyed}} during Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In the early 1900s, {{there was a}} steam-electric power station {{at the mouth of}} Nescopeck Creek. The Wilkes-Barre and Hazleton Railway passed over Nescopeck Creek {{in the beginning of the}} 1900s. The Jeddo Tunnel, which drained a colliery in the 20th century, emptied into Nescopeck Creek. After World War II, there was a large increase in <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> in the Nescopeck Creek watershed due to the failing coal mining industry. From 1919 to 1926, the United States Geological Survey had a station on Nescopeck Creek near the community of St. Johns. Two other stream gauging stations have been built on Nescopeck Creek. One of these stations, which was in use from 1949 to 1950 was in Nescopeck. The other, which was in use from 1963 to 1970, was 0.6 miles upstream of Nescopeck Creek's mouth. In the 1990s, some people were caught stealing Native American artifacts at the Nescopeck Creek headwaters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} {{part of the}} {{population}} worked in coal mining, although there are no working mines in the area now. There is still a fairly large agricultural workforce and in light industry or service industries, although many people commute to surrounding cities for work. According to the 2011 Census the valley has a population of approximately 5,000, largely living in one of the dozen or so villages and in isolated farms and hamlets. The average age of the population is 42 years, with <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> of 1–4% of all economically active people aged 16–74, however these figures are approximations because the ward areas covered and described in the census statistics do not relate exactly to the area of the valley. In the Indices of deprivation 2010 all of the areas within the valley were considered to be in the most affluent third in England.|$|E
40|$|In 1982, the United States {{experienced}} the highest annual <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> since the Great Depression – 9. 7 percent. In principle, that rate is directly {{comparable to the}} 8. 1 percent seasonally adjusted <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> for February 2009, and suggests that current unemployment is still {{not as bad as}} it was in 1982. The official <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate,</b> however, masks two important differences between the <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> in 1982 and today. The first difference is demographic. In 1982, the US population was substantially younger than it is today. Even in an otherwise identical economy, we would expect a younger population to have a higher <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> than an older population would. The second difference is statistical. The main government survey used to measure the <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> – the Current Population Survey (CPS) reaches a smaller share of the population today than it did in 1982, and is especially likely to miss people who are not employed. As a result, the official <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> understates the <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> relative to 1982. <b>unemployment,</b> <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{asymmetric}} {{behavior of}} <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> is investigated between years 1923 and 2011. In this regard, we employ linear unit root tests and Markov Switching model. According to unit root test results, <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> data is not stationary in level, {{while the first}} difference of data is stationary. Markov switching analysis {{results indicate that the}} <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> behaves asymmetrically between years 1923 and 1950, continuously. In the light of these results, it is understood that the structure of <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> is nonlinear and it moves between two regimes. Another important result is that there are rigidities in <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> after 50 ’s. The <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> does not decrease below percentage 7 since 1974, except 1996, 1998 and 2000.

5|$|Much of the Turkish Cypriot {{migration}} to the UK occurred {{as a consequence of}} intercommunal violence in Cyprus during the 1950s and 1960s. Many Turkish Cypriots viewed the EOKA insurgency as an attempt on the part of Greek Cypriots to establish hegemony on the island with the aim of achieving union with Greece. By 1958, there were around 8,500 Turkish Cypriots in Britain. Between 1960 and 1962, the inflow increased substantially because of a fear that Britain would impose immigration controls, and indeed the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 did reduce migration flows from Cyprus to Britain. Although the expansion of Britain's Turkish Cypriot community took place primarily between the late 1940s and the mid-1960s, there was a further influx of around 3,000 immigrants after partition in 1974. Migration continued because of the political and economic situation in the 1970s and 1980s, and Turkish Cypriots have continued to migrate to the UK due to high <b>unemployment</b> <b>rates</b> in northern Cyprus. In the early 1980s, it was estimated that 160,000 Cypriots were resident in the UK, 20 to 25 per cent of them being Turkish Cypriots. Since Cyprus joined the European Union in May 2004, holders of Republic of Cyprus passports have been able to migrate freely to the UK under EU law.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> in the heavily indebted and less {{developed}} EU countries {{is currently on}} the margins of both media interest and policy debates. This paper compares the influence of several economic variables on the total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> and the youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate.</b> The countries that are studied are three countries with the highest youth unemployment rate: Greece, Croatia and Spain, and three countries with the lowest youth unemployment rate: Germany, Denmark and the Czech Republic. By implementing an Autoregressive Distributed Lags (ARDL) approach, this paper concludes that the youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> is significantly more affected by the increase of the public debt-to-GDP ratio in comparison to the total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> in Croatia and Spain. This paper finds significant differences in the factors that impact youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> in comparison to total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate.</b> Notably, the impact of economic growth is far stronger in decreasing total <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> than youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate.</b> The main conclusion of this paper is {{that there should be a}} new European economic framework that will focus on combating rising youth <b>unemployment</b> <b>rate</b> in order to avoid potentially dangerous consequences and restore faith in the EU and national institutions which has still not recovered from the 2008 crisis...|$|R
