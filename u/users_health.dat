40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel recommendation algorithm that generates recommendations {{and suggestions for}} preventive intervention.

The purpose of recommendation algorithm is to give a recommendation for performing a specific activity that will improve <b>user’s</b> <b>health,</b> based on his given health condition and set of knowledge derived from the history of the user and users like him. The aim of the recommendation algorithm is to discover which activities affect change in the value of each health parameter individually. Once revealed, algorithm can use that information in situations it recognizes as same or similar to previous health conditions of a same or another user with similar medical condition. If there is evidence in users’ history, that the execution of a certain physical activity has improved <b>user</b> <b>health</b> parameters and condition, it can be concluded that the activity can help him or other <b>users</b> with similar <b>health</b> issues and improve their health condition.

The suit is {{designed to protect the}} user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of hazardous materials. The suits main feature is its [...] "high-impact reactive armor", an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer. A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an RPG. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in flashlight, a radio, various tracking devices, a compass, and a Geiger counter. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the <b>users</b> <b>health</b> and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the users condition. It also projects a heads-up display (HUD) which displays Gordons health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair.As a means of immersing the player in the role, Gordon never speaks, and there are no cutscenes or mission briefings—all action is viewed through Gordons eyes, with the player retaining control of Gordons actions at nearly all times. The images of Gordon are only seen on the games cover and menu pages, and also in advertisements, making them marketing tools rather than pictures of what Gordon is [...] "really like". Gabe Newell has stated that Valve sees no reason to give Gordon a voice.|$|E
