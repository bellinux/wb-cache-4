IMA Lab was designed to address museum-specific technology needs not currently met by software vendors and to provide consulting services to museums and nonprofit organizations that want to <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> to help solve problems and meet objectives. IMA Lab projects include TAP, steve.museum, and the IMA Dashboard. TAP is a mobile tour application for iPod Touch that presents visitors with content related to the IMA's collection, such as artist interviews, text and audio files, and pictures. Steve.museum, for which IMA Lab is the technical lead, is a project that explores social tagging as {{a new way to}} describe collections and make them more accessible.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{researched and}} reported on how <b>technology</b> was <b>used</b> to facilitate and inform reflective teaching practices. It also identified {{the characteristics of}} benefits and barriers in <b>using</b> <b>technology</b> for teaching and reflection. The study, descriptive in nature, was designed to determine the reflective practices of instructors and how emerging <b>technologies</b> could be <b>used</b> to enhance that reflection. To obtain this information, a Grounded Theory approach was used. Data were gathered and evaluated from {{a national survey of}} instructors on their teaching practices, <b>technology</b> <b>used</b> in teaching, how they reflected on their teaching, how they <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> to reflect on their teaching, and barriers to <b>using</b> <b>technology</b> for teaching and reflection. Seventy-three completed survey responses were received and coded into code families. These individual codes and code families were then analyzed to determine themes on how instructors <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> for more effective reflection on their teaching. The findings identified a number of themes related to (a) reflective teaching practices, (b) how instructors <b>used</b> <b>technology</b> to reflect on teaching, (c) the characteristics of learning technologies that supported reflective teaching practices, and (d) the barriers to <b>using</b> these <b>technologies.</b> The themes showed examples of how reflecting with technology supports effective teaching and learning...|$|R
25|$|Techno-liberals {{look for}} change. By their nature, they're not {{satisfied}} with the way things are and want {{to find new ways to}} do things. Liberals in technology arena move a society forward as the opportunists. Technoliberalism is actually more about civil liberties and individual rights such as Free Internet, Net neutrality for landline Internet not for mobile or satellites, gun control and Pro abortion, etc. Techno-liberalism represents socio-cultural perspectives that imply all human endeavors. This includes how we develop and <b>use</b> <b>technology,</b> especially computer technology. In the technology arena, liberalism normally points to innovation and risk-taking. Furthermore, if you're a techno-liberal in information technology, the future can't come soon enough. For those who see the true promise of the web for multi-media and as a general platform for application software, the Internet is still far too slow and primitive.|$|E

[...] " [...] is hardly obvious in his work." [...] Though if his early work had been mild attempts to <b>use</b> <b>technology,</b> Cyberpunk itself, Robbins wrote, was [...] "the sound of science gone too far." [...] The ideology of futurism Idol adopted was panned by Robbins, while the music itself was hardly different from his previous work. [...] "For the most part, other than keyboards that add a pervasive nod to the jittering beat of techno-rave music, Cyberpunk sounds pretty much like every other Idol album." ...|$|E
500|$|The International Cricket Council (ICC), {{responsible}} for running the game worldwide, conducted {{a trial in}} 2002 where lbw appeals could be referred to a match official, the third umpire, to review on television replays. The third umpire could only <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> to determine where the ball had pitched and if the batsman hit the ball with his bat. The ICC judged the experiment unsuccessful and did not pursue it. More trials followed in 2006, although ball-tracking technology remained unavailable to match officials. After a further series of trials, in 2009 the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) was brought into international cricket where teams could refer the on-field decisions of umpires to a third umpire who had access to television replays and technology such as ball tracking. According to the ICC's general manager, Dave Richardson, DRS increased {{the frequency with which}} umpires awarded lbw decisions. In a 2012 interview, he said: [...] "Umpires may have realised that if they give someone out and DRS shows it was not out, then their decision can be rectified. So they might, I suppose, have the courage of their convictions a bit more and take a less conservative approach to giving the batsman out. I think if we're totally honest, DRS has affected the game slightly more than we thought it would." ...|$|E

Both novels use an ancient, almost primitive threat to modern, [...] "Western" [...] technology and ideology (The Raft in Snow Crash and The Fists of Righteous Harmony in The Diamond Age).

2500|$|Richey defined {{educational}} technology as [...] "the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources". The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) denoted instructional technology as [...] "the {{theory and practice}} of design, development, utilization, management, and evaluation of processes and resources for learning". As such, {{educational technology}} refers to all valid and reliable applied education sciences, such as equipment, as well as processes and procedures that are derived from scientific research, and in a given context may refer to theoretical, algorithmic or heuristic processes: it does not necessarily imply physical technology.

2500|$|Yet, because {{technology}} is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies, Hughes argues that engineers, scientists, and managers have often {{believed that they}} can <b>use</b> <b>technology</b> to shape the world as they want.

For instance, Evgeny Morozov particularly challenges two concepts: “Internet-centrism” and “solutionism." [...] Internet-centrism refers {{to the idea that}} our society is convinced that the Internet {{is one of the most}} stable and coherent forces. Solutionism is the ideology that every social issue can be solved thanks to technology and especially thanks to the internet. In fact, technology intrinsically contains uncertainties and limitations. According to Alexis Madrigal's review of Morozov's theory, to ignore it will lead to “unexpected consequences that could eventually cause more damage than the problems they seek to address."
