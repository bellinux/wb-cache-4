The World Bank International Debt Statistics (previosuly Global Development Finance) contains more than 200 debt and financial flows indicators for over 130 countries that report public and publicly-guaranteed debt to the World Bank Debtor Reporting System. The database runs from 1970 onwards and covers external debt stocks and flows, major economic aggregates, and key debt ratios as well as average terms of new commitments, currency composition of long-term debt, debt restructuring, and scheduled debt service projections. These data were first provided by the UK Data Service in February 2004. The UK Data Service web site includes further information on its World Bank International Debt Statistics holdings, including a dataset user guide and details of latest database updates.
