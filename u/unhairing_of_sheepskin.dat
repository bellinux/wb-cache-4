25|$|Being {{one of many}} {{clothing}} {{products made}} from animal skin, the production <b>of</b> <b>sheepskin</b> boots {{has been the subject}} of criticism by the animal rights movement with producers responding by improving animal welfare. Animal rights groups call for the boycott <b>of</b> <b>sheepskin</b> boots and their replacement with synthetic alternatives. In 2007, Pamela Anderson, realizing that the boots were made of skin, called for a boycott on her website. In February 2008, the Princeton Animal Welfare Society staged a campus protest against the fur industry, particularly attacking the sheepskin boot industry.|$|R
40|$|Considerable recent {{research}} {{both for the}} developing {{as well as the}} developed countries has provided evidence for the existence <b>of</b> the <b>sheepskin</b> effect to the economic returns in schooling investment. However, there has not been much empirical work investigating the mechanism that may lie behind the observed sheepskin effects. The few notable exceptions that have started addressing this important yet neglected question of interpreting what do sheepskin effects signal include Flores-Lagunes and Light (2007) for the U. S., Riddell (2008) for Canada and Shabbir and Ashraf (2011) as well as Shabbir (2011) in the case of Pakistan. The present study was undertaken to examine the robustness <b>of</b> <b>sheepskin</b> effects in the face of measured family background in the case of Pakistan. The unique feature {{of this study is that}} it utilizes the only nationally representative data set available which allows for a test <b>of</b> <b>sheepskin</b> effects; in fact, Shabbir (1991) was the first of its kind study which used this data set to test (and establish) the existence <b>of</b> <b>sheepskin</b> effects in the case of Pakistan.

These are among the first broad-based results confirming the frequent contention derived from signaling models that minorities have smaller returns to low productivity signals, but larger returns to high productivity signals.

INTRODUCTION Education has long displayed a strong positive correlation with earnings but the causality has always been disputed [McConnell (1992) ]. Does education really raise one's ability to work? Or are those whose inherent ability to work well the people that perform well in school? Education, particularly the attainment of certificates which are so important in the `paper chase,' may just serve as a convenient tool for employers to screen potential employees for pre-existing abilities to work.

However, following increasing environmental legislation restricting the disposal of commercial and industrial organic wastes to landfill, alternative treatment of tannery solid hair waste is necessary. The overall aim of this research was to develop conditions favourable for the decomposition of bovine hair waste in a composting environment. In this study, chemical pretreatments of bovine hair were carried out to enhance susceptibility to enzymatic digestion. Pretreatment using a combination of potassium thioglycolate and sodium hydroxide enhanced enzymatic digestibility of hair. Comparative solubilisation of black, brown and white hair samples with sodium sulfide showed that, the percentage soluble nitrogen, from white hair was 73...|$|R
