5|$|The {{brains of}} humans and other {{primates}} contain the same structures as the brains of other mammals, but are generally larger in proportion to body size. The encephalization quotient (EQ) is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> brain sizes across species. It {{takes into account the}} nonlinearity of the brain-to-body relationship. Humans have an average EQ in the 7-to-8 range, while most other primates have an EQ in the 2-to-3 range. Dolphins have values higher than those of primates other than humans, but nearly all other mammals have EQ values that are substantially lower.|$|E

Victor Zarnowitz evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. From 1834 to 1929, one measure of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, which can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> recessions.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} decision criteria {{in the business}} insurance sector. Decision criteria can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> evaluate and <b>compare</b> and evaluate offers before taking a purchasing decision. The research identifies key decision criteria that {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) in Sweden <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> and evaluate B 2 B insurances before taking a purchasing decision. This leads to the understanding of criteria affecting customer preference. The criteria quality, performance, reliability, flexibility and deductible are included. Â  The result showed that there is a relationship between performance, flexibility, reliability and customer preference. These criteria affect customer preference and thereby also the choice of business insurance provider. No relationship between deductible, quality and customer preference was detected. The study concludes that flexibility, performance and reliability are key decision criteria business customers <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> and evaluate B 2 B insurances. It is suggested that insurance companies emphasize these criteria in their sales and marketing efforts in order to gain competitive advantage...|$|R
