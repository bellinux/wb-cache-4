As communication speeds have increased, high speed and resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have become necessary. ADCs have traditionally relied on comparing an input voltage to a reference voltage and digitizing the result. The increased {{speed of operation}} requires faster processes, which in turn limit the <b>usable</b> <b>input</b> voltage <b>range</b> due to breakdown voltage limitations. The work presented in this thesis studies two aspects of ADCs and possible alternate implementations to address existing limitations. A sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) is a common first stage for ADCs. At high frequencies, the SHA provides valuable timing relief to subsequent stages. Biasing of the high speed circuits consumes valuable headroom in low voltage circuits, limiting operation of existing architectures to supply voltages of at least 1. 8 V. An alternative architecture is presented that allows reduced supply voltages to be used. An alternative core ADC architecture is also discussed. The implementation chosen utilizes a time measurement system that quantizes time instead of voltage. A phase delay proportional to the input voltage is first generated. This signal is then quantized using a time-to-digital converter. The use of active devices in the clock path is eliminated, allowing for increase operation speed while delay generation is accomplished with varactors, allowing for large voltage swings on the input signal...|$|R
40|$|Q: My ADC has a 1. 8 -V power supply. How can {{it have a}} 2 -V p-p <b>input</b> <b>range?</b> A: The latest {{generation}} of low-power, high-speed ADCs—manufactured on fine-line silicon processes—run on low-voltage supplies. ADC designers face a tradeoff between making the <b>input</b> <b>range</b> bigger to get better signal-to-noise ratio (larger signals provide higher SNR), and making the <b>input</b> <b>range</b> smaller to ease the drive requirements. Over the years we’ve seen ADCs with 5 -V supplies and 4 -V p-p <b>input</b> <b>ranges,</b> and 3 -V supplies with 2 -V p-p <b>input</b> <b>ranges,</b> but these didn’t raise any eyebrows. Over the past few years, however, we’ve seen a host of ADCs with 1. 8 -V supplies and 2 -V p-p <b>input</b> <b>ranges.</b> These raise some seemingly reasonable questions: How can the ADC have a 2 -V p-p <b>input</b> voltage <b>range</b> while running on 1. 8 -V supplies? Doesn’t this require the signal to exceed the supply rails? The overlooked detail, of course, is that the analog input signal to most high-speed ADCs is differential. Transmitted as complementary single-ended signal pairs on the VIN+ and VIN – pins, the differential input signal VINDIFF = VIN+ – VIN–. The single-ended components, centered within the supply rails, swing only half the amplitude of the differential signal, with a typical commonmode voltage of VSUPPLY/ 2...|$|R

CMOS inverters can operate from low power supply voltage; however, they have very narrow linear <b>input</b> <b>range,</b> and they are slngle-end amplifiers. Thus, we need common-mode suppression device when inverters are used to realize differential amplifiers. First, We analyzed a simple CMOS inverter and discussed requlrements to construct differential amplifier with inverters. Next, we analyzed three existing Pseudo-differential 0 TAs, which are inverter-based OTAs, for their common-mode input ranges･ assuming 0. 18 μm CMOS process. Finally, the common-mode <b>input</b> <b>ranges</b> are {{compared with that of}} a simple differential pair. We found that the inverter-based OTAs have comparable common-mode <b>input</b> <b>range</b> at 1. 8 V power supply voltage; however, they have much wider common-mode <b>input</b> <b>range</b> at 1. 0 V power supply voltage, than a simple differential pair.

40|$|The {{resolution}} of commercial ADCs is specified in bits. In an ADC, the available resolution equals (2 n) – 1, where n {{is the number}} of bits.

It enables {{the development of a}} wide range of high performance analog ICs capable of 33 V operation in a footprint that no previous generation of high voltage parts could achieve. Unlike analog ICs using conventional CMOS processes, iCMOS components can accept bipolar input signals while providing increased performance, dramatically reduced power consumption, and reduced package size. The AD 7321 can accept true bipolar analog input signals. The AD 7321 has four software-selectable <b>input</b> <b>ranges,</b> ± 10 V, ± 5 V, ± 2. 5 V, and 0 V to + 10 V. Each analog input channel is independently programmed to one of the four <b>input</b> <b>ranges.</b> The analog <b>input</b> channels on the AD 7321 are programmed to be single-ended, true differential, or pseudo differential. The ADC contains a 2. 5 V internal reference. The AD 7321 also allows for external reference operation. If a 3 V reference is applied to the REFIN/OUT pin, the AD 7321 can accept a true bipolar ± 12 V analog input.

On the contrary of most traditional approaches for implementing CMOS multipliers, the proposed configuration is valid in the whole inversion regime of the MOS transistor, providing wide <b>input</b> <b>range</b> and improved linearity. The main theoretical principle of our multiplier lies on the quadratic relationship between the forward saturation component of drain current and source transconductance, according to ACM model. A current signal is converted into source transconductance through a device operating in the linear region and this transconductance is mirrored to another device operating in saturation.

40|$|The {{trend in}} ADCs and DACs is toward higher speeds and higher resolutions at reduced power levels. Modern data {{converters}} generally operate on ± 5 V (dual supply) or + 5 V (single supply). In fact, many new converters {{operate on a}} single + 3 V supply. This trend has created a number of design and applications problems which were much less important in earlier data converters, where ± 15 V supplies and ± 10 V <b>input</b> <b>ranges</b> were the standard. Lower supply voltages imply smaller <b>input</b> voltage <b>ranges,</b> and hence more susceptibility to noise from all potential sources: power supplies, references, digital signals, EMI/RFI, and probably most important, improper layout, grounding, and decoupling techniques.

40|$|Abstract. State {{explosion}} in model checking {{continues to be}} the primary obstacle to widespread use of software model checking. The large <b>input</b> <b>ranges</b> of variables used in software is the main cause of state explosion. As software grows in size and complexity, the problem only becomes worse. As such, model checking research into data abstraction as a way of mitigating state explosion has become more and more important. Data abstractions aim to reduce the effect of large <b>input</b> <b>ranges.</b> This work focuses on a static program analysis technique called dead variable analysis. The goal of dead variable analysis is to discover variable assignments that are not used. When applied to model checking, this allows us to ignore the entire <b>input</b> <b>range</b> of dead variables and thus reduce the size of the explored state space. Prior research into dead variable analysis for model checking does not make full use of dynamic run-time information that is present during model checking. We present an algorithm for intraprocedural dead variable analysis that uses dynamic run-time information to find more dead variables on-the-fly and further reduce the size of the explored state space. We introduce a definition for the maximal state space reduction possible through an on-the-fly dead variable analysis and then show that our algorithm produces a maximal reduction in the absence of nondeterminism. ...|$|R
