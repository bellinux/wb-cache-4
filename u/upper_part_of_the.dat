5|$|Nearly {{all of the}} {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek is biologically degraded, with the only exceptions being several headwater streams. However, the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed is less severely degraded than the lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|A nearly {{vertical}} {{region of}} the HR diagram, known as the instability strip, is occupied by pulsating variable stars known as Cepheid variables. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main sequence {{in the region of}} class A and F stars, which are between one and two solar masses. Pulsating stars {{in this part of the}} instability strip that intersects the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main sequence are called Delta Scuti variables. Main-sequence stars in this region experience only small changes in magnitude and so this variation is difficult to detect. Other classes of unstable main-sequence stars, like Beta Cephei variables, are unrelated to this instability strip.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E

There is no record of a capstone having been discovered.|$|E
5|$|The Mahanoy Creek {{watershed}} is 66 percent forested land, 21 percent agricultural land, 9 percent barren mined land, and 4 percent developed land. However, {{the upper}} part of Mahanoy Creek is 50 percent forested land, 44 percent mined land, 5 percent developed land, and less than 1 percent agricultural land. There are six boroughs in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed. There are a total of 28 municipalities in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|The upper esophageal {{sphincter}} {{surrounds the}} <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> esophagus. It consists of skeletal muscle {{but is not}} under voluntary control. Opening of the upper esophageal sphincter is triggered by the swallowing reflex.

5|$|A fire {{accident}} occurred in 1793 that destroyed the large gallery that connected the chapel {{to the north}} tower, and the west face of the large central tower was seriously damaged. The fire spread along the roofs and turrets of the northwest wing, and the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north tower was also burned. The chapel was sacked, and the flames destroyed its facade and part of its north wall. The crypt was not damaged. Most of the floors and fireplaces in the château and all the doors, windows and woodwork were irreparably destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with dead skin cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E

5|$|Basalt, mostly {{covered by}} silt in the uplands and {{sediment}} in the lowlands, underlies the Balch Creek watershed. The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> watershed includes private residential land, the Audubon Society of Portland nature sanctuary, {{and part of}} Forest Park. Mixed conifer forest of Coast Douglas-fir, western redcedar, and western hemlock with a well-developed understory of shrubs and flowering plants is the natural vegetation. Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park. A small population of coastal cutthroat trout resides in the stream, which in 2005 was the only major water body in Portland that met state standards for bacteria, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Atlético won the Campeonato Mineiro, {{and reached}} the Copa Libertadores quarter-finals and the semi-finals of Copa Mercosur, but had a bad season in the {{national}} league, the Copa João Havelange. The following year, despite a good performance in the Brasileirão with a squad that included Marques, Guilherme and Gilberto Silva, the team again was eliminated in the competition's semi-finals, eventually finishing in fourth place. Atlético then finished in the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> national league table in the following two seasons, but in 2004 it barely escaped relegation. In 2005 the club was demoted to the Série B, the second level of the Brasileirão.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{the waters}} of Beaver Lake once again receded to their lowest level since 1984, just above 1,100feet (335m). This {{generated}} a new brief interest in Monte Ne and people were once again attracted {{to the edge of}} the lake to explore the remains. The <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the never constructed pyramid were exposed for a time before being once again swallowed by the lake.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} {{begin to develop}} as an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which goes on to form the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins {{to pass through the}} lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E

5|$|In {{front of}} the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cervix lies the bladder, {{separated}} from it by cellular connective tissue known as parametrium, which also extends over {{the sides of the}} cervix. To the rear, the supravaginal cervix is covered by peritoneum, which runs onto the back of the vaginal wall and then turns upwards and onto the rectum, forming the recto-uterine pouch. The cervix is more tightly connected to surrounding structures {{than the rest of the}} uterus.|$|E
5|$|Larrys Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale {{mountain}} region, {{with the}} {{source in the}} dissected Allegheny Plateau and the mouth in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. The {{southern part of the}} Larrys Creek watershed has sedimentary surface rocks from the Devonian period, with a large area from the Mississippian period in the north of the watershed and a small Pennsylvanian period region within this area. The Cogan House anticline runs north of and parallel to the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creek. Iron ore within the watershed was mined south of Salladasburg and along Canoe Run in the 19th century; there are also deposits on Puterbaugh Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath the heart, and a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} the <b>upper</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E
