40|$|New {{ultrasonic}} reading heads {{have been}} designed at SILab. The heads include a new motor drive with an encoder for precise feedback on the reading positions. The software and acquisition data system were developed as well. The heads are suitable both for dry and underwater applications. The head for dry reading includes a water reservoir to allow the coupling with the ultrasonic bolt. Also the weight and dimensions of the heads were reduced to ease transport and handling. One prototype was fabricated at SILab for each system. On request of DG-TREN, a new <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>system</b> for dry applications is under development. It {{is based on the}} characteristics of the CASTOR® containers (dimensions, ambient and condition of operations). It includes a new upgraded ultrasonic sealing bolt, the reading head and a remote positioning system to reduce to a minimum the dose to the inspectors.

Over 80 percent of centrifugal gas compressors manufactured today are equipped with dry gas seals.

40|$|LectureFor years, {{labyrinth}} shaft-end seals {{have been}} used for centrifugal compressors handling air and nonhazardous gases, and for low suction pressure compressors in hydrocarbon service. To prevent gas leakage from the hydrocarbon machines, either injection of inert gas or jet ejector systems have been applied with the seals. The ejectors were normally arranged to exhaust back to the compressor suction. Early application of labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> were generally on compressors with suction pressures in the 0 - 8 psig range, and the <b>seal</b> <b>system</b> operation was generally satisfactory. Many of the older machines have been uprated to higher suction pressures. The labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> have been applied to newer compressors with suction pressures as high as 15 psig. Many of the systems do not perform satisfactorily, and operators complain of leakage of hydrocarbons and contamination of the lube oil. This {{may be the result of}} noncritical-flow ejectors operating with critical pressure ratios. Labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> can be designed to perform satisfactorily with the higher compressor suction pressures, but these systems often require critical-flow ejectors. Despite their relatively low initial cost, the economics of labyrinth/ejector <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> for high compressor suction pressures may not compare favorably with oil-type <b>seal</b> <b>systems</b> because of the energy required to recycle motive gas...|$|R

40|$|There is no {{wear and}} no {{friction}} with non-contacting <b>sealing</b> <b>systems.</b> Because of this, {{there is in}} principle no lifetime-limit. However, this does not apply for grease-filled labyrinth seals.

Based on the actual state of the art, this work shows the latest results of experiments to enable designers to unerringly develop non-contacting <b>sealing</b> <b>systems</b> with grease-filled gaps to seal dry particles with reliable function. To that end, a lot of experiments were done to expand existing design guidelines. Additionally, new operating instruction were found to ensure permanent operation.
