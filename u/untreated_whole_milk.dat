40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that ruminal drinking in calves can lead to d-lactic metabolic acidosis, ruminal acidosis was induced in nine calves by intraruminal application of <b>untreated</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> via a stomach tube. The amount of the daily force-fed liquid was 3 · 1 l. The experimental design called for an end of intraruminal applications if two {{or more of the following}} signs were observed: severe depression, estimated degree of dehydration> 10 %, absence of sucking reflex, lack of appetite for two consecutive feedings, severe metabolic acidosis with calculated Actual Base Excess (ABE) <) 15 mmol/l. The pro-cedure was scheduled to be discontinued on the 17 th day of experiment. The onset of ruminal acidification occurred rapidly, and mean pH value fell from 6. 70 (± 0. 48) to 4. 90 (± 0. 38) after the first application. The following days the pH values varied between 4 and 5. Rumen acidity was characterized biochemi-cally by a significant increase in both isomers of lactic acid. The effects of the intraruminal administration on the calves were detrimental; eight of nine calves showed an acute disease pro-cess. According to the pre-established clinical standard, seven of nine calves were removed from the intraruminal feeding sche-dule. All but one of the calves developed severe systemic acidosis. The increase in anion gap demonstrated the net acid load. In all the calves d-lactate levels were found to show a significant and rapid increase. On the contrary, l-lactate never deviated from physiological levels. These observations confirm that, in young calves as in adult cattle, ruminal acidosismay lead to a clinically manifested d-lactic metabolic acidosis...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Of {{the many}} {{proposals}} {{to counter the}} obesity epidemic, the most contentious {{is the use of}} the “fat tax”. Previous investigations of the efficacy of price-based initiatives in altering consumption behavior have yielded contradictory findings. METHODS We use six years of milk sales data from 1, 500 stores to investigate whether price incentives induce substitution to healthier alternatives. Retail prices of milk are either uniform across fat content level, or non-uniform- decreasing with fat content. The prevailing price structure is determined at the chain level, and is independent of local demand conditions. This exogenous variation provides a natural quasiexperiment to analyze the impact of small price differences on substitution across fat content. RESULTS When prices are uniform, <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> has the highest market share at 36. 4 %. Under non-uniform prices, 2 % milk is on average 14 cents cheaper than <b>whole</b> <b>milk,</b> and <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> share falls to 29. 7 %. Under uniform prices, <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> share for the lowest income quartile exceeds the highest income quartile by 17 percentage points. As the <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> premium over lower-fat alternatives increases, <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> share for both income groups falls, but the response is stronger for low income consumers. The discrepancy in market shares between income groups disappears with a <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> premium of 15 - 20 %. CONCLUSIONS We find that within-category demand for milk is highly elastic suggesting that taxes, if reflected in shelf prices, can serve as an effective mechanism to shift choices toward healthier options, particularly amongst lower income consumers. ...|$|R

40|$|Determination {{of correct}} feeding regimes for calves is very {{important}} as it directly influences calves’ productive and reproductive traits, as well as duration of adult animal exploitation period. As the liquid feed {{is the most expensive}} component, its importance also has an economic aspect in calves rearing. The experiment was carried out on 30 Holstein calves with the aim to determine productive, economic and health effects of feeding calves with <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> in different periods. Calves were divided into three equal groups (10 calves in each group). Experiment was carried out in the period from calving up to the 60 th day of calf ’s age. All groups were given <b>whole</b> <b>milk,</b> however, duration of <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> feeding differed among groups. Group 1 consumed <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> from birth up to the 30 th day of age, group 2 from birth up to the 20 th day of age and group 3 from birth up to the 10 th day of age. Afterwards, all groups were fed with milk replacement formula up to the 60 th day of age. Suggested technological solutions in calves feeding within this experiment were analyzed through evaluation of basic fattening characteristics, monitoring of diarrhea occurrences and calculating costs per kg of weight gain per each group. Statistical analysis referring to calves body weight, daily gain and liquid feed conversion during the 1 st month of experiment proved the best values for group 1, which were statistically highly significant (P< 0. 01) if compared to other groups. Examination of health status of calves determined that diarrhea occurred less frequently in group 1, which led to conclusion that feeding <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> to calves should be given priority with respect to its nutritive and health benefits.

In the accredited (EN ISO 17025) milk laboratory in Brno–Tuřany the samples were analysed for the content of fat (T; g .   100 g− 1), crude protein (B; g .   100 g− 1), lactose (L; lactose monohydrate; g .   100 g− 1) and somatic cell count (SCC; 103. ml− 1). The average values in the <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> output were as follows: T = 3. 69 [*]g .   100 g− 1, B = 3. 39 [*]g .   100 g− 1, L = 4. 92 [*]g .   100 g− 1, PSB = 345. 103 [*]ml− 1 and log SCC = 1. 9695, at a <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> output of 29. 88 kg. day 1 of milk.

One of the sub-groups was fed with <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> for a period of 8 weeks, while the other group was fed with <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> for a period of 5 weeks.
