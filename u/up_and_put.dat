He {{attempted}} to bulk <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> on additional weight by eating {{six to eight}} meals a day. He arrived in the Paralympic village {{with the rest of}} Australia's Para-alpine team on 9 March 2010. Coached by Steve Graham, he competed in the downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom and super combined events. In the super-G standing event, he finished 10th. He also finished 27th in the slalom. He came 30th in the giant slalom event.|$|E
5|$|Where {{he did not}} {{overwrite}} Maxentius' achievements, Constantine upstaged them: the Circus Maximus was redeveloped so {{that its}} total seating capacity was twenty-five times larger than that of Maxentius' racing complex on the Via Appia. Maxentius' strongest supporters in the military were neutralized when the Praetorian Guard and Imperial Horse Guard (equites singulares) were disbanded. The tombstones of the Imperial Horse Guard were ground <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> to use in a basilica on the Via Labicana. On November 9, 312AD, barely two weeks after Constantine captured the city, the former base of the Imperial Horse Guard was chosen for redevelopment into the Lateran Basilica. The Legio II Parthica was removed from Alba (Albano Laziale), and the remainder of Maxentius' armies were sent to do frontier duty on the Rhine.|$|E

25|$|Another boy, Alexander Petrovich Zhelobkovich (1930–1994), who was 12 {{years old}} at the time, also survived. When the Nazi {{soldiers}} almost surrounded the village, his mother woke him <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> him on a horse, on which he escaped to a nearby village. After the war, he served in the armed forces and later became a reserve lieutenant colonel.|$|E

Subsequently, Regent Sun and all other Regency ships were laid <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> for sale.|$|E

25|$|When the United States {{entered the}} war, Olds {{immediately}} implemented a previously-prepared {{plan to use}} civil transport pilots to replace reserve military aviators recalled to their combat commands. His staff also drew <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> into action a plan to reorganize and expand the command. Olds was promoted to brigadier general on January 16, 1942, and personally handled the successful negotiations with neutral Brazil {{for the use of}} Natal as a key intermediate point. In its first nine months, the command delivered over 7,100 airplanes to their pick-up points.|$|E
25|$|Natalie Bassingthwaighte {{was born}} on 1 September 1975 in Wollongong, New South Wales to Betty (born ca. 1953) and Michael Bassingthwaighte (AM) (born ca. 1952). Betty {{has worked as a}} theatre nurse, beauty {{therapist}} and hairdresser. Since 1982 Michael has worked as the CEO of a health care insurance provider. Bassingthwaighte grew up in the suburb of Mount Warrigal as the second of four girls with her older sister Melinda (born ca. 1974) and the twins, Lisa and Nicole (born ca. 1982). From a young age, she used to charge 20 cents for family and friends to come and see her dress <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> on mini concerts. Bassingthwaighte got her first role in a primary school production at Balarang Primary School of Peter Pan, playing the character Tinker Bell. She enrolled at Wollongong High School of the Performing Arts and graduated from the Australian College of Entertainment.|$|E

500|$|The Just So Stories {{began as}} bedtime stories told to his {{daughter}} [...] "Effie" [...] when the first three were published in a children’s magazine, a year before her death, Kipling explained: [...] "in the evening there were stories meant to put Effie to sleep, and you {{were not allowed to}} alter those by one single little word. They had to be told just so; or Effie would wake <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> back the missing sentence.

500|$|Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt Diorama [...] "was a shockingly {{creative}} and impressive step forward {{that showed the}} band shedding its grunge past and adding horns, strings, and mature lyrics to its arsenal." [...] Fellow Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano noted that [...] "they somehow kept going and kept improving ... Silverchair has grown <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> together a fine mix of orchestral pop and rock on Diorama." [...] Bernard Zuel described how the Diorama concert tour marked a move from hard rock towards art rock: [...] "they {{stepped out of the}} arenas and barns and 'got classy' ... finally having admitted to harbouring artistic ambition (a very un-Australian band thing to do), they've proved they have the ability".|$|E
500|$|In the film, {{refugees}} are [...] "hunted down like cockroaches", rounded <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> into cages and camps, and even shot, leading film critics like Chris Smith and Claudia Puig to observe symbolic [...] "overtones" [...] {{and images of}} the Holocaust. [...] This is reinforced in the scene where an elderly refugee woman speaking German is seen detained in a cage, and in the scene where British Homeland Security strips and beats illegal immigrants; a song by The Libertines, [...] "Arbeit macht frei", plays in the background. [...] "The visual allusions to the Nazi roundups are unnerving," [...] writes Richard A. Blake.

According to reports, Usher has {{to spend more time}} with his then-pregnant wife. The expected November release date was booked to coincide with that of Usher's fragrance line. Released on May13,2008. The continually changing release dates became frustrating for Usher; Dupri said to Billboard, [...] "The last couple [...] times I've been around , you could tell he's got the bug to hurry <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> this record out. He wants to get back out here and give the people that. He's got that itch." [...] Here I Stand was first released by LaFace Records in Mexico and several European countries on May13,2008; releases in other countries followed.|$|E
500|$|Editor N.C. Christopher Couch {{considered}} the book's physical format to be Eisner's major {{contribution to the}} graphic novel form—few in comic book publishing had experience in bookmaking, whereas Eisner gained intimate familiarity with the process during his time at American Visuals. [...] The book succeeded in getting into bookstores, though initial sales amounted to a few thousand copies in its first year; stores had difficulty finding an appropriate section in which to shelve it. [...] It was put {{on display at the}} Brentano's bookstore in Manhattan, and reportedly sold well. [...] Eisner visited the store to find out how the book was faring after being taking down from display. [...] The manager told him it had been placed in the religious section, and then in humor, but customers had raised concerns that the book did not belong in those sections. [...] The manager gave <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> the book in storage in the cellar.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939 most of the 3.5 million Polish Jews were rounded <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> into newly established ghettos by Nazi Germany. The system was intended to isolate the Jews {{from the outside world}} in order to facilitate their exploitation and abuse. The supply of food was inadequate, living conditions were cramped and unsanitary, and the Jews had no way to earn money. Malnutrition and lack of medicine led to soaring mortality rates. The initial victories of the Wehrmacht over the Soviet Union inspired plans for the German colonisation of occupied Poland, including all territory within the General Government. At the Wannsee Conference held near Berlin on 20 January 1942, new plans were outlined for the genocide of the Jews, known as the [...] "Final Solution" [...] to the Jewish Question. The extermination programme was codenamed Aktion Reinhard in German, to differentiate it from the Einsatzgruppen operations in territories conquered by Nazi Germany, in which half a million Jews had already been killed.|$|E

500|$|Clough {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "I'm not {{equipped}} to manage successfully without Peter Taylor. I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back." [...] The two worked as a pair by complementing each other's strengths, as Clough had a forceful personality and was adept at motivating players, whilst Taylor was more reserved, though he had an ability to spot talented players. Former Hartlepools player Cliff Wright described the pair as [...] "good cop, bad cop. Cloughie would knock you to the ground, verbally at least, and Pete would pick you <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> you back together." [...] As the bigger personality and the man with the title of manager, Clough garnered much greater publicity than Taylor, which caused Taylor to grumble that [...] "I sometimes wonder why he never says to Bell's whisky, for instance, when they're handing out Manager of the Month awards, 'You'll have to present an extra gallon bottle. There are two of us." [...] On a personal level they were very close, and often finished each other's sentences.|$|E
500|$|... "Wake Me Up" [...] was {{eventually}} released as {{the fourth and}} final single from the album on 21 February 2005. The first verse was recorded {{on the last day}} of sessions for What Will the Neighbours Say?. Kimberley Walsh's [...] "dressed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> on my make up" [...] line was considered a [...] "pivotal" [...] point in the recording process. [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] was released on two CD single formats, as well as an additional 7" [...] picture disc. The first disc included a remix of Girls Aloud's previous single, a cover version of The Pretenders' [...] "I'll Stand by You". The second CD format included the Tony Lamezma's Love Affair remix of [...] "Wake Me Up", as well as an exclusive b-side: the previously unreleased ballad, entitled [...] "History", which was co-written by the band. The 7" [...] picture disc includes the Gravitas Club Mix of [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] and another new b-side: another ballad, [...] "Loving Is Easy", which was also co-written by Girls Aloud. It only appeared on vinyl until its inclusion on the special edition rarities disc of Girls Aloud's first greatest hits album, The Sound of Girls Aloud, along with a demo version of [...] "Wake Me Up", which features an alternate first verse.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles reconvened at EMI Studios on 21 October {{to conduct}} three {{additional}} takes, including the master. The group experimented with the arrangements, {{with the second}} take introducing a double-tracked sitar opening that complemented Lennon's acoustic melody. Though the group completely reshaped [...] "Norwegian Wood", {{it was far from}} the album version. Harrison's sitar playing is still at the forefront, alongside heavy drumbeats. The take was not considered suitable for overdubbing, so the band scrapped it, and re-evaluated the arrangement. By the third take, the song was called [...] "Norwegian Wood", and the group changed the key from D major, to E major. The Beatles skipped the rhythm section on this take, and decided to jump directly to the master take. In all, the rhythm section accommodates the acoustics, and the band thought the musical style was an improvement over earlier run-throughs. Therefore, the sitar is an accompaniment, consequently affecting the droning sound evident in past takes. Looking back on the recording sessions in the 1990s, Harrison explained his inclusion of the sitar to be [...] "quite spontaneous from what I remember", adding, [...] "We miked it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>put</b> it on and it just seemed to hit the spot".|$|E
