25|$|There {{were other}} signs the revolt was encountering problems. Early {{in the year}} Owain’s forces {{suffered}} defeats at Grosmont and Usk at the Battle of Pwll Melyn. Although {{it is very difficult}} to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at these two battles, it appears that Henry of Monmouth or possibly Sir John Talbot defeated substantial Welsh raiding parties led by Rhys Gethin ("Swarthy Rhys") and Owain’s eldest son, Gruffudd ab Owain Glyndŵr. The exact date and order of these battles is subject to dispute. However, they may have resulted in the death of Rhys Gethin at Grosmont and Owain's brother, Tudur, at Usk and the capture of Gruffudd. Gruffudd was sent to the Tower of London and after six years died in prison. King Henry also showed that the English were engaged in more and more ruthless tactics. Adam of Usk says that after the Battle of Pwll Melyn near Usk, King Henry had three hundred prisoners beheaded in front of Usk Castle. John ap Hywel, Abbot of the nearby Llantarnam Cistercian monastery, was killed during the Battle of Usk as he ministered to the dying and wounded on both sides. More serious for the rebellion, English forces landed in Anglesey from Ireland. Over the next year they would gradually push the Welsh back until the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406.|$|E

Metcalfe explained this was because Mercedes was intoxicated and unaware of her actions, [...] "but she was also furious at Jacqui for giving her a slap". Metcalfe explained that when Mercedes woke up, she was in disbelief about the events of the previous night and felt [...] "appalled". She added that Mercedes did not fancy Tony and that they did not even like each other, which was why [...] "neither of them can <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> between them". Regarding Mercedes' feelings about hurting Jacqui, Metcalfe stated: [...] "Mercedes hates herself for it. She feels incredibly guilty and ashamed of what she's done. It's surprising Jacqui doesn't guess something is wrong because Mercedes can't look her in the eye".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the episode was mostly positive. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club wrote highly of the episode and awarded it an A–. Handlen praised the episode's exploration of Mulder's mind, noting that the entry allowed the audience to see Mulder's views of the world. He argued that [...] "Mulder's desperate need to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to his sister [...] drives him to expect betrayal, because at least with betrayal, the world makes some kind of sense." [...] He did write, however, that he was [...] "a little disappointed at how [...] "Demons" [...] doesn't really hold up in retrospect from a story perspective," [...] but noted that [...] "what does work here is great." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth awarded the episode an 8 out of 10 and wrote, [...] "Overall, this episode continued to strip away, in methodical fashion, Mulder’s psychological support system. [...] While there are some plot contrivances that are troubling, the episode as a whole comes together very well." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it three-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote that [...] "Demons" [...] works [...] "as a character study of Mulder" [...] and praised the episode's [...] "hyper-realistic flashback" [...] sequences. Vitaris, while calling {{the structure of the}} story [...] "not particularly imaginative", wrote that [...] "Mulder's condition is intriguing". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it [...] "the wrong episode at the wrong time." [...] The two argued that the attention given to Mulder's potential [...] "aneurysm" [...] are oddly juxtaposed next to Scully's real, life-threatening brain cancer. However, they did call the flashback sequences [...] "masterpieces of editing", but noted that their contents [...] "lack information".|$|E

2500|$|John Stuart, {{the only}} officer {{to escape the}} Fort Loudoun {{massacre}} that {{took place during the}} Anglo-Cherokee War, was appointed as the British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southern District, based in Charlestown present day Mobile Alabama. His deputy to the Cherokee, Alexander Cameron (known as Alexander McGillivray), lived among them, first at Keowee, then at Toqua on the Little Tennessee River. Cameron's assistant, John McDonald, set up a base 100 miles to the southwest {{on the west side of}} the Chickamauga River, where it was crossed by the Great Indian Warpath. To the Muscogee, Stuart sent David Taitt as deputy. The deputy to the Choctaw was his brother Charles Stuart at Mobile Alabama. Among the Chickasaw at Mauvilla, Kali-Okla, and Kushla Alabama, Farquhar Bethune (possibly McGillivray - see the will of McGillivray in Weatherford) served as Stuart's deputy.

During the war with England, and the Buat Conspiracy, the Orangists had to lie low, as we have seen. However, under the gathering clouds of the conflict with France, and because the Prince finally got to the age where he could plausibly be proposed for actual public office in his own right (his cousin Willem Frederick died in 1664, taking the cadet branch of the family temporarily out of the running as the Frisian stadtholdership was now taken by an infant). The pressure on De Witt to allow a role for William therefore started to mount inexorably, putting him on the defensive. However, he celebrated one final triumph of the [...] "True Freedom", when in 1667 he managed to engineer the final abolition of the stadtholderate, not only in Holland, but also in Utrecht, Gelderland and Overijssel. These provinces signed the so-called Perpetual Edict (1667) which abolished the office of stadtholder in these provinces [...] "forever" [...] (the Act of Seclusion had only stated that no Prince of Orange could hold that office), separating the captaincy-general of the Union from the stadtholderate of any of the provinces (to close the door to the Frisian stadtholder), and transferring the functions of the stadtholder permanently to the States in Holland.|$|E
2500|$|Kawai {{says that}} many {{different}} kinds of love relationships are shown in Torikaebaya, between siblings, parent and child, and lovers. He considers it [...] "remarkable" [...] that jealousy does not figure in these tangled webs of love. Kawai describes the siblings as [...] "bisexuals" [...] — when the Chūnagon is cuckolded, although she feels sorry for herself, she can also feel [...] "compassion" [...] for her wife, who is in an unusual marriage. [...] When the Chūnagon is hidden away in Uji by Saishō, Saishō returns to Shi no Kimi, and the Chūnagon briefly feels jealous, but she uses her experience as a man to attain some emotional distance. She resolves to escape Saishō after having her child, and [...] "pretends to love him passionately". The Emperor, although dismayed that the former Chūnagon (or, as he thinks, Naishi no Kami) is not a virgin, he does not confront her about her previous lover. Kawai says this is another way jealousy is avoided in the tale. Saishō does not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to the former Chūnagon, and he quizzes his new wife, the younger Yoshino Princess about the matter fruitlessly. To preserve his home’s harmony, he gives up trying to locate the former Chūnagon. To Kawai, this [...] "reflects his lack of jealousy". For Kawai, a modern audience may disrespect Saishō and the Emperor for not seeking out the truth above all else in these matters, but Kawai thinks that the author believes that jealousy is a [...] "dissonance" [...] in love, and a slight [...] "dissonance" [...] is preferable, as it heightens awareness of the [...] "beauty" [...] of the work. In his view, Saishō and the Emperor putting aside their jealousy prevents the work from having too much [...] "dissonance". Kawai says that by changing one's point of view, for example, becoming like the opposite sex as the siblings do, [...] "useless conflicts" [...] can be sidestepped. He regards [...] "bisexuality" [...] as a counter to [...] "violent feelings of jealousy", as it enriches a relationship and leaves jealousy no foothold.|$|E

6000|$|Before you can <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened,</b> I {{must first}} explain {{a bit about}} the nature of the hot air balloon which is used for {{parachute}} jumping. If you have ever witnessed such a jump, you will remember that directly the parachute was cut loose the balloon turned upside down, emptied itself of its smoke and heated air, flattened out and fell straight down, beating the parachute to the ground. Thus there is no chasing a big deserted bag for miles and miles across the country, and much time, as well as trouble, is thereby saved. This maneuver is accomplished by attaching a weight, at the end of a long rope, to the top of the balloon. The aeronaut, with his parachute and trapeze, hangs to the bottom of the balloon, and, weighing more, keeps it right side down. But when he lets go, the weight attached to the top immediately drags the top down, and the bottom, which is the open mouth, goes up, the heated air pouring out. The weight used for this purpose on the [...] "Little Nassau" [...] was a bag of sand.|$|E

Benjamin Bloom (1956) attempt to categorise the different sorts of intellectual knowledge that teachers wanted their students to learn. Bloomâ€™s â€œtaxonomyâ€? as it became known, is still the most useful framework for teachers to use in deciding what it is they are trying to teach their students. Bloom classified knowledge into six categories, ranging from the type of task which demanded the lowest level of thinking (memorization), to the highest level of intellectual ability (evaluation). Cognitive psychologists have tried to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> when we think and learn. They have constructed models to represent what occurs during the process of thinking.
