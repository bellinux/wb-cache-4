5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus <b>uncinus</b> clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
2500|$|Cirriform clouds {{have three}} non-convective species that can form in mostly stable airmass conditions. [...] Cirrus {{fibratus}} comprise filaments {{that may be}} straight, wavy, or occasionally twisted by non-convective wind shear. The species <b>uncinus</b> is similar but has upturned hooks at the ends. [...] Cirrus spissatus appear as opaque patches that can show light grey shading.|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and <b>uncinus</b> species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
2500|$|A {{second group}} {{describes}} the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible {{only from a}} significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species {{with which they are}} otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. Intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. [...] They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. [...] The variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. [...] It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and <b>uncinus</b> species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus, and with the genus altostratus.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrus <b>uncinus</b> {{is a type}} of cirrus cloud. The name cirrus <b>uncinus</b> {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "curly hooks". Also known as mares' tails, these clouds are {{generally}} sparse in the sky and very thin.|$|E

50|$|The uncinate {{processes}} of the ribs are extensions of bone that project caudally from the vertical segment of each rib. (Uncinate means hooked from Latin uncinatus, from <b>uncinus,</b> barb, from uncus, hook.) They are found in birds (except for screamers), reptiles, and the early amphibian Ichthyostega.|$|E
50|$|The radula {{has a large}} simple rhachidian tooth with, on each side, two large, simple {{transverse}} laterals, {{followed by}} two minute ones, and a large outer lateral with a strong tridentate cusp, outside {{of which is a}} single scale-like flat <b>uncinus,</b> bearing an elongated thickened ridge, but no cusp.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrus {{fibratus}} {{is a type}} of cirrus cloud. The name cirrus fibratus {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "fibrous". These clouds are similar to cirrus <b>uncinus,</b> commonly known as [...] "mares' tails"; however, fibratus clouds do not have tufts or hooks at the end. The filaments are usually separate from one another.|$|E
50|$|Cirriform clouds {{have three}} non-convective species that can form in mostly stable airmass conditions. Cirrus {{fibratus}} comprise filaments {{that may be}} straight, wavy, or occasionally twisted by non-convective wind shear. The species <b>uncinus</b> is similar but has upturned hooks at the ends. Cirrus spissatus appear as opaque patches that can show light grey shading.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrus {{duplicatus}} is {{a variety}} of cirrus cloud. The name cirrus duplicatus is derived from Latin, meaning [...] "double". The duplicatus variety of cirrus clouds occurs when {{there are at least}} two layers of cirrus clouds. Most of the time, occurrences of cirrus fibratus and cirrus <b>uncinus</b> are in the duplicatus form. Like stratus clouds, cirrus clouds are often seen in the duplicatus form.|$|E
50|$|Uncinia is a genus of {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} family Cyperaceae, known as hook-sedges in Australia and as hook grasses or bastard grasses in New Zealand. The genus is characterised {{by the presence of}} a long hook formed by an extension of the , which is used to attach the fruit to passing animals (epizoochory), especially birds, and it is this feature which gives the genus its name, from the Latin <b>uncinus,</b> meaning a hook or barb.|$|E
50|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, fibratus, spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus fibratus looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus <b>uncinus</b> clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
5000|$|It is well {{established}} by atmospheric scientists that contrails can persist for hours, {{and that it is}} a perfectly normal characteristic for them to spread out into cirrus sheets. The different-sized ice crystals in contrails descend at different rates, which spreads the contrail vertically. Then the differential in wind speeds between altitudes (wind shear) results in the spreading of the contrail across many miles/kilometers in the sky. This mechanism is similar to the formation of cirrus <b>uncinus</b> clouds. Contrails between 25000 and 40000 ft can often merge into an [...] "almost solid" [...] interlaced sheet. Contrails can have a lateral spread of several kilometers, and given sufficient air traffic, it is possible for contrails to create an entirely overcast sky that increases the ice budget of individual contrails and persists for hours.|$|E
50|$|The quite minute radula is peculiar. The rhachidian and (on each side) five {{laterals}} have broad simple bases with a pear-shaped outline. The cusps, {{which might}} {{be compared to the}} stem of the pear bent over, are extremely narrow and long and symmetrically serrate on each side with 4-6 serrations. The major <b>uncinus</b> is stout and has a large four-toothed ovate cusp. There are about twenty more slender uncini with scythe-like cusps serrate on the outer edge. Outside of these are two or three of a flat form, like a section of a palm-leaf fan from handle to margin with four riblets, and the distal edge with three or more indentations. Under pressure these uncini have a tendency to split up lengthwise, beginning at the indentations. They are flat and smooth, thinner toward the distal end, and have no distinct shaft.|$|E
50|$|A {{second group}} {{describes}} the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible {{only from a}} significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species {{with which they are}} otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. Intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus fibratus. They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. The variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. It is sometimes seen with the fibratus and <b>uncinus</b> species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus, and with the genus altostratus.|$|E
50|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and <b>uncinus</b> species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.CombinationsIt is possible for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based and the other is pattern-based. An example of this would be a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks. The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E
50|$|The head is {{not well}} {{preserved}} in known specimens. It comprised approximately 20% of the body length (excluding the arms). Brain cartilage is observed in some specimens, {{as well as a}} pair of aragonitic statoliths which helped the animal determine horizontal orientation when swimming. Belemnotheutis, like most of the other belemnoids, had ten arms of equal length lined with two rows of inward-pointing hooks each. Each of the hooks were composed of several sections. The curved pointed tip is called the <b>uncinus</b> and was probably {{the only part of the}} hooks exposed. The rest of the hook (the shaft and the base) were embedded in a sheath of soft tissue below the orbicular scar, a small groove where the tissue attachment terminated. They are also believed to have been stalked and mobile, helping the animal manipulate its prey. Traces of functional suckers have been found and these constitute a single row on each arm, alternating in between the pairs of hooks. The size of the suckers decreases distally along the arms, with the largest (around 2 mm in diameter) being closest to the head. The length of the arms varies with the size of the individual but may have reached 100 mm in larger specimens.|$|E
