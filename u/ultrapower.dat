In other words hyperreal numbers per se, aside from their use in nonstandard analysis, have no necessary relationship to model theory or first order logic, although they were discovered by the application of model theoretic techniques from logic.

The hereditarily finite sets, Vω, satisfy the axiom of regularity (and all other axioms of ZFC except the axiom of infinity). So if one forms a non-trivial <b>ultrapower</b> of Vω, then it will also satisfy the axiom of regularity. The resulting model [...] will contain elements, called non-standard natural numbers, that satisfy the definition of natural numbers in that model but are not really natural numbers. They are fake natural numbers which are [...] "larger" [...] than any actual natural number. This model will contain infinite descending sequences of elements. For example, suppose n is a non-standard natural number, then [...] and , and so on. For any actual natural number k, [...] This is an unending descending sequence of elements. But this sequence is not definable in the model and thus not a set. [...] So no contradiction to regularity can be proved.|$|E

Using <b>ultrapowers</b> we obtain an explicit description of the asymptotic cone of a semisimple Lie group. From this description, using semi-algebraic groups and non-standard methods, we can give a short proof of the Margulis Conjecture.
