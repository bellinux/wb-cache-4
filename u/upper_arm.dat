5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> in the opposite direction it came from {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E
5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. The bones of the forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E
5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone). The pelvis and the bones of the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E

5|$|The root of {{the lower}} incisor is visible {{at the back of}} the {{mandible}} (lower jaw) as a slight protrusion; a true capsular process is absent. There are 13 thoracic (chest), 7 lumbar, 4 sacral, and 38 or 39 caudal (tail) vertebrae. The humerus (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone) lacks an entepicondylar foramen.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, there are twelve ribs. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. Anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} a vertebra, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal (far) end of the humerus (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone).|$|E
5|$|Plesiorycteropus {{is known}} {{from a number}} of subfossil bones, {{comparable}} to coverage of some of the poorly known subfossil lemurs, such as Daubentonia robusta. The material includes several skulls, all of which are missing the facial bones, complete long bones such as the femur and humerus (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone), and other bones, but some elements are still unknown, including most of the skeleton of the hand and foot. There is little reason to assume it was similar in general form to the aardvark. No teeth or jaws referable to Plesiorycteropus have been found, and it is generally assumed that the animal was toothless.|$|E

5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature is the presence of an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} 198284 Suresh Srivastava, a GSI {{geologist}} at the Palaeontology Division of the GSI's Western Region, collected {{large numbers of}} bone fossil fragments from Rahioli, and also precisely mapped the area. These fossils {{were taken to the}} Palaeontology Division at Jaipur for identification. U. B. Mathur and Suresh Srivastava, under the supervision of S. C. Pant, meticulously cleaned many of the skeletal parts (braincase, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, sacrum, thigh bone, <b>upper</b> <b>arm,</b> shin bones, and others), leading to the publication of multiple research papers. There was a lull in further activity until a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed with Punjab University in 199495.|$|E
5|$|From {{the same}} site where T.goodmani was found, Samonds also {{recorded}} the distal (far) end of a Triaenops humerus (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone), with a width of 3.58mm. This bone was similar to humeri of T.menamena, {{but she did not}} identify it as either species because of the small size difference between T.menamena and T.goodmani. In site NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), two Triaenops mandibles were recorded, one with p4 and m1 and another with m1–2 and part of m3. Relative to living Triaenops and Paratriaenops, m1 in those jaws is longer and narrower. Although sample sizes are small, the measurements do not resemble those of T.goodmani. In addition, the ridge between the entoconid and metaconid is stronger than in T.goodmani. Samonds identified these jaws only as Triaenops.|$|E

5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was fully}} bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short thighs and rather long feet, {{indicating}} {{that it was}} likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of Herrerasaurus were {{less than half the}} length of its hind limbs. The <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> and forearm were rather short, while the manus (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.|$|E
5|$|Konnan was {{inactive}} throughout early 2000, as he {{was suspended}} for three months by Bill Busch after requesting his release from WCW, unhappy {{with the way he}} was being used. Shortly after returning from suspension and reforming the Filthy Animals, Konnan was sidelined once again, this time with a legitimately torn triceps muscle, damaged when Van Hammer threw Juventud Guerrera at him during a match and Guerrera's elbow connected with Konnan's <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> as he attempted to catch him. Throughout 2000, the Filthy Animals feuded with other stables, including The Misfits In Action, The Natural Born Thrillers and Team Canada. At WCW's final pay-per-view event, Greed on March 18, 2001, Lance Storm and Mike Awesome (representing Team Canada) defeated Hugh Morrus and Konnan. WCW was sold to WWE five days later, on March 23.|$|E
5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first thoracic vertebra, an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{different}} periods of display and/or storage, as practiced under retail conditions for frozen turkey <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> in Nigerian open markets, on physical appearance, odour {{and extent of}} lipid peroxidation of the meat was investigated. Five batches of frozen turkey shipments, sampled bi-monthly at 45 <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> per batch were used. The frozen <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> from each batch were displayed on the counter for up to 3 days, but re-frozen overnight. Five samples from the same batch were removed at 6 hourly intervals, giving a total of 9 treatments per batch. The samples were assessed for physical quality attributes (appearance and odour) by a 7 -member panel using a 9 -point Hedonic scale. The turkey <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> were dissected and the moisture and lipid contents of the muscles measured. Extent of oxidation of muscle was determined by quantifying the malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances test. Muscle, bone and skin were found to represent 65. 05 ± 4. 28, 23. 51 ± 4. 21 and 14. 44 ± 2. 49 % by weight of the intact <b>upper</b> <b>arms.</b> The relationship between the intact <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> and the skin, bone and muscle, {{as measured by the}} correlation coefficient were found to be 0. 60, 0. 50 and 0. 95 respectively (P< 0. 001). A strong relationship (r = 0. 95, P< 0. 001) was found between physical appearance and odour of the meat. The physical appearance and odour of turkey <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> were adversely affected (P< 0. 01) by increasing length of display and/or storage. The meat were disliked at the afternoon (for odour) and evening (for physical appearance) of the second day of display. Moisture and lipid contents of samples were 69. 89 ± 0. 94 and 4. 58 ± 0. 75 % respectively. MDA concentrations of the turkey <b>upper</b> <b>arms</b> were found to increase with increased length of display and/or storage and were 2. 90 ± 0. 82 mg MDA/kg muscle for the “fresh ” and 4. 87 ± 0. 83 mg MDA/kg muscle at the end of third day of display and/or storage...|$|R

5|$|The false potto {{generally}} {{resembles a}} small potto, {{but according to}} Schwartz it differs in having a longer tail, shorter spines on its neck and chest vertebrae, a smaller, less complex spine on the second neck vertebra, an entepicondylar foramen (an opening in the humerus, or <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone), a lacrimal fossa (a depression in the skull) that is located inside the eye socket, a smaller upper third premolar and molar, and higher-crowned cheekteeth, among other traits. However, many of these traits are variable among pottos; for example, one researcher found entepicondylar foramina in {{almost half of the}} specimens in his sample of pottos.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The facets of the sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs were {{proportionally}} {{shorter than}} in any other large carnivorous dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus. The forearm was only a quarter the size of the <b>upper</b> <b>arm.</b> There were no carpalia in the hand, so that the metacarpals articulated directly with the forearm. The hand showed four basic digits, though apparently only the middle two of these ended in finger bones, while the fourth consisted of a single splint-like metacarpal that may have represented an external 'spur'. The fingers themselves were fused and immobile, and may have lacked claws. Carnotaurus differed from all other abelisaurids in having proportionally shorter and more robust forelimbs, and in having the fourth, splint-like metacarpal as the longest bone in the hand. A 2009 study suggests that the arms were vestigial in abelisaurids, because nerve fibers responsible for stimulus transmission were reduced to an extent seen in today's emus and kiwis, which also have vestigial forelimbs.|$|E

5|$|The shoulderblade or scapula {{is short}} and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves {{slightly}} to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes {{about half of the}} shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The coracoid is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a scapulocoracoid, lacking a visible suture. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval foramen but the usual boss for the attachment of the <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> muscles is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Triaenops goodmani is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Triaenops. It is known from three lower jaws {{collected}} in a cave at Anjohibe in 1996, and described as a new species in 2007. The material is at most 10,000 years old. A bat humerus (<b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bone) from the same site could not be identified as either T.goodmani or the living T.menamena. T.goodmani is identifiable {{as a member of}} Triaenops or the related genus Paratriaenops by a number of features of the teeth, such as the single-cusped, canine-like fourth premolar and the presence of a gap between the entoconid and hypoconulid cusps on the first two molars. T.goodmani is larger than the living species of Triaenops and Paratriaenops on Madagascar, and on the first molar the protoconid cusp is only slightly higher than the hypoconid, not much higher as in the other species.|$|E
5|$|Williston {{was also}} the first {{scientist}} to critically evaluate all of the pteranodont species classified by Cope and Marsh. He agreed with most of Marsh's classification, with a few exceptions. First, he did not believe that P. ingens and P. umbrosus could be considered synonyms, which even Cope had come to believe. He considered both P. velox and P. longiceps to be dubious; the first was based on non-diagnostic fragments, and the second, though known from a complete skull, probably belonged to one of the other, previously-named species. In 1903, Williston revisited the question of Pteranodon classification, and revised his earlier conclusion that there were seven species down to just three. He considered both P. comptus and P. nanus to be specimens of Nyctosaurus, and divided the others into small (P. velox), medium (P. occidentalis), and large species (P. ingens), based primarily on the shape of their <b>upper</b> <b>arm</b> bones. He thought P. longiceps, the only one known from a skull, could be a synonym of either P. velox or P. occidentalis, based on its size.|$|E
