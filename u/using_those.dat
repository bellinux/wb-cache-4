5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply <b>using</b> <b>those</b> same shares as collateral for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying interest on the loan {{until the end of}} the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational data will be able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems <b>using</b> <b>those</b> data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the Story Mode, players are assigned a number of points determined by their performance, with a maximum of one hundred. <b>Using</b> <b>those</b> points, the player is given the option of creating a racer with customized color and performance. The point value is distributed among five parameters: Max Speed, Acceleration, Grip, Drift, and A.G.S., which determines how fast the racer's ability gauge charges. A maximum of twenty points can be assigned {{to each of the}} five racing parameters. Customized racers can be used in all of the game's modes except for the Story Mode, and only the main characters and Bahamut are open to customization.|$|E

5|$|Out of options, Buchner opened negotiations, <b>using</b> <b>those</b> interned in {{the castle}} as hostages. Presenting them at the keep's door, he made clear {{that they would be}} killed unless Ferdinand promised to spare his, his wife's and Sudermann's lives. Ferdinand acceded to Buchner's demand; some sources {{maintain}} that the Abbot of Heisterbach, one of the prisoners, had been treated decently by Buchner throughout his imprisonment {{in the castle}} and himself asked for Buchner's life to be spared. The prisoners were released. With much difficulty, given the state of mind of the besiegers, Ferdinand and Arenberg brought the Buchners and Sudermann out of the castle alive. Once the Buchners, Sudermann, and the hostages were clear of the fortress, Ferdinand released his troops, who were in an ugly mood and hungry for blood and plunder. All those who remained in the keep—soldiers, men, women and children—were killed, some inside the keep, some in the courtyard below; the slaughter lasted well into the night. The castle's 178 dead were buried in two mass graves whose locations remain unknown. Among those who perished in the destruction and storming of the castle {{was also one of the}} prisoners, a vicar from Hildesheim. The Hildesheim suffragan, too, was not among the rescued prisoners; he had died during his incarceration, a short while before the castle was stormed.|$|E

25|$|Shape {{analysis}} of linked list data structures {{is a technique}} for verifying the correctness of an algorithm <b>using</b> <b>those</b> structures.

25|$|During {{a period}} of early {{broadcast}} business consolidation, radio manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA) acquired New York City radio station WEAF from American Telephone & Telegraph (AT). Westinghouse, a shareholder in RCA, had a competing outlet in Newark, New Jersey pioneer station WJZ (no relation to the radio and television station in Baltimore currently <b>using</b> <b>those</b> call letters), which also served as the flagship for a loosely structured network. This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923, and moved to New York City.|$|E
25|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} the reference range for a parameter with log-normal distribution is to logarithmize all the measurements with an arbitrary base (for example e), derive the {{mean and standard deviation}} of these logarithms, determine the logarithms located (for a 95% prediction interval) 1.96 standard deviations below and above that mean, and subsequently exponentiate <b>using</b> <b>those</b> two logarithms as exponents and using the same base as was used in logarithmizing, with the two resultant values being the lower and upper limit of the 95% prediction interval.|$|E

In so doing, he established a research program which embraced multiple aspects of human variation, from mental characteristics to height; from facial images to fingerprint patterns. This required inventing novel measures of traits, devising large-scale collection of data <b>using</b> <b>those</b> measures, and in the end, the discovery of new statistical techniques for describing and understanding the data.|$|E

Additionally, negative values of R2 may occur when fitting non-linear functions to data. In cases where negative values arise, {{the mean of the}} data provides a better fit to the outcomes than do the fitted function values, according to this particular criterion.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 20th century, an {{increasing}} number of Muslim immigrants from Somalia and Iraq have settled in the city, and international students have increased. By 2009, the ICM's growth made the existing mosque and community center in central Murfreesboro inadequate for the number of worshippers <b>using</b> <b>those</b> facilities. The ICM bought a vacant lot {{on the outskirts of the}} city and submitted plans to build a new community center and mosque on the site.

25|$|WFAA-FM {{signed on}} October 5, 1946 as KERA-FM (no {{relation}} to the current radio and television station <b>using</b> <b>those</b> call letters).

By 1947, WFAA-FM had moved from its original frequency at 94.3 FM to a preferred location at 97.9. With FM broadcasting in its infancy, the station signed on and off the air for months – and even going silent for two years – at a time, before settling on a permanent broadcast schedule by 1965.|$|E
