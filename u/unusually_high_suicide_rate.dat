5|$|A {{number of}} student {{deaths in the}} late 1990s and early 2000s {{resulted}} in considerable media attention focussing on MIT's culture and student life. After the alcohol-related death of Scott Krueger in September 1997 as a new member at the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity, MIT began requiring all freshmen {{to live in the}} dormitory system. The 2000 suicide of MIT undergraduate Elizabeth Shin drew attention to suicides at MIT and created a controversy over whether MIT had an <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rate.</b> In late 2001 a task force's recommended improvements in student mental health services were implemented, including expanding staff and operating hours at the mental health center. These and later cases were significant as well because they sought to prove the negligence and liability of university administrators in loco parentis.|$|E
5000|$|The SS {{value of}} [...] "fighting for fighting's sake" [...] could {{be traced back}} to the values of the front-line German {{soldiers}} in World War I and the post-war Freikorps, and in turn led SS members to see violence as the highest possible value, and conventional morality as a hindrance to achieving victory. The SS mentality fostered violence and [...] "hardness". The ideal SS man was supposed to be in a state of permanent readiness. As historian Hans Buchheim quips, [...] "the SS man had to be forever on duty." [...] For members of the SS their mentality was such that for them, nothing was impossible no matter how arduous or cruel, to include the [...] "murder of millions". SS men who attempted to live by that principle of violence had an <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rate.</b> The [...] "soldierly" [...] values of the SS were specific to the German post-World War I concept of the [...] "political soldier" [...] who was indoctrinated to be a [...] "fighter" [...] who would devote his life to struggling for the nation.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{present a}} methodological {{proposal}} for studying suicide and suicide attempts from a combined socio-anthropological, epidemiological, and psychosocial perspective. This interdisciplinary and complex research model simultaneously examined individual, socioeconomic, historical/cultural, and population data as {{few studies have}} succeeded to date. Considering that {{the present study was}} conducted in a specific social reality, the authors created a methodological approach to comprehend the effects of a crisis in an industrial restructuring process in a mining company town in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, that was associated with <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b> Since it referred to a small geographic area (with only 100, 000 inhabitants), the research is considered an ideal case study. The authors created different strategies to trace the local epidemiological profile, adapted a psychosocial autopsy technique to elucidate suicide cases and a psychosocial harm assessment technique to comprehend suicide attempts, and conducted a local analysis of the socio-cultural context. The methods proposed here (with advantages and limitations) proved productive for elucidating the study hypothesis...|$|R

Daegu has the <b>highest</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rate</b> for age ranging from 40 to 59. Finally, Gangwon, Jeonnam, and Chungnam have <b>highest</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rate</b> for age of 20-39.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the reasons}} of South Korea's {{relatively}} <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rate</b> {{is due to the}} elderly's substantially <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rate.</b> This is due to poor elderly people killing themselves not to be a burden on their families, since there is a poorly-funded welfare system, and the old social structure where children looked after their parents, has largely disappeared in the 21st century. As a result, people living in rural areas have <b>higher</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{review of the}} literature was conducted to investigate the incidence and understanding of suicide among Alaska 2 ̆ 7 s Native population. A brief anthropological and historical review was presented to provide a basis for interpretation of the current cultural situation. An examination of epidemiological practices and their impact on suicide data was completed. While the gathering of data related to suicide is always problematic, rural Alaska presents a set of unique complications. During the study period (1983 - 1984) the national suicide rate was 11. 9 per 100, 000. For Alaska Natives 2 ̆ 7 it was 42. 9 per 100, 000. For Alaska Native males ages 20 - 24 it was 257 per 100, 000. Indications are that alcohol plays a significant role in Alaska Native suicide. While reliable data on Alaska Native consumption patterns is unavailable, alcohol is twice as likely to be involved in an Alaska Native suicide {{as it is in the}} general population. Alcohol is also closely related to violent methods. However, the pattern of suicide among Alaska Natives is not consistent with that of alcoholics in the general population. Alaska Natives respond to seasonality in much the same way as the general population does to its environment. There is no indication that the <b>unusually</b> <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rate</b> is related to the more severe winter weather. Suicide does appear to have a strong cultural component. This is also probable for Alaska 2 ̆ 7 s Natives. Eskimos in particular have a well documented traditional incorporation of suicide into their culture...|$|E

40|$|Contrary to Durkheim’s {{idea about}} suicide during wartime, the Netherlands had <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> in 1940 and 1945. To explain these findings, we propose the social {{integration}} theory, according to which, people who {{expect to be}} excluded from society {{are more likely to}} commit suicide. We examine this idea using individual-level data on suicide in the Netherlands during the Second World War, assuming that Jews expected to be excluded by the occupying German forces, whereas political delinquents expected punishment after the war. In support of our theory, we found <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> among Jews {{at the beginning of the}} war and <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> among political delinquents when the Netherlands was liberated. These findings support the proposed theory and call for refinement of Durkheim’s ideas. ...|$|R

40|$|Age-specific cohort {{analysis}} of Australian <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> confirmed recent Canadian and American {{reports of a}} substantial increase in <b>suicide</b> <b>rate</b> among young age groups. However, it was unable to replicate fully the previous findings that not only did successive birth cohorts have <b>higher</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rates,</b> but that at each successive five-year period they had <b>higher</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> than preceding cohorts had at that age. The major differences could be explained {{on the basis of the}} introduction of legislation that restricted the prescription of sedatives. This suggests that although there may be early and lasting effects on successive birth cohorts contributing to a general increase in cohort-specific <b>suicide</b> <b>rates</b> in the countries examined, such rates also can be influenced by changing environmental factors more immediately related to the suicide itself...|$|R

50|$|One {{reason for}} its <b>high</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rate</b> {{compared}} to {{other countries in the}} developed world is a large amount of suicide among the elderly. The prevalence of suicide among elderly South Koreans is due to the amount of widespread poverty among senior citizens in South Korea, with nearly half of the country's elderly population living below the poverty line. Combined with a poorly-funded social safety net for the elderly, this results in them killing themselves not to be a financial burden on their families, since the old social structure where children looked after their parents has largely disappeared in the 21st century. As a result, people living in rural areas tend to have <b>higher</b> <b>suicide</b> <b>rates.</b>|$|R
