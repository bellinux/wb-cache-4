5|$|The Soviet {{rapid transit}} system {{was seen as}} the quickest, cleanest and {{cheapest}} way of <b>urban</b> <b>transport,</b> and eventually another point acquired greater significance; the authorities could allocate their resources from the automobile industry to the rapid transit sector and save a substantial volume of the country's diesel and petrol. Because rapid transit system usually were cheaper to operate and less energy consuming, the Soviet authorities managed to construct 20 rapid transits nationwide, with a further nine in construction when the Soviet Union collapsed. Twenty other stations were under construction in 1985. The country's rapid transit system was the most intensively used in the world.|$|E

In {{order to}} improve the {{objectivity}} of <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> network evaluation and achieve the sub-file of quality level of preliminary scheme, a comprehensive evaluation method for <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> network was proposed based on TOPSIS, and then constructed the evaluation model of <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> network. This method was applied to Xi’an <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> network planning, which obeyed the basic theory of scheme evaluation and some related requirements. The result showed that planning- 5 was the best one among the five <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> network planning in Xi’an and consistent with the passenger flow prediction. The evaluation model for <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> network based on TOPSIS was objective, which involved few parameters, simple operation, scientific evaluation and provided a basis for <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> network planning decision...|$|R

40|$|Investment in the {{transport}} {{system with the}} aim of fostering attractiveness and land use in urban structures is of great interest for planners and investors. Investment in <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> would especially contribute to revitalising distinct city areas. The samples of high population density and diversified area use are organised around accessible means of <b>urban</b> public <b>transport.</b> The main objective of this case study was to find an adequate model for the solution of <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> on the location Novi Jelkovec in Zagreb after {{the construction of a new}} urban settlement, with the aim to revitalise the peripheral parts of the city. The theoretical assumption on the influence of better organised transport on land use is hereby researched through the example of correction of timetables and reduction of travelling time between nodes on the line in the Novi Jelkovec settlement. In preparing this paper the following methods were used: analysis and synthesis, mathematical and statistical methods, methods of interviewing. The theory of correlation of land use and <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> is based on models that develop the “compact city”. The obtained research results confirm the significance of the correlation between urban land use and <b>urban</b> public <b>transport.</b> It can be concluded that this paper proves the influence of the correlation between land use and <b>urban</b> public <b>transport</b> on the concrete example of Novi Jelkovec.
