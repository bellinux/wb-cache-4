40|$|A simple dynamic systems {{analysis}} {{is used to}} give examples of strong, weak overdriven, and weak <b>underdriven</b> oblique detonations. Steady oblique detonations consisting of a straight lead shock attached to a solid wedge followed by a resolved reaction zone structure are admitted as solutions to the reactive Euler equations. This is demonstrated for a fluid that is taken to be an inviscid, calorically perfect ideal gas that undergoes a two-step irreversible reaction with the first step exothermic and the second step endothermic. This model admits solutions for a continuum of shock wave angles for two classes of solutions identified by a Rankine-Hugoniot analysis: strong and weak overdriven waves. The other class, weak <b>underdriven,</b> is admitted for eigenvalue shock-wave angles. Chapman-Jouguet waves, however, are not admitted. These results contrast those for a corresponding onestep model that, for detonations with a straight lead shock, only admits strong, weak overdriven, and Chapman-Jouguet solutions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1993 The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop a predictive capability for oblique detonation waves (ODWs). Planar wedge flows and axisymmetric conical flows are considered. The Rankine-Hugoniot solution is reviewed first, which yields necessary conditions for attached ODWs. But this solution is limited to inviscid flows over idealized geometries and infinite Damkohler number (Da), which is the ratio of fluid dynamical to chemical time scales. A multidimensional numerical model is developed, tested against theory, and is then used to investigate the influence of finite Da and viscous flows. Results demonstrate the role of the Damkohler number in bulk ignition. Refined grid results show that viscous (laminar) effects are confined to boundary layers and do not contribute to ODW formation. This conclusion corrects a previously held belief that was based on inadequately resolved simulations. Results presented for <b>underdriven</b> oblique detonation waves are the first known for fuel-air mixtures of propulsion interest. Together with an explanatory model, these results suggest the existence of <b>underdriven</b> ODW's. Transient numerical solutions give clues to the wave's formation mechanisms, and perturbed solutions illustrate interesting properties of the wave once formed...|$|R

50|$|Poorly {{engineered}} <b>underdrive</b> pulleys {{can cause}} unwanted side effects; {{this is due}} to not spinning the alternator, power steering, and/or air conditioning fast enough. This leads to low alternator voltage, weak/no power steering assist, and weak/no air conditioning effectiveness, especially at idle/low RPM. The most commonly seen result is lighting may dim, or the stereo may cut out. Too much <b>underdrive</b> for a race car is not much of a concern due to the high RPMs they run at, but for daily driven vehicles it can lead to a dead battery if too much time is spend at idle or low RPM. Additionally, an <b>underdrive</b> pulley will not reduce the power consumed by the alternator, as the alternator's load is automatically adjusted by its control circuit to match the electrical load regardless of input speed.|$|E

The two-dimensional Euler equations were used as the governing equations in combination with a detailed hydrogen-oxygen reaction model. Three different groups of mixtures, which represent various degrees of chemical reactivity, were investigated. The results show that when the mixtures generally have {{a high degree of}} chemical reactivity, detonation initiation can eventually be realized successfully by Mach reflection as well as the DDT mechanism, independent of the spatial distribution of the mixture in the channel. A recurring four-stage sequence of detonation initiation, detonation attenuation, initiation failure and detonation reinitiation can be identified. When the mixtures generally have an intermediate degree of chemical reactivity, detonation combustion can be fully realized in the channel, where different degrees of overdrive are found in the upper lower half. After the shutdown of the hot jet, the overdriven detonation attenuates gradually and eventually a slightly overdriven detonation and a slightly <b>underdriven</b> detonation are generated, which can be regarded as a new stable state of propagation. However, whether a detonation can be initiated successfully is determined by the spatial mixture distribution.

40|$|Abstract—The {{width of}} an {{interconnect}} line affects the total power consumed by a circuit. The effect of wire sizing {{on the power}} characteristics of an inductive interconnect line is presented in this paper. The matching condition between the driver and the load affects the power consumption since the short-circuit power dissipation may decrease and the dynamic power will increase with wider lines. A tradeoff, therefore, exists between short-circuit and dynamic power in inductive interconnects. The short-circuit power increases with wider linewidths only if the line is <b>underdriven.</b> The power characteristics of inductive interconnects therefore may have a great influence on wire sizing optimization techniques. An analytic solution of the transition time of a signal propagating along an inductive interconnect with an error of less than 15 % is presented. The solution is useful in wire sizing synthesis techniques to decrease the overall power dissipation. The optimum linewidth that minimizes the total transient power dissipation is determined. An analytic solution for the optimum width with an error of less than 6 % is presented. For {{a specific set of}} line parameters and resistivities, a reduction in power approaching 80 % is achieved as compared to the minimum wire width.

More telling is the torque curve, which was vastly improved over the base GT models, 90% of its 305 lbft Nm available from 2000 rpm. This broader torque curve makes itself known at the drag strip, as these special edition Mustangs could cover the 1/4 mile in 2-3 tenths of a second quicker and about 2 mi/h km/h faster than regular GT. 17-inch American Racing Torq-Thrust style rims, wrapped in 245/45ZR performance rubber by Goodyear, were reminiscent of those on the car driven by McQueen in the movie.

5000|$|As {{with other}} traction-type CVTs, {{transmission}} of torque through the NuVinci CVT involves some relative sliding between the torque-transmitting contact patches. This is because, {{for any given}} contact patch, parts of the ball are going {{in a slightly different}} direction and at slightly different speeds than the disc (this phenomenon of traction-type CVTs is referred to as [...] "contact spin"). [...] "The spin velocity (or drill speed) is defined as the difference in the rotational speed of the driving and driven rollers in a direction perpendicular to the contact patch plane. It is caused by the relative difference in surface speeds of both elements across the contact patch and is a major source of power loss in traction drive CVT’s." [...] In all traction-type CVTs, this relative sliding necessarily occurs between surfaces which are under the very high clamping pressures required to ensure torques are transmitted reliably. This relative sliding under high pressures cause transmission losses (inefficiency). Fallbrook Technology refuse to publish any efficiency data for the NuVinci CVT. However, The NuVinci is a variant on the [...] "Tilting-ball drive" [...] type of continuously variable transmission (CVT), and the efficiency of [...] "Tilting-ball drive" [...] type CVTs is typically in the range of 70% to 89%. However, its geometry does differ significantly from the Kopp type of tilting ball variator in the reference in that the NuVinci has its torque transfer contacts on the outside diameter rather than the inside diameter, which puts the idler (an element that reacts clamping load) in compression rather than tension, and because the idler contact surface is not conformal as in the Kopp design. In general {{because of the way the}} CVT is set up, it is more efficient at a 1:1 ratio compared to maximum overdrive or <b>underdrive</b> positions.

40|$|Electrical {{turbulence}} in cardiac {{tissue is}} associated with arrhythmias such as life-threatening ventricular fibrillation. Recent experimental {{studies have shown that}} a sequence of low-energy electrical far-field pulses is able to terminate fibrillation more gently than a single high-energy pulse which causes severe side effects. During this low-energy antifibrillation pacing (LEAP), only tissue near sufficiently large conduction heterogeneities, such as large coronary arteries, is activated. In order to optimize LEAP, we performed extensive simulations of cardiac tissue perforated by blood vessels, employing two alternative cellular models that exhibit electrical turbulence at a similar length scale. Moreover, the scale of blood vessels in our two-dimensional simulations was chosen such that the threshold for single pulse defibrillation matches experimental values. For each of the 100 initial conditions, we tested different electrical field strengths, pulse shapes, numbers of pulses, and periods between the pulses. LEAP is successful for both models, albeit with substantial differences. One model exhibits a spectrum of chaotic activity featuring a narrow peak around a dominant frequency. In this case, the optimal period between low-energy pulses matches this frequency and LEAP greatly reduces the required energy for successful defibrillation. For pulses with larger energies, the system is perturbed such that <b>underdrive</b> pacing becomes advantageous. The spectrum of the second model features a broader peak, resulting in a less pronounced optimal pacing period and a decreased energy reduction. In both cases, pacing with five or six pulses which are separated by the dominant period maximizes the energy reduction. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|E
