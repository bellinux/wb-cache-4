50|$|This bird nests in an <b>unlined</b> <b>hole</b> {{in a tree}} cavity, laying 2-3 eggs.|$|E
50|$|It nests in an <b>unlined</b> <b>hole</b> up to 9 m {{high in a}} dead tree. The clutch is two {{or three}} glossy white eggs, {{incubated}} by both sexes.|$|E
50|$|This {{woodpecker}} {{occurs in}} the higher levels of wet forests, semi-open woodland and old second growth. It nests in an <b>unlined</b> <b>hole</b> 6 - 30 m high in a dead tree. The clutch is two to four glossy white eggs, incubated by both sexes.|$|E
5000|$|They feed on arthropods, {{especially}} insects, {{which they}} find by probing with their bills in rotten wood and in crevices in bark. [...] They nest in <b>unlined</b> tree <b>holes,</b> laying {{two to four}} eggs, which are blue, grey, or olive, and unmarked in most species.|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat of}} this species is wet forests and {{adjacent}} second growth or semi-open woodland. Two white eggs are laid in an <b>unlined</b> nest <b>hole</b> 3 - 30 m high in a tree and incubated by both sexes. The young hatch naked and are fed by both parents.|$|R
50|$|The {{cardinal}} woodpecker often occurs in small family groups or may join small mixed flocks. Forages {{mainly in the}} lower storeys of trees and among shrubs and vines, on maize stalks and reeds. Pecks rapidly and probes dense vegetation, clambering along and hanging from small twigs. Like other woodpeckers, this species is an insectivore. It is frequently seen, and regularly drums softly. The call is a high-pitched krrrek-krrrek-krrrek. It nests in a tree <b>hole,</b> <b>unlined</b> apart from wood chippings.|$|R
50|$|Although living rollers are {{birds of}} warm climates in the Old World, fossil {{records show that}} rollers were present in North America during the Eocene. They are monogamous and nest in an <b>unlined</b> <b>hole</b> in a tree or in masonry, and lay 2-4 eggs in the tropics, 3-6 at higher latitudes. The eggs, which are white, hatch after 17-20 days, and the young remain in the nest for {{approximately}} another 30 days.|$|E
50|$|The 3-4 white {{eggs are}} laid in an <b>unlined</b> <b>hole</b> in a tree, usually an old {{woodpecker}} nest, but sometimes a natural cavity. Both sexes incubate the eggs for 14-15 days, and the chicks {{remain in the}} nest after hatching. They are blind and naked at birth, and have short bills and specialised pads on their heels {{to protect them from}} the rough floor of the nest. They are fed by both parents and fledge after about 6 weeks. They are fed for several weeks after leaving the nest.|$|E
50|$|Rollers are {{noisy and}} {{aggressive}} when defending their nesting territories, which they patrol while displaying their striking plumage. Intruders are attacked with intimidating rolling dives. They are monogamous and nest in an <b>unlined</b> <b>hole</b> {{in a tree}} or in masonry, and lay 2-4 eggs in the tropics, 3-6 at higher latitudes. The eggs, which are white, hatch after 17-20 days, and the young remain in the nest for approximately another 30 days. Egg laying is staggered at one-day intervals so that if food is short only the older larger nestlings get fed. The chicks are naked, blind and helpless when they hatch.|$|E
50|$|The {{laughing}} kookaburra is {{native to}} eastern mainland Australia, but has also been introduced to parts of New Zealand, Tasmania, and Western Australia. It occupies dry eucalypt forest, woodland, city parks and gardens. This species is sedentary and occupies the same territory throughout the year. It is monogamous and retains the same partner for life. A breeding pair can be accompanied by up to five fully grown non-breeding offspring from previous years that help the parents defend their territory and raise their young. The laughing kookaburra generally breeds in <b>unlined</b> tree <b>holes</b> or in excavated holes in arboreal termite nests. The usual clutch is three white eggs. The parents and the helpers incubate the eggs and feed the chicks. The youngest of the three nestlings is often killed by the older siblings. When the chicks fledge {{they continue to be}} fed by the group for six to ten weeks until they are able to forage independently.|$|R
50|$|Green-rumped parrotlets breed {{during the}} rainy season (June- November). They {{typically}} make their nests in <b>unlined</b> tree cavities, <b>holes</b> found in arboreal termite nests, or in cavities in wooden fence posts. The female lays an average of seven white eggs over a period of 9-16 days. The female usually initiates incubation after the first egg is laid, leading to asynchronous hatching which begins 18-22 days after the start of incubation. Depending on the clutch size, hatching concludes 2-14 days after the first egg hatches. Fledging occurs 29-35 days after hatching, with the clutch fledging over a period of 14 days on average.|$|R
