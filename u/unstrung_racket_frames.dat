Rigid hand, forearm, upper-arm and torso segments were driven by joint angle time histories obtained from backhand performances. Wobbling mass segments were incorporated to represent soft tissue motion. The upper-limb model was attached to a forward dynamics model of the racket-ball system using spring-dampers at the thenar and hypothenar eminences of the hand. The <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> was represented using two rigid bodies with two torsional spring-dampers to allow motion {{in and out of}} the racket plane. The stringbed was represented by nine point masses connected using elastic springs. A point mass representation of the tennis ball allowed normal and oblique impacts at the nine locations on the stringbed. Inertia parameters for the elite tennis player and the rackets and visco-elastic parameters for the rackets and ball were determined from independent experimental tests. Visco-elastic parameters for the hand and wobbling masses were determined within the matching process of six backhand trials. Excellent agreement between performance and matching simulations was obtained with a mean RMS difference of 1. 3 % based on racket kinematics, outbound ball velocity and time of ball contact. Simulation results suggest that the inertia and stiffness parameters of the <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> and the stringbed tension have a relatively small influence on elbow loading within current design ranges. In contrast, the off-centre ball impact simulations resulted in an 11 % increase in peak internal elbow joint force, a 22 % increase in peak pronation-supination net torque and a 19 % increase in peak elbow-flexion extension net torque around the elbow joint. This research suggests that <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> vibration is an unlikely mechanism for tennis elbow and that an accumulation of peak loads from off-centre hits is a more likely cause.

40|$|A {{model has}} been derived that determines the ball, stringbed and <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> motion for an impact between a tennis ball and racket. This paper {{describes}} the model and methods used to verify it experimentally. The model incorporated parameters such as racket mass, moment of inertia and ball stiffness. The work was conducted to produce a tool {{that could be used}} to identify the importance of each of the parameters on the impact. The ball was modelled as simple spring and damper in parallel while the stringbed was modelled as a spring in series with the ball. The values of these spring and damper parameters were determined experimentally. It was assumed that the <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> was a rigid body to simplify the analysis. Two different methods of supporting the racket were modelled, and the balls were always projected perpendicular to the string plane. Firstly, the racket was head-clamped and all the balls impacted at the geometric string centre of the racket. Good agreement was found between the experiment and model data for both ball rebound velocity and maximum stringbed deflection during impact. The second method of support involved freely suspending the racket at the tip on a small pin. Three different impact positions along the longitudinal axis of the racket were tested. Good agreement between the experiment and model data was found for the ball rebound velocity for impacts at the geometric string centre of the racket. The model over-predicted the experimental racket rebound velocity (generally by less than 5 per cent) for all impact positions. A qualitative analysis assigned this small difference to the assumption that the frame was a rigid body and therefore vibration losses were not accounted for. </p...|$|R

Cable structures, which are used for exterior materials of reinforced concrete structures, act on strong positive tension on cables instead of mullion and transom, and secure openness and ease of construction (Park 2002). A typical example is the cable network cladding system where the fixed hardware is installed at the edge points connected vertically and horizontally to fix square or rectangular glass in point shape (Park et al. 2014).

The interaction of the stingbed and frame simulated using two different loading conditions; a point load and a distributed load. The point load condition gave a predictable dynamic response in which and impact at the fundamental node point of the model beam resulted in minimal vibrations after impact. However, when simulating the force as a distributed load the ball impact position which gave minimal vibrations was not located at this node. These theoretical results were related to those found in modal analysis of a tennis racket. It was concluded that the impact force mush be applied as a distributed load in order for a one-dimensional beam model to correctly simulate the mode of vibration of the racket...|$|R

Previous work has shown that reducing the number of cross strings in a tennis racket can increase rebound ball spin. The aim of this study was to further our understanding of the effect of the number of cross strings on ball spin generation. Two rackets were tested, one with 16 main and 19 cross strings and the other with 16 main and 12 cross strings. The <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> was fully-constrained and a ball was fired onto the strings at inbound angles of 24 and 38 °. Inbound velocity was set at 30 m/s and inbound spin was varied from 0 to 500 rad/s. Ball velocity and spin, and lateral main string deflections during impact, were measured from high-speed video footage. Lateral string deflections were consistently larger for the racket with fewer cross strings. The racket with fewer cross strings produced slightly higher rebound spin and lower horizontal rebound velocity, which was attributed to the main strings returning during the restitution phase of the impact...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Only very {{recently}} has modern technology {{been applied to}} the design of the tennis racket. In fact, the tennis player of a few hundred years ago would easily recognize today's racket. Although the literature reveals a surprising number of studies on racket mechanics, little work has been reported on the dynamic stresses involved during tennis play. Such investigations lead naturally to questions of fully stressed design optimization. An AMF/Head "Professional" tennis racket was modeled on an IBMPC-AT using the MSC-PAL finite element code. Experimental verification of the computer model was accomplished in two ways. First, the racket was clamped at the handle, loaded statically, and deflections measured by dial indicator. Next, the racket was instrumented with piezoelectric accelerometers, caused to vibrate in its fundamental mode, and the resulting acceleration-time history recorded on a digital oscilloscope. This data was translated on the IBMPC-AT to reveal the racket's fundamental natural frequency. These experimental results were then compared to the predictions from the finite element model. For dynamic loading, the racket was mounted in a test fixture utilizing a spring-loaded arm. Tennis balls were fired from a pitching machine with the acceleration-time history again recorded on a digital oscilloscope. The data was processed on the IBMPC-AT and used as input for the finite element transient analysis, and dynamic stresses in the <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> were determined. The results are disscused and future research opportunities are indicated...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of two different racket models and two different forehand drive velocities on the three-dimensional vibration behavior of the racket and shock transmission to the player’s wrist under real playing conditions. Nine tennis players performed a series of crosscourt flat forehand drives at two velocities, using a lightly and a highly vibrant racket. Two accelerometers were fixed on the <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> and the player’s wrist. The analysis of vibration signals in both time and frequency domains showed no inter-action effect of velocity and racket conditions either on the racket vibration behavior or on shock transmission. An increase in playing velocity enlarged the amount of vibrations at the racket and wrist, but weakly altered their frequency content. As compared to a racket per-ceived as highly vibrating, a racket perceived as lightly vibrating damped longer in the out-of-plane axis of the racket and shorter on the other axis of the racket and on the wrist, and displayed a lower amount {{of energy in the}} high frequency of the vibration signal at the racket and wrist. These findings indicated that the playing velocity must be controlled when investigating the vibration loads due to the racket under real playing conditions. Similarly, a reduced perception of vibration by the tennis player would be linked to decreased ampli-tude of the racket vibration signal, which may concentrate the signal energy in the low frequencies...|$|R
40|$|Tennis {{equipment}} manufactures {{should have}} a complete understanding of the physics of the game, as this aid will aid them when designing and developing {{the next generation of}} rackets, strings and balls. Finite element (FE) models have to be used previously to simulate impacts between a tennis ball and racket. The accuracy of these models is usually obtained by comparing them against experimental data obtained within a laboratory. The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare an FE model to a freely suspended racket against impact data from actual tennis shots. An FE model consisting of a tennis ball, string-bed and racket was constructed in Ansys/LS-DYNA 10. 0. The FE model was compared with data for the impact of a ball on a racket for 18 actual tennis shots. The data for the tennis shots was collected from elite players during practice at the 2006 Wimbledon qualifying tournament. The root mean squared error for the rebound properties of the ball from the FE model and the actual shots was, 0. 9 ms- 1 for velocity, 9 ° for angle and 61 rad. s- 1 for spin. It was concluded that the FE model is sufficiently accurate to replicate the impact between a ball and racket during an actual tennis shot.

40|$|AbstractA torque-driven, 3 D {{computer}} simulation model of an arm-racket system {{was used to}} investigate the effects of ball impact location (nine locations on the stringbed) on wrist flexionfor one-handed tennis backhand groundstrokes. The model consists of nine segments with three rotational degrees of freedom at the shoulder, two at the elbow, two at the wrist, three at the grip and two between the racket handle and racket head. Seven pairs of torque generators were used to control joint angle changes with each pair of torque generators representing the torque exerted by the corresponding agonist-antagonist muscles across a joint. The torque exerted during a simulation was determined by multiplying maximum voluntary torque and the corresponding torque activation level which was specified {{as a function of}} time using flexor and extensor torque activation profiles. The stringbed was represented by nine point masses connected to each other and the <b>racket</b> <b>frame</b> with elastic springs and three torsional springdampers between the hand and the racket were used to represent grip tightness. The model was designed so that the ball could contact the racket at any of the nine point mass locations and therefore allow simulations for different ball impact locations. The starting point of all simulations was a matched centre impact trial with all parameters in the model kept at the values used in the matching simulation apart from ball impact location. For each perturbation of ball impact location, simulations were run for a 50 ms period starting with ball-racket impact. The effect of ball impact location on the movement of the racket and wrist could be clearly grouped into three impact locations; above the longitudinal axis of the racket, on the longitudinal axis of the racket and below the longitudinal of the racket. Simulations showed that during off-centre impacts below the longitudinal axis of the racket, the wrist was forced to flex up to 16 ∘ more due to substantial racket rotation within the hand when compared to a matched centre impact simulation. As a consequence off-centre impacts below the longitudinal axis of the racket may be a substantial contributing factor for tennis elbow injuries due to forced wrist flexion and eccentric contraction of the wrist extensors...|$|R
40|$|Liquidmetal(R) alloy {{is part of}} {{an entirely}} new class of {{vitrified}} metals, and is also known as metallic glass, or Vitreloy(R). A vitrified metal is a frozen liquid that fails to crystallize during solidification, unlike common metals such as titanium, steel, and aluminum. The technology takes the non-crystalline structure of glass and combines it with the properties of metal, a combination not found in nature, allowing for a product that offers the strength of a metal with the elasticity of a polymer. This unique technology is more than twice as strong as titanium and has a higher elastic limit. Liquidmetal(R) Golf presents this space-age development in a complete line golf clubs. Clubs made with this technology have a lower vibration response along with a softer, more solid feel. Because less energy is absorbed by the club's head upon impact, more energy is transferred directly to the ball.
