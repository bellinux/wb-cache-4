40|$|The Dutch Architecture Union {{stated in}} a {{building}} magazine in 1948 : “There {{is no reason to}} believe that houses and districts, that meet the specified demands, will lose their utility in the next one hundred years”. The actual practice has turned out to be different. Post World War II terraced houses face demolition after fifty or sixty years, because these houses do not live up to today’s demands. Every year, approximately 20, 000 houses are being demolished, creating huge amounts of debris. At this pace, it will take over 300 years to replace the entire Dutch housing stock. This is obviously far too long. Three strategies to solve this problem can be distinguished. Of these, renovation is the best option regarding waste reduction and preservation of the societal structure of the post World War II districts. Unfortunately, renovation is generally not chosen by housing corporations, mainly because of the impact of the operation and the required participation of the occupants. SmartRenovation is a new approach to renovation. It forges links between the housing corporation, the architect, the occupants and the contractor by offering a toolkit for <b>upgrading</b> the <b>post</b> World War II houses in a fast and efficient way by adding prefabricated units to either the front or the back of the house...|$|R

50|$|Before 1981, {{the prison}} {{officers}} in all provinces of Pakistan {{used to wear}} khaki colour uniforms as worn by the Pakistan Army.

The upgrades [...] the controls philosophy change-over to the floating pressure control technology and the newly refurbished equipment [...] have greatly improved the performance, stability, and efficiency of these two refrigerators.

40|$|Several {{projects}} have been completed or are nearing completion at the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) National Transonic Facility (NTF). The addition of a Model Flow-Control/Propulsion Simulation test capability to the NTF provides a unique, transonic, high-Reynolds number test capability that is well suited for research in propulsion airframe integration studies, circulation control high-lift concepts, powered lift, and cruise separation flow control. A 1992 vintage Facility Automation System (FAS) that performs the control functions for tunnel pressure, temperature, Mach number, model position, safety interlock and supervisory controls was replaced using current, commercially available components. This FAS upgrade also involved a design study for {{the replacement of the}} facility Mach measurement system {{and the development of a}} software-based simulation model of NTF processes and control systems. The FAS upgrades were validated by a <b>post</b> <b>upgrade</b> verification wind tunnel test. The data acquisition system (DAS) upgrade project involves the design, purchase, build, integration, installation and verification of a new DAS by replacing several early 1990 's vintage computer systems with state of the art hardware/software.
