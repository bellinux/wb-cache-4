5|$|Richard John Charles Tomlinson (born 13 January 1963) is {{a former}} officer of the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). He {{believes}} he was subject to <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> from MI6 in 1995, and attempted to take his former employer to a tribunal. MI6 refused, arguing that {{to do so would}} breach state security, although Tomlinson disputed this reasoning.|$|E
5|$|On 21 March 2000, {{during a}} game with Manchester City, he {{ruptured}} his anterior cruciate ligaments, keeping him out of action for several months. He was awarded a testimonial against Manchester City in August 2000, but got into a dispute with the club over the financial arrangements. He then left the club in November 2000, and issued employment tribunal proceedings for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror {{newspaper}} printed {{pictures of}} Arsenal fans {{alleged to have}} been part of the violence. It later arose that the majority of the people in the photos were either not involved or had been acting in self-defence. The photos led to some postmen working for Royal Mail losing their jobs because they had been seen in the photos and in television coverage, even though they had not been arrested. Michael Doherty, the chairman of the Communication Workers Union, and his brother Tom took Royal Mail to an Employment Tribunal for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> claiming they had been acting in self-defence. In 2001, the tribunal ruled in their favour, and ordered Royal Mail to reinstate them. In 2012, the editor of the Daily Mirror at the time, Piers Morgan apologised for printing the pictures.|$|E
50|$|The {{procedure}} for resolving unfair-labour-practice disputes {{is similar to}} the dispute resolution for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{welfare of}} the company's {{employees}} has been subject to scrutiny in recent months following complaints of late salary payments, lack of trained leadership, long hours, <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals,</b> high staff turnover and harassment cases.|$|R
5000|$|Dismissal for {{a reason}} {{contrary}} to statute or contrary to a statutory procedure is described as [...] "unfair dismissal" [...] but not all wrongful <b>dismissals</b> are <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals,</b> and dismissal by forcing somebody to resign through {{serious breach of contract}} is known as constructive dismissal and constructive dismissal is usually a wrongful dismissal due to lack of notice.|$|R
5|$|Under Section 8, the Secretary of State {{could pass}} a {{statutory}} instrument setting out {{the rules and}} limits surrounding compensation for the employee's dismissal after making a protected disclosure; until this is done, Section 9 provided interim remedies, which {{were the same as}} in other cases of <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal.</b> The Secretary of State did pass such an instrument, the Public Interest Disclosure (Compensation) Regulations 1999, but Section 8 has now been repealed under Section 44 of the Employment Relations Act 1999. Under Section 10, the Act applies to crown servants, excepting under Section 11, those who are employees of MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. The Act does exclude, in Sections 12 and 13, serving police officers and those employed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> laws did {{not prevent}} the {{implication}} of the term.|$|E
25|$|The {{applicant}} undertook {{an unsuccessful}} internal appeal against dismissal, and subsequently {{applied to the}} Employment Tribunal, claiming discrimination on the ground of religion or belief, harassment, <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> and wrongful dismissal. The claim of wrongful dismissal was accepted on procedural grounds, but the other claims were dismissed, and the applicant appealed against the dismissal of the claims of discrimination and <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> to the Employment Appeal Tribunal.|$|E
50|$|The AFIC {{has come}} under {{scrutiny}} under claims of mismanagement of Islamic schools run by the organisation. Claims range from financial impropriety, <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> of staff, gender discrimination and the hiring of teachers with fundamentalist or extremist backgrounds.|$|R
30|$|On November 6, 1999, the Spanish {{government}} {{passed a}} law which granted working parents with children under 6  years old the right to reduce their work schedules to reconcile work and family life. 8 The work time reduction granted ranges from one third to {{one half of the}} usual full-time schedule, with an equivalent wage reduction. 9 Workers also have the right to choose the time slot during the day when they want to work. The firm must either agree or go to court. Under this law, worker dismissals for any reason related to pregnancy, maternity or paternity leave, and childcare were declared “unfair.” When employers face <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> for reasons other than pregnancy, maternity, or childcare, they can solve them by either paying the severance payments stipulated for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> (45  days per year worked {{at the time of the}} passing of the law) or by re-hiring the worker. In practically all cases, firms pay the severance payment and do not re-hire the worker. 10 However, if dismissals related with pregnancy, maternity, or childcare issues are declared unfair, workers must be readmitted. The possibility of payment for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> is not envisaged in this case, so in essence, this law provides its users with greater protection against dismissals.|$|R
50|$|Hedwig Ross {{was born}} Hedwig Weitzel on 17 September 1900 in New Zealand, to German {{immigrants}} Friedrich Gustav Weitzal and Maria Weitzl née Benninghoven who were farmers. As a schoolgirl in Wellington she witnessed the 1913 Great Strike of New Zealand, where workers from several industries protested against {{working conditions and}} <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals.</b>|$|R
25|$|Prior to WorkChoices, <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> protections {{existed in}} awards or through state {{industrial}} relation commissions. The changes to dismissal laws {{was part of}} WorkChoices which reduced the protections of previous <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> laws, which were introduced at a federal level by the Labor Government of Paul Keating in 1993. The arguments for these changes related to creating jobs by removing the burden on business of dismissing unsuitable employees. Arguments against the changes included the lack of job security for employees.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> and {{unlawful}} termination claims {{went through}} an initial hearing and compulsory conciliation {{conference at the}} AIRC. Only when the conciliation was unsuccessful and a conciliation certificate issued could the claim proceed to the next step. For <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> claims, the claim proceeded to arbitration by the AIRC, where a Member of the Commission could issue a binding decision. For unlawful termination claims, the claim proceeded to a court with appropriate jurisdiction such as the Federal Court or the Industrial Division of the Federal Magistrates Court.|$|E
25|$|WorkChoices {{contained}} provisions {{relating to}} both <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> and unlawful termination, which are separate matters. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) retained {{some of its}} role in hearing <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> and unlawful termination cases, but increased the emphasis on mediation and conciliation. It also reduced the timeframe within which employees were able to lodge such claims; claims had to be lodged within 21 days from the date of termination. Employees could apply for an extension of this timeframe, but a review of published decisions shows that extensions were infrequently granted. Fees applied for applications, at one time $55.70.|$|E
40|$|Lenny Roth {{provides}} an overview of the main provisions of the federal government’s Work Choices legislation and the current High Court challenge mounted by state governments. He looks at the coverage of new system and at changes to award wages, award conditions, legislative conditions, workplace agreements, constraints on industrial action, dispute resolution procedures and <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Discrimination in the {{workplace}} particularly relates to access to employment, job retention and safety in {{the workplace}}. [...] An inability {{to find a job}} can cause difficulties with having enough money, but also can cause a person to feel disconnected from the world. [...] Transgender people have reported harassment, violations of privacy, and <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> at the workplace.|$|R
50|$|The Employment Act 2006 {{sets out}} a number of {{employee}} and employer rights on the Isle of Man such as the right to a minimum wage, the right to a minimum period of notice and <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals.</b> Pursuant to the Miniumum Wage Act 2001, the Isle of Man has a minimum wage committee who determine different minimum wage amounts depending on the age of the employee.|$|R
25|$|A {{grievance}} procedure {{was required to}} be included in the written statement of particulars of the contract of employment. A worker under a normal contract of employment could receive compensation for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> to encourage the development of dismissal procedures.|$|E
25|$|In October 2012, Osborne {{proposed}} {{a new policy}} to boost the hiring of staff, under which companies {{would be able to}} give new appointees shares worth between £2,000 and £50,000, but the appointees would lose the right to claim <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> and time off for training.|$|E
25|$|Empowered {{employers}} to fire striking workers and not face <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> claims if all workers {{involved in the}} strike at a particular workplace on a particular day are sacked. This allows {{employers to}} selectively fire striking workers, like those who continue to strike whilst other workers have returned to work.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, {{the concept}} of [...] "unfair labour practice" [...] was broadly defined. The Industrial Court (a {{specialist}} tribunal that exercised jurisdiction over alleged unfair labour practices) took several innovative approaches. The court formulated {{a set of rules}} to govern <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals.</b> These rules are now contained in Chapter VIII of the Labour Relations Act 1995 and in the Code of Good Practice: Dismissal.|$|R
5000|$|Section 187 of the LRA {{lists the}} reasons for which an {{employee}} may not be dismissed under any circumstances. Such dismissals are [...] "automatically unfair." [...] Once it is proved that the employee has been dismissed {{for any of these}} reasons, the employer may not raise any defence save those provided for in the Act. Victims of automatically <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> will invariably be reinstated unless they choose compensation instead.|$|R
40|$|This study assesses whether {{hospitality}} employees consider {{workplace training}} is adequate and identifies management’s {{view on the}} importance of training. Links between inadequate training and problems such as sexual harassment, <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals,</b> under-staffing, poor food hygiene, and theft are also identified. Results indicate that hospitality employees are commonly required to work without sufficient training, and that training has a positive effect on employee relations by reducing workplace problems and improving staff retention...|$|R
25|$|The way {{to enforce}} a claim for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> is at an {{employment}} tribunal. An employee who is dismissed may also have breach of contract claim(s), based on common law. Common law claim(s) may be brought in a county court. Employment tribunals are spread around the country, in most towns. The right to bring a case falls under Part X, Chapter 2, s.111.|$|E
25|$|Away {{from the}} cricket field, on 8 April the ECB {{announced}} that triangular One Day International tournaments {{would no longer}} be played in England. On 11 April Kevin Pietersen, England's South African-born all-rounder was reported to have a foot injury that could see him miss the start of the season, and Chris Schofield began his case for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> against Lancashire, which he eventually won.|$|E
25|$|He {{was elected}} Member of Parliament for Mitcham in 1950 and served there until 1974 when the seat was merged {{and he moved}} to Carshalton. In Edward Heath's {{government}} he served as Secretary of State for Employment and {{was responsible for the}} Industrial Relations Act 1971, which balanced the introduction of compensation for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> with curbs on the freedom to strike and the virtual abolition of closed shop agreements.|$|E

50|$|Section 187(1)(d) is of {{particular}} importance. It designates as automatically <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> {{in response to the}} employee's taking action, or indicating an intention to take any action, against the employer by exercising any right conferred by the LRA, or by participating in any proceedings in terms of the LRA. Dismissal for any conduct regarding membership of a trade union, or for exercising the rights conferred by the labour legislation, is automatically unfair.|$|R

Activities include strikes, rallies and leafleting, filing injunctions and arguing cases at Labour Commissions and District Courts on issues such as fixed-term contracts, the non-enrollment of employees into Social Insurance, illegal outsourcing of Assistant Language Teachers by public schools, and <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> due to one-year contracts.|$|R
25|$|His {{early work}} as {{political}} columnist on The Spectator {{coincided with the}} war in Biafra, a mainly Catholic province that had tried to secede from Nigeria. Waugh strongly criticised Harold Wilson's government, especially the foreign secretary Michael Stewart, for colluding {{in the use of}} mass starvation as a political weapon. He was sacked from The Spectator in 1970, but with the support of Bernard Levin and others, he won damages for <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> in a subsequent action.|$|E
25|$|In December 2008, it was {{reported}} that following Ashley's decision to withdraw the sale of Newcastle United, a legal dispute in regards to Keegan's departure of the club was in place between himself and Ashley, with Keegan claiming <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> and Ashley claiming damage to his public image. In September 2009, it {{was reported}} that Keegan had met with Ashley and the Newcastle board – including former members – in a Premier League arbitration hearing for a claim of £10 million in compensation for his shock resignation.|$|E
25|$|As {{manager of}} Shamrock Rovers, Collins {{struggled}} {{both on and}} off the pitch. Following a points deduction because the club presented fraudulent documents to the FAI licensing committee, after a season of poor results and in-fighting at the club, Shamrock Rovers faced relegation. Collins was first suspended for a week in November 2005 pending the resolution of an internal investigation. After Rovers were relegated for the first time ever Collins' contract was terminated. He later brought a claim of <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissal</b> against Shamrock Rovers to the Employment Appeals Tribunal in Dublin, the case was settled out of court in November 2006.|$|E

It's an embarrassment for Laurie who no doubt wishes he were elsewhere. [...] Information provided by Geoff Pryor...|$|R
50|$|The RVIP {{is headed}} by a Commissioner, {{assisted}} by a Deputy Commissioner. In April 2013 the Government advertised a vacancy for the post of Commissioner. There was speculation that the appointment was a foregone conclusion and that the Deputy Commissioner (and then Acting Commissioner) David Morris would be appointed. In July 2013 the Governor announced that David Morris had been appointed as Commissioner with effect from September 2013. The appointment has caused some controversy, as there are on-going formal complaints against the new Commissioner in which <b>unfair</b> <b>dismissals</b> and abuse of authority are alleged.|$|R
