30|$|The {{present study}} is aimed at {{analyzing}} impact of change in input land cover on model-simulated parameters such as near surface temperature and surface skin temperature. The impact of incorporation of urban canopy features along with modifications in LULC has also been analyzed. Three different types of land <b>use</b> <b>data</b> have been applied to the model viz. USGS land <b>use</b> <b>data,</b> MODIS-based land <b>use</b> <b>data</b> and user-modified USGS land <b>use</b> <b>data.</b> A coupled simulation with modified land <b>use</b> <b>data</b> and urban canopy model has also been carried out. Model performance has been evaluated for temperature and surface skin temperature based on statistical parameters. Further urban heat island intensities (UHI) have been computed for all four simulation cases for varying land use and compared with the UHI estimations based on observations and the impacts on model performance analyzed.|$|R

We discuss the macro and micro indices of land <b>use</b> <b>data</b> generalization with consideration of spatial scales and landscape pattern. To quantitatively relate the indices and scale and landscape pattern metrics, land <b>use</b> <b>data</b> samples have been collected at multiple spatial scales in various land use regions across China. Based on statistic analysis, we then generate both macro and micro control rules for land <b>use</b> <b>data</b> generalization at various spatial scales and patterns.

5|$|<b>Using</b> <b>data</b> from Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, {{scientists}} have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals.

Usually chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars Rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.|$|E
