5000|$|The power-egg, {{a literal}} {{translation}} into English of the German term Kraftei, was a design feature in German Second World War era aircraft, particularly for twin or multi-engined airframe designs. The power-egg {{was a completely}} [...] "unitized" [...] modular engine installation, consisting of engine and all ancillary equipment, which could be swapped between suitably designed aircraft, with standardised quick-changing attachment points and connectors. In aircraft so designed the power-egg was removed before {{mean time to failure}} was reached and a fresh one installed, the removed engine would then be sent for maintenance. In ideal conditions spare engines were placed in sealed containers protected from damage and the elements, to be opened when needed. These existed in two differing formats — the initial Motoranlage format which used some specialized added components depending on what airframe it was meant for use on, and the Triebwerksanlage format, a more complete <b>unitization</b> format usually including exhaust and oil cooling systems.|$|E
5000|$|Engines were {{typically}} delivered from BMW complete in their cowling, {{ready to be}} bolted {{to the front of}} the aircraft or nacelle, since 1942 as Motoranlage (M) and 1944/1945 as Triebwerksanlage (T). The Motoranlage was the original form of the interchangeable Kraftei, or [...] "power-egg", unitized powerplant installation concept used in many German wartime aircraft. It was most often used with twin and multi-engined designs, with some need for external add-ons. The more comprehensive Triebwerksanlage format for <b>unitization</b> consolidated more of the engine's required accessory systems beyond what the earlier Motoranlage concept could, plus some external mountings, such as an integrally complete exhaust system (including a turbocharger, if fitted as part of the design), as a completely interchangeable unit. Both M and T formats were also used with various inline engines, like the Daimler-Benz DB 603 used for both the inline-engined versions of the Do 217 and the enormous Bv 238 flying boat, and the Junkers Jumo 213 powerplants used for later marks of the Ju 88 multirole aircraft.|$|E

Both the examples of the Dornier Do 217 medium bomber powered by inline engines, and the Axis Powers' largest-flown powered aircraft of any type, the Blohm & Voss BV 238 flying boat used essentially the same unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplants, complete with [...] "chin" [...] radiators under the nacelles as integral components. A differing Kraftei physical packaging is also {{believed to have been}} crafted by the Heinkel firm for the DB 603 engines used on its Heinkel He 219A night fighter, as {{what appears to be the}} same exact engine installation design used for the He 219A was also used for the quartet of ordered airframes for the same firm's He 177B four-DB 603-engined heavy bomber design's prototype series, as both airframe types' engine [...] "units" [...] used annular radiators and cylindrical cowls of identical appearance to enclose them.

40|$|International audienceThe Pre-Salt Polygon 1 is {{amongst the}} most {{important}} {{oil and natural gas}} discoveries of the last few years in Brazil and globally. In July 2017, its production represented 48. 2 per cent of total Brazilian output. 2 Due to the geological structure of the area, and the presence of fields already granted under concession agreements and onerous assignment agreements, this will probably result in the signing of many <b>unitization</b> agreements (UAs) in the next few years. The Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) is about to regulate ‘procedures and guidelines for the <b>unitization</b> agreement negotiation’, according to Article 34 of the Pre-salt Law. In compliance with this article, ANP published Resolution No 25 of 2013 on 9 July 2013, which regulates the <b>unitization</b> procedure in Brazil, covering onshore and offshore E&P operations. These rules provided solutions to issues that the revoked Article 27 of Petroleum Law, the various E&P concession agreements and other ANP Resolutions could not solve, although other issues, especially relating to open areas located in the Pre-salt Polygon, remain. The National Energy Policy Council (CNPE) has published Resolution No 8 of 2016, establishing <b>unitization</b> guidelines for the process of involving open areas. CNPE has also launched Resolution No 7 of 2017, which provides guidelines on local content in <b>unitization</b> areas.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{extends the}} property rights {{theory of the}} firm in two directions by examining, first, the value of information when contracts are incomplete, and secondly, the impact of incomplete contracts on situations characterized by non-excludability of assets and rivalry over the ownership of assets.;The first issue is addressed {{in the context of}} the choice between exports and foreign direct investment facing a firm commencing operations in a foreign country. Apart from considering similarities in cost structures and asset specificity of investments as location-specific factors, the view is presented that the ability to gain familiarity with an initially unfamiliar country is location-specific as well. A 2 ̆ 7 similarity effect 2 ̆ 7 and a 2 ̆ 7 familiarity effect 2 ̆ 7 are identified, and these effects can reinforce or oppose one another; in the latter case, the firm may choose different entry modes depending on the extent of its initial familiarity with the foreign market. From a more theoretical point of view, a somewhat surprising feature of the property rights theory emerges: information may lose value when contracts are incomplete.;The second issue is analyzed {{in the context of the}} oil industry. Specifically, two alternative organizational modes for extracting oil from a common pool are considered: competitive extraction and <b>unitization.</b> Competitive extraction results in significant rent dissipation, and <b>unitization</b> is generally viewed as a common property solution to this problem. Yet, a puzzle confronting the oil industry is that firms are often reluctant to voluntarily enter <b>unitization</b> agreements. The fact that <b>unitization</b> contracts are typically incomplete can serve to reconcile the puzzle. While the literature has stressed the role of ex ante bargaining problems in precipitating the failure of <b>unitization</b> agreements, the emphasis here is on demonstrating that the anticipation of ex post bargaining may impose inefficiencies on <b>unitization</b> that compete with the inefficiencies associated with competitive extraction due to the common pool problem. The outcome can be a lower surplus under <b>unitization,</b> which suggests that the general presumption in the literature that <b>unitization</b> is surplus enhancing relative to competitive extraction may not be always be valid...|$|E
40|$|In normal aging, {{memory for}} {{associations}} declines more than memory for individual items. <b>Unitization</b> is an encoding process defined by {{creation of a}} new single entity to represent a new arbitrary association. The current study tested the hypothesis that age-related differences in associative memory can be reduced following encoding instructions that promote <b>unitization.</b> In two experiments, groups of 20 young and 20 older participants learned new associations between a word and a background color under two conditions. In the item detail condition, they had to imagine that the item is the same color as the background; an instruction promoting <b>unitization</b> of the associations. In the context detail condition, that did not promote <b>unitization,</b> they had to imagine that the item interacted with another colored object. At test, they had to retrieve the color that was associated to each word (source memory). In both experiments, the results showed an age-related decrement in source memory performance in the context detail but not in the item detail condition. Moreover, Experiment 2 examined receiver operating characteristics in older participants and indicated that familiarity contributed more to source memory performance in the item detail than in the context detail condition. These findings suggest that <b>unitization</b> of new associations can overcome the associative memory deficit observed in aging, at least for item-color associations. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|<b>Unitization</b> {{refers to}} when two {{components}} are integrated or combined {{into a single}} unit. So the whole is more familiar than the parts (Graf 2 ̆ 6 Schacter, 1989). Previous researchers have shown <b>unitization</b> of unrelated word pairs can occur {{by the use of}} compound definition. As support, they have found <b>unitization</b> to increase reliance on familiarity in associative recognition. The purpose of this PhD dissertation was {{to examine the effects of}} <b>unitization</b> of preexperimental associations on associative recognition. The effects of associative recognition of unitized compound word (CW) pairs can serve as a useful benchmark to compare to that of other methods of <b>unitization.</b> In Chapter 2, I present findings from Manuscript 1 consisting of five experiments in which I investigated the effects of <b>unitization</b> of CW pairs on associative recognition. In Experiment 1, I found a CW effect as in higher hit rates and false alarm rates for CW compared to noncompound word (NCW) pairs. In addition, there was no discrimination difference between CW and NCW pairs. In Experiments 2 a and 2 b, I show from both a non-speeded and speeded forced-choice test that when response bias is minimized, participants show a discrimination advantage for CW pairs. In Experiments 3 a and 3 b, I show that item recognition is reduced for CW compared to NCW pairs, but when components of the CW and NCW pairs are emphasized at encoding, similar item recognition is shown for both pair types. Lastly, in Experiment 5, I show from receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves that there is a discrimination advantage for repeated NCW pairs compared to CW and NCW pairs. In Chapter 3, I present findings from Manuscript 2 consisting of three experiments in which I investigated the effects of <b>unitization</b> of CW pairs on associative recognition in older adults. In Experiment 1, older adults showed a discrimination advantage for CW pairs. Moreover, when presentation time was reduced young adults still did not show a discrimination advantage for CW pairs. Finally, in Experiment 3, I found both young and older adults showed a discrimination advantage for CW pairs in the forced-choice test. Thus, <b>unitization</b> of CW pairs benefited older adults because of ease of encoding and allowing increased use of familiarity during recognition. In addition, test format influences younger adults’ use of familiarity. Lastly, in Chapter 4, I present findings from Manuscript 3 consisting of three experiments examining whether processing fluency of unitized CW pairs was associated with the greater use of familiarity. In Experiment 1, minimizing perceptual fluency did not influence the CW effect. In Experiment 2 B, I found there was no difference in CW effect between the more conceptual fluent transparent CW than opaque CW pairs. In conclusion, I show there are many effects of <b>unitization</b> of preexperimental associations on associative recognition and there are a number of factors that can determine if there is a benefit of <b>unitization</b> to associative memory. The results provide a set of benchmarks that can be used in the evaluation of different procedures designed to unitize random word pairs...|$|E

We manipulated <b>unitization</b> during encoding and used ERPs to index familiarity and recollection at retrieval. The data revealed a selective reduction in the neural correlate of familiarity for individual words originally encoded in unitized compared with nonunitized word pairs.
