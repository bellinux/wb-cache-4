During their live shows of the 1990s, the Orb performed using digital audio tape machines optimised for live mixing and sampling before switching to laptops and digital media. Despite changes in performance method, the Orb maintained their colourful light shows and psychedelic imagery in concert. These visually intense performances prompted critics to compare the group to Pink Floyd.|$|E

In 1978 a St Albans linen merchant, Denis Pamphilon, was fined £100 daily for usurpation of the banner on decorative bedspreads until he desisted, and both Rangers F.C. and the Scottish National Party have been admonished by the Court of the Lord Lyon for their improper and non-authorised use of the banner.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will {{demonstrate}} how one can model and analyse Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) and their environment using the process algebra Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) [11, 21] and its model checker FDR [9]. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) {{is a system}} that detects abuses, misuses and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>uses</b> in a network. We show that this analysis can be used to discover two attack strategies {{that can be used to}} blind every Intrusion Detection System (IDS), even a hypothetical perfect one that knows all weaknesses of its protected host. We will give an exhaustive analysis of all such attack possibilities and will briefly discuss prevention techniques...|$|R

[...] Major League Baseball player David Wright, third baseman for the New York Mets, was tricked into doing a commercial for Lee's crusade; Wright agreed to appear on camera and offer an endorsement because {{he believed that the}} event had already been approved by the Mets, but in fact, the advertisement, which featured <b>unauthorised</b> <b>uses</b> of the Mets' logo, was being put together by a reporter who misused his press credentials to gain access to Wright and film him. After the misuse came to light, broadcasting of the advertisement ceased, and Wright publicly apologised.|$|R
5|$|The multi-coloured Personalised card is {{available}} on registration. The name and, if opted, {{a photo of the}} holder are imprinted on the cards. They can function automatically as a Child, Adult, or Elder card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for different concessionary fares. As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of Personalised Octopus cards. In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card {{can be used as a}} key card for access to residential and office buildings. If a Personalised card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent <b>unauthorised</b> <b>use</b> of the card. A refund would then be issued to the holder of the card for the deposit and the value that remained on the card three hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$30 card cost and a HK$20 handling fee.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} fight mass-scale {{copyright}} infringements on the Internet, numerous legislative initiatives {{have recently been}} proposed or adopted with the aim to improve the enforcement of copyright in the online world. This article evaluates the relevance of these enforcement strategies {{in the context of}} the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>uses</b> of copyrighted works by means of peer-to-peer file sharing or streaming. The dubious efficiency of some of the solutions adopted at national level, such as the implementation of graduate-response systems or the criminalisation of end users, is questioning the systematic increase of penalties as an appropriate reaction to address the problem of the general disrespect for copyright on the Internet. It rather calls for a new approach through the cautious legalisation of certain practices, in order to ensure that the copyright system continues to fulfil its basic function: the protection of creators and the encouragement of creativity...|$|R
40|$|The Paper, by {{consideration}} {{of the issue of}} authorisation, addresses a very practical development in commerce. Online copyright infringement is now not only about <b>unauthorised</b> <b>uses</b> of cinematograph films but has filtered down to become more prevalent amongst small to medium enterprises (SME), as some competitors embrace online trading by aggressively and often unlawfully, seeking market share. It is understandable that internet service providers (ISPs), as gatekeepers of internet traffic, may be considered as being more than a conduit of contravening conduct but not a joint tortfeasor involved in a common design. In between those extremes lies the concept of authorisation in copyright which has a long history in Australia since the Copyright Act 1905 (Cth). The text of s 101 (1 A) of the Copyright Act, in particular s 101 (1 A) (a) and (c), derived from statements of Gibbs J in Moorhouse...|$|R

25|$|In Scotland, Lord Lyon King of Arms is {{the judge}} of the Lyon Court, which has {{jurisdiction}} over all heraldic matters.

On 1 February 1999, Prime Minister Sharif made a breakthrough with India when he invited his counterpart to Pakistan. On 19 February, Indian premier Atal Bihari Vajpayee paid a historic state visit to Pakistan travelling on the inaugural bus service connecting the Indian capital of New Delhi with the major Pakistan's cultural city of Lahore, establishing a major transport link for the peoples of both nations. On 21 February, both Prime ministers signed the bilateral agreement with a memorandum of understanding to ensure the nuclear-free safety in South Asia. This bilateral agreement was widely popular in Pakistan and India onwards, the people of Pakistan supported the Prime minister's move and the Prime minister received wide appreciation from the opposition as well as the civil society. This agreement known as Lahore Declaration, it was widely assumed to development of nuclear weapons brought added responsibility to both nations towards avoiding conflict and promoted the importance of Confidence-building measures, especially to avoid accidental and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>use</b> of nuclear weapons.
