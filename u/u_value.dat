The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. The unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains {{in the winter and}} using sun shades in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (<b>U</b> <b>value,</b> the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (g value), and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.|$|E

We {{investigate}} the phase {{diagram of the}} square lattice bilayer Hubbard model at half filling with the variational Monte Carlo method for both the magnetic and the paramagnetic case {{as a function of}} the interlayer hopping t ⊥ and on-site Coulomb repulsion U.

These high δ^(234) <b>U</b> <b>values</b> are common to Pleistocene carbonates from many localities and indicate that the U-series has not followed closed-system behavior {{since the time of}} deposition. Pervasively dolomitized samples from the Golden Grove terrace have significantly lower δ^(234) U than the unreplaced aragonite, and (^(230) Th/^(238) U) _(ACT) (activity ratios) in excess of values for secular equilibrium. Groundwaters sampled from 125 – 460 ky old portions of the Pleistocene carbonate aquifer have δ^(234) <b>U</b> <b>values</b> close to secular equilibrium, and low (^(230) Th/^(238) U) _(ACT) of less than 4 × 10 ^(− 3). The pronounced differences in the U—Th isotope systematics between the aragonitic corals, dolomites and groundwaters reflect the enhanced mobility of U relative to Th during water-rock interaction. These results demonstrate that diagenesis can profoundly affect the U—Th isotopic composition of marine carbonates and therefore the accuracy of high-precision ^(230) Th ages determined on such samples. However, diagenesis involving fluids such as the present-day groundwaters on Barbados or those which formed the dolomites cannot account for the elevatedδ 234 <b>U</b> <b>values</b> of the corals. The mechanism by which apparently well-preserved corals become enriched in ^(234) U remains to be identified. Low δ^(234) U for the dolomites and the groundwaters records the transport of dissolved U from portions of the aquifer that are significantly older (e. g., > 10 ^ 6 yrs) than their present host carbonate rocks. The preservation of these distinct U-isotopic compositions during fluid migration through younger carbonates indicates that interaction between groundwaters and these carbonates, with accompanying ^(234) U enrichment in the waters from dissolution or alpha-recoil, has been extremely limited...|$|R
