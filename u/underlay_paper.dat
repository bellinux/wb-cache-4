50|$|The {{original}} US-released Spirograph {{consisted of}} two different-sized plastic rings, with gear teeth on both the {{inside and outside of}} their circumferences. They were pinned to a cardboard backing with pins, and any of several provided gearwheels, which had holes provided for a ballpoint pen to extend through them to an <b>underlying</b> <b>paper</b> writing surface. It could be spun around to make geometric shapes on the <b>underlying</b> <b>paper</b> medium. Later, the Super-Spirograph consisted of a set of plastic gears and other interlocking shape-segments such as rings, triangles, or straight bars. It has several sizes of gears and shapes, and all edges have teeth to engage any other piece. For instance, smaller gears fit inside the larger rings, but also can engage the outside of the rings in such a fashion that they rotate around the inside or along the outside edge of the rings. Kenner also introduced Spirotot, Magnetic Spirograph, Spiroman and various refill sets.|$|R

Furthermore, we present an efficient algorithm for implementing the Cumani operator. All operators have been applied to several synthetic and real images. The results are presented in this paper.

40|$|Although the {{paperless}} office (PLO) management {{system has been}} established {{with the goal of}} paper usage reduction, demand for paper has still showed an uptrend over the years. Given the substantial pressure on forest ecosystems due to a continued increase of paper consumption, understanding the behavioral aspects of paper consumption is, therefore, required. This present paper aims at exploring the factors <b>underlying</b> <b>paper</b> consumption behavior. Empirical data was acquired through a survey of 266 Indonesian students, involving both undergraduate and postgraduate students. A theoretical model, based on the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM), was tested against the empirical data. It was found that the model received reasonable support from the data. Results indicate that reducing paper consumption behavior is strongly influenced by habit and, marginally significant, by intention. Furthermore, habit formation is influenced by both normative processes and situational influences. The results, to some extent, explain the PLO paradox {{in a way that the}} PLO program should have focused on breaking the habit of paper usage instead of promoting the benefits of PLO.

40|$|Tough {{competition}} {{on the market}} of vacuum cleaner motors forces the manufacturers to purchase only top-notch quality and flawless products at the lowest prices. Therefore there is an increasing need for fast, reliable and objective quality assessment of every single unit {{at the end of}} the assembly cycle. In order to meet the requirements of quality assurance automatic and in-depth quality end-tests are applied in modern manufacturing [1 - 5]. In the <b>underlying</b> <b>paper</b> a structure of the diagnostic system for quality tests of vacuum cleaner motors is presented. The core of the system contains four modules for feature extraction that employ, respectively: analysis of commutation, vibration analysis, sound analysis and check of parity relations. The symptoms resulting therefrom are processed by an approximate reasoning module. Particular attention in this paper is devoted to vibration analysis. Vibration of vacuum cleaner motor, which directly or indirectly impacts motor's lifespan, is contributed by different sources. However, the most serious implications regard vibration of vacuum cleaner housing accompanied by unpleasant noise. The main contribution of the paper concerns a particular measurement procedure and analysis of the experimental data obtained on a series of motors with different conditions. Thi...|$|R

Therefore one objective {{is the development of}} a theoretical concept of DRC within the research fields of social system‐theory, relational and capability‐based view. Another goal is the evolvement of the four DRC concerning the interorganizational knowledge transfer between firms. The theoretical part is based on a literature analysis in strategic management research. The authors propose a theoretical framework – DRC – predicated on social system‐theory, relational and capability‐based view. The discussion concludes by providing management implications for implementation of DRC to practitioners in firms. The outcome of this paper contributes to the underlying conceptual work for strategic and knowledge management of firms. In detail a theoretical concept – DRC – for managing knowledge to generate innovativeness and competitiveness is developed. Furthermore, the paper provides some management implications on macro‐, meso‐, and micro‐level of firms to implement them. For practitioners the paper gives implications for implementing the theoretical considerations. The concept has proven to be useful in improving the interorganizational knowledge transfer and innovativeness and competitive advantage in firms...|$|R
