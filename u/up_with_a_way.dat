5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi trying to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was {{not in the business of}} making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

His suggestion was an attachment called the diagonal board that further improved the bombe's effectiveness.|$|E

25|$|Boron and Graphite rods {{came around}} in the 1960s and 1970s when the United States and United Kingdom {{invested}} considerable research into developing the new technologies. Hewitt and Howald {{were the first to}} come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to lay the fibers into the shape of a fishing rod by wrapping them around a piece of balsa wood. However, by 1977, boron fibre technology had been muscled out by the cheaper material graphite and was no longer competitive in the market.|$|E

500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, he thought of the idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, {{the first thing he did}} was to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E
500|$|Dr. Walter Bishop (John Noble) and FBI agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) {{discover}} that Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) {{has agreed to}} return with his real father, dubbed [...] "Walternate" [...] (Noble), to his own universe called the Other Side, which runs parallel to ours. One of the mysterious Observers (Michael Cerveris) leaves Olivia a note indicating that Peter is named in a prophecy as the one responsible {{for the end of}} the world. To warn Peter of his impending role, the Fringe Division work with biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to cross over. They form a plan that takes advantage of Olivia's universe-hopping ability, and recruit three other Cortexiphan test subjects who have unique abilities: Nick Lane (David Call), Sally Clark (Pascale Hutton), and James Heath (Omar Metwally), two of whom appeared in previous episodes. The team—composed of Walter, Olivia, Nick, Sally, and James—successfully arrives on the Other Side. James dies shortly after arrival, but the rest manage to escape the alternate reality's Fringe Division, who had used their special technology to detect their arrival. It is revealed that Walternate is the Secretary of Defense on the Other Side.|$|E
500|$|Alan Resnick (portrayed by himself), an {{emerging}} young tech expert and innovator, is {{introduced to the}} viewer. He tells the audience of his four-step program to create a digital avatar {{that acts as a}} backup of its host, granting [...] "the secret to eternal life". He tells the audience of his past: two years ago, Resnick was banished to his couch after getting into a lovers' spat with his wife, Janet. He dreamt of himself in a foggy meadow with an attractive, nude young woman (portrayed by [...] "MKNZ") who calls for him to engage in sex. He initially refuses, but then changes his mind, but before they are able to do so, he is shot with a gun by a nameless man (Ben O'Brien), which totally destroys his face. This gave him the idea to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to digitally back himself up. Two months pass, and he is able to create an [...] "exact digital copy" [...] of himself who calls himself [...] "Teddy" [...] (for unknown reasons). [...] "Teddy", a floating avatar head, acts as the co-host {{for the remainder of the}} program, often interrupting Resnick's speech to talk about his [...] "wife".|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking it now. And I can do it!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Critics gave mixed {{opinions}} to the team-up dynamic. Nich Maragos from 1UP.com celebrated that Sonic Team had [...] "finally [...] <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> {{of introducing}} teamwork and variance between characters that doesn't overwhelm Sonic's bread-and-butter gameplay." [...] Maragos singled this {{out as the}} main divider between Advance 3 and Sonic Heroes, a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it, unlike Advance 3, was in 3D. Maragos, GameSpot's Frank Provo, IGN's Craig Harris, and Game Informers Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic's friends brought. However, Mason, as well as reviewer Stardingo from GamePro, thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience. Darryl Vassar of GameSpy took {{a different point of}} criticism: he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities, but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao, whom he called [...] "pointless". Maragos noted that the [...] "mid-air trick" [...] system from Advance 2 was optional in Advance 3, but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating [...] "hidden areas". Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional [...] "cheapness" [...] in the level design, because [...] "most of the characters have absolutely no defense when hopping off items like springboards".|$|E
500|$|Because the dialogue-integrated {{tutorial}} in {{the first}} game had been well received, it was considered a major point for future games in the series. In the first game, Takumi had Phoenix being guided through his first trial by the judge and Mia, and for the second game, he had Phoenix suffer from amnesia; when writing the third game, Takumi {{did not know what to}} do, as it would not seem credible if Phoenix had amnesia a second time. Eventually he came up with the idea of using a flashback to a case where Mia had just become an attorney; he developed this idea further, and ended up using flashbacks as a major theme for the game's story. He decided that he wanted to include a case where Mia faces off against Edgeworth back when he was a rookie prosecutor, but encountered a problem: both characters had previously been established as never having lost a single case. Trying to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for a case in the past to work with neither of them winning or losing, he came up with the story for Terry Fawles, who dies during the trial. The game's main theme was [...] "not everything is always what it seems on the surface".|$|E

500|$|Pete Michels, {{director}} of the episode, had read {{a story in the}} newspaper about people with famous names. He came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> of how Homer's life could be affected if he saw someone on TV with his name. While creating the Homer Simpson television character, the production staff was deciding if the character should be [...] "cool" [...] throughout the episode, or if he should be an idiot from the beginning. The staff decided to use both methods and have him become an idiot after being seen as cool in the first episode of the new program. The hat Homer wears while walking through the mall is a parody of one owned by Woody Allen. [...] Ron Hauge, a The Simpsons show producer, suggested the name Max Power to a friend who wanted to change his name. His friend, however, did not take it. The episode would also inspire Tom Martin's cousin to name his son Max Power. One scene from the episode features Ned Flanders commenting that cartoons are easily able to change voice actors; to enhance the joke for his one line of dialogue, Flanders is voiced by recurring cast member Karl Wiedergott instead of his regular voice actor Harry Shearer.|$|E
500|$|Lonsdale's {{employer}} and landlord received {{phone calls from}} Scientology representatives who claimed {{that he was a}} religious bigot and dangerous. Lonsdale was subpoenaed by the Church of Scientology for a deposition in the fall of 2006, and the Church claimed that he belonged to an anti-Scientology group which had previously been barred from protesting in certain areas in downtown Clearwater, the Lisa McPherson Trust. Luke Lirot, the lawyer who defended Lonsdale in the matter, told the St. Petersburg Times: [...] "I found him to be quite affable and truly a very intelligent man ... I certainly hope that a very thorough investigation is conducted." [...] In his deposition, Lonsdale stated he was unemployed and began to educate himself about Scientology while working on a photography project on homeless people in Clearwater. After reading more about Scientology, he decided to shed light on the organization and irritate Scientologists. Of the claims Scientology made that Lonsdale was affiliated with the Lisa McPherson Trust, Lirot commented: [...] "It was obvious to everybody {{he had nothing to do}} with the trust, and the trust had been disbanded and dissolved many years prior ... They just wanted to try to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to preclude him from exercising his right to picket in downtown Clearwater, and they were unsuccessful in doing that." ...|$|E
500|$|Gard was keen to animate the {{character}} realistically, an aspect {{he felt the}} industry at the time had disregarded. He sacrificed quick animations in favour of more fluid movement, believing that players would empathise with {{the character}} more easily. Lara's dual-wielding of pistols {{was inspired by the}} film Hard Boiled and an Æon Flux short. In the first Tomb Raider, Croft's three-dimensional (3D) character model is made of around 230polygons. The character's braid was removed from the model, but added back for subsequent iterations. Gavin Rummery, programmer on the first two Tomb Raider games, explained, [...] "It had been dropped from the original because it just didn't work properly with all the acrobatic moves – it was more like she had an electric eel attached to her head that had a life of its own. But on TRII I came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to get it working and was really pleased how natural it looked." [...] There is a misconception that, while adjusting the character model, Gard accidentally increased the breasts' dimensions by 150 percent {{and the rest of the}} creative team argued to keep the change. Gard, however, has stated thasich notion [...] "came out of a silly remark made in an interview". Core Design hired Shelley Blond to voice Croft after the game entered the beta phase of development. Gard left Core Design after completing Tomb Raider, citing a lack of creative freedom and control over marketing decisions related to the ideas he developed (especially Lara Croft).|$|E

500|$|Another {{example of}} the {{inductive}} composition method {{was the creation of}} the game's title, which was only decided on after the story was completed. It was meant to reflect how the game's story connects the future and the past, with the word [...] "ever" [...] intended to be read with two meanings: [...] "once before" [...] and [...] "someday", but the number [...] "17" [...] was initially simply chosen as Uchikoshi liked the number due to being born on the 17th, and because he liked the transition to [...] "17" [...] from the [...] "7" [...] in Never 7; upon checking the calendar for year spans where dates and days of the week would line up, he found that one such occurrence was the seventeen years between 2017 and 2034; other spans included eleven years, which was too short, and twenty-eight, which was too long. When Uchikoshi considered how to bring characters over from 2017 to 2034, some worked out naturally: Tsugumi was immortal due to being infected with the Curé Virus, You had a clone in 2034, and Sora was an artificial intelligence. He could not come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to make Coco and Sara appear in both 2017 and 2034, but thought that the player probably would not figure it out just from this discrepancy. The one character left was Kaburaki, who would be a teenager in 2017 but in his 30s in 2034; Uchikoshi solved this by infecting him with the Curé Virus, which then led to him making the rest of the 2017 cast infected as well.|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} team {{intended to}} continue {{the story of the}} previous game in the series in every way with Dual Destinies. They focused on an overarching story and plot twists, and on characters' motives and how they get involved in the story, but not directly on the characters themselves. When deciding which characters to bring back from previous games, {{they did not want to}} bring back anyone only for the sake of bringing them back, instead intending for everyone to have important roles in the story. They considered some characters to [...] "come in sets", such as Apollo and Trucy, which affected which characters to bring back. Miles Edgeworth was brought back as the developers felt that Phoenix needed a character to play off of. Yamazaki said it was difficult to create the new rival character Simon Blackquill, as he had to be at least as unique and memorable as the ones in previous Ace Attorney titles. He came up with the idea that Blackquill would be a convict, thus being the [...] "most criminal prosecutor yet". Blackquill's intelligence and use of psychological manipulation turned out to make trials challenging to write, as Yamazaki kept writing himself into a corner, with it being difficult to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> for the protagonist to win. Yamazaki went through several ideas when brainstorming ways for Blackquill to be seen as a difficult opponent, such as making him immortal and two hundred years old, or [...] "super-rich" [...] and able to buy off any witness; these ideas were scrapped due to not fitting into the Ace Attorney series.|$|E
2500|$|A {{slot machine}} is a casino {{gambling}} machine. Due {{to the vast}} number of possible wins with the original poker card based game, it proved practically impossible to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> to make a machine capable of making an automatic pay-out for all possible winning combinations. The first [...] "one-armed bandit" [...] was invented in 1887 by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California who devised a simple automatic mechanism with three spinning reels containing {{a total of five}} symbols– horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the machine its name.|$|E
