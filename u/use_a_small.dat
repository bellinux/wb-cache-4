5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, and a set of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E
5|$|The common {{term for}} a place at which one may dive is a dive site. As a general rule, {{professional}} diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which {{are known for their}} convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.|$|E

25|$|Some demand valves <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> {{sensitive}} {{pilot valve}} {{to control the}} opening of the main valve. The Poseidon Jetstream and Xstream and Oceanic Omega second stages are examples of this technology. They can produce very high flow rates for a small pressure differential, and particularly for a relatively small cracking pressure. They are generally more complicated and expensive to service.|$|E
25|$|Fanny {{suggested}} that Mrs Troake <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> pastry boat filled with fruit sorbet {{and covered with}} spun sugar, decorated with an orange slice and a cherry through a cocktail stick to give the dish {{the look of a}} small boat, suitable, Fanny thought, for the naval guests. In the event, the dessert was a disaster and could not be served properly. Robert Morley had also been consulted on the menu and said he felt that Mrs Troake's original coffee pudding was perfect.|$|E

25|$|With the {{widespread}} introduction of superchargers to the aviation industry {{in order to}} improve altitude performance, Fedden felt it was reasonable to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> amount of boost at all times {{in order to improve}} performance of an otherwise smaller engine. Instead of designing an entirely new block, the existing Jupiter parts were re-used with the stroke reduced by one inch (25mm). The smaller capacity engine was then boosted back to Jupiter power levels, while running at higher rpm and thus requiring a reduction gear for the propeller. The same techniques were applied to the original Jupiter-sized engine to produce the Pegasus.|$|E

Some trains from Manchester Piccadilly to Bristol Temple Meads are extended to Paignton and Plymouth, and on summer weekends to Penzance and Newquay. CrossCountry services between Reading and Newcastle also <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> {{portion of the}} West Coast Main Line between Coventry and Birmingham New Street. Services towards Reading are often extended to Southampton Central (or occasionally Bournemouth) and 1 train per day towards Reading is extended to Guildford.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{imaging model}} of PDF was, like PostScript's, opaque: each object {{drawn on the}} page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.|$|E

25|$|The Baldwin Locomotive Works had {{a humble}} beginning. Matthias W. Baldwin, the founder, was a {{jeweller}} and whitesmith, who, in 1825, formed {{a partnership with}} a machinist, and engaged {{in the manufacture of}} bookbinders' tools and cylinders for calico printing. Baldwin then designed and constructed for his own <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> stationary engine, the workmanship of which was so excellent and its efficiency so great that he was solicited to build others like it for various parties, and thus led to turn his attention to steam engineering. The original engine was in use and powered many departments of the works for well over 60 years, and is currently on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC.|$|E
25|$|American {{designer}} MacDuffy {{constructed the}} first suit to use ball bearings to provide joint movement in 1914; it was tested in New York {{to a depth}} of , but was not very successful. A year later, Harry L. Bowdoin of Bayonne, New Jersey, made an improved ADS with oil-filled rotary joints. The joints <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> duct to the interior of the joint to allow equalization of pressure. The suit was designed to have four joints in each arm and leg, and one joint in each thumb, for a total of eighteen. Four viewing ports and a chest-mounted lamp were intended to assist underwater vision. Unfortunately {{there is no evidence that}} Bowdoin's suit was ever built, or that it would have worked if it had been.|$|E
25|$|Linguistic {{profiling}} occurs {{beyond the}} spheres {{of race and}} ethnicity in the identification of geographic origin. Indeed, evidence suggests that listeners may successfully categorize speakers based upon dialect. Clopper and Pisoni (2003) found that na√Øve (or inexperienced) listeners could successfully categorize speakers as hailing from New England, the South, or the West, but had greater difficulty discerning geographic origin when a larger number of dialects were provided: New England, North, North Midland, South Midland, South, West, New York City, or Army Brat. Listeners were only able to identify speakers correctly 30% of the time. They also found evidence suggesting that residential history of the listener affected speaker categorization, and that listeners tended to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> set of phonetic cues to make these distinctions.|$|E

25|$|Lugged steel {{construction}} uses standard cylindrical steel tubes which are connected with lugs, external fittings made {{of pieces of}} steel (sometimes stainless steel) which fit over {{the ends of the}} tubing. Before assembly, the builder cuts the tubes to the desired length and precisely mitres their ends, providing a tight fit. The end of the tubes are inserted into the lugs and subsequently brazed with a silver or brass filler metal. The lug greatly increases the strength of the joint by distributing the molten filler metal over a larger surface area via capillary action. When brazing a bicycle frame, builders may <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> positioning structure called a jig to hold the tubes in place and maintain their precise alignment and frame geometry.|$|E
25|$|Gohl {{would kill}} {{most of his}} victims in the union {{building}} by shooting them. Then after relieving them of their money and valuables, he would dispose {{of them in the}} Wishkah River, which ran behind the building and into Grays Harbor. According to some reports, there was a chute which descended from a trapdoor in the building directly into the river. Other reports state that Gohl would <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> launch to murder his victims and dump the bodies directly in the harbor. Though suspected of being responsible for the large numbers of sailors who would disembark in Aberdeen and disappear, nothing was done to stop him until an accomplice, John Klingenberg, was brought back to Aberdeen after trying to jump ship in Mexico to escape prosecution, or possibly to escape Gohl.|$|E
25|$|Hayes' {{solution}} to the problem was to <b>use</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> microcontroller to implement a system that examined the data flowing into the modem from the host computer, watching for certain command strings. This allowed commands to be sent to and from the modem using the same data pins as {{all the rest of the}} data, meaning it would work on any system that could support even the most basic modems. The Smartmodem could pick up the phone, dial numbers, and hang up again, all without any operator intervention. The Smartmodem was not necessary for BBS use but made overall operation dramatically simpler. It also improved usability for the caller, as most terminal software allowed different phone numbers to be stored and dialed on command, allowing the user to easily connect to a series of systems.|$|E
