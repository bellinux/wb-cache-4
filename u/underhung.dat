[Footnote 41: It is {{probable}} that this shortening has resulted not directly but indirectly, from the selection of individuals which were noted for tenacity of hold; for the bull-dog's peculiarity in this respect seems due to relative shortness of the upper jaw, giving the <b>underhung</b> structure which, involving retreat of the nostrils, enables the dog to continue breathing while holding.] ...|$|E
60|$|The candles lighted up Lord Steyne's shining bald head, {{which was}} fringed with red hair. He had thick bushy eyebrows, with little {{twinkling}} bloodshot eyes, {{surrounded by a}} thousand wrinkles. His jaw was <b>underhung,</b> and when he laughed, two white buck-teeth protruded themselves and glistened savagely {{in the midst of}} the grin. He had been dining with royal personages, and wore his garter and ribbon. A short man was his Lordship, broad-chested and bow-legged, but proud of the fineness of his foot and ankle, and always caressing his garter-knee.|$|E

60|$|It was at Fillmore that I saw a {{man that}} I was to see again. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man, well on in middle age, with all the {{evidence}} of good health and immense strength--strength not alone of body but of will. Unlike most men I was accustomed to about me, he was smooth-shaven. Several days' growth of beard showed that he was already well-grayed. His mouth was unusually wide, with thin lips tightly compressed {{as if he had}} lost many of his front teeth. His nose was large, square, and thick. So was his face square, wide between the cheekbones, <b>underhung</b> with massive jaws, and topped with a broad, intelligent forehead. And the eyes, rather small, a little more than the width of an eye apart, were the bluest blue I had ever seen.|$|E
60|$|I {{heard the}} paper's name with a queer little shock and {{surveyed}} the man with interest. No doubt {{he was only a}} successor of the purveyor of discords who darkened my boyhood. It was amazing to find an influence so terrible embodied in a creature so palpably petty. He was seated some way down a table at right angles to the one at which I sat, a man of mean appearance with a greyish complexion, thin, with a square nose, a heavy wiry moustache and a big Adam's apple sticking out between the wings of his collar. He ate with considerable appetite and unconcealed relish, and as his jaw was <b>underhung,</b> he chummed and made the moustache wave like reeds in the swell of a steamer. It gave him a conscientious look. After dinner he a little forced himself upon me. At that time, though the shadow of my scandal was already upon me, I still seemed to be shaping for great successes, and he was glad to be in conversation with me and anxious to intimate political sympathy and support. I tried to make him talk of the HOME CHURCHMAN and the kindred publications he ran, but he was manifestly ashamed of his job so far as I was concerned.|$|E
6000|$|Close at {{his heels}} walked his hired attendant, whom, out of insolent caprice and {{with a desire to}} show his {{contempt}} for the prejudices of others, he had dressed as a rough country clergyman. This fellow slouched along with frowning brows and surly, challenging eyes, like some faithful, hideous human bulldog, his knotted hands protruding from his rusty cassock, his great <b>underhung</b> jaw turning slowly from right to left as he menaced the crowd with his sinister gaze. Already a close observer might have marked upon his face a heaviness and looseness of feature, the first signs of that physical decay which in a very few years was to stretch him, a helpless wreck, too weak to utter his own name, upon the causeway of the London streets. At present, however, he was still an unbeaten man, the terror of the Ring, and as his ill-omened face was seen behind his infamous master many a half-raised cane was lowered and many a hot word was checked, while the whisper of [...] "Hooper! 'Ware Bully Hooper!" [...] warned all who were aggrieved that it might be best to pocket their injuries lest some even worse thing should befall them. Many a maimed and disfigured man had carried away from Vauxhall the handiwork of the Tinman and his patron.|$|E
6000|$|In one of {{the tombs}} {{there is a little}} chamber whose ceiling, {{probably}} because of a fault in the rock, could not be smoothed off like the others. So the decorator, very cunningly, covered it with a closely designed cloth-pattern--just such a chintz-like piece of stuff as, in real life, one would use to underhang a rough roof with. He did it perfectly, down there in the dark, and went his way. Thousands of years later, there was born a man of my acquaintance who, for good and sufficient reason, had an almost insane horror of anything in the nature of a ceiling-cloth. He used to make excuses for not going into the dry goods shops at Christmas, when hastily enlarged annexes are hidden, roof and sides, with embroideries. Perhaps a snake or a lizard had dropped on his mother from the roof before he was born; perhaps it was the memory of some hideous fever-bout in a tent. At any rate, that man's idea of The Torment was a hot, crowded underground room, <b>underhung</b> with patterned cloths. Once in his life at a city in the far north, where he had to make a speech, he met that perfect combination. They led him up and down narrow, crowded, steam-heated passages, till they planted him at last in a room without visible windows (by which he knew he was, underground), and directly beneath a warm-patterned ceiling-cloth--rather like a tent-lining. And there he had to say his say, while panic terror sat in his throat. The second time was in the Valley of the Kings, where very similar passages, crowded with people, led him into a room cut of rock, fathoms underground, with what looked like a sagging chintz cloth not three feet above his head. The man I'd like to catch,' he said when he came outside again, 'is that decorator-man. D'you suppose he meant to produce that effect?' ...|$|E
6000|$|The centre-piece {{of all is}} {{the high}} chief himself, Malietoa-Tuiatua-Tuiaana Mataafa, king--or not king--or king-claimant--of Samoa. All goes to him, all comes from him. Native deputations bring him gifts and are feasted in return. White travellers, to their indescribable irritation, are (on his approach) waved from his path by his armed guards. He summons his dancers by the note of a bugle. He sits nightly at home before a {{semicircle}} of talking-men from many quarters of the islands, delivering and hearing those ornate and elegant orations in which the Samoan heart delights. About himself and all his surroundings there breathes a striking sense of order, tranquillity, and native plenty. He is of a tall and powerful person, sixty years of age, white-haired and with a white moustache; his eyes bright and quiet; his jaw perceptibly <b>underhung,</b> which gives him something of the expression of a benevolent mastiff; his manners dignified and a thought insinuating, with an air of a Catholic prelate. He was never married, and a natural daughter attends upon his guests. Long since he made a vow of chastity,--"to live as our Lord lived on this earth" [...] and Polynesians report with bated breath that he has kept it. On all such points, true to his Catholic training, he is inclined to be even rigid. Lauati, the pivot of Savaii, has recently repudiated his wife and taken a fairer; and when I was last in Malie, Mataafa (with a strange superiority to his own interests) had but just despatched a reprimand. In his immediate circle, in spite of the smoothness of his ways, he is said to be more respected than beloved; and his influence is the child rather of authority than popularity. No Samoan grandee now living need have attempted that which he has accomplished during the last twelve months with unimpaired prestige, not only to withhold his followers from war, but to send them to be judged in the camp of their enemies on Mulinuu. And {{it is a matter of}} debate whether such a triumph of authority were ever possible before. Speaking for myself, I have visited and dwelt in almost every seat of the Polynesian race, and have met but one man who gave me a stronger impression of character and parts.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was clearly}} for him, on this bright answer, {{as if her}} white hand were holding out the perfect flower of felicity. [...] "You came in from your revels on purpose--with the same charity you showed me from that first moment?" [...] They stood smiling {{at each other as}} in an {{exchange}} of sympathy already confessed--and even as if finding that their relation had grown during the lapse of contact; she recognising the effect of what they had originally felt as bravely as he might name it. What the fine, slightly long oval of her essentially quiet face--quiet in spite of certain vague depths of reference to forces of the strong high order, forces involved and implanted, yet also rather spent in the process--kept in range from under her redundant black hat was the strength of expression, the directness of communication, that her guest appeared to borrow from the unframed and unattached nippers unceasingly perched, by their mere ground-glass rims, as she remembered, on the bony bridge of his indescribably authoritative (since it was at the same time decidedly inquisitive) young nose. She must, however, also have embraced in this contemplation, she must more or less again have interpreted, his main physiognomic mark, the degree to which his clean jaw was <b>underhung</b> and his lower lip protruded; a lapse of regularity made evident by a suppression of beard and moustache as complete as that practised by Mr. Bender--though without the appearance consequent in the latter's case, that of the flagrantly vain appeal in the countenance for some other exhibition of a history, of a process of production, than this so superficial one. With the interested and interesting girl sufficiently under our attention while we thus try to evoke her, we may even make out some wonder in her as to why the so perceptibly protrusive lower lip of this acquaintance of an hour or two should positively have contributed to his being handsome instead of much more logically interfering with it. We might in fact in such a case even have followed her into another and no less refined a speculation--the question of whether the surest seat of his good looks mightn't after all be his high, fair, if somewhat narrow, forehead, crowned with short crisp brown hair and which, after a fashion of its own, predominated without overhanging. He spoke after they had stood just face to face almost long enough for awkwardness. [...] "I haven't forgotten one item of your kindness to me on that rather bleak occasion." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{hoisting}} {{rail system}} has been designed for lifting loads from the north sidewalk of the D 0 collision hall into the collision hall pit. This engineering note documents the design. The hoisting system was conceived primarily to aid in getting heavy loads into the pit during short (less than a few days) accesses. The typical use for the hoist will be to lift a BLS power supply (120 lbs) and carrier (16 lbs) from a roll around cart {{on the sidewalk and}} onto a similar cart in the collision hall pit. The hoist system will alleviate the need for two persons to carry this heavy load up and down a narrow (24 -inch) staircase. The hoisting system has a designed lift rating of 150 lbs. All members and components are well within a conservative safety factor when subjected to this loading at it's worst possible configuration, that is with it's boom cantilevered out 8 feet from the base rail. See the hoisting rail assembly sketch (in the hand calculations section) and the picture inserted below to get an orientation of the device. The hoisting system is designed using BLine 'unistrut' system components. The hoist consists of a 'base' rail that is fastened to either the northeast or northwest air handler platforms. This fixed base rail has (2) two sided trolley assemblies inserted into it's lower unistrut member. One assembly is locked in place on the base rail. Another is locked in place on the lower 'boom' rail. The trolley assemblies are free wheeling which allows boom movement in the north-south direction about 7 1 / 2 feet within the fixed base rail. An electric hoist hangs from the 'boom' rail on a single trolley. The hoisting system meets Fermilab Environment and Safety Manual chapter 5021 entitled 'Overhead cranes hoists and rigging'. Inclusive in that requirement is that it meets the applicable Fermilab 'work smart standards' of ANSI B 30. 11 - 1998 'Monorails and <b>underhung</b> cranes', and ANSI B 30. 16 - 1998 'Overhead hoists (<b>underhung)</b> '. The design criteria for the structural members per these standards is that static stresses shall not exceed 0. 2 times the average ultimate material strength. The unistrut members are fabricated from hot rolled carbon steel. The B-Line catalog states that the minimum yield strength of the virgin material is 33, 000 psi and the cold worked average yield stress is 42, 000 psi. The ultimate strength of the material is not given in the catalog, but based on the description of the material and values listed in the Ryerson steel catalog, I will use a value 58, 000 psi for the ultimate strength. A minimum safety factor of 5 must be achieved based on ultimate strength...|$|E
