25|$|Birds {{are capable}} of seeing colors in the <b>{{ultraviolet}}</b> <b>range,</b> and some species {{are known to have}} ultraviolet peaks of reflectance (indicating the presence of ultraviolet color) on their beaks. The presence and intensity of these peaks may indicate a bird's fitness, sexual maturity or pair bond status. King and emperor penguins, for example, show spots of ultraviolet reflectance only as adults. These spots are brighter on paired birds than on courting birds. The position of such spots on the beak may be important in allowing birds to identify conspecifics. For instance, the very similarly-plumaged king and emperor penguins have UV-reflective spots in different positions on their beaks.|$|E
25|$|Xeroderma pigmentosum mostly {{affects the}} eye and skin. Individuals with XP have extreme {{sensitivity}} to light in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>range</b> starting from {{one to two years}} of age, and causes sunburn, freckling of skin, dry skin and pigmentation after exposure. When the eye is exposed to sunlight, it becomes irritated and bloodshot, and the cornea becomes cloudy. Around 30% of affected individuals also develop neurological abnormalities, including deafness, poor coordination, decreased intellectual abilities, difficulty swallowing and talking, and seizures; these effects tend to become progressively worse over time. All affected individuals have a 1000-fold higher risk of developing skin cancer: half of the affected population develop skin cancer by age 10, usually at areas most exposed to sunlight (e.g. face, head, or neck). The risk for other cancers such as brain tumors, lung cancer and eye cancers also increase.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} median eyes (AME) {{have very}} good vision. This pair of eyes is built like a telescopic tube with a corneal lens {{in the front and}} a second lens in the back that focus images onto a four-layered retina, a narrow boomerang-shaped strip oriented vertically. Physiological experiments have shown they may have up to four different kinds of receptor cells, with different absorption spectra, giving them the possibility of up to tetrachromatic color vision, with sensitivity extending into the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>range.</b> As the eyes are too close together to allow depth perception, and the animals do not make use of motion parallax, they have evolved a method called image defocus instead. Of the four photoreceptor layers in the retina, the first two closest to the surface contain ultraviolet-sensitive pigments while the two deepest contain green-sensitive pigments. The incoming green light is only focused on the deepest layer, while the other one receives defocused or fuzzy images. By measuring the amount of defocus from the fuzzy layer, it is possible to calculate the distance to the objects in front of them. In addition to receptor cells, also red filters have been detected, located in front of the cells that normally register green light. It seems that all salticids, regardless of whether they have two, three, or four kinds of color receptors, are highly sensitive to UV light. Some species (for example, Cosmophasis umbratica) are highly dimorphic in the UV spectrum, suggesting a role in sexual signaling (Lim & Li, 2005). Color discrimination has been demonstrated in behavioral experiments.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the ultraviolet A-induced effects on melanin pigmentation both in an in vitro model system and in vivo. Ultraviolet-Vis absorbance spectra of L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine-melanin solutions at different concentrations were measured before and after ultraviolet A exposure (10 – 120 J per cm 2). The difference spectra reveal that following ultraviolet A exposure the absorbance increases exponentially from 800 nm to 450 nm accompanied by a prominent decrease of absorbance in the <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>range.</b> This change of spectral features depends on both ultraviolet A doses and melanin concentrations. The photo-bleaching effect observed in the <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>range</b> also depends on oxygen. Human subjects were irradiated with ultraviolet A (40 – 80 J per cm 2) on their back and diffuse reflectance spectra were collected at both irradiated and untreated sites. The absorption spectra of ultraviolet A-induced pigment were calculated as the difference of the two. The ultraviolet A-induced pigment in vivo has similar spectral characteristics and dose dependency as the in vitro system. Photo-oxidation of pheomelanin solutions presents distinctively different spectral and dose–response characteristics from eumelanin. After ultraviolet A irradiation pheomelanin absorbance decreases both in the visible and the <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>range.</b> We conclude that irradiation with ultraviolet A induces significant photochemical alterations in the skin witnessed by increased photoprotection in the visible spectral range and reduced protection in the <b>ultraviolet</b> A <b>range.</b> We suggest that soluble melanin plays an important part in ultraviolet A-induced pigment in skin and two distinct absorption mechanisms of melanin may be involved in ultraviolet A photo-oxidation. We also propose that eumelanin and pheomelanin could be differentiated according to their spectral responses to ultraviolet A irradiation...|$|R

500|$|Unlike {{most other}} semiaquatic animals, the {{hippopotamus}} {{has very little}} hair. The skin is [...] thick, providing it great protection against conspecifics and predators. By contrast, its subcutaneous fat layer is thin. The animals' upper parts are purplish-gray to blue-black, while the under parts and areas around the eyes and ears can be brownish-pink. Their skin secretes a natural sunscreen substance which is red-coloured. The secretion is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "blood sweat", but is neither blood nor sweat. This secretion is initially colourless and turns red-orange within minutes, eventually becoming brown. Two distinct pigments have been identified in the secretions, one red (hipposudoric acid) and one orange (norhipposudoric acid). The two pigments are highly acidic compounds. They inhibit the growth of disease-causing bacteria, and their light absorption peaks in the <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>range,</b> creating a sunscreen effect. All hippos, even those with different diets, secrete the pigments, so it does not appear that food {{is the source of the}} pigments.
