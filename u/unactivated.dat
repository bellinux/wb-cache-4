5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate {{specification of}} adult neural precursors through release of Noggin. Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears {{to set up}} concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, {{such as in the}} RMS. Microglia also actively regulate adult neurogenesis. Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by <b>unactivated</b> microglia in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult neurogenesis, depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action. In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ neurogenesis, suggesting a possible role in the RMS.|$|E

500|$|In May 2026, {{the prime}} {{universe}} {{is suffering from}} the same singularities that have already destroyed the parallel universe, {{as a result of}} the two universes being inextricably linked together. Though the Fringe Division that developed in this universe has been able to use amber to contain these vortices, a group called the [...] "End of Dayers", led by a man named Moreau (Brad Dourif), attempts to breach the fabric of reality at soft spots and create more vortices. After one such incident at a theater, Peter and Olivia (Anna Torv), now married, along with Astrid (Jasika Nicole) and Ella (Emily Meade), Olivia's niece and now a rookie Fringe agent, find an <b>unactivated</b> container that they believe the End of Dayers used to trigger the breach. Fringe is unable to determine how the container works, and Peter convinces Broyles (Lance Reddick), now a senator, to allow him to release his father Walter (Noble), currently in maximum security prison as punishment for activating the doomsday device, to help identify its workings.|$|E
2500|$|Amines, benzylic ethers, and alkenes are {{oxidized}} {{more rapidly}} than <b>unactivated</b> alcohols; thus, selective stoichiometric oxidation of <b>unactivated</b> alcohols {{in the presence of}} these functional groups is not possible. Alcohols with β-nitrogen or β-oxygen substituents react sluggishly under acidic conditions. Allylic and benzylic alcohols can be selectively oxidized under these conditions ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{configuration}} of the double bond is conserved in the reaction. The corresponding acetylenic alcohols are also suitable substrates, although the resulting propargylic aldehydes can be quite reactive. Benzylic and even <b>unactivated</b> alcohols are also good substrates. 1,2-Diols are cleaved by [...] to dialdehydes or diketones. Otherwise, the applications of [...] are numerous, being applicable to many kinds of reactions including amine oxidation, aromatization, oxidative coupling, and thiol oxidation.|$|E
2500|$|Platelets, {{also called}} thrombocytes ( [...] + , [...] "blood clot cell"), are a {{component}} of blood whose function (along with the coagulation factors) is to stop bleeding by clumping and clotting blood vessel injuries. Platelets have no cell nucleus: they are fragments of cytoplasm that are derived from the megakaryocytes of the bone marrow, and then enter the circulation. These <b>unactivated</b> platelets are biconvex discoid (lens-shaped) structures, [...] 2–3µm in greatest diameter. Platelets are found only in mammals, whereas in other animals (e.g. birds, amphibians) thrombocytes circulate as intact mononuclear cells.|$|E
2500|$|Mitochondria hyperpolarization is a {{key event}} in {{initiating}} changes in morphology. Intraplatelet calcium concentration increases, stimulating the interplay between microtubule/actin filament complex. The continuous changes in shape from the <b>unactivated</b> to the fully activated platelet is best seen on scanning electron microscopy. Three steps along this path are named early dendritic, early spread and spread. The surface of the <b>unactivated</b> platelet looks {{very similar to the}} surface of the brain, with a wrinkled appearance from numerous shallow folds to increase the surface area; early dendritic, an octopus with multiple arms and legs; early spread, an uncooked frying egg in a pan, the [...] "yolk" [...] being the central body; and the spread, a cooked fried egg with a denser central body. These changes are all brought about by the interaction of the microtubule/actin complex with the platelet cell membrane and open canalicular system (OCS), which is an extension and invagination of that membrane. This complex runs just beneath these membranes, and is the chemical motor which literally pulls the invaginated OCS out of the interior of the platelet like turning pants pockets inside out, creating the dendrites. and then spreads each dendrite until the entire OCS becomes indistinguishable from the initial platelet membrane as it forms the [...] "fried egg". This dramatic increase in surface area comes about with neither stretching nor adding phospholipids to the platelet membrane.|$|E
2500|$|A {{reserve battery}} {{can be stored}} unassembled (<b>unactivated</b> and {{supplying}} no power) {{for a long period}} (perhaps years). [...] When the battery is needed, then it is assembled (e.g., by adding electrolyte); once assembled, the battery is charged and ready to work. [...] For example, a battery for an electronic artillery fuze might be activated by the impact of firing a gun. The acceleration breaks a capsule of electrolyte that activates the battery and powers the fuze's circuits. Reserve batteries are usually designed for a short service life (seconds or minutes) after long storage (years). A water-activated battery for oceanographic instruments or military applications becomes activated on immersion in water.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{example of}} a {{catalytic}} C–H borylation of an <b>unactivated</b> hydrocarbon (benzene) was reported by Smith and Iverson using Ir(Cp*)(H)(Bpin) as the catalyst. [...] The efficiency of this system, however, was low, providing only 3 turnovers after 120 h at 150°C. [...] Numerous subsequent developments by Hartwig and coworkers led to efficient, practical conditions for arene borylation. [...] Aromatic C–H borylation was developed by Hartwig and Ishiyama using the diboron reagent Bis(pinacolato)diboron catalyzed by 4,4’-di-tert-butylbipyridine (dtbpy) and 2. With this catalyst system the borylation of aromatic C–H bonds occurs with regioselectivity that is controlled by steric effects of the starting arene. The selectivity for functionalization of aromatic C–H bonds is governed by the general rule that the reaction does not occur ortho to a substituent when a C–H bond lacking an ortho substituent is available. When only one functional group is present borylation occurs in the meta and para position in statistical ratios of 2:1 (meta:para). The ortho isomer is not detected due to the steric effects of the substituent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{activated}} NO2 luminesces broadband {{visible to}} infrared light as it reverts {{to a lower}} energy state. A photomultiplier and associated electronics counts the photons that are proportional {{to the amount of}} NO present. To determine the amount of nitrogen dioxide, NO2, in a sample (containing no NO) it must first be converted to nitric oxide, NO, by passing the sample through a converter before the above ozone activation reaction is applied. The ozone reaction produces a photon count proportional to NO that is proportional to NO2 before it was converted to NO. In the case of a mixed sample that contains both NO and NO2, the above reaction yields the amount of NO and NO2 combined in the air sample, assuming that the sample is passed through the converter. If the mixed sample is not passed through the converter, the ozone reaction produces activated NO2 only in proportion to the NO in the sample. [...] The NO2 in the sample is not activated by the ozone reaction. Though <b>unactivated</b> NO2 is present with the activated NO2, photons are emitted only by the activated species that is proportional to original NO. Final step: Subtract NO from (NO + NO2) to yield NO2 ...|$|E
