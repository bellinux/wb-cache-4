40|$|Resilience and Survivability in {{networks}} is an {{area which}} is growing fast, mainly {{due to the fact}} that these vital desired properties for a network, protocol, application, or service behaviour, are now receiving a lot of attention from industry, research, academia, and standardization groups-thanks to the emergence of autonomic & cognitive management and control paradigms for the evolving networks in recent years. In characterizing the resilience properties of a system or individual functional entities of a system, the area of autonomics is extending the traditional scope and meaning of resilience in networks, by including self-diagnosing and self-repairing/self-healing behaviours, as well as proactive resilience to various types of challenges i. e. adverse conditions of operation and incidents (including fault-activations and security attacks and threats). This goes beyond the protection and restoration techniques for survivable networks found in protocols such as SDH, ATM, and IP-Fast-Re-route. What is becoming crucial for the global community is the establishment of standardized frameworks that can be applied for implementing interoperable systems that exhibit resilience properties in their own capacity and collaboratively as networked systems. This paper reports on a recently launched initiative in ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) that is aimed at standardizing resilience, survivability, autonomic fault-management and autonomic security management. We outline the types of concepts and architectural principles that are standardizable from resilience, survivability, and autonomic fault and security management point of view. We present and discuss a candidate evolvable architectural framework for standardization that <b>unifies</b> <b>resilience,</b> survivability and autonomic fault-management within a single holistic framework. It unifies the aspects by defining the responsible Functional Blocks (FBs) and their interworking in the realization of resi- ience, survivability, autonomic fault-management and autonomic security management in systems and networks. We show how research results in these areas can now be contributed to developing and relying on a commonly-shared (i. e. common baseline) unified standardized framework, by adopting, enhancing and evolving the framework presented in this paper as standardization activity (open to all technical experts/researchers to now join) ...|$|R
30|$|Khalili et al. (2015) {{provided}} a social resilience framework across these three phases of disaster; however, their study is limited {{because of its}} focus on qualitative interviews with subject matter experts. Hinds (1989) argued that applying both qualitative and quantitative methods to a research problem “increases the ability to rule out rival explanations of observed change and reduces skepticism of change-related findings”. Similarly, Hussein (2015) argued that quantitative research {{can be used to}} validate qualitative findings. Therefore, the quantitative approach applied within the present study to the qualitative findings from Khalili et al.’s (2015) study is essential {{for the development of a}} <b>unified</b> social <b>resilience</b> framework, which is required to improve current efforts to address social resilience. Thus, by conducting quantitative research using an online survey with New South Wales (NSW) State Emergency Services (SES) volunteers from locations throughout NSW who had experienced significant flooding events, the present study attempted to validate the resilience framework in the study by Khalili et al. (2015).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Using a {{developmental}} systems framework and grounded theory methods, {{the study reported}} here describes the psychosocial experiences of late adolescents coping with parental cancer. Results suggest three primary psychosocial developmental influences, including multilevel influences, coping strategies to maintain control, and responses to uncertainty and anticipatory grief. Identity and intimacy were the two most salient psychosocial tasks. The central <b>unifying</b> concept of <b>resilience</b> was the primary psychosocial developmental outcome that resulted from coping with parental cancer during late adolescence. This finding illuminates the need for Extension to expand its focus on positive outcomes that can result from coping with life crises during adolescence...|$|R
40|$|Resilience {{has been}} {{discussed}} in ecology for over forty years. While some aspects of resilience have received attention in transport planning, there is no <b>unified</b> definition of <b>resilience</b> in transportation. To define resilience in transportation, I trace back to the origin of resilience in ecology {{with a view of}} revealing the essence of resilience thinking and its relevance to transport planning. Based on the fundamental concepts of engineering resilience and ecological resilience, I define "comprehensive resilience in transportation" as the quality that leads to recovery, reliability and sustainability. Observing that previous work in resilience analysis in transportation has focussed on addressing engineering resilience rather than ecological resilience, I conclude that transformability has been generally overlooked and needs to be incorporated in the analysis framework for comprehensive resilience in transportation...|$|R
30|$|Disaster {{impact is}} a factor of both {{the scale of the}} {{disaster}} and the ability of the community to withstand the shock of the disaster. Thus, social resilience reflects the preparedness and response of the community and is dependent on social situations in the communities during both the pre- and post-disaster contexts (Boyce, 2000). Disaster response, therefore, both affects and influences social resilience (Tobin and Whiteford, 2002). To capture this cyclical relationship, it is necessary to consider all three disaster phases and the associated social indicators of resilience to best develop a <b>unified</b> social <b>resilience</b> framework. Such indicators—defined herein as parameters for assessing the social resilience of a community—include community demographics, participation, learning processes related to disaster, and leadership (Miller et al., 2010). These indicators represent variable aspects of communities, i.e., they vary the phases of a single disaster, but also over time across different disasters. By advancing the understanding of the indicators associated with social resilience, the present study provides implications for increasing those capacities identified as positive factors of social resilience or decreasing those identified as negative factors of social resilience. This begins with recognition of these indicators and their impact in disaster social resilience. The {{purpose of the present study}} is thus to improve the ability of a community to withstand the shock of disasters by improving social resilience.|$|R
40|$|Although {{scholars}} of social-ecological resilience propose unity {{between humans and}} the natural world, much of this work remains based on Cartesian division of mind and body that denies it. We present {{an example of a}} <b>unified</b> system of <b>resilience</b> thinking shared with us by Anishinaabe (Ojibway) elders of Pikangikum First Nation, northwestern Ontario. The elders' views of boreal forest disturbance and renewal are distinct from western scientific approaches in their recognition of agency, the ability to individually express free will in nonhuman beings including animals, plants, rocks, and forest fire within their landscape. Pikangikum elders perceive that, if relationships based on respect, reciprocity, and noninterference are maintained with other agents, renewal will continue. The proposition of living landscapes composed of diverse nonhuman agents poses challenges to collaboration with western worldviews, which view nature largely as mechanistic and without moral standing. We suggest that a greater attention to nonwestern ontologies can contribute to productive cross-cultural partnerships directed toward fostering resilience...|$|R
40|$|As an {{indication}} of development ecological, economic and social frame conditions change due to global adjustments. More competition, open markets, changes in political frameworks, structural changes etc. form the challenges for economies as a whole, organisations and employees. On the whole, however, the discussion about challenges often forgets the consequences for ‘organisational’ resilience, i. e. an organisation’s capacity to anticipate disturbance, adapt to events, and create lasting value and thrive in a changing world. The notion of a resilient organisation is an emerging concept to clarify and cope with the modern day pace of change. By linking resilience theory with the sustainable transition process of organisations, this contribution has attempted to explore opportunities for and barriers to the diffusion, institutionalisation and implementation of resilience concepts from an integrative perspective. Furthermore, this contribution works toward a <b>unified</b> theory of <b>resilience</b> to help embrace and manage organisational change effectively when considering {{the concept of a}} sustainable future. Recommendations are provided for continued research to achieve progress in the modelling of organisational resilience...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{adopts a}} {{strategic}} view on organizational survival {{and argues that}} preparedness, responsiveness, adaptability and learning abilities constitute organizational drivers of resilience and a new direction on crisis management. As a conceptual and literature exploration, the methodological focus is to combine various concepts within a <b>unified</b> model for <b>resilience.</b> The proposed conceptual model highlights the need for strategic reconfigurations toward {{the construction of a}} resilience culture {{and the development of a}} supporting social capital in organizations. It also portrays organizational survival and sustainability as dependent on strategic characteristics rather than the managerial ability to handle situations and manage crisis. Implications, methodological concerns in the study of resilience and further research directions are also presented. The paper approaches a new way of thinking about crises and provides a set of cultural and organisational characteristics that would increase resilience and crisis management abilities. While organisations are nowadays more than even affected by disruptions and crises, their inherent ability and strategies to protect their sustainability have been under theorized. This paper aims at contributing to a growing and fruitful discussion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{construct}} of resilience {{has captured the}} imagination of researchers across various disciplines over the last five decades (Ungar, 2008 a). Despite {{a growing body of research}} in the area of resilience, there is little consensus among researchers about the definition and meaning of this concept. Resilience has been used to describe eight kinds of phenomena across different disciplines. These eight phenomena can be divided into two clusters based on the disciplinary origin. The first cluster mainly involves definitions of resilience derived from the discipline of psychology and covers six themes including (i) personality traits, (ii) positive outcomes/forms of adaptation despite high-risk, (iii) factors associated with positive adaptation, (iv) processes, (v) sustained competent functioning/stress resistance, and (vi) recovery from trauma or adversity. The second cluster of definitions is rooted in the discipline of sociology and encompasses two themes including (i) human agency and resistance, and (ii) survival. This paper discusses the inconsistencies in the varied definitions used within the published literature and describes the differing conceptualizations of resilience as well as their limitations. The paper concludes by offering a <b>unifying</b> conceptualization of <b>resilience</b> and by discussing implications for future research on resilience...|$|R
40|$|Resilience has, in {{the past}} four decades, been a term {{increasingly}} employed throughout a number of sciences: psychology and ecology, most prominently. Increasingly one finds it in political science, business administration, sociology, history, disaster planning, urban planning, and international development. The shared use of the term does not, however, imply <b>unified</b> concepts of <b>resilience</b> nor the theories in which it is embedded. Different uses generate different methods, sometimes different methodologies. Evidential or other empirical support can differ between domains of application, even when concepts are broadly shared. The review centres on three resilience frameworks, of increasing complexity: Engineering Resilience (or ‘Common Sense’ resilience); Systems Resilience, called Robustness in economics; and Resilience in Complex Adaptive Systems. Although each framework has historical roots in particular disciplines, the frameworks themselves can be applied to any domain: Engineering Resilience is utilised in some child development studies; Systems Resilience is often used in governance and management; and the Complex Adaptive Systems approach has been applied to economics, innovation in technology, history, and urban planning. Thus different frameworks along the spectrum offer a choice of perspective; the acceptability of trade-offs between them, and not subject matter, will ultimately determine which perspective is chosen.
