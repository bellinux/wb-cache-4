40|$|We {{introduce}} the free quantum noncommutative fields {{as described by}} braided tensor products. The multiplication of such fields is decomposed into three operations, describing the multiplication in the algebra M of functions on noncommutative space-time, the product in the algebra H of deformed field oscillators, and the braiding by factor Psi_{M,H} between algebras M and H. For noncommutativity generated by the twist factor we shall employ the star-product realizations of the algebra M in terms of functions on standard Minkowski space. The covariance of single noncommutative quantum fields <b>under</b> <b>deformed</b> Poincare symmetries is described by the algebraic covariance conditions which are equivalent to the deformation of generalized Heisenberg equations on Poincare group manifold. We shall calculate the covariant braided field commutator, which for free quantum noncommutative fields provides the field quantization condition and is given by standard Pauli-Jordan function.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{consequences}} of time-space noncommutativity in the quantum mechanics of atoms and molecules, focusing on the Moyal plane with just time-space noncommutativity ([ˆxµ, ˆxν] = iθµν, θ 0 i ≡ / 0, θij = 0). Space rotations and parity are not automorphisms of this algebra and are not symmetries of quantum physics. Still, the spectral degeneracies of a time-independent Hamiltonian due to symmetries do not depend at all on θ 0 i. They give no clue about rotation and parity violation when θ 0 i ≡ / 0. The persistence of degeneracies for θ 0 i ≡ / 0 can {{be understood in terms}} of invariance <b>under</b> <b>deformed</b> noncommutative “rotations” and “parity”. They are not spatial rotations and reflection. We explain such deformed symmetries. We emphasize the significance of time-dependent perturbations (for example, due to time-dependent electromagnetic fields) to observe noncommutativity. As an illustration, we calculate the rate for the process 2 s → 1 s + γ in hydrogen as a function of θ 0 i. (It is zero for θ 0 i = 0 by parity conservation). The importance of the deformed rotational symmetry is commented upon further using the decay Z 0 → 2 γ as an example...|$|E

50|$|Shape {{change of}} {{erythrocytes}} under applied forces (i.e., shear forces in blood flow) is reversible and the biconcave-discoid shape, which is normal for most mammals, is maintained after {{the removal of}} the deforming forces. In other words, erythrocytes behave like elastic bodies, while they also resist to shape change <b>under</b> <b>deforming</b> forces. This viscoelastic behavior of erythrocytes is determined by the following three properties: 1) Geometry of erythrocytes; the biconcave-discoid shape provides an extra surface area for the cell, enabling shape change without increasing surface area. This type of shape change requires significantly smaller forces than those required for shape change with surface area expansion. 2) Cytoplasmic viscosity; reflecting the cytoplasmic hemoglobin concentration of erythrocytes. 3) Visco-elastic properties of erythrocyte membrane, mainly determined by the special membrane skeletal network of erythrocytes.|$|R

40|$|In tissue {{engineering}} and wound healing, porous scaffolds can stimulate the wound healing process by regenerating the damaged or diseased tissue. But when applied in wound area various forces like bandage, contraction and self weight act upon these visco-elastic scaffold/membrane and cause deformation. As a result, the geometry and the designed porosity change which eventually alters the desired choreographed functionality such as material concentration, design parameters, cytokines distribution over the wound device geometry. In this work, a novel scaffold modelling {{approach has been}} proposed that will minimize the change in effective porosity with the designed porosity due to its deformation. First the targeted wound surface model has been extracted and sliced along its depth. Then the height based contours are projected and descritized into functional regions Surface profile for each region have been extracted with contour area weight based slope method. Finally, the filament deposition locations have been generated considering the region profile. Thus the proposed method will give a better functionality of tissue membrane providing predictable material concentration along the wound surface and optimum environment <b>under</b> <b>deformed</b> conditions. The methodology has been implemented using a bi-layer porous membrane via computer simulation. A comparison {{of the results of}} effective porosity between the proposed design and conventional design has also been provided.

40|$|Reconstructing or {{repairing}} {{a damaged}} tissue with porous scaffolds {{to restore the}} mechanical, biological, and chemical functions {{is one of the}} major tissue engineering and wound healing strategies. Recent developments in three-dimensional bioprinting techniques and improvements in the biomaterial properties have made fabrication of controlled and interconnected porous scaffold structures possible. Especially, for wound healing or soft tissue engineering, membranes/scaffolds made out of visco-elastic hydrogels, or other soft biomaterials with regular porous structures are commonly used. When the visco-elastic structures are applied onto a wound or damaged area, various forces might act upon these structures. The applied forces caused by bandage or occlusive dressings, contraction, and/or the self-weight could deform the fabricated scaffolds. As a result, the geometry and the designed porosity changes which eventually alters the desired choreographed functionality. To remedy this problem, a denser scaffold providing higher material concentration could be developed. However, denser scaffolds might have a negative impact on cell proliferation and also could block pathways for nutrient and waste transportation. In this work, a novel multifunctional visco-elastic scaffold modeling has been proposed to control the effective porosity of scaffolds. The designed scaffolds are optimized to provide spatial functionality and controlled material concentration <b>under</b> <b>deformed</b> conditions. The proposed methodology has been implemented and illustrative examples are provided in this paper. Effective porosity between the traditional and the proposed scaffold design have been compared by applying both models on the same free-form surface mimicking a wound...|$|E
