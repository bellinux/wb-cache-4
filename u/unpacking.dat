5|$|On 27 February 1939 the {{new owner}} of the rectory, Captain W. H. Gregson, was <b>unpacking</b> boxes and accidentally knocked over an oil lamp in the hallway. The fire quickly spread {{and the house was}} {{severely}} damaged. After investigating the cause of the blaze the insurance company concluded that the fire had been started deliberately.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Audrina {{purchases}} {{a home in}} Hermosa Beach, while Stephanie {{begins a}} romantic relationship with Josh. To the surprise of the guests, Brody attended Kristin's farewell party that evening. He confesses that he is saddened by her move, but she maintains that the decision is in her best interest. The next day, after much prior deliberation, Lo moves into her boyfriend Scott's house and begins <b>unpacking</b> her belongings.|$|E
5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was <b>unpacking</b> one of Franklin's {{suitcases}} {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} was more of a political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E

5|$|The first {{component}} of the space station was the Zarya module, which was launched unmanned in November 1998. Following this launch, and prior to Expedition 1, there were five manned Space Shuttle flights and two unmanned Russian flights to the ISS. Some of these flights delivered large modules, such as the pressurized Unity and Zvezda modules, and {{the first piece of}} the Integrated Truss Structure. The manned flights were used for partial assembly of the ISS, as well as to start <b>unpacking</b> the supplies and equipment that were being delivered. Prior to Expedition 1, Krikalev expected the ISS to be very similar to his experience on Mir ten years previous, due to the physical similarities of the stations' components.|$|E
5|$|In their haste, Cope and Marsh did {{not always}} follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the {{discovery}} by Benjamin Mudge of the type specimen of Allosaurus in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in Wyoming; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete Allosaurus and several partial skeletons. In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the Como Bluff area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never unpacked it. Upon <b>unpacking</b> in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it {{was found to be}} one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view. This is the well-known mount poised over a partial Apatosaurus skeleton as if scavenging it, illustrated as such by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July 2008, Behan was {{questioned}} by the Carabinieri (Italian military police) {{in connection with the}} murder of a 72-year-old woman, Silvana Abate Francescatti, at her home on Monte Amiata, Arcidosso, in Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy. The woman was found on 11 July with 13 stab wounds, including a fatal throat wound, but was believed to have died the previous day. Behan, who had been resident in Arcidosso for part of the year since 2006, was arrested after seeking treatment twice at a hospital near Arcidosso for a cut on his thigh. In an interview with The Irish Times, he claimed he had first gone to the hospital on 10 July after cutting himself in the thigh while <b>unpacking</b> furniture and other objects delivered from the USA. However, hospital staff had mistakenly decided he had been acting suspiciously due to his poor spoken Italian, {{and the fact that he}} had expressed annoyance at how the hospital was managed and its bad signage.|$|E
40|$|The current {{research}} work aimed {{to access the}} contamination level of aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1, and G 2 in the household spices that are widely consumed in huge amounts. 200 different spice samples, 100 packed and 100 <b>unpacked,</b> were analyzed for the aflatoxins profile by HPLC with an incidence of 61. 5 % contamination out of which 53. 66 % samples exceed the EU limit. The results disclosed that the <b>unpacked</b> samples are more contaminated {{as compared to the}} packed samples except for white cumin seeds. Among packed and <b>unpacked</b> samples of spices, the maximum value of aflatoxins was detected in fennel, that is, 27. 93 [*]μg/kg and 67. 04 [*]μg/kg, respectively. The lowest concentration of aflatoxin was detected in cinnamon in packed form (0. 79 [*]μg/kg) and in the <b>unpacked</b> samples of white cumin seeds which is 1. 75 [*]μg/kg. Caraway seeds and coriander in its <b>unpacked</b> form showed positive results whereas black pepper (packed and <b>unpacked)</b> was found free from aflatoxins. This is the first report on the occurrence of aflatoxins in packed and <b>unpacked</b> samples of spices from Pakistan. To ensure safe consumption of spices, there should be constant monitoring of aflatoxin and more studies need to be executed with the intention of preventing mycotoxin accretion in this commodity...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate packed and <b>unpacked</b> fluid milk consumption and preferences among Turkish households using the data from a consumer survey. Multinomial logit procedure was used to investigate the selected socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of consumers that determine households’ fluid milk consumption choices among packed, <b>unpacked</b> and both packed-unpacked milk consumption choices. Based on the results, 30. 5 % of respondents consumed only <b>unpacked</b> fluid milk, 36. 3 % consumed only packed fluid milk and 33. 1 % of respondents consumed both <b>unpacked</b> and packed fluid milk. Empirical results indicate that better educated household heads, higher income and larger households, and households with children under seven years of age consumed more packed milk than others. A similar result was found for <b>unpacked</b> milk consumption, except for a negative effect of education, working wife and income. Milk production and manufacturing firms are increasing in Turkey; results of this study provide some relatively new information about the consumers’ fluid milk consumption decision...|$|R
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and <b>unpacking</b> boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E

While she stresses that many gay men {{who were members of}} the gay liberation movement repudiated sadomasochism, she writes that the dominant gay male perspective has promoted sadomasochistic sexuality to the detriment of lesbians and feminist women.|$|E
25|$|The initial view, {{reported}} by Horace Smith-Dorrien, {{was that the}} British had difficulty <b>unpacking</b> their ammunition boxes fast enough and that the quartermasters were reluctant to distribute ammunition to units other than their own. Well-equipped and well-trained British soldiers could fire 10–12 rounds a minute. The lack of ammunition caused a lull in the defence and, in subsequent engagements with the Zulus, ammunition boxes were unscrewed in advance for rapid distribution. Numerous first hand accounts indicate ammunition was available and being supplied, including Smith-Dorrien's earliest {{in a letter to}} his father.|$|E
25|$|Atlantis crew {{received}} a special wakeup message from Sir Elton John to start flight day 6. The message followed the day's wakeup song which was played at 6:29 UTC.

The MPLM was launched with 9,403 pounds of cargo and it is expected to return 5,666 pounds when Atlantis lands.

25|$|There {{was almost}} a major crisis before the {{settlement}} got started. The only bank in Tampa {{at the time was}} a branch of the Jacksonville-based First National Bank. Due to the stagnant state of commercial business in town, bank management had decided to close the location. When Ignacio Haya heard the news, he visited the bank’s office to find the fixtures and equipment being packed up for shipment back to Jacksonville. Haya explained to branch manager T.C. Taliaferro that he and Ybor would need the services of a local bank to run their operations, and promised that the initial payroll would come to at least $10,000. On his own volition, Taliaferro began <b>unpacking</b> the boxes. The branch remained open and the crisis was averted.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May, the ACG {{was flown}} from RAAF Base Townsville to Norfolk Island, {{where it was}} to be {{transferred}} to Success and Tobruk. Four RAAF C-130s transported the company group and its equipment that morning, though loading the aircraft took longer than expected due to a shortage of pallets and specialist loading staff. Once at Norfolk Island, the company group had to repack its equipment into smaller containers, as those originally used could not be carried by the Navy's Wessex helicopters. These helicopters transferred the Army force onto Tobruk during the night, which was dangerous as they were not equipped for night flying. The soldiers were not familiar with the ship, and the process of <b>unpacking</b> and storing their equipment was also slow.|$|E
25|$|The French crown also tightly {{controlled}} printing, and the printer and writer Etienne Dolet was {{burned at the}} stake for atheism in 1546. The 1551 Edict of Châteaubriant comprehensively summarized censorship positions to date, and included provisions for <b>unpacking</b> and inspecting all books brought into France. The 1557 Edict of Compiègne applied the death penalty to heretics and resulted in the burning of a noblewoman at the stake. Printers were viewed as radical and rebellious, with 800 authors, printers and book dealers being incarcerated in the Bastille before it was stormed in 1789. At times, the prohibitions of church and state followed each other, e.g. René Descartes was placed on the Index in the 1660s and the French government prohibited the teaching of Cartesianism in schools in the 1670s.|$|E
