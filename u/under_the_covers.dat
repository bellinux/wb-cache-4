5|$|Krug {{was born}} Judith Fingeret in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 15, 1940. Her {{interest}} in {{freedom of speech}} was fostered from an early age. She recalled reading a book about sex education <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> in her bedroom with a flashlight {{at the age of}} 12. Her mother found her and asked what she was doing. When she held up the book, her mother allowed her to continue reading and told her to turn on the bedroom light so she could read properly and avoid damage to her eyes.|$|E

25|$|Overnight rain then seeped in <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers,</b> {{resulting}} in a damp pitch, and the third day's play was called off. Irish wicket-keeper Niall O'Brien reacted by having words with the Aberdeen groundsman, and a formal report was submitted on the incident. Despite no more rain falling during the hours of play, the fourth day was also called off, and the match declared a draw with Scotland gaining nine points and Ireland three.|$|E
25|$|The Wirehaired Vizsla {{thrives on}} attention, exercise, and interaction. It is highly intelligent, and enjoys being {{challenged}} and stimulated, both mentally and physically. Vizslas {{that do not}} get enough attention and exercise can easily become destructive or hyperactive. Under-stimulated Vizslas may also become depressed or engage in obsessive-compulsive behaviours such as persistent licking (Coffman 1992). Vizslas are very gentle dogs that are great around children. The Vizsla wants {{to be close to}} its owner as much of the time as possible. Many Vizslas will sleep in bed with their owners if allowed, burrowing <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers.</b>|$|E
25|$|The return tour {{match against}} Victoria was almost entirely washed out, {{except for the}} second day. Sam Loxton won the toss and batted on a pitch that had sweated <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> and Victoria {{promptly}} crashed to 39/6. Brian Statham (3/23) took the first three wickets, followed by Trevor Bailey (3/22) with the second three. Loxton (27) and Allan Dick (41) made a rescue attempt with a stand of 53, until Bob Appleyard (3/14) took the next three wickets and Johnny Wardle (1/14) finished off the innings for 113. Reg Simpson and captain Peter May both made 33 not out in 99/1 in reply and the match was given up as the rain returned.|$|E

25|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1908, Girault vividly described {{an encounter with}} bedbugs in 1907 {{in a hotel room}} in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was reluctant to sleep on the bed after discovering the bedbugs as he entered the room a little after midnight. He eventually decided to keep the lights on and to lie across the bed without getting <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers.</b> He slept fitfully, constantly waking up to find bedbugs scurrying away after feeding on him. At 3:30 AM, he eventually gave up and slept on a rocking chair. Despite the discomfort, he systematically described the behaviour and stages of maturity of the bedbugs, the general conditions of the room, and attempted to search for eggs and moultings of the insects.|$|E
25|$|The {{countryside}} is beautiful, but {{the weather}} is cold and often inclement, the cottage is without running water or light, they have no food and the locals are unwelcoming – in particular a poacher, Jake, whom Withnail offends. They see Jake prowling around their cottage. Marwood suggests they leave for London the next day. Withnail in turn demands that they share a bed {{in the interest of}} safety, but Marwood refuses. During the night, Withnail becomes paranoid that the poacher is going to come after them and climbs <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> with Marwood, who angrily leaves for a different bed. Hearing the sounds of an intruder breaking into the cottage, Withnail again joins Marwood in bed. The intruder turns out to be Monty, who has been stranded with a punctured tyre.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E

500|$|After he {{performs}} a quick spin, Jackson jumps and lands, freeze framed, on his toes. Upon {{arrival at the}} hotel, Jackson climbs the staircase to Billie Jean's room. Each step lights up as he touches it and a burnt out [...] "Hotel" [...] sign illuminates as he passes. The paparazzo then arrives at the scene and watches as Jackson vanishes <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> of Billie Jean's bed. Trailed by the police, the paparazzo is then arrested for spying on Billie Jean. Jackson sported a new look for the video; Jackson's clothes, a black leather suit with a pink shirt and a red bow tie, were copied by children around the US. Imitation became so severe that, despite pupil protests, Bound Brook High School banned students from wearing a single white glove like Jackson had on during the performance of [...] "Billie Jean" [...] at [...]|$|E
500|$|Among Waters' Victorian-set novels, {{depictions of}} sexual {{encounters}} are also, according to Palmer, {{the most vivid}} in Tipping the Velvet. A review in The Advocate calls the book [...] "riotously sexy", and The Seattle Times suggests the scene where Nan shows Kitty how to open and eat an oyster is evocative of Tom Jones. This follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians. Frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour, or employed it as an erotic element controlled by, and for the benefit of, men. Lesbian literary scholar Bonnie Zimmerman writes, [...] "Lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject the patriarchal stereotype of the lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed. It is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in the closet or <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers.</b> We don’t wish to give the world another stick with which to beat us." ...|$|E
500|$|From 2004 to 2007, Higgins' sexual {{orientation}} {{was the subject}} of media speculation based partly on interpretations of her lyrics and her interviews. In an October 2007 interview with Australian lesbian magazine Cherrie, she was asked if she fell under the moniker of [...] "not-so-straight" [...] girls. She replied [...] "Um, yeah, definitely. ... I think sexuality is a fluid thing and it's becoming increasingly more acceptable to admit that you're that way." [...] In November her Myspace page reported, [...] "I've been in relationships with both men and women so I guess I fall most easily under the category 'Bisexual'". She {{went on to say that}} she wanted future interviews to focus on her music rather than her sexuality. In a March 2008 interview with AfterEllen.com, Higgins said that her song [...] "Secret" [...] was written about an ex-girlfriend who was not comfortable, at first, about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
