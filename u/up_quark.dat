5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down quark (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E
5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: flavour changing. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavour (type) {{of one of its}} two down quarks to an <b>up</b> <b>quark.</b> Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{down quark}} is a first-generation quark with {{a charge of}} −. It is the second-lightest of all the six of quarks, the lightest being the <b>up</b> <b>quark.</b> Down quarks are most {{commonly}} found in nucleons. Its protons contains one down quark and two up quarks, while neutrons contain two down quarks and one <b>up</b> <b>quark.</b> Down quarks were theorized by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig when they discovered the quark model in 1968.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example from}} the real world is isospin symmetry, an SU(2) group {{corresponding}} to the similarity between <b>up</b> <b>quarks</b> and down quarks. This is an approximate symmetry: While <b>up</b> and down <b>quarks</b> are identical in how they interact under the strong force, they have different masses and different electroweak interactions. Mathematically, there is an abstract two-dimensional vector spaceand the laws of physics are approximately invariant under applying a determinant-1 unitary transformation to this space:For example, [...] would turn all <b>up</b> <b>quarks</b> in the universe into down quarks and vice versa.

25|$|The eta meson is a meson {{made of a}} mix of <b>up</b> <b>quark,</b> down quark, strange quark, quarks, and anti-quarks. It was {{discovered}} by a team at the University of California, Berkeley using the Bevatron.|$|E
25|$|The <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> is a first-generation quark with {{a charge}} of +(2/3)e. The {{existence}} of up quarks was first postulated when Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig developed the quark model in 1964, and the first evidence for them was found in deep inelastic scattering experiments in 1968.|$|E
25|$|Weak boson fusion. Another {{possibility}} {{when two}} (anti-)fermions collide {{is that the}} two exchange a virtual W or Z boson, which emits a Higgs boson.

500|$|All mesons are {{unstable}} {{because of}} weak decay. In the {{process known as}} beta decay, a down quark in the neutron can change into an <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> by emitting a virtual [...] boson which is then converted into an electron and an electron antineutrino. Another example is the electron capture, a common variant of radioactive decay, wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact, and are changed to a neutron (an <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> is changed to a down quark) and an electron neutrino is emitted.|$|E
500|$|The symbols {{encountered}} in these lists are: I (isospin), J (total angular momentum), P (parity), u (<b>up</b> <b>quark),</b> d (down quark), s (strange quark), c (charm quark), b (bottom quark), Q (charge), B (baryon number), S (strangeness), C (charm), B′ (bottomness), {{as well as}} a wide array of subatomic particles (hover for name). (See the baryon article for a detailed explanation of these symbols.) ...|$|E
25|$|Each baryon has a {{corresponding}} antiparticle (antibaryon) where quarks {{are replaced by}} their corresponding antiquarks.

50|$|Protons are spin-½ fermions and are {{composed}} of three valence quarks, making them baryons (a sub-type of hadrons).

500|$|In the quark {{model for}} hadrons, the neutron is {{composed}} of one <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> (charge +2/3e) and two down quarks (charge −1/3e). [...] The magnetic moment of the neutron can be modeled as a sum of the magnetic moments of the constituent quarks, although this simple model belies {{the complexities of the}} Standard Model of particle physics. [...] The calculation assumes that the quarks behave like pointlike Dirac particles, each having their own magnetic moment, as computed using an expression similar to the one above for the nuclear magneton: ...|$|E
500|$|All {{particles}} have {{a property}} called weak isospin (symbol T3), {{which serves as a}} quantum number and governs how that particle behaves in the weak interaction. Weak isospin plays the same role in the weak interaction as does electric charge in electromagnetism, and color charge in the strong interaction. All left-handed fermions have a weak isospin value of either + or [...] For example, the <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> has a T3 of + and the down quark [...] A quark never decays through the weak interaction into a quark of the same T3: Quarks with a T3 of + only decay into quarks with a T3 of [...] and vice versa.|$|E
500|$|Spin can be {{represented}} by a vector whose length is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant ħ (pronounced [...] "h bar"). For quarks, a measurement of the spin vector component along any axis can only yield the values +ħ/2 or −ħ/2; for this reason quarks are classified as spin- particles. The component of spin along a given axis – by convention the z axis – is often denoted by an up arrow ↑ for the value + and down arrow ↓ for the value −, placed after the symbol for flavor. For example, an <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> with a spin of + along the z axis is denoted by u↑.|$|E

50|$|Isospin {{symmetry}} can {{be generalized}} to flavour symmetry, an SU(3) group corresponding to the similarity between <b>up</b> <b>quarks,</b> down quarks, and strange quarks. This is, again, an approximate symmetry, violated by quark mass differences and electroweak interactions—in fact, it is a poorer approximation than isospin, because of the strange quark's noticeably higher mass.|$|R
50|$|A test {{particle}} is a particle whose mass and charge {{are assumed to}} be so small that its effect on external system is insignificant. It is often a hypothetical simplified point particle with no properties other than mass and charge. Real particles like electrons and <b>up</b> <b>quarks</b> are more complex and have additional terms in their Lagrangians.|$|R
500|$|Quarks, {{which make}} up {{composite}} particles like neutrons and protons, come in six [...] "flavours" [...] up, down, strange, charm, top and bottom [...] which give those composite particles their properties. The weak interaction is unique in that it allows for quarks to swap their flavour for another. The swapping of those properties is mediated by the force carrier bosons. For example, during beta minus decay, a down quark within a neutron is changed into an <b>up</b> <b>quark,</b> thus converting the neutron to a proton and resulting in the emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino. Also, the weak interaction is the only fundamental interaction that breaks parity-symmetry, and similarly, {{the only one to}} break charge parity symmetry.|$|E
500|$|A quark of one flavor can {{transform}} into a quark of another flavor {{only through the}} weak interaction, {{one of the four}} fundamental interactions in particle physics. By absorbing or emitting a W boson, any up-type quark (up, charm, and top quarks) can change into any down-type quark (down, strange, and bottom quarks) and vice versa. This flavor transformation mechanism causes the radioactive process of beta decay, in which a neutron (...) [...] "splits" [...] into a proton (...) , an electron (...) and an electron antineutrino (...) (see picture). This occurs when one of the down quarks in the neutron (...) decays into an <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> by emitting a virtual [...] boson, transforming the neutron into a proton (...) [...] The [...] boson then decays into an electron and an electron antineutrino.|$|E
500|$|Quarks have {{fractional}} {{electric charge}} values – either - or [...] times the elementary charge (e), depending on flavor. Up, charm, and top quarks (collectively {{referred to as}} up-type quarks) have a charge of +e, while down, strange, and bottom quarks (down-type quarks) have −e. Antiquarks have the opposite charge to their corresponding quarks; up-type antiquarks have charges of −e and down-type antiquarks have charges of +e. Since the electric charge of a hadron {{is the sum of}} the charges of the constituent quarks, all hadrons have integer charges: the combination of three quarks (baryons), three antiquarks (antibaryons), or a quark and an antiquark (mesons) always results in integer charges. For example, the hadron constituents of atomic nuclei, neutrons and protons, have charges of 0e and +1e respectively; the neutron is composed of two down quarks and one <b>up</b> <b>quark,</b> and the proton of two up quarks and one down quark.|$|E
50|$|Six {{types of}} <b>quarks</b> (<b>up,</b> down, strange, charm, bottom and top) {{have been found}} experimentally; however, the {{majority}} of matter on Earth {{is made up of}} only <b>up</b> and down <b>quarks.</b> It is a fundamental question whether there exists stable matter made <b>up</b> of strange <b>quarks</b> in combination with <b>up</b> and down <b>quarks.</b> Particles of such matter are known as strangelets. Strangelets might have extremely large mass and very small charge-to-mass ratios. It would be a totally new form of matter. AMS-02 may determine whether this extraordinary matter exists in our local environment.|$|R
5000|$|Within the quark {{model for}} hadrons, {{such as the}} neutron, the proton is {{composed}} of one down quark (charge -1/3 e) and two <b>up</b> <b>quarks</b> (charge +2/3 e). [...] The magnetic moment of the proton can be modeled as a sum of the magnetic moments of the constituent quarks, although this simple model belies {{the complexities of the}} Standard Model of particle physics.|$|R
50|$|A similar mysterious {{situation}} {{was with the}} Δ++ baryon; in the quark model, it is composed of three <b>up</b> <b>quarks</b> with parallel spins. In 1964-65, and Greenberg and Han-Nambu independently resolved the problem by proposing that quarks possess an additional SU(3) gauge degree of freedom, later called color charge. Han and Nambu noted that quarks might interact via an octet of vector gauge bosons: the gluons.|$|R
2500|$|Again, {{the neutron}} {{is not an}} {{elementary}} particle but a composite of an <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> and two down quarks (udd). It is in fact one of the down quarks that interacts in beta decay, turning into an <b>up</b> <b>quark</b> to form a proton (uud).

2500|$|Each type of meson has a {{corresponding}} antiparticle (antimeson) in which quarks {{are replaced by}} their corresponding antiquarks and vice versa.
