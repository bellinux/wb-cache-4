5|$|On April 17, 2014, Stanislaus National Forest {{issued an}} order closing the {{majority}} of the burn area to the public through November 18, 2014, citing safety issues from potential falls of heavily burned trees, rock falls, and <b>uneven</b> <b>ground.</b> The decision was met with disappointment by morel mushroom hunters who had looked forward to extensive post-fire fruiting of this highly sought-after mushroom. The safety rationale was questioned, as Yosemite National Park, which largely prohibits mushroom collecting, had opened up the burn areas within its boundaries to the public earlier in the month. Some mushroom hunters stated that {{they would be willing to}} sign liability waivers in order to enter the area, but the Forest Service rejected this idea, stating they were ultimately responsible for the safety of those entering the area. Extensive harvesting of morels in the Rim Fire area nevertheless took place in May 2014, in a few cases legally by special permit, but in most cases through illegal harvesting. The closure of the burn area was also criticized by the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors for, among other reasons, causing the cancellation of grazing allotments by local ranchers.|$|E
5|$|The Zveno-3 {{in which}} TB-3 carried two Grigorovich I-Z fighters under the wings {{presented}} a different challenge — the I-Z was a monoplane with fixed landing gear which touched the ground {{while it was}} suspended under the mothership. To accommodate the <b>uneven</b> <b>ground</b> during takeoffs, the fighters were attached via a floating frame that permitted vertical movement relative to the TB-3. However, immediately after takeoff the I-Z pilots had to push forward on the control sticks to lock the frame in the fixed bottom position — if the fighter-bomber was not rigid in flight, the bomber became extremely difficult to control. During one of the test flights, I-Z pilot Korotkov incorrectly timed the locking maneuver and the lift generated by his fighter broke the docking frame and crashed him {{into the bottom of}} the mothership's wing. As the bomber came in for an emergency landing with both fighters still attached, the slow landing speed of the TB-3 resulted in loss of lift for the I-Z which fell away, killing Korotkov. This was the most serious accident of the entire Zveno program despite the inherent complexity of carrying as many as five aircraft, performing mid-air launches and dockings, and damage to the motherships by propellers and landing gear of the fighters. Tests with various combinations of aircraft determined that top-mounted configurations presented the most difficulty in docking due to turbulent airflow coming off the mothership's wings. The problem of safe underwing attachment was solved with the appearance of the Polikarpov I-16 fighter with retractable landing gear. This permitted the use of the same rigid mounting frames as for the top-mounted aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The {{assessment}} of the English historian Sir Walter Raleigh is:Three great errors Sempronius committed, of which every one deserved to be recompensed with the loss that followed. The first was, that he fought with Hannibal in a champain, being by far inferior in horse, and withal thereby subject to the African elephants, which in enclosed or <b>uneven</b> <b>grounds,</b> and woodlands, would have been of no use. His second error was, that he made no discovery of the place upon which he fought, whereby he was grossly overreached, and ensnared, by the ambush which Hannibal had laid for him. The third was, that he drenched his footmen with empty stomachs, in the river of Trebia, even in a most cold and frosty day, whereby in effect they lost {{the use of their}} limbs.|$|R
40|$|Background. Anterior {{soft tissue}} {{impingement}} {{is a common}} cause of chronic pain in the ankle. The preferred method of operative treatment is an arthroscopic excision of hypertrophic fibrous and synovial tissue in the anterior part of the ankle joint. Methods. We present the results of arthroscopic treatment of anterior ankle impingement in group of 14 patients. Results. Subjective improvement after the procedure was observed in all patients and 13 of them (93 %) were without any symptoms after the operation. One patient reported of intermittent pain, especially when walking on <b>uneven</b> <b>grounds.</b> Conclusions. We conclude that arthroscopic excision of hypertrophic synovial tissue in the anterior part of the ankle which causes the symptoms of impingement is a minimally invasive procedure that is both safe and reliable.

25|$|A {{less obvious}} {{problem is that}} it is very {{difficult}} to keep such a vehicle moving in a straight line. Although a governor can be used to ensure the two engine speeds are similar, loads on the tracks will not be the same as it moves over different terrain, causing the more heavily loaded track to slow and the tank to turn in that direction. This will cause the tank to wander when moving over <b>uneven</b> <b>ground.</b> This is not an issue at very low speeds, and the system is sometimes used on bulldozers and other tracked construction vehicles. For tanks, considerable driver skill and constant adjustment are needed, even at the relatively low speeds seen on early designs.|$|E

25|$|Fabius {{refused to}} move from his camp despite the pleas of his {{officers}} and the urgings of Minucius. The Roman army made ready and stood at arms but did not move out. Fabius {{did not want to}} fight a night battle, fearing a Punic trick to draw the Romans into a battle over broken, <b>uneven</b> <b>ground,</b> where Roman infantry will lose their edge as their lines would be broken, and communication would be hampered. Hannibal had previously hoodwinked and destroyed two Roman armies at Trebbia and Trasimene and the cautious Fabius did not want his army to be the third. Thus, although Hannibal still managed to trick the Romans, the Romans only suffered loss of face but not the loss of another army.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The large Pleistocene herbivores of Mediterranean islands {{belong to}} four families: Elephantidae, Hippopotamidae, Cervidae and Bovidae. They {{originated}} in environments characterized by peculiar features, {{different from the}} typical habitats of their ancestors. This paper examines {{some aspects of the}} functional morphology of these endemic forms in relation with their environment. Lightening of limbs in elephants are essentially related with size reduction, which allows to move on <b>uneven</b> and steep <b>grounds.</b> Adaptations in hippos to a more arid environment and <b>uneven</b> <b>grounds</b> are also shown by specimens with scantily reduced size. Morpho-functional variations in cervids are connected with the life habits rather than body size; the various forms are characterized by a wide spectrum of adaptations. Modifications in endemic bovids are less known with exception of the dwarf balearic bovids, in which the evolutionary process produced a loss of agility and speed. Changes in size and in functional morphology are always quicker and dependent on the interaction of several factors. In the evolution of the endemic herbivores various phenomena have to be considered: neoteny, achondroplastic dwarfism, hypermorphosis. The presence/absence of large carnivores has a stronger influence on the dimensional and morpho-biometric variability than on the body size reduction. Riassunto I grandi erbivori pleistocenici delle isole del Mediterraneo sono in genere caratterizzati da variazioni di taglia e di morfologia in parte dipendenti dalle diverse dimensioni corporee acquisite, in parte legate a nuovi modi di vita. Tali elementi hanno diversa incidenza nei processi evolutivi dei singoli taxa, in funzione dell'interagire di vari parametri, ma in genere sussiste in ambiente insulare una stretta relazione tra condizioni fisiografiche e morfologia funzionale...|$|R

40|$|Wheel-legged hybrid robots {{promise to}} combine the {{efficiency}} of wheeled robots with the versatility of legged robots: {{they are able to}} roll on simple terrains, to dynamically adapt their posture and even to walk on <b>uneven</b> <b>grounds.</b> Al-though different locomotion modes of such robots have been studied, a pivotal question remains: how to automatically adapt the locomotion mode when the environment changes?

In the three investigated situations (flat ground, grass-like terrain, tunnel-like environment), our method found efficient controllers for forward locomotion in 1 to 2 minutes: the robot used its wheels on the flat ground, it walked on the grass-like terrain and moved with a lowered body in the tunnel-like environment...|$|R
25|$|The battle {{itself was}} smaller in scale when {{compared}} to the Battle of Ticinus. Although Fabius was not duped by Hannibal’s moves, his blocking force at the pass was. Leonard Cottrell, in his book “Hannibal: Enemy of Rome", wrote that the trick was designed to be recognized by Fabius as a trick. Hannibal had studied the mind of his opponent, and devised a plan to make him do exactly what Hannibal needed him to do. Fabius thought Hannibal was {{trying to get him to}} fight a night action over broken, <b>uneven</b> <b>ground,</b> where Roman infantry would lose their greatest advantages of discipline and teamwork, as their formations would become disorganized. Since Hannibal was choosing the battle ground and the hour, he might have sprung other surprises to gain further advantages on the Romans. Fabius predictably did what Hannibal had anticipated: nothing. The Romans guarding the pass, with no Fabius to keep them in check, thought they were doing their job when they rushed out, preventing a Carthaginian escape. Again, they acted as Hannibal had anticipated, and the Carthaginians took advantage of their actions to escape.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} novel interactive {{techniques to}} simulate the sensation of {{walking up and down}} in immersive virtual worlds based on visual feedback. Our method consists in modifying the motion of the virtual subjective camera while the user is really walking in an immersive virtual environment. The modification of the virtual viewpoint {{is a function of the}} variations in the height of the virtual ground. Three effects are proposed: (1) a straightforward modification of the camera’s height, (2) a modification of the camera’s navigation velocity, (3) a modification of the camera’s orientation. They were tested in an immersive virtual reality setup in which the user is really walking. A Desktop configuration where the user is seated and controls input devices was also tested and compared to the real walking configuration. Experimental results show that our visual techniques are very efficient for the simulation of two canonical shapes: bumps and holes located on the ground. Interestingly, a strong ”orientation-height illusion ” is found, as changes in pitch viewing orientation produce perception of height changes (although camera’s height remains strictly the same in this case). Our visual effects could be applied in various virtual reality applications such as urban or architectural project reviews or training, as well as in videogames, in order to provide the sensation of walking on <b>uneven</b> <b>grounds...</b>|$|R
