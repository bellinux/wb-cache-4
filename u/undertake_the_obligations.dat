40|$|ABSTRACT On 6 December 1994, the Norwegian {{parliament}} – the Storting – {{passed a}} resolution that approves of Norwegian participation in military operations for NATO that are undertaken beyond the territory of NATO (out-of-area operations) even in cases when the United Nations’ Security Council has not authorised such action. Until this resolution (Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94) was passed, Norway’s foreign policy had been that out-of-area operations would only be undertaken upon Security Council authorisation. The policy expressed in the resolution was sealed in March 1999, when Norwegian aircrafts participated in NATO’s bombing of Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro {{despite the lack of}} an explicit Security Council mandate. Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 was passed with dissenting votes and reflects opposing views about Norway’s moral bonds: On the one hand, a duty not to participate in non-UN-mandated out-of-area operations to adhere to the rules in international law {{and on the other hand}} a duty to participate in such operations to <b>undertake</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> as a NATO member. This thesis asks whether the Storting passed a morally justifiable resolution when it decided that Norway was going to participate in NATO out-of-area operations that were about to be undertaken without a mandate from the United Nations Security Council. This question is answered by investigating the premises upon which Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 rests: (i) 	Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 does not represent a violation of the rules concerning the resort to military force in international law, or (ii) 	Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 represents a violation of the rules concerning the resort to military force in international law, but there were adequate reasons for giving priority to the obligation towards NATO to participate in non-UN-mandated out-of-area operations to the detriment of the obligation to adhere to rules of international law. This thesis finds that the first premise is invalid because Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94 clearly falls outside of the scope of the UN Charter and because there is poor evidence that customary international law has replaced the Charter provisions. In determining whether Norway is obligated towards NATO to participate in non-UN-mandated out-of area operations, it is asked whether such participation constitutes part of Norway’s fair share of the burden as a NATO member. Having explored two burden-sharing principles to establish what Norway’s fair share of the burdens consists in, the discussion concludes that assessing what Norway’s fair share of the burden consists in proves inappropriate for determining whether Norway is obligated towards NATO to participate in non-UN-mandated out-of-area operations. For this reason, the duty of reciprocity is explored to assess whether Norway owes NATO participation as a return for received benefits. The moral requirement to reciprocate, it is concluded, imposes a duty on Norway to reciprocate since the country willingly and knowingly has received benefits as a NATO member. By participating in non-UN-mandated out-of-area operations, Norway fulfils this obligation. These conclusions imply that the Storting faced a situation where two requirements pointed the Storting in opposing directions. Participating in non-UN-mandated out-of-area, which the duty towards NATO requires, is in conflict with fulfilling the obligation to adhere to rules of international law. Likewise, fulfilling the duty to adhere to rules of international law dissatisfies the duty to make returns for received benefits. Therefore, the two duties are subjected to scrutiny again in order to determine whether the Storting had adequate reasons for giving priority to the obligation towards NATO. It is shown that the Storting did not demonstrate the existence of adequate reasons for giving priority to the duty towards NATO over the duty to towards the international community. Consideration of all relevant arguments in this particular situation demonstrated that the Storting could have done less harm by acting differently. While keeping an important promise made towards the international community to adhere to rules of international law was possible without dissatisfying the obligation towards NATO altogether, fairness towards NATO was incompatible with the obligation towards the international community. This thesis concludes that the Storting did not adopt a morally justifiable resolution when passing Beslutning S. nr. 2, 06. 12. 94...|$|E

As a result of the researches led by developed nations to detect adverse effects of human-originated greenhouse gas emissions, which have already reached dangerous levels in the atmosphere, on the climate system, the need to take global action about this matter has been revealed. Kyoto Protocol, which is adopted in 1997 and now considered as the most significant international effort ever made to minimize the effects of global warming and climate changes, is of great importance for determining <b>the</b> <b>obligations</b> to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the applicable mechanisms.

Purpose of this study is to assess, under the title of "deforestation", Turkish environment and forest legislation with respect to achievement of Kyoto Protocol's goal and to reveal deficiencies of this legislation, and according to the results of such assessment, to make suggestions for Turkey's fulfillment of its obligations mentioned above.

40|$|In {{becoming}} a signatory to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Treaties, Canada has <b>undertaken</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to provide {{protection against the}} circumvention of technological measures designed to protect copyright works. While on its face <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> appears simple, in reality it brings about an intersection of policy, law and technology; a complex situation with far reaching repercussions. The U. S., a co-signatory to the WIPO Treaties, responded to this tension by enacting the Digital Milennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which heavily regulated circumvention technology and garnered wide-spread criticism. Critics labeled the law as unpredictable and overbroad legislation, which has chilled free speech, violated fair use, stifled research and study and encouraged monopolies by eliminating competition. Drawing largely on the U. S. experience, this thesis aims to suggest a possible route for Canada to take when fulfilling its own <b>obligations</b> under <b>the</b> WIPO. It will begin with {{a review of the}} relevant provisions of the Treaties {{to determine the extent of}} Canada's obligation. It will then examine Canada's proposal papers and the responses of its citizens to the questioned posed regarding future anti-circumvention legislation. It will also examine the DMCA in detail and attempt to distil its flaws. Finally, it will investigate the extent of the need for new anti-circumvention legislation in Canada by examining Canada's existing laws dealing with the protection of technology measures. Such process will provide evidence that Canada has, to a large extent, complied with its <b>obligations</b> under <b>the</b> WIPO while maintaining the delicate balance between the stakeholders of copyright law. Thus while new anti-circumvention legislation may still be in order, Canada has the latitude to craft a law that fully recognizes the rights of all stakeholders in the copyright equation and is consistent with its own copyright policies...|$|R

5000|$|The post-war Treaty of Neuilly again denied Bulgaria what it {{felt was}} its share of Macedonia and Thrace. After this moment the {{combined}} Macedonian-Adrianopolitan revolutionary movement separated into two detached organizations: Internal Thracian Revolutionary Organisation (bulg.

ITRO was a revolutionary organisation active in the Greek regions of Thrace and Macedonia to the river Strymon and Rhodope Mountains between 1922 and 1934. The reason {{for the establishment of}} ITRO was the transfer of the region from Bulgaria to Greece in May 1920. ITRO proclaimed its goal as the [...] "unification of all the disgruntled elements in Thrace regardless of their nationality", and to win full political independence for the region. Later IMRO created as a satellite organisation the Internal Western Outland Revolutionary Organisation (bulg. Вътрешна западнопокрайненска революционна организация), which operated in the areas of Tsaribrod and Bosilegrad, ceded to Yugoslavia. IMRO began sending armed bands called cheti into Greek and Yugoslav Macedonia and Thrace to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the oppressed population. On 23 March 1923 Aleksandar Stamboliyski, who favoured a détente with Greece and Yugoslavia, so that Bulgaria could concentrate on its internal problems, signed the Treaty of Niš with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and <b>undertook</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to suppress <b>the</b> operations of the IMRO carried out from Bulgarian territory.

The right faction sought incorporation of all Macedonian territory into Bulgaria, while the left faction sought separate Macedonia that could join future Balkan Federation. In December 1921, left-leaning deserters of IMRO formed the official Macedonian Federative Organization. Violence between the two groups reinforced a political crisis growing public impression that Bulgarian government was unstable. Meanwhile, the government started military campaign against the IMRO in the Summer of 1921 using the Federative Organization as ally. The Premier Aleksandar Stamboliyski proclaimed as his aim the forming a new Balkan Federation of agrarian states. In March 1923 he signed the Treaty of Niš with the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and <b>undertook</b> <b>the</b> <b>obligation</b> to suppress <b>the</b> operations of the IMRO and IWORO carried out from Bulgarian territory. [...] As result in the Summer of 1923, IMRO aided by radical officers organized coup d'état in Bulgaria. The fall of the pro-Yugoslav government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski was a great success to the power of IMRO. Subsequently, part of the fleeing from Bulgaria federalists placed themselves in Serbian service, joining the Association against Bulgarian Bandits and fighting against IMRO. Serbian Prime Minister Ljubomir Davidovic openly disagreed with such policy but Zika Lazic, head of the team that mobilized such guerillas, responded he did not find a better mechanism for mutual annihilation between current and former Bulgarian Komitadjis. As a consequence, aided unofficially by the new government, the IMRO acted as a [...] "state within a state" [...] in Bulgaria, which was used as its base for new hit and run attacks against Yugoslavia. Because of this, {{at the end of the}} 1920s the Yugoslav-Bulgarian frontier was turned into the most fortified one in Europe. The Serbian actions led to a significant reduction of the IMRO attacks. IMRO's constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organization, which had come to be seen as a gangster organization inside Bulgaria and a band of assassins outside it. Afterwards the Association against Bulgarian Bandits was gradually dissolved.|$|R
