40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, Durban, 2003. Exports of Eritrean fishery products, {{for which}} the European Union is the largest market, has an {{important}} share in the socio-economic development of the country. It {{is very important to}} earn foreign currency and provide employment opportunities by encouraging local and foreign investors in the sector. The export of fish from Eritrea mainly targets markets of developed nations where food quality and safety standards are increasing rapidly. During the last decade there has been more focus on the application of more stringent quality and safety regulations according to international norms. This paper investigates the determinants of quality in global fish businesses. The paper provides an overview of all the factors that characterize international fish market regulations with special emphasis given to the EU markets. It also investigates the general quality and safety policies of the Eritrean Marine Products Company (EMPC). The paper findings show that the EMPC face some difficulties that may hinder its competitiveness in the global fish market. The paper examines the activities and resources of the three actors, that is the EMPC, European <b>Union</b> <b>Inspectors</b> and Fish Inspection and Quality Control Division, which have a significant contribution to the quality of fish exported from Eritrea. The impact of cooperative strategy or the networking model among the three actors to quality fish exporting from the country is investigated. The study supports the formation of cooperative strategy among these actors in that it is positively related to the export performance of the processing firms with higher compliance to standards...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} Gender Differences in Motivation among Secondary School Teachers. The {{objectives of the}} study were: to examine the factors leading to motivation in teaching among males and female teachers in secondary schools; assess {{the differences in the}} levels of motivation in teaching among males and female teachers in secondary schools; and to investigate significant relationship between sex and motivation in teaching in secondary schools. The study was conducted in Dar es Salam City. Also, the study involved Heads of Secondary, District Secondary Education Officer, Teachers <b>Union,</b> Education <b>Inspectors</b> and teachers’ representatives from community secondary schools. The data of the study were collected through interview and questionnaire methods. The data collected were analyzed descriptively and quantitavely. The findings of the first objective revealed that there was a slight difference on the factors that led to motivation in teaching among males and female teachers in secondary schools. The key factors that raised motivation to female teachers were the idea that they could be identified as having a job and that they were doing something of worth. Men on their side, were more motivated when their job got them out of poverty. The results of second and third objectives reflected that there were no different levels of motivation among male and female teachers. The study recommends that the government and nongovernment institutions should give motivation to the teachers by teachers by building the houses of teachers, providing electricity to the places where there is the problem of electricity by providing solar power panel and giving teachers allowance. This will help the teachers to enjoy their work as {{it is well known that}} teaching professional has been forgotten...|$|R
2500|$|The five-hour {{hearing was}} a {{contentious}} one. Council member Tommy Wells, {{chair of the}} committee on public safety, called Ellerbe's answers about vehicle readiness [...] "vague", and the Washington Post reported that Ellerbe [...] "repeatedly faltered" [...] while answering. When pressed, Ellerbe could not even say if he had visited the DCFEMS 9-1-1 emergency call center. Ellerbe turned for help from Deputy Mayor Paul Quander so often that Wells rebuked Ellerbe and demanded that Ellerbe (not Quander) respond. D.C. City Council chairman Phil Mendelson expressed shock that the city {{had to rely on}} reports from the firefighters' <b>union</b> and D.C. <b>Inspector</b> General's office for accurate information on the department, and rhetorically asked how Ellerbe cannot track 411 vehicles when the D.C. police can keep accurate track of 4,000 cars, trucks, and motorcycles. Ellerbe apologized to the council at the hearing for submitting inaccurate data on the fleet. But Wells warned Ellerbe that he should be prepared to quit unless he could guarantee the accuracy of the information the department provides. Despite the faulty vehicle data, Ellerbe said his capital request ($24 million for fiscal 2014, 2015, and 2016) did not need revision.|$|R
30|$|However, an {{important}} objection to ‘fixing’ the temporary employment issue with social benefits and labor market policies is that turnover costs are shifted from employers to society. Another way of compensating temporary workers for their risk is granting them ‘insecurity bonuses’, as achieved in France {{in the form}} of the prime de précarité. In this system, employers have to pay a bonus to the worker (amounting to ten per cent of the total gross wage paid under the contract) if the employment relationship is not continued after the contract has expired. As mentioned, since 2013 there has also been a higher employer contribution rate to the unemployment insurance fund in case of short fixed-term contracts. This system ensures that employers contribute to the social costs of their hiring practices and increases incentives to use temporary contracts responsibly. In addition, it might reduce the perception among temporary workers being disadvantaged in several dimensions (unemployment risk and lower wages). For such a system to be effective, it would be important that, first, the bonus is sufficiently high to substantively affect employers’ incentives and workers’ material situation (albeit without totally discouraging hiring). Second, it has to be ensured that there are no legal loopholes that allow circumventing the bonus. Third,—and a more general point—the equal-pay principle has to be vigorously enforced through monitoring by <b>unions</b> and labor <b>inspectors</b> as well as through severe sanctions in case of non-compliance; otherwise, employers can cancel out the insecurity bonus by lowering temporary workers’ wages, a practice that already seems to be widespread.|$|R
40|$|In November 1996 the NSW Minister for Mineral Resources, Ron Bob Martin MP, {{commissioned}} ACiL Economics and Policy Pty Ltd {{to conduct}} a wide ranging review of safety within the Nt:w South Wales mining industry. The review {{was a response to}} a disturbing number of fatalities which had occurred in the industry during the Minister 2 ̆ 7 s tenn of office together with a number of alanning near misses whert: serious failures in mining systems had occurred. Shortly after the review was commissioned, four mine workers died at Gretley Colliery near Newcastle. An inquiry is currently being conducted into the incident. ACiL were given the following terms of reference for the MSR (MSR) : Identify key issues which need to be addressed before a significant and measurable improvement in mine safety performance, and an observable reduction in the potential for serious safety incidents, can be expected. 2. Explore options for addressing these key issues, through consultation {{with a wide range of}} stakeholders. 3. Consider how the findings of the Warden 2 ̆ 7 s Court Inquiry into the 1994 Moura Mine disaster should be applied in New South Wales. 4. Evaluate the role, activities, structure, employment conditions, and resourcing of the State 2 ̆ 7 s Mines Inspectorates in light of the identified key issues. 5. Evaluate existing legislative provisions in the light of the identified key issues. 6. Provide Government with recommendations on how mine safety in New South Wales could be enhanced, with particular regard to the potential contribution of the Inspectorates. The ACiL report titled 2 ̆ 2 Review of Mine Safety in NSW 2 ̆ 2 was tabled in Parliament by the Minister in April 1997. The review considered industry safety perfonnance and its measurement through considering available statistics, drawing on submissions and, predominantly seeking the views of a broad cross sec:tion of industry and Government personnel. This included mine managers, <b>inspectors,</b> <b>union</b> officials and the workforce. In its report, the MSR makes numerous observations concerning issue; of safety and the mining industry. Arising from those observations the review made forty four (44) recommendations (See Appendix A) for either consideration or action to address the issues identified...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{controversial}} embedding of New Public Management in the Italian education system after the school autonomy reform (1997), witnessing {{a process of}} restructuring and reculturing. Such a process has been {{the outcome of the}} interplay between different factors: the borrowing of education policies and recipes from the global discourse on education, the mediation of those policies by cultural and structural path dependencies, the struggles developing around and between the arenas of politics and of policy production and policy enactment. We show how the Italian NPM has implied: •	the entering of new issues in the education debate, •	the formation of new subjectivities, especially “new” heads, •	the entering of non-educational actors, •	the establishment of a new moral environment. We demonstrate how these changes have been accompanied by a shift from a focus on social equity (e. g., reducing dropping out, contrasting material and intellectual “new” and old poverties) towards economic requirements linked to competion and meritocratic values. Analysing the interplay between politics, policy and culture, we draw on Newman’s analytical model (2001) to map the tensions between centralisation/decentralisation and internal/external change. Moreover, we enrich this framework using discourse as a heuristic tool to explore how knowledge and identities are intertwined with practices and relations of power. This framework seeks to highlight the conflicting and overlapping policy tensions and developments of NPM entering the educational scene. The research draws on policy texts analysis and in-depth interviews. Data will be analyzed through an interpretative process of merging Critical Discourse Analysis with Grounded Theory process of coding and subcoding. Interviews with key actors (policy-makers, school <b>inspectors,</b> <b>union</b> representatives, head teachers, experts) have been collected as well as policy texts and documents through a ‘cascade’ sample of institutional web-sites. Looking at the intertwining between the formation of new head teachers and the shifts towards new accountabilities (Barzanò, 2011), the paper shows how school heads and their unions resist the repeated trials of governments to introduce managerialist mechanisms of headship evaluation. It also shows how such resistance, inspired by the welfarist discourse, also implies strong attachments to the aims of social equity. The paper ends with a critical appraisal of the recent efforts made by the Italian government to introduce an overall framework of system, schools and teachers’ evaluation where the heads are not ‘subjectified’ as objects of evaluation but they are requested to enact meritocratic policies. In doing so, we try to investigate how such NPM “educational policies and practices more often fail to address poverty” (AERA call 2013) as a main objecitve in addressing education towards social equity issues...|$|R
