40|$|In 2015, the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit {{adopted the}} 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, listing the {{required}} Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The African Union endorsed the 2063 Agenda, the continent’s shared strategic framework for inclusive growth and sustainable development. The public service in Africa, as globally, is {{under pressure to}} produce and show outcomes {{as a measure of}} government’s effectiveness in meeting these goals. Genuine change requires critical self-reflection. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of government performance is essential to document and report on performance, promote learning and improvement. M&E is a mechanism to assess and analyse pre-determined levels of performance, and to report progress on the adoption of performance information. The National Monitoring and Evaluation Systems (NMES) contribute to the establishment of a continuous improvement culture in service delivery and feed information into SDG and Agenda 2063 implementation reports. M&E is an effective public administration tool to plan, coordinate, document and share results effectively and timeously, as translated into ministerial/departmental, and sectional <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> M&E systems and plans. The article argues that the capacity of public service human resources is key in the M&E function and agenda. Ethics in M&E processes enhance M&E systems to underpin national priorities and collect information that feeds into M&E of global strategies such as SDGs and Agenda 2063...|$|E

Although, these key issues are not mutually exclusive, the thrust {{of this paper is}} to identify some factors influencing rural employment promotion (REP) in southern Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select 60 rural communities in southern Nigeria. In all, 300 interviewees were sampled and interviewed using structured and unstructured interview schedules. Descriptive statistical techniques such as frequency, percentages, mean and standard deviation, etc. were used to describe and summarise the data collected. Probit analysis was employed to make deductions through the use of STATA package. The result showed a Pseudo R 2 value of 0. 3581, which is quite reasonable for qualitative dependent variable models. At P ≤ 0. 01 level of significance, education (z = 2. 02), farm size (z = 2. 39) positively influenced the drive towards rural employment generation. Also, at P ≤ 0. 01 level, the availability of banking institutions (z = 1. 94) and support from the family members (z = 2. 17) did strongly predict REP. Other predictors of REP were the disaggregated <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>project</b> type/orientation, which are production (z = 1. 67) and service-oriented ventures (z = 1. 98) and they both had strong and positive influence on REP at P ≤ 0. 05 and 0. 01 levels of significance, respectively. The paper concludes that the provision of basic and functional services such as education, health care, water, electricity and motorable roads are vital for rural employment promotion drive in rural communities...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the fundamental constraints of using structured materials to enable cost-effective solar energy devices, both macroporous silicon and reactive ion etched (RIE) silicon pillars have been used as photoelectrodes. Macroporous Si was doped with Au in order to systematically lower the minority carrier diffusion length for the purpose of mimicking devices made from structured low-cost materials. Control over the charge carrier lifetime was demonstrated, with lifetimes between 1 and 15 µs achievable by varying the Au drive-in temperature. Photoelectrochemical measurements in methanol with dimethylferrocene+/ 0 showed significant decreases in both short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) with increasing Au doping. Furthermore, at the highest Au concentrations tested, the porous samples outperformed the planar samples, demonstrating that structuring of the absorber can lead to improvements in charge carrier collection, as expected from computational models.

Two measures of growth efficiency (GE, growth per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> growing space) were examined: stemwood increment (dm 3) per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>projected</b> leaf area (PLA) (m 2) and stemwood increment (dm 3) per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> crown projection area (CPA) (m 2).

O- 2. 0 meters above breast height (BH, 1. 37 m (4. 5 ft)) for each crop tree, and the number and size of branches and the ratio of knots were determined. Volumes of all crop trees were calculated using Smalian's formula (Avery and Burkhart 1994) applied to different geometric forms of the tree to estimate total cubic foot volume from diameter measurements up the tree bole. The efficacy of Honer's (1967) volume equation for estimating total cubic foot volume from diameter at BH (DBH) and total height (THT) was tested by comparing measured values to the estimated values.

40|$|Graduation date: 1981 Seasonal {{variations}} in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) leaf weight and nitrogen content were measured in Oregon's Coast and western Cascade Ranges. Current and older foliage from thinned and unthinned stands were sampled monthly from October, 1978 to September, 1979. Changes in leaf weight per <b>unit</b> area <b>of</b> foliage and percent nitrogen were determined {{in order to}} calculate net changes in nitrogen content of foliage, expressed as grams <b>of</b> nitrogen per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>projected</b> leaf area. Coast Range stands consistently maintained foliage weights around 400 g/m[superscript] 2 with nitrogen contents of 4 - 5 gN/m[superscript] 2. In Cascade stands, foliage weight and total nitrogen fluctuated seasonally. Leaf weights of 200 g/m[superscript] 2 and nitrogen contents of 2 gN/m[superscript] 2 characterized the period from November through March. During summer months, foliage weight and nitrogen content averaged 325 g/m[superscript] 2 and 3 gN/m[superscript] 2, respectively. These findings correlate well with the higher levels of productivity observed in the Coast Range and support views that wintertime photosynthesis there is significant. In response to thinning at the Cascade site, newer foliage increased in weight and nitrogen content. Similar responses were not evident at the Coast Range site which showed little variation in either weight or nitrogen content seasonally...|$|R

40|$|The purpose <b>of</b> this <b>project</b> was {{to develop}} a compact, solar powered {{desalination}} unit that would not only provide fresh drinking water for remote communities, but do so with little attention or maintenance. It follows from Project E 202 in which a pre-production prototype unit was constructed. The Project team recognised that although Reverse Osmosis is the leading technology in the World for brackish water desalination, it is prone to fouling and failures of the technology are common. The development methodology has been driven by the need to reduce the risks of fouling. Accordingly, low recovery ratios are used at reasonably low pressures. The energy recovery system not only makes the low recovery ratio regime economic in terms of energy use, but also facilitates fully automatic start-up and shut-down as well as self-regulation during fluctuating insolation levels. The production units that have been produced differ from the preproduction <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>Project</b> E 202, in that a single cylinder system has been adopted and the valving has been incorporated into the piston head and so is completely internal. While the single cylinder arrangement reduces the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>unit,</b> it dramatically simplifies construction and reduces cost, while the internal valving has all but eliminated the valving slip that plagued Project E 202.

40|$|Since the {{equations}} involved in solving bearing problems are tedious to work with, calculations are most easily {{made by the}} use of bearing performance charts. But still the design of journal bearings is a relatively cumbersome iterative process that involves the use of various data charts and tables, thus leading to time consuming and less accurate results. Therefore, a complete computer-aided design (CAD) procedure covering the basic methods for designing a full hydrodynamic journal bearing of finite length is developed and presented. The theoretical data and relevant empirical charts are collected and presented in appropriate formats. Also, the design variables <b>of</b> load per <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>projected</b> bearing area, and bearing clearance in industrial applications, needed in the bearing design, are derived and incorporated in the design process. However, when designing a bearing for a given application, an infinite number of solutions is possible. Thus, certain limitations are imposed on the values of the bearing performance variables including stability, based on empirical guidelines. Consequently, one may select the solution for optimum conditions, say of maximum load capacity, or the minimum power loss (i. e. minimum friction). Finally, the CAD programme developed and constructed is general, fully automated, flexible, extendable, interactive and friendly to use. King Saud Universit...|$|R
