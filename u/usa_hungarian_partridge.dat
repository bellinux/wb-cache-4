50|$|Upland hunters {{traditionally}} walk when finding game, though quail {{hunters in}} the Southern States often employ hunting buggies or vehicles {{due to the}} sparseness of game.

There are 34 campsites suitable for recreational vehicles, with electricity and water available. An additional 25 primitive sites with drinking water and facilities nearby are available. The park is along the Oregon Trail and offers a covered wagon to rent for camping. The park includes showers, mowed lawns, and wildlife viewing. Hiking and biking opportunities include a trail named for former governor Victor G. Atiyeh that runs along the Deschutes. Hunting is also available for pheasant, chukar, and <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge</b> during designated seasons for each.

40|$|Population {{characteristics}} and seasonal ecological {{requirements of a}} <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge</b> population were determined on a 54 mi 2 area in northeast Teton County, Montana during January, 1969 -April 1974. A total of 2, 873 observations and 17, 736 partridge were recorded. (Cereal grains were major food items with green plant materials and forbs taken in high frequencies but low volumes. Dandelions were the major forb species eaten.) Partridge fed in early morning and late evening, the latter being most important. Pairs were the basic population unit; pairing began annually 7 - 18 February and was complete by 1 March. All observed, marked females and 81 - 83 percent of males paired. Surviving previous-year pairs remained paired and all adults tended to pair within coveys; 67 and 69 percent of subadult males and females, respectively, paired outside their winter coveys. The peak week of nesting was 13 - 19 May and 29 percent of all broods hatched during the peak week, 19 - 25 June. Mean brood sizes decreased 18 percent from time of hatching to observation in July, 21 percent July-August, and 7 percent August-September...|$|R
40|$|Of {{the many}} game birds {{introduced}} to the North American continent only two, the European or <b>Hungarian</b> <b>partridge,</b> Perdix perdix, and the ring-necked pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, have been successful thus far. Recent introductions of the chukar partridge, Alectoris graeca, also show promise of being successful. The {{pros and cons of}} animal introductions have been discussed in a number of papers. It is definitely true that rabbits in Australia, starlings in America and the mongoose in Hawaii have become pests. But the garre birds introduced in North America cannot fairly be classed as pests; they have been welcomed {{in a number of states}} and provinces; actually partridges and pheasants have completely altered the hunting picture in many areas, and it is difficult to realize the amount of hunting left if these birds were removed. King (1942), although generally opposed to the introduction of the partridge and the pheasant in America, mentions that probably 90 percent of the upland bird shooting in Oregon is produced by the partridge and pheasant; and the importance of the pheasant as a game bird in the cornbelt needs no elaboration...|$|R

40|$|The study {{introduces}} a Hungarian economic thinker, István Varga, whose valuable activity has remained unexplored up to now. He became an economic thinker during the 1920 s, {{in a country}} that had not long before become independent of Austria. The role played by Austria in the modern economic thinking of that time was a form of competition with the thought adhered to by the UK and the <b>USA.</b> <b>Hungarian</b> economists mainly interpreted and commented on German and Austrian theories, reasons for this being that, for example, the majority of Hungarian economists had studied at German and Austrian universities, while at Hungarian universities principally German and Austrian economic theories were taught. István Varga was familiar not only with contemporary German economics but with the new ideas of Anglo-Saxon economics as well - and he introduced these ideas into Hungarian economic thinking. He lived and worked in turbulent times, and historians have only been able to appreciate his activity in a limited manner. The work of this excellent economist has all but been forgotten, although he was of international stature. After a brief summary of Varga's profile the study will demonstrate the lasting influence he has had in four areas - namely, business cycle research and national income estimations, the 1946 Hungarian stabilisation program, corporate profit, and consumption economics  - and will go on to summarise his most important achievements...|$|R
40|$|There are {{numerous}} {{signs of the}} emergence of global imbalances in world economy. This is reflected by the fact that of the developed countries the USA is producing a substantial, historically unprecedented magnitude of current account deficit vis-a-vis the current account surplus of a well-defined group of mainly emerging countries and of some developed countries. This is probably not an optimal situation, {{and in the course of}} solving this problem there is the question of what impacts the Hungarian economy may be exposed to and what steps Hungarian monetary policy can take. In examining the various scenarios of global adjustment, it is important to distinguish between an adjustment originating in Asia or in the USA. The former stimulates the Hungarian economy, while the latter temporarily hinders the Hungarian economy. A correction triggered by the markets has stronger output consequences for the Hungarian economy, than that of a restrictive fiscal policy in the <b>USA.</b> <b>Hungarian</b> monetary policy has an effect on whether output or inflation will become more volatile. Hungarian monetary policy tracking the ECB involves higher fluctuations in inflation and lower changes in GDP, whereas the situation is just the opposite in case of independent policies. If the exchange rate of the forint weakens due to a decline in global risk appetite, this would initially result in growing inflation, although over the longer term even lower GDP and inflation cannot be ruled out either. global imbalance, current account adjustment, forcasting, simulation. ...|$|R

Moreover, there were Hungarian actresses who were great stars in Nazi Germany (notably Marika Rökk and Clara Tabody) and who participated in propaganda films throughout the war; yet they never had to face charges for their political activity, continued their film careers after the war and are still admired and recognized today as major screen stars of the past.|$|R
