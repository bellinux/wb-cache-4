50|$|Research in {{learning}} automata {{can be traced}} back to the work of Tsetlin in the early 1960s in the Soviet Union.

Additionally, Tsetlin worked on reasonable and collective automata behaviour, and on automata games. Learning automata were also investigated by researches in the United States in the 1960s. However, the term learning automaton was not used until Narendra and Thathachar introduced it in a survey paper in 1974.|$|E

In general, the independent variable can be a scalar, a vector, or a matrix while the dependent variable can be any of these as well. Each different situation will lead to a different set of rules, or a separate calculus, using the broader sense of the term. Matrix notation serves as a convenient way to collect the many derivatives in an organized way.|$|E
