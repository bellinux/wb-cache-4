5000|$|The {{passing of}} the <b>Unremunerated</b> <b>Work</b> Act, 1995 which allows for the {{counting}} of unwaged work in national statistics. This made Trinidad and Tobago {{one of the first}} countries in the world to pass such legislation and the Trinidad and Tobago language being used as the model for the Beijing Declaration on Women.|$|E
50|$|For example, The <b>Unremunerated</b> <b>Work</b> Act of 1993 {{would require}} the Bureau of Labor Statistics to conduct surveys that would measure unpaid labor and include these {{measures}} in the GDP. This bill was supported by many but not all feminist economists. Critics argue that this bill would romanticize care work and propagate gender biases in the field. Other critics argue that care work can be performed more efficiently outside the home. Finally, some critics believe that this would create a move for care givers to value efficiency over affection, quantity and quality.|$|E
5000|$|Also, {{the amount}} of unpaid, {{voluntary}} and housework labour performed outside the world of business and industry, as revealed by time use surveys, suggests to some feminists (e.g. Marilyn Waring and Maria Mies) that Marxists may have overrated the importance of industrial surplus labour performed by salaried employees, because the very ability to perform that surplus-labour, i.e. the continual reproduction of labour power depends {{on all kinds of}} supports involving <b>unremunerated</b> <b>work</b> (for a theoretical discussion, see the reader by Bonnie Fox). In other words, work performed in households [...] - [...] often by those who do not sell their labour power to capitalist enterprises at all [...] - [...] contributes to the sustenance of capitalist workers who may perform little household labour.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this essay, I {{introduce}} {{the figure of}} the “neoliberal subject of value ” to explore the affective ambiguities of what Tiziana Terranova has termed “free labor, ” or the voluntary, unwaged, and exploited activities that generate the digital data, content, and connections central to informational capitalism. If, as Terranova argues, free labor is characterized by exhaustion — {{due to the lack of}} means by which this labor can sustain itself — why are millions of people still sustaining a commitment to such pervasive modes of <b>unremunerated</b> <b>work?</b> To formulate an answer to this question, I first turn to the neoliberal theory of human capital, which offers a more fruitful avenue for the analysis of digitally mediated “living labor ” than the Autonomist Marxist theory that inspired Terranova’s analysis, by elucidating how a logic based on competition, entrepreneurialism, and speculation has transformed how work is understood and valued. Second, I discuss the central role of commensuration within capitalist value production, arguin...|$|E
40|$|Official {{statistics}} show {{that there are more}} economically active men than women (80 % versus 50 % in 2006) {{and that there is a}} gender differential in employment status (74 % for men versus 46 % for women in 2005). Are women then contributing less to the economy than men? Is the gender disparity for real or do these statistics mask the true worth of women? Can we achieve the MDG no. 3 on the promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women? Accurate and adequate information on women’s economic participation are obviously needed to respond to these questions and to guide the government in crafting more effective economic, social and environmental policies that are responsive to women. However, towards a more meaningful measurement of the contribution of women to the Philippine economy, action is needed from many stakeholders. Unfortunately, twelve years after the Beijing Platform for Action which made specific recommendations on the possible reflection of <b>unremunerated</b> <b>work</b> in the system of national accounts, very little has happened. For instance, the 2004 - 2010 Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan does no...|$|E
40|$|The {{portrayal}} of war The human cost {{of war is}} something with which all readers of this volume are familiar, albeit vicariously. The international media bring the images of war right into our own homes. The protagonists in these representations are almost exclusively male – soldiers, diplomats, politicians. By contrast, women are assigned one of two supporting roles: either the helpless victim caught in the crossfire, or the pillar of strength in adversity. The men do the talking and strategizing; the women suffer and struggle in the background. The implicit message of this narrative is clear. When conflict breaks out, men prosecute war to defend the homeland, while women bind the social wounds and keep the home fires burning. The statistics are well known, and may {{no longer have the}} power to shock: contemporary wars are fought out not on demarcated battlefields, but in the towns, villages, and homes of ordinary people. The fact that 90 per cent of today’s war casualties are civilians, and the fact that four out of five refugees and displaced persons are women and children [...] . are so often quoted that we hardly stop to think about what they mean. (Eade 1996 : 5) To these, we can add that one-fifth of humanity survives on less than a dollar a day, and that two-thirds of the world’s poorest people are women, as are two-thirds of adults who cannot read and write. Women perform most of the <b>unremunerated</b> <b>work</b> in the ‘hidden economy’, and are disproportionately represented among the world’s ‘working poor’, with lower average earnings than men in every country in the world, significantly so in some. It goes without saying, then, that most of those who become homeless, stateless, and penniless as a result of armed conflict are women (Eade 2001) ...|$|E
