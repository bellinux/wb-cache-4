40|$|The {{spread of}} {{value-added}} tax (VAT) {{in developing countries}} has been dramatic {{since the beginning of}} 1990 ’s. Adopted by more than 130 countries, including many of the poorest, VAT has been, and remains, the key of tax reform in many developing countries. While adopting VAT, there are arguments for and against <b>uniform</b> general <b>VAT</b> system. A <b>uniform</b> and general <b>VAT</b> on all commodities is considered to be efficient and less distortionary. On the other hand, from the distributional perspective many goods especially food is exempted from VAT as low income households spend a high share of income on food. The contribution {{of this study is to}} analyze the income distribution and welfare impact of VAT reform when the food sectors are divided into local markets and supermarkets. A Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model is used to evaluate the consequences of VAT reforms for Bangladesh.

Its purpose is expositional: to describe the DBCFT, how it might work, what its effects would be and some of the challenges that its implementation would face. The paper starts by introducing the basic mechanics of the DBCFT before evaluating it against five criteria: economic efficiency, robustness to avoidance and evasion, ease of administration, fairness and stability. It does so both for the case of universal adoption by all countries and the more plausible case of unilateral adoption. The paper then looks closely at the application of DBCFT treatment to the financial sector, which is a familiar problem under the VAT but has been little considered under the DBCFT. Finally, the paper sets out some core implementation issues, and how they might be addressed. It also compares the implementation of a DBCFT with the economically equivalent reform option that introduces a broad-based, <b>uniform</b> rate <b>VAT</b> (or achieves the same effect through an existing VAT), and reduces taxes on payroll by the same proportion...|$|R

40|$|Establishing a <b>uniform</b> 15 % <b>VAT</b> {{rate for}} every good and service subject to this tax would {{generate}} additional fiscal resources of, at least, 81. 2 billion pesos. The approximate cost of granting an exact {{compensation for the}} first three quartiles of the income distribution (in case of considering this as target population) for the impact of such measure—under the pessimistic assumption that 75 % of the increase in VAT rates is transferred to prices—to the first three quartiles of income distribution (considered as the target population) would amount to 32. 5 billion pesos. The measure would therefore generate 48. 7 billion pesos worth of net resources for the three levels of government (federal government, states and municipalities). In fact, it is possible to overcompensate part of the low-income population, and even the entire low-income population, and yet generate available net resources by making the VAT reform simultaneously revenue-raising and redistributive. This is independent from the destination of the net resources received by the three levels of government. If, at least, part of those resources is channeled towards social programs, the redistributive impact of such reform is strengthened.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects on}} the degree of {{equality}} of reforms in indirect taxation are analysed by using a microsimulation model of the Norwegian economy subsequent to a CGE model. The two main reforms studied are substitution of a <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT</b> rate on all goods and services and substitution of the non-uniform Norwegian VAT reform of 2001 for the previous, differentiated system. A main characteristic of the non-uniform reform is the halving of the VAT rate on food. All reforms are made public revenue neutral by changes in the VAT rate. Producer prices, pre-tax nominal incomes, wealth and transfers are all exogenous in the microsimulation model. In this paper we feed percentage changes in corresponding variables from the CGE model into the microsimulation model in order to enrich the microsimulation analyses. The non-uniform VAT reform leads to a clear increase in equality while the change in equality concerning the uniform reform is close to 0. With the <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT</b> reform, as opposed to the non-uniform, decompositions show that taking CGE effects into account has a large impact {{on the degree of}} equality. Changed producer prices and changed pre-tax nominal incomes, wealth and transfers both contribute to this.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} import tariffs and tariff-replacing indirect taxes on the welfare of households grouped by the size distribution of income. A computable general equilibrium model for Bangladesh is simulated to examine the removal of quantitative restrictions and tariffs {{as well as the}} replacement of trade taxes with a value added tax (VAT). Import liberalization alone expands the manufacturing sector and increases the welfare of lower income households. If a <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT</b> is placed on both imports and all non-agricultural production in order to replace the lost tariff revenue for the government, some of the gains from import liberalization are diminished. If exports are exempted from the VAT, the gains are sustained to a greater degree. With a combination of tariff liberalization, quota markups, and the VAT, the economy goes through a contraction and the welfare of all households is reduced.

40|$|Following the {{adoption}} {{by the international}} community of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approach, which provides the basis for concessional lending by the multilateral institutions, there has been a resurgence of interest in the poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of different policy reforms being considered by the low income countries. This paper reviews some of the major techniques and frameworks for assessing the PSIA. It highlights their strengths and weaknesses and suggests a relatively simple analytical framework for the PSIA based on household survey data. The paper then shows how the suggested framework could be utilized to investigate the poverty/income distributional implications of introducing a value-added tax (VAT). The results indicate that a revenue-neutral <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT</b> is regressive in its impact on different households. In order to mitigate the adverse impact, the paper explores the distributional impact of an alternative policy package consisting of a basic rate of VAT with exemptions and excise taxes for certain commodity groups chosen {{on the basis of their}} distributional characteristics. The distributional consequences of the alternative package are found to be superior to those of the <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT.</b> Value added tax;Tax reforms;Economic models;expenditure, household groups, incidence analysis, distributional impact, impact analysis, reform package, social impact analysis, linear expenditure system, total expenditure, household expenditure, impact of policy, expenditure survey, consumption expenditure, household survey data, household survey, household income, analytical framework, expenditure survey data, behavioral response, changes in prices, income groups, expenditures, poverty reduction strategy, public expenditure, income levels, poverty reduction strategy paper, social impact of policy, household data, distributional consequences, poverty line, impact of tax, income distribution, input-output, change in government, public spending, expenditure programs, social analysis, macroeconomic framework for poverty reduction strategy, expenditure data, distributional issues, expenditure groups, expenditure pattern, macroeconomic framework, public expenditures, consumption patterns, direct impact, impact of policy change, impact of policy changes, government expenditure, macroeconomic policies to poverty, analytical frameworks, impact of policy reforms, analytical issues, distribution of income, expenditure share, household size, distributional impacts, expenditure level, poverty outcomes, distributional implications, general equilibrium model, expenditure policy, poverty analysis, data requirements, social expenditures, econometric techniques...|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the {{consequences}} of two alternative ways of raising funds to finance poverty alleviation programs in Mexico: A Value Added Tax (VAT) reform and a personal income tax reform (IT). The impact of the reforms is analyzed with an applied general equilibrium model of the Mexican economy, calibrated using a 1996 Social Accounting Matrix. The model includes 18 production sectors, 10 representative households, the government, and the rest of the world. The cash transfers required to attain a fixed increase in the Equivalent Variation (EV) of the lowest income households are obtained either increasing effective VAT rates or IT rates. When all rates are scaled up by the same factor, the VAT reform generates a positive global EV considerably larger than the one obtained scaling the IT rates, though the latter diminishes (increases) lower (higher) income households’ contribution. Setting a <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT</b> rate results in a positive global EV considerably larger than the one obtained with a uniform IT. Moreover, the distribution gap increases in the latter case since the richest households receive the largest benefits. poverty alleviation, tax reforms, social accounting matrix, applied general equilibrium, equivalent variation...|$|E
40|$|Microsimulation {{models are}} apt to be the {{preferred}} instrument when applied, equality analyses of tax reforms in specific economies are undertaken. However, most of these models ignore general equilibrium effects, like changes in prices, and may therefore miss valuable information because of their partial nature. In this paper we combine a microsimulation model and a CGE model through feeding of CGE results on producer prices, pre-tax nominal incomes, wealth and transfers into the microsimulation model. The two main reforms studied are substitution of a <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT</b> rate on all goods and services (called the general VAT reform) and substitution of the non-uniform Norwegian VAT reform of 2001 (called the political VAT reform) for the previous, differentiated system. We find {{that the degree of}} equality is clearly increased with the political VAT reform and unchanged with the general VAT reform. Comparing these results with the case where CGE effects are not taken into account, i. e. a "traditional" microsimulation analysis, we find that equality is still increased with the political VAT reform while equality is now also increased with the general VAT reform instead of being unchangedmicro-macro links, indirect taxation, VAT reforms, Equality...|$|E
40|$|The {{proposal}} by Levy (2008) whereby a universal social insurance (USI) scheme {{is guaranteed to}} all workers, regardless of formality status, aims at abolishing the current contributory social insurance system and financing social insurance through value-added taxes instead (henceforth, the social security reform). We argue {{that this is a}} major reform as it breaks down the duality present in social insurance policy in Mexico and other Latin American countries {{and put an end to}} both informality and the truncated welfare state problem, in the sense that all workers would be covered by the same regulations with regard to social insurance. The model is calibrated for the Mexican economy, as this country is characterized by a large informal sector, high rates of tax evasion, and a knotty tax system, including differentiated rates on value-added taxes. In particular, we estimate the hypothetical cost of such scheme for 2008 as well as the extra revenues generated after imposing a <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT</b> rate of 16 percent. These calculations are based on a static general equilibrium model, which takes into account the change in firms¿ behavior in a tax evasion framework. The results suggest that the USI scheme is financially viable, even after taking into account a compensatory transfer to poor households as a result of the VAT increase. In addition, real wages in the formal sector might increase by 15 percent as a result of USI. This number should be interpreted as an upper bound estimate, given that the model assumes an inelastic labor supply. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is to analyze the impact of policy {{interventions}} such as financing human development (HD), tax reform and conditional cash transfer programmes, under the framework of growth and sustainable development. These policy instruments are evaluated {{through the application of}} both partial and general equilibrium models, and the last paper concentrates on developing regional social accounting matrices (SAMs) as a core database for spatial general equilibrium modelling. Essay 1 : Trade-offs in Achieving Human Development Goals for Bangladesh investigates the benefits and costs associated with alternative investment financing options for achieving HD goals by applying the MAMS (Maquette for Millennium Development Goals Studies) model. We find that full achievement of these goals would have led to a GDP loss that would have been significantly larger in the domestic borrowing scenario than in the tax scenario. The tax-financing alternative is thus the better option for financing large development programs. In terms of public spending composition, we find that, under some circumstances, a trade-off arises between overall Millennium Development Goal (MDG) progress and poverty reduction. Essay 2 : Welfare impact of broadening VAT by exempting Small-Scale food markets: The case of Bangladesh analyses the welfare impacts of different VAT reforms. A general and <b>uniform</b> <b>VAT</b> on all commodities is preferred as it is more efficient and less administratively costly. However, due to equity concerns, food is normally exempted from VAT. On the other hand, exemptions on food mean that an implicit subsidy is provided to high-income households. Hence, we analyze a broad-based VAT regime with a high threshold that excludes small-scale operators (where the low-income households buy their products most, including food) and the simulation result shows that welfare improves for the low-income households. Essay 3 : Effect of Girls’ Secondary School Stipend on Completed Schooling and Age at Marriage: Evidence from Bangladesh estimates the effect of a conditional cash transfer programme on education and age at marriage. We apply both difference in differences (DiD) and regression discontinuity methods to evaluate the impact of the policy instrument. Our estimation results show that the girls in the treatment group who were exposed to the programme had a higher average number of completed years of schooling and also delayed their first marriage compared to the girls in the control group. We also show that the DiD approach might produce a biased result as it does not consider the convergence effect.

The methodology makes possible the construction of regional SAMs that are consistent with official regional accounts and minimize deviations from transport data...|$|E
