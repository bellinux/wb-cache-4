40|$|The {{condition}} of eccentric discharge {{is known to}} be one of the most critical for the design of thin-walled cylindrical metal silos. Significant progress has been made in recent years in devising a relatively realistic set of representative pressures for this load case. However, the consequences these may have on the predicted structural behavior <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>silo</b> are not yet fully understood. This paper presents a detailed parametric study into the behavior <b>of</b> <b>a</b> custom-designed slender <b>silo</b> under <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> unsymmetrical pressures describing the action <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eccentric parallel-sided pipe flow channel of varying cross-sectional areas. The results are compared with the reference axisymmetric case of concentric discharge. It is found that the predicted behavior is very complex indeed, and that geometric nonlinearity is of much greater significance for cylindrical shells under unsymmetrical load patterns than under symmetrical patterns. Further, it is found that eigenmodeaffine imperfections, which are very deleterious under axisymmetric loading patterns, are instead beneficial to the buckling strength <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>silo</b> under eccentric discharge, thus making them unsuitable for use in design for this load condition.. 0000530. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers...|$|R

50|$|The {{two main}} {{problems}} which will necessitate silo cleaning in dry-matter silos and bins are bridging and rat-holing. Bridging {{occurs when the}} material interlaces over the unloading mechanism {{at the base of}} the silo and blocks the flow of stored material by gravity into the unloading system. Rat-holing occurs when the material starts to adhere to the side of the silo. This will reduce the operating capacity <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>silo</b> as well as leading to cross-contamination of newer material with older material. There are <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> ways to clean <b>a</b> <b>silo</b> and many <b>of</b> these carry their own risks. However, since the early 1990s acoustic cleaners have become available.
