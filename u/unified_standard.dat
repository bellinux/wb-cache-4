25|$|In Sweden {{the concept}} of a <b>unified</b> <b>standard</b> {{language}} based on a high prestige dialect spoken in the capital region was primarily understood in terms of the written language as exemplified with the Swedification of the Danish and Norwegian provinces that were acquired in the 17th century. The people were taught Swedish hymns and prayers, but with a phonology that remained largely Danish or Norwegian.|$|E
2500|$|Unified English Braille (UEB) is an {{attempted}} <b>unified</b> <b>standard</b> for English Braille, proposed in 1991 to the Braille Authority of North America (BANA). The motivation for UEB {{was that the}} proliferation of specialized braille codes—which sometimes assigned conflicting values to even basic letters and numbers—was threatening not just braille-literacy, but also the viability of English braille itself. Also, the irregularities of English Braille made automated transcription inaccurate, and therefore increased the cost and time required to print in braille. In 1993, the UEB project {{was adopted by the}} International Council on English Braille, and expanded to cover the various national systems of the member states: [...] Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Nigeria, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. An additional goal became adoption of a single standard for all braille encoding, apart from music; with the exception of math-notation, this was largely achieved. [...] New Zealand officially retains Maori Braille as compatible with UEB, and BANA officially retains Nemeth Code as a math-notation option alongside UEB for the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Following a {{referendum}} on March 10, 1996, Romansh was recognized as a partial official language of Switzerland alongside German, French, and Italian in article 70 of the federal constitution. According to the article, German, French, Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh are national languages of Switzerland. The official languages are declared to be German, French, and Italian, and Rhaeto-Romansh is an official language for correspondence with Romansh-speaking people. This means that in principle, {{it is possible to}} address the federal administration in Romansh and receive an answer in the same language. In what the Federal Culture Office itself admits is [...] "more a placatory and symbolic use" [...] of Romansh, the federal authorities occasionally translate some official texts into Romansh. In general, though, demand for Romansh-language services is low because, according to the Federal Culture Office, Romansh speakers may either dislike the official Rumantsch Grischun idiom or prefer to use German in the first place, as most are perfectly bilingual. Without a <b>unified</b> <b>standard</b> language, the status of an official language of the Swiss Confederation would not have been conferred to Romansh. It takes time and needs to be promoted to get implemented in this new function.|$|E
