50|$|The {{primary means}} of {{financing}} the International Monetary Fund is through members' quotas. Each member of the IMF is assigned a quota, part of which is payable in SDRs or specified <b>usable</b> <b>currencies</b> ("reserve assets"), and part in the member's own currency. The difference between a member's quota and the IMF's holdings of its currency is a country's Reserve Tranche Position (RTP). Reserve Tranche Position is accounted among a country's foreign-exchange reserves.|$|E
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the global {{financial}} crisis, there has been increased interest in the IMF’s SDR, which was created in 1969 “to meet the need, as and when it arises, for a supplement to existing re-serve assets. ” However, despite support over time from a number of senior political leaders and leading academics, the SDR has never come close to achieving a status anywhere near that of “the principal reserve asset in the international monetary system ” en-visaged in the IMF’s Articles of Agreement (IMF 1944, Article VIII, Section 7). This note describes the renewed interest in the SDR and assesses the SDR’s prospects to contribute to greater stability in the international monetary system. What Is the SDR? A good place to start is with what the SDR is not. It is not a cur-rency, nor is it a claim on the IMF. Instead, it is a potential claim on the “freely <b>usable</b> <b>currencies</b> ” of IMF members. The “cre...|$|E
40|$|As an {{official}} multilateral lending agency, the IMF has {{a daunting task}} to keep its finances in balance. Its mandate requires it to lend to countries in difficult financial straits after private sector lenders have pulled out and official bilateral lenders have become wary of the risks. In the 1990 s, the rapid growth and increasing complexity and instability {{of international trade and}} capital flows raised the stakes immensely. The value of world trade more than doubled from the 1980 s to the 1990 s. The aggregate current account deficit of all deficit countries rose from $ 223 billion a year in the 1980 s to $ 366 billion in the 1990 s. The size and volatility of international financial flows grew much more rapidly. In response, IMF credit outstanding rose from $ 28 billion to $ 41 billion. Despite the size of new lending, the Fund was covering a smaller portion of its members ’ financial needs. Raising the capital to keep this contribution from shrinking further provided a constant challenge throughout the decade. The Financial Evolution of the IMF The IMF began life in 1946 as a single fund: a pool of financial resources deposited by its member countries, mostly in the form of gold, U. S. dollars, and countries ’ own currencies. Those nondollar currency balances were {{a major part of the}} IMF’s assets, even though they were—at the time—not traded or convertible internationally and therefore not usable for IMF lending. Over time, the number of “usable currencies” gradually grew. The financial assets of what eventually became the General Depart-ment of the IMF comprised gold, <b>usable</b> <b>currencies,</b> and other currencies. The First Amendment of the Articles of Agreement, adopted in 1969, enabled the IMF to allocate (i. e., issue) special drawing rights (SDRs) through a separate SDR Department, which then had its own balance sheet. 1 Beginning in 1976, the IMF 1 The division of the IMF’s accounts into separate “departments ” (General and SDR) should not be confused with the organizational division into area and functional departments such as the African Department and the Fiscal Affairs Department. The two concepts are completely independent...|$|E

Members are able to give other members Zoops for their videos, photos, music, blogs and profiles. Each Zoop was worth $0.01 U.S. Capazoo provided their subscribed members with a debit card enabling them to turn their accumulated Zoops into <b>usable</b> <b>currency.</b> Capazoo also had a referral program that let members earn Zoops by referring new members to the site.|$|R
50|$|Central banks {{routinely}} {{collect and}} destroy worn-out {{coins and banknotes}} in exchange for new ones. This {{does not affect the}} money supply, and is done to maintain a healthy population of <b>usable</b> <b>currency.</b> The practice raises an interesting possibility. If an individual can steal the money before it is incinerated, the effect is the opposite of burning money; the thief is enriched {{at the expense of the}} rest of society. One such incident at the Bank of England inspired the 2001 TV movie Hot Money and the 2008 film Mad Money.|$|R
50|$|Cause-related loyalty {{marketing}} {{is a recent}} trend in cause marketing. As the name implies, CLM is the marriage of cause marketing and loyalty programs. Cause marketing occurs when for-profit companies join forces with nonprofits to promote a cause. Recent examples include Nike, Inc. partnering with Livestrong, athlete Lance Armstrong’s cancer-fighting foundation, and Eastman Kodak teaming with stationery designer Bonnie Marcus in support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. CLM, however, takes these donations and corporate social responsibility efforts one step further, wedding them to thousands of customer loyalty programs. Rather than requiring the outlay of funds from donors, CLM essentially “recycles” loyalty program members’ unused points or miles. It then converts them into <b>usable</b> <b>currency</b> for a cause of the loyalty members’ choosing.|$|R

The player controls Axys with third-person perspective, who can navigate through levels (running, jumping, climbing, hanging), attack enemies (with swords or by firing RPG-style magic-like projectiles), solve level puzzles (slide puzzles, hangman-style word puzzle), obtain collectable gems (<b>usable</b> as <b>currency),</b> and rescue NPC penguins.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to use numismatic {{evidence}} to help understand the political aims and achievements of the Viking kings of York, c. 895 - 954. A variety of numismatic techniques will be used and tested for their suitability {{as a means of}} historical enquiry. Due to the limitations of the documentary sources for this period, coins will be used to provide an insight into the political workings of this kingdom. Firstly, the iconography and epigraphy of coins made in Viking York will be used to investigate how the Viking kings attempted to legitimise their rule. Secondly, it will be asked whether these coins were produced in sufficient quantity to form a <b>usable</b> <b>currency</b> and how the volumes of these currencies compare with other contemporary coinages, such as those issued by the Anglo-Saxons. Thirdly, to understand where the Vikings ruled and how effectively they could impose coin-use upon their kingdom, the economic influence of the Viking Kingdom of York will be examined by studying the distribution of the coins which were made both in York, and in other kingdoms. Finally, the ways in which coins and other forms of money, such as hacksilver, were used within and between Viking kingdoms will be examined to understand how effectively the Viking kings ruled their economy. It is hoped that this will reveal and refine existing knowledge {{about the ways in which}} the kings of York gained and maintained political power in York for much of the tenth century. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{peer-to-peer}} complementary currency can be {{a powerful}} tool for promoting exchanges and building relationships for coordinated activities. i-WAT[11] is a proposed such <b>currency</b> <b>usable</b> on the Internet. It is based on the WAT System[15], a polycentric complementary currency using WAT tickets as its media of exchange: participants spontaneously issue and circulate the tickets as needed, whose values are backed up by chains of trust. i-WAT implements the tickets electronically by exchanging messages signed in OpenPGP[3]. This paper proposes an extension to the design of i-WAT to facilitate mutual help among people in need. In particular, we propose additional “reduction ” tickets whose values are reduced over time. By deferring redemption of such tickets, the participants can contribute to reduce the debts of the issuers, as well as to accelerate spending. Applications of this feature include a relief to disaster-affected people. A reference implementation of i-WAT has been developed {{in the form of a}} plug-in for an XMPP[6][7] instant messaging client. We have been putting the currency system into practical use, to which the proposed feature will be added shortly...|$|R
40|$|The {{conservative}} economics of'Josep Pla {{start with}} a society where individual's act, decide and choose. Individuals must have the maximum capacity to choose in morality and in economics. In contrast State bureaucrats and the megalomaniacs of 'Leviathan want to direct the economy. There is a constant battle between nature and culture, that is memory, the basis of' civilisation. Revolutions coopt nature as agents of destruction showing the vulnerability of culture. Civilisation is order against disorder. Capitalism is the most appropiate system for humanity. Through wealth individual freedom is guaranteed. Capitalism is efficient and productive, while socialism may seem adequate but is inefficient. Wealth cannot be given away, it is created. The first duty of 'a liberal is to defend the wealth of a country against the omnipotent State. The only clear human economic law is supply and demand. This is normality. When markets decline, hunger beckons. Europe without the Renaissance and the bourgeoisie would be a desert. There is no institution as human as private property and the market. The last thing that will die the is individualism. Pla believed in Keynes but abandoned him when he realised Keynes was inflationary. Pla values the price of money {{as the most important}} event in human life. The rise of Hitler was the product of' inflation. Pla goes even further identifiying socialism and inflation. The price of money has led to the collapse of all revolutions and reactions. In a normal consolidated society the first duty of citizens is to demand that politicians maintain a <b>usable</b> and efficient <b>currency.</b> The price of money is the foundation of practical morality, the only one possible. The great metastasis of the century has been Marxism. Pla says he has great respect for socialism because it is always wrong, systematically. Communism is the childiest version of rationalism. Shortcuts lead to darkness. Society is a fragile base which requires constant awareness of ethics and reality. Freedom is not natural and civilisation is a protective varnish against barbarism. The intellectual fascination with absolutes has sacrificed entire generations to utopias. The abuse of rationalism concentrates on social imperfections, but individuals are imperfect by definition. Survivors, not heroes, remain, in old and civilised countries...|$|R
