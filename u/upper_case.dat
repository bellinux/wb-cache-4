25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{class or}} equipment codes letters (<b>upper</b> <b>case),</b> {{as well as}} the traction type code letters (lower case), are as described above, according to the old scheme, and continue to precede the UIC number (RABDe or Re 460).|$|E
25|$|There are no lower or <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> letters, but {{the first}} letter of a proper name was often written a bit larger. Though the Unicode {{standard}} has upper and lowercase letters, which are same shaped, the difference is only their size.|$|E

50|$|On 5 October 1998, the ITV logo {{was changed}} to a lower cased blue and yellow affair. This was {{in line with the}} fact that, with the <b>upper</b> <b>cased</b> ITV logo used previously, the viewer {{perception}} of ITV was a high brow stuffy channel, not aimed at younger audiences. ITV changed the logo to seem friendlier and more welcoming to younger audiences.|$|R

25|$|On 1 August 2017 the {{styling and}} logo were changed. The logo is now all {{lowercase}} and other uses of 'ARM' are in sentence case except where the whole sentence is <b>upper</b> <b>case,</b> so, for instance, {{it is now}} 'Arm Holdings'.|$|E
25|$|Using this scheme, an eight-character human-selected {{password}} without <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> {{letters and}} non-alphabetic characters {{is estimated to}} have 18 bits of entropy.

25|$|The {{forms of}} the Latin {{alphabet}} used during the Classical period did not distinguish between <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> and lower case. Roman inscriptions typically use Roman square capitals, which resemble modern capitals, and handwritten text often uses old Roman cursive, which includes letterforms similar to modern lowercase.|$|E
25|$|Diesel-{{electric}} {{and electric}} locomotive classifications originally consisted of an upper-case D or E respectively {{followed by a}} second and sometimes a third (sub-class) letter. The second and third letters are sometimes represented as smaller-sized <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> (for example, as seen on many locomotive cab-side number plates).|$|E

25|$|A {{consensus}} {{classification of}} the known Eastern Algonquian languages and dialects by Goddard (1996) is given below with some emendation, for example treatment of Massachusett and Narragansett as distinct languages. In the case of poorly attested languages, particularly in southern New England, conclusive classification of written records as representing separate languages or dialects may be ultimately impossible. Headings in <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> denote proposed subgroups within Eastern Algonquian.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, Professor James Woodward, {{co-director of}} the Centre for Sign Linguistics and Deaf Studies at the Chinese University of Hong Kong since 2004, {{proposed}} a distinction between deafness and the Deaf culture.

25|$|In the {{numbering}} system introduced by J. Collingwood Bruce in 1930, Turrets were numbered after the Milecastle located {{to the east}} of the turret. The nearest turret to the milecastle is suffixed by 'A', and the other turret by 'B'. For example, travelling west from Milecastle 33, the first Turret encountered would be Turret 33A, and the second would be Turret 33B. Both lower and <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> 'A' and 'B' suffixes are in widespread use, and the full name is often abbreviated to (for example) 'T33a'.|$|E
25|$|All ULDs are {{identified}} by their ULD number. A three-letter prefix identifies its type, {{followed by a}} 4 or 5 digit serial number (4 if prior to October 1, 1993; either 4 or 5 if after October 1, 1993) to uniquely identify it from others of the same type, and ending with a two character (alpha-numerical) suffix identifying the ULD's owner (if an airline, often the same as IATA designator codes). For example, AKN 12345 DL means that the ULD is a forkliftable LD3 with the unique number 12345 and its owner is Delta Air Lines. IATA uses three letter codes (in <b>upper</b> <b>case</b> letters) to describe key characteristics of ULDs.|$|E
