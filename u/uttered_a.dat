5|$|In week six, on Day 39, Big Brother told Siavash and Dogface that, {{because they}} had {{discussed}} nominations earlier in the week, they would face eviction if they <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> single profanity before 3 p.m. They both failed and therefore faced the public vote, along with Karly and Noirin who received the most nominations. The shopping task consisted of nine separate challenges from previous editions of Big Brother, in which housemates had to compete against former contestants (see the week seven shopping task section). The housemates failed to pass the required number of challenges and therefore failed the overall task. On Day 44, five new housemates, Kenneth, Bea, David, Hira and Tom entered the House and Karly became the seventh person to be evicted with 50.4% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} {{has also made}} several parodic cameo and homage appearances in non-Disney media. In the 1945 radio program This Is My Best, the Queen <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> curse so dreadful that the Magic Mirror shattered into a thousand pieces and where the Queen once stood {{was nothing but a}} heap of ashes from which black spiders crawled and scuffled off into the night. In Woody Allen's live-action film Annie Hall (1977), Alvy mentions that when he saw Disney's Snow White, he was attracted to the Queen while all the other children had a crush on Snow White. This is followed by an animated sequence of the Wicked Queen, resembling Annie and voiced by Diane Keaton, talking to the cartoon version of the daydreaming Alvy, but turns out that even the Queen scolds him; Alvy attributes it to her having her period mood, to which the Queen reminds him she is just a cartoon character.|$|E
25|$|Schörner {{was said}} to never have <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> word of praise, and would demote or punitively {{transfer}} soldiers on the spot for the most minor infractions, even as the war was ending. Bidermann was especially bitter that while Schörner's men were marched off to die in Soviet POW camps at the cessation of hostilities, Schörner made certain that he personally avoided their fate. When captured by the Americans in their sector, Schörner {{is said to have}} been dressed as a Bavarian non-combatant, behavior for which he had only recently had his own soldiers executed.|$|E

40|$|Thomas Bradwardine, an Archbishop of Canterbury {{and one of}} {{the great}} logicians of the fourteenth century devised a novel {{approach}} to the Liar paradox, the upshot of which is that someone <b>uttering</b> <b>a</b> Liar sentence fails to speak the truth. But does this mean that that person <b>utters</b> <b>a</b> falsity, as Bradwardine claims, or that the speaker fails to <b>utter</b> <b>a</b> falsity as well as failing to <b>utter</b> <b>a</b> truth? An author writing more than a century before Bradwardine thinks the latter, holding that the Liar utterance does not express a proposition. That view, which pretty much died out in the mediaeval period, is here revived, and is revealed to be superior to Bradwardine’s. ...|$|R

25|$|Cowen's {{tenure as}} Foreign Minister saw {{extensive}} negotiations continue regarding the Northern Ireland {{peace process and}} other international activities, particularly when Ireland gained {{a place on the}} United Nations Security Council. In 2003, he was the victim of a personal attack by the leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, Ian Paisley, a former outspoken critic of the Republic of Ireland and its government. In front of a crowd of party supporters and in the presence of television cameras and radio reporters, Paisley <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> diatribe about Cowen's personal appearance and also insulted his mother. In 2004, Cowen played a key role during Ireland's Presidency of the European Council and the simultaneous expansion of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|We {{left the}} town, fleeing this living picture of Sodom, with incessant fear lest the raging {{waters of the}} lake {{overtake}} us, which were at the moment invading {{the main part of}} the town, sweeping away everything they encountered. On the outskirts of the town, I came upon a woman who was so exhausted by her burden of two little children and a bundle of clothing that she could proceed no farther. Moved by pity, I took one of the toddlers from her and carried him, and the little indio who has been wailing while in the arms of his mother, stopped short when I took him into mine and never <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> sound while I was carrying him a good piece of the way.|$|E
25|$|Among the Indian leaders, Mahatma Gandhi emphatically {{insisted on}} {{maintaining}} a united India {{and for a}} while successfully rallied people to this goal. During his meeting with Mountbatten, Gandhi asked Mountbatten to invite Jinnah to form a new Central government, but Mountbatten never <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> word of Gandhi's ideas to Jinnah. And when Mountbatten's timeline offered the prospect of attaining independence soon, sentiments took a different turn. Given Mountbatten's determination, Nehru and Patel's inability to deal with the Muslim League and lastly Jinnah's obstinacy, all Indian party leaders (except Gandhi) acquiesced to Jinnah's plan to divide India, which in turn eased Mountbatten's task. Mountbatten also developed a strong relationship with the Indian princes, who ruled those portions of India not directly under British rule. His intervention was decisive in persuading {{the vast majority of them}} to see advantages in opting to join the Indian Union. On one hand, the integration of the princely states can be viewed as one of the positive aspects of his legacy. But on the other, the refusal of Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir, and Junagadh to join one of the dominions led to future tension between Pakistan and India.|$|E

25|$|One {{version of}} the story of the {{creation}} of the Onibaba involves the baby girl of a wealthy family in Kyoto. Although already five-years-old and otherwise healthy and happy, the child had not <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> sound since birth. Worried and desperate, the family consulted doctor after doctor with no success until they came upon a fortune teller who told them that the cure was to feed the girl the fresh liver of a living fetus. This gruesome task was passed on to her nanny who set off on the search after leaving her own similarly aged daughter an omamori, an amulet for protection. The nanny’s search for a woman willing to give up her unborn child’s liver lasted for weeks and months before the nanny, tired and weary, reached Adachigahara, where she decided to stay in a cave to wait for pregnant travelers to pass by. Years passed before a lone pregnant woman approached her cave. Desperate, the nanny jumped upon the woman and retrieved the fetus’ liver. Only after accomplishing her goal did she realize that the woman was wearing the omamori she had given her daughter many years ago. Driven insane by this realization, the nanny became a yōkai and from then on attacked passers-by and ate their flesh.|$|E
500|$|All of the in-game objects (including non-player characters) in Virtual Theatre {{occupied}} space, {{which was}} a unique feature for an engine at the time. Consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they came across, {{as well as the}} player had to side step them. When a non-player character bypassed the protagonist, he or she <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> comment (like [...] "Excuse me, Sir"). As the result, the engine achieved a more realistic game world than previous engines were able to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene.|$|E
500|$|The teenage Leno's growing {{popularity}} led to bookings at, among others, the Varieties Theatre in Sheffield and the Star Music Hall in Manchester. At the same time, Leno's clog dancing {{continued to be}} so good that in 1880 he won the world championship at the Princess's Music Hall in Leeds, for which he received a gold and silver belt weighing 44.5 oz (1.26kg). His biographer, the pantomime librettist J. Hickory Wood, described his act: [...] "He danced on the stage; he danced on a pedestal; he danced on a slab of slate; he was encored over and over again; but throughout his performance, he never <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> word".|$|E

500|$|A {{man named}} Vukota said these words to Bishop Danilo, {{one of the}} main {{characters}} of The Mountain Wreath, who previously <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> piercing vision speaking as if he was alone. The second and the third verses can be compared with an idiomatic expression whose literal sense is [...] "to dash into a frenzied countenance", meaning [...] "to fall into a frenzied or crazed exaltation". Vukota compared Bishop Danilo's exaltation with that of a witch or a vjedogonja when their spirit flew out of their body. It was thought that the witches held an assembly each year on 1 March, and the vjedogonje mostly flew during the long autumn nights, especially when strong winds blew. After Vukota's words, Bishop Danilo started as if from a dream.|$|E
500|$|Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional {{copies and}} met {{employees}} {{of a number}} of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, but I think {{it is important that the}} artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> word into a microphone, for good or ill." ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{images and}} {{lines from the}} film have worked their way into popular culture. Johnny Castle's line, [...] "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", {{has been used in}} song lyrics, as the title of the [...] "Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner" [...] episode of the TV series Veronica Mars, and as the title of a Fall Out Boy song. [...] "Nobody puts Baby in a corner" [...] was also quoted in Supernatural: when Dean says the line {{concerning}} his beloved Impala and his brother Sam retorts that the line is from a Swayze movie; Dean responds: [...] "Swayze always gets a pass". The line was parodied in the webcomic Looking for Group where Richard, one of the primary characters, <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> variation involving his own name, and in Family Guy, where the scene is parodied by Baby's parents questioning Johnny due to her youth. In Sweden, feminist art group Sisters of Jam put the text [...] "Nobody puts Baby in a corner" [...] (in English) in white neon light at Umeå Bus Square (2008) and at Karlstad University (2012).|$|E

500|$|According to the hagiography of Theodore of Syceon, Domentziolus {{was married}} to a lady named Irene, and had three sons. Elizabeth Dawes {{summarizes}} the tale given as following: [...] "Domnitziolus, patrician and curopalates, asks Theodore to visit him in Arcadianae. His wife Eirene has no children: the saint blesses her and promises her three children - and they will be boys. All the male and female slaves of the household are brought to Theodore for his blessing. A slave girl had long been ill, troubled by a hidden demon. He beats on her breast and the demon declares itself. Then the Saint laying her on the ground Put his foot on her neck, turned his eyes to the east and <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> silent prayer. At the end of his prayer he recited aloud the doxology of the Holy Trinity. For some time the slave girl remained speechless and then was completely cured. Later Eirene gave birth to three sons, as the Saint had prophesied. The conception of her first son immediately followed the Saint's prayer. Emperor and Patriarch say farewell to Theodore and he returns to his monastery." [...] Since Theodore died by 613, the tale would have to occur prior to this date.|$|E

And when asked [...] "What is the prize for the winner?", [...] "An olive-wreath" [...] came the answer.

When the news of Rathenau's death became known in the Reichstag, the session turned into turmoil. DNVP-politician Karl Helfferich in particular became the target of attacks, because he had just recently <b>uttered</b> <b>a</b> vitriolic attack upon Rathenau.
