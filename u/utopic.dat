Besides, KKE was very positive to the option of a greater Macedonia, including the Greek region, since it realized that a victory in the Greek Civil War was <b>utopic.</b> Later EAM and SNOF disagreed in issues of policy and they finally crashed and the latter was expelled from Greece (1944).|$|E

Intelligent agents provide the possibility to reflect at least a number of aspects of the nonvirtual situation in a simulated form, and, in addition, enables to use new opportunities for one-to-one marketing, integrated in the Website.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of GeographyRichard A. MarstonDavid R. SeamonSprawling over 180 {{square miles}} of California’s Mojave Desert, Wonder Valley was founded in the early 1950 s and today is an unincorporated {{community}} of approximately 1, 000 residents. The community’s landscape is expansive and unsettling, featuring a chaotic assortment of residences that include abandoned homesteads, squatter settlements, artists’ studios, middle-class cabins, and luxury vacation properties. This dissertation explores Wonder Valley’s enigmatic place identity from residents’ point of view, drawing on an experiential understanding of place grounded in humanistic and phenomenological geography. Specifically, the dissertation makes use of Edward Relph’s explication of place identity to guide empirical inquiry and conceptual structure. 	Drawing on resident interviews, place observations, and textual analysis, the dissertation identifies and explicates three distinct Wonder Valley identities—homesteaders, dystopics, and <b>utopics.</b> Arriving in the 1950 s, homesteaders were Wonder Valley’s first inhabitants and express a practical connection to the landscape that is interpreted in terms of environmental reach, specifically, the creation, maintenance, and extension of environmental and place order. During the 1970 s, as many homesteaders abandoned Wonder Valley, dystopics arrived and today include two subgroups: first, a criminal element pulled to Wonder Valley because of its local isolation but regional proximity to Los Angeles; and, second, destitute squatters pushed out from other communities and having nowhere else to go. The third group identified is <b>utopics,</b> primarily artists from Los Angeles and San Francisco, who arrived in the early 1990 s, attracted by Wonder Valley’s natural beauty and sacred ambience. 	The dissertation explores how these three groups arrived at different times, for different reasons, to create vastly different landscapes, to engage in opposing aims and activities, and to understand Wonder Valley’s meaning as a place in greatly contrasting ways. These differences in meaning are most directly expressed in the common areas of public land, which have often become sites of inter-group tension and conflict, particularly in regard to abandoned homesteads {{and the use of}} off-road vehicles. To interpret this group conflict conceptually, the dissertation develops what is termed existential ecotone— a unique mode of place experience generated by overlapping but contrasting modes of being-in-place...|$|R

To {{illustrate}} my contention, I offer close readings of the director 2 ̆ 7 s films, particularly the protagonists 2 ̆ 7 bodily/linguistic performances. My efforts will vindicate my assertion that through these specialized performances, through the forceful assertion of their marginal identities, the films 2 ̆ 7 protagonists encroach upon, and finally appropriate, historically dominant spaces. As a result, the spaces they appropriate acquire a new, characteristic hybridity. Michel Foucault 2 ̆ 7 s concept of heterotopia provides a framework for delineating the dominant and liminal spaces within Smith 2 ̆ 7 s cinematic/real worlds.

Delany 2 ̆ 7 s Trouble on Triton (1976), articulates an {{ideology}} of masculinity that is deeply at odds with his society and that his friend, Lawrence, labels a 2 ̆ 2 logical perversion. 2 ̆ 2 Deploying Derrida 2 ̆ 7 s concept of destinerrance (the notion of arriving at the wrong place, or reaching the right place only by going wrong), this article argues that Delany 2 ̆ 7 s complex investigation of questions of gender, sexuality, and race in Triton exposes {{the extent to which}} such ideologies depend on irrational self-justification and outright duplicity. Bron is caught in the tensions among destiny, destination, and destinerrance; this, quite ironically, makes him in many ways the most utopian character in this ambiguously heterotopian world. Bron has a blueprint for a better society, even if that blueprint is rooted in a nostalgic fantasy of an antiquated realm of sexual hierarchy. However, because Triton 2 ̆ 7 s heterotopian narrative and locale cannot be wholly dissociated from the concept of utopia, the novel also demonstrates that, since utopia is more of a critical concept than a realizable destination, contemporary <b>utopics</b> {{have no choice but to}} deal with their inherent destinerrance.

40|$|Thomas More’s Utopia will be {{five hundred}} years old in 2016, yet the genre and mode which he invented are {{repeatedly}} mis-prisioned as non-dynamic blueprints. More’s original consists of two books which act in juxtapositional dialogue: the first recounts discussions between More and friends about practical and philosophical political matters, including the topical issues of enclosures and Royal taxation. The second book consists solely of {{a detailed description of}} the politics and sociology of the island “Utopia”, by the stranger Hytholoadeus. “Utopia” thus has two originary meanings: More’s book and the island place. The dialogic frame in which the hypothetical place is imagined is “utopia”, and not the blueprint which is contained within the frame. The semantic joke buried in the Greek meaning of Utopia (no-place) posits the self-consciously serio-comic enterprise as a literary and political thought-experiment in critical analysis of the present juxtaposed against imagined other(s). More’s “invention” of the utopian genre at a moment in history when exploration and communication first became global makes it a perfect prism through which to debate contemporary cultural and literary texts for students, at a time when the global consequences of that historical moment are coalescing in economic, political and environmental crisis. “Utopia” necessitates and includes its opposites, others, contradictions. It offers an open invitation to its reader to join in. More’s original contains what became staple conventions of Utopian content: travel in space and/or time; a meeting with a stranger; representation of the other as both familiar and strange; a dialogue with the reader; and the “blue-print” for the state of Utopia. Sadly, the legacy of nineteenth-century Marxist readings of More’s work was to harness only the latter as though it existed autonomously of the dialogic work. The adjective “utopian” became a term of approbation for the left and critique for the right. The cumulative consequences of the fall of the Berlin wall, the rise of religious fundamentalism, globalisation and the economic crisis have fuelled a Western intellectual scepticism about grand narratives and idealised political projects, and the post-nineteenth century meaning of “utopia” was discredited by both left and right. Similarly, the label “dystopian” has often been used to shut down the formal dialectic between text, world and reader. Yet the silent erosion of the semantics of <b>utopics</b> by the political classes’ neo-liberal consensus can be exposed as precisely that if we return to More’s original text, and read through its structural complexities, its generic self-consciousness, and gain a sense of what Utopia is speaking. By returning to an origin, we can revivify the radical rhetoric of both word and genre, and rediscover its vibrancy in contemporary writing. If we are alert to how other genres evolve and change in political and cultural contexts, how have we not been to utopias? Utopian discourse is not about the articulation of a blue-print or a set of naive ideals, but a sophisticated dialectical mode of rhetorical exploration which perfectly matches the representational and cultural demands of our emergent post-post-post modern globalised culture. Naturally poly-logical because it is self-consciously open-ended and paradoxically celebratory of the possible impossible, the Utopian genre is the perfect embodiment of how generic hybridity can encompass cultural hybridity in a non-authoritarian and open way. Modern theoretical and critical discussions of both genre and the intersection of Literature and globalization (with the notable exception of Frederic Jameson) continue to ignore the radical dialogics and potential of utopian writing. For example, neither the Longman Critical Reader, Modern Genre Theory (ed. David Duff, 2000) and the Routledge reader Literature and Globalization (ed. Liam Connell and Nicky Marsh) have “utopia” in their index. Critics and publishers tend to relegate Utopian writing to fan (s/f) fiction. This chapter uses Marge Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of Time (now nearly forty years old), Atwood’s trilogy (Oryx and Crake, The Year of the Flood and MaddAdam), and some recent young adult fiction (for example Marcus Sedgewick’s Floodlands) to show how utopian generic playfulness in its complex and self-conscious dialogism is a vital contemporary genre and a mode of critical political debate, as well as how frequently this has been represented through female voices (even where ventriloquized by male writers). When Atwood’s work is labelled “dystopian”, we shut down the political potential of her writing’s dialogic nuances intrinsic to the utopian dialectic. As she herself has argued, her recent work is “ustopic”: using possible scenarios through fiction to enable us to conceive of political action about our world. Equally, Piercy’s novel moves fluidly between 1976 and two alternate futures, one disastrous and one ethically and ecologically sustainable: all three spaces and times work in dialogue to create a fourth space – that of the reader’s present. In both authors utopia is a process not a place: although place (here and there) is key in locating our sensibilities and intellects about the failures of our current world. There is no guarantee that humans can avoid the possible disasters envisioned in these novels: but alternative places and times act as distorting mirrors, acting in dialogue with our present to open up a space for thinking and action. Utopia is heuristic. Piercy and Atwood conceive of and construct utopia as a dynamic space between page and reader: not a blue print but a blank page on which we can write our own future. The utopian mode is an open radical genre, self-consciously intertextual and flexible in form and mode. More’s debt to the multi-voiced and moded Mennipean satire has often been remarked, and this hybridised genre (itself the product of an emergent empire) is a perfect match for the twenty-first century conundrum of glocalised identity articulation. The recently popular motif of the newly arrived disruptive stranger in contemporary fiction is a central tenet of utopian (as well as fabular and folk-tale) writing, and suggests that real knowledge of the modals of utopian discourse will enable genuine dialogic political debate about our future(s) amongst student...|$|R
