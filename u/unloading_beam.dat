40|$|The {{electron}} beam optics of the injector and microwave system of a two klystron, four-section linear accelerator with an <b>unloaded</b> <b>beam</b> energy of 140 MeV are discussed. The injector contains a microwave chopper, a nanosecond inflector and a prebunching assembly {{so that a}} wide variety of different injection conditions can be presenteld to the machine. The waveguide sections are of non-uniform impedance design and each is energized by 8. 5 megawatts peak r-f power. The design para-meters of the waveguide sections are discussed together wit 11 the {{electron beam}} dynamics for various modes of injector operation, and some comparisons are made with measurements of the electron beam characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{vibration}} response (natural {{frequencies and}} damping) of a post-buckled beam {{as a result}} of an axial compression force is studied both analytically as well as experimentally. In the analytical development, the pinned-pinned (simply-supported) beam is treated approximately as two-bar link with a rotational spring and damper at the mid-span. It is shown that the post-buckled beam vibrational behavior follows inversely to the behavior of the pre-buckled beam vibrational behavior. For example, as one applies an increasing compression load to a prebuckled beam, the natural frequencies decrease, while the modal damping increases from underdamped to overdamped. As this load approaches the buckling load, the beam natural frequency goes to zero, while the modal damping approaches infinity. Once the beam deforms into its post-bucked state, then further increases in the compression loading causes an increase in the beam bending natural frequency and the corresponding modal damping goes from infinity to overdamped to finally underdamped. The natural frequency and damping of the post-buckled beam approach that of the initially <b>unloaded</b> <b>beam</b> as the beam deformation is fully collapsed. Experimental testing of a compressively loaded graphite/epoxy beam validate these trends for both the pre-buckled and post-buckled conditions. These results are of interest to designers of compressively loaded structures that are subject to buckling, for example fuselage and wing skins that are subjected to dynamic loads. I...|$|R
40|$|Analytical {{solutions}} are derived for both transient and steady state gradient distributions in the traveling wave (TW) accelerating structures with arbitrary variation of parameters over the structure length. The {{results of the}} <b>unloaded</b> and <b>beam</b> loaded cases are presented. Finally, the exact analytical shape of the rf pulse waveform was found in order to apply the transient beam loading compensation scheme during the structure filling time. The obtained theoretical formulas were cross-checked by direct numerical simulations on the CLIC main linac accelerating structure and demonstrated a good agreement. The proposed methods provide a fast and reliable tool for the initial stage of the TW structure analysis...|$|R
40|$|It is {{sometimes}} necessary to strengthen in situ concrete structures. Externally bonded plate reinforcement {{has been successfully}} applied to structures with subsequent satisfactory performance. However, {{little research has been}} reported, especially in respect to long term behaviour. The present study investigated the flexural behaviour of normal under- reinforced concrete beams with plate reinforcement bonded to their tensile face. Furthermore, long term studies of loaded and <b>unloaded</b> plated <b>beams</b> were initiated for testing after exposure to natural weathering conditions. The parameters under investigation were adhesive and steel plate thickness, the degree of cracking in the beam prior to bonding on the plates, multiple plate layers and plate jointing techniques. Test results showed that although the increase in ultimate load produced by the bonded plates was only 17...|$|R

Wary of Gwent's {{electronic}} eavesdropping, Alan Carter and {{a squad of}} Security guards replace {{the crew of the}} cargo Eagle. Flying over to the massive machine, the ship is taken inside and conveyed to an antechamber adjacent to the control area. After the cargo is <b>unloaded,</b> Gwent's scanner <b>beam</b> first inspects the containers, then the menâ€”detecting the heavy-duty laser rifles each carries. Gwent orders them to leave at once; their act of treachery has forfeited Bergman's freedom.|$|R
40|$|Structures with {{governing}} equations having identical inertial terms but somewhat differing stiffness terms can be termed flexurally analogous. An {{example of such}} a structure includes an axially loaded non-uniform <b>beam</b> and an <b>unloaded</b> uniform <b>beam,</b> for which an exact solution exists. We find that there exist shared eigenpairs (frequency and mode shapes) for a particular mode between such structures. Non-uniform beams with uniform axial loads, gravity loaded beams and rotating beams are considered and shared eigenpairs with uniform beams are found. In general, the derived flexural stiffness functions (FSF's) for the non-uniform beams required for the existence of shared eigenpair have internal singularities, but some of the singularities can be removed by an appropriate selection of integration constants using the theory of limits. The derived functions yield an insight into the relationship between the axial load and flexural stiffness of axially loaded beam structures. The derived functions can serve as benchmark solutions for numerical methods. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|A {{high quality}} of beams and {{recurrence}} of their parameters are the important characteristic for RFQ ion implanters. A qualitative run of the proposed design depends on operative field control in a RF-cavity. {{the results of the}} first stage investigations of light emission at the exit of H and 2 H RF-cavities <b>unloaded</b> by a <b>beam</b> are presented. A strong dependence of the intensity of light radiation on the material of the vacuum chamber beyond the exit aperture of the cavities, on the RF power value and independence of this intensity of vacuum conditions inside and outside the cavities (over a large range of pressure changes) are shown. This radiation generated by the electrons leaving the cavity through the exit aperture can be used for real-time nonperturbative RF field control. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and analytical study is conducted {{in order to}} investigate the flexural behaviour of masonry beams when reinforced or strengthened with Fibre- Reinforced Polymers (FRP) composite materials. Nine reinforced masonry beams with 4. 0 m and 2. 4 m clear spans were constructed to be tested under four point bending setup. The beams were subjected to increasing monotonic load up to failure, and then <b>unloaded.</b> Two <b>beams</b> have two courses of hollow concrete masonry units, and the remaining seven beams have three courses. Three masonry beams were reinforced using conventional steel rebars two of which were considered as the control specimens, while the remaining beam strengthened using two layers of Carbon Fibre-Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) sheets that were externally bonded to {{both sides of the}} beam. The remaining six beams were internally reinforced using Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymers (GFRP) rods with different reinforcement ratios. Beams were detailed to have sufficient shear reinforcement such that they do not fail in shear. Comparisons were conducted between the GFRP-reinforced and steel-reinforced control beams as well as CFRP-strengthened and steel-reinforced control beam of the flexural capacity, deformation and strains of the tested specimens. Using the acquired data from the {{experimental and}} analytical studies, effectiveness of GFRP rods as internal reinforcement for concrete masonry beams as well as the effectiveness CFRP sheets for strengthening steel-reinforced concrete masonry beams are demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|Pre-stressed beams are broadly {{applied in}} the highway, urban and railway bridges. In design process of these beams, the {{pre-stress}} forces are determined according to the current standards and theoretical formulas but, during the serviceability service life of a bridge, many factors such as relaxation of steel, shrinkage, creep of concrete and ambient temperature {{can lead to the}} change of the applied pre-stress forces. Therefore, in order to effectively control the operating state and the bearing capacity of bridges, {{it is very important to}} identify the pre-stress losses. The proposed method is the extension of the Simplified Formula of Galef [Galef, 1968] to generic pre-stressed bridge beams for the identification of their pre-stress forces. The procedure is suitable for any slender simply-supported beam of any bridge. Making use of the first natural frequencies of the <b>unloaded</b> and loaded <b>beam</b> under investigation, the Simplified Formula is able to estimate the pre-stress force, knowing the respective buckling load. Most of the existing dynamic methods are particularly sensitive to experimental and model errors in which it is also difficult to select a-priori the best natural frequency that will estimate the pre-stress force. In fact, different natural frequencies values lead different precisions in the estimations. The proposed procedure does not require any selection of the best mode shape to be used in the identification process. Numerical tests on two post-tensioned concrete and steel beams confirm the robustness of the non-destructive method even in the presence of moderate parameter errors...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental data}} and {{results on the}} flexural performance of shallow reinforced concrete beams strengthened with carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) plates. A total of four full-scale beams were constructed and tested up to failure. The beams measured 5300 mm long, 500 mm width, and 250 mm deep and were tested in four-point bending over a simply-supported span of 5000 mm. Three beams were strengthened with CFRP plates bonded to the soffit of the beams, while the remaining beam was unstrengthened and served as control. The main variable was the preloading level prior to strengthening. The beams were subjected to three different preloading levels: 0, 40, and 60 % of their yield capacity. The strengthened beams were loaded first to the specified load level before strengthening to induce cracks and then <b>unloaded.</b> Thereafter, the <b>beams</b> were strengthened and tested up to failure. The test {{results indicated that the}} flexural performance of the strengthened beams was significantly improved. At the service load level, the deflection of the strengthened beams was reduced by about 50 % in comparison to that of the unstrengthened beam. Strengthening using CFRP plates was effective in restricting the opening of flexural cracks. The reduction in crack width due to strengthening was more than 68 % at the service load level. In addition, the strengthened beams experienced higher ultimate strength than that of the unstrengthened beam. The increase in ultimate strength was more than 140 %. Preloading the test beams up to 60 % of the yield capacity before strengthening appeared to have marginal effect...|$|R
40|$|A {{literature}} review of existing research on rack structures shows that connection models {{that are often}} adopted {{for the study of}} frame behaviour are usually based on the pre - yield stiffness. Record of experiments carried out and connection models developed from such experiments show that there is no reported study on the post - yielding behaviour of these connections under seismic loads. Seismic excitations often cause connections to rotate well beyond yielding and therefore requiring consideration of the post - yielding stiffnesses which developed in the connections to allow all the excessive stresses developed from the seismic effects to be re - distributed {{to other parts of the}} structure in prevention of premature collapse. The current study is an investigation into the semi - rigid and post - yielding behaviour of a beam end connector used in the UK storage rack industry. The pre and post - yielding behaviours of the connection under seismic condition undergo "pinching" which is the degradation of stiffness in the connection as a result of persistent loading and <b>unloading</b> of the <b>beam,</b> causing; significant wear and tear in the connection. The deterioration in the connection is manifested through material yielding, permanent geometric change and fatigue failure. The pinching behaviour in the connection was determined through experiments, which were conducted as part of this research. The experiments showed a steady rise in moment resistance within the elastic range of the connector. In this range every stiffness curve generated from the connection showed a slight deviation from the preceding curve but similar in shape. As the applied loads increased the connection behaved plastically with non recoverable looseness developing around the neutral or zero position as a result of the permanent deformation. There was then a sudden drop in strength followed again by a gradual increase in moment capacity which led to a shape similar to a butterfly wing, a "butterfly -shaped" moment rotation curve. The pinching was associated with significant looseness in the connection and this was shown in the moment rotation curve to get bigger with increases in the number of load cycles and magnitude of the applied load. A connection model to describe the "butterfly shaped" stiffness curve was then developed through regression analysis and this was used for the study of rack frame behaviour under seismic loading. A procedure for non linear dynamic analysis, based on Newton - Raphson and Newmark's methods was developed using stability functions to derive the structural stiffness and the pinching properties of the connections were then incorporated for the study. The research finally gives a revised design methodology, incorporating the pinching behaviour of the connections in comparison with existing design codes.
