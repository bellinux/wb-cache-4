40|$|Speakers of Lao (Southwestern Tai, Laos) use {{a number}} of forms of nominal classification, {{including}} numeral classifiers, modifier classifiers, class terms, and kin prefixes. The numeral classifier system is a typologically prototypical one, with dozens of classifiers making fine semantic distinctions {{in the context of}} enumeration. Repeater constructions are common, making numeral classifiers an open class. The modifier classifier system involves the use of classifiers in nominal modification of all kinds, including demonstratives (in situational or discourse deixis and anaphora), attributive modifiers (such as adjec-tives and relative clauses), and a <b>unitizing</b> <b>construction</b> resembling noun classifier constructions found in other languages. The class term system is lexically derivational, with hundreds of nouns incorporating a prefixed term expressing taxonomic essence (e. g. whether the noun denotes a tree, insect, some kind of liquid, and so on). The kin prefix system involves the prefixation of kinship terms and other human terms as prefixes to personal names. This paper is the first general description of nominal classification in Lao. While the system is almost exactly the same as that found in closely related Thai, many former descrip-tions of that language have concentrated on numeral classifier constructions only, and have neglected a significant distinction suggested here, namely that between numeral and modifier classifiers. 1...|$|R

50|$|So {{named for}} its {{resemblance}} to a ladder, the ladder frame {{is one of the}} simplest and oldest of all designs. It consists of two symmetrical beams, rails, or channels running the length of the vehicle, and several transverse cross-members connecting them. Originally seen on almost all vehicles, the ladder frame was gradually phased out on cars in favor of perimeter frames and <b>unitized</b> body <b>construction.</b> It is now seen mainly on trucks. This design offers good beam resistance because of its continuous rails from front to rear, but poor resistance to torsion or warping if simple, perpendicular cross-members are used. Also, the vehicle's overall height will be greater due to the floor pan sitting above the frame instead of inside it.|$|R
40|$|NASA Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) {{project and}} the Boeing Company are collabrating to advance the {{unitized}} damage arresting composite airframe technology with application to the Hybrid-Wing-Body (HWB) aircraft. The testing of a HWB fuselage section with Pultruded Rod Stitched Efficient <b>Unitized</b> Structure (PRSEUS) <b>construction</b> is presently being conducted at NASA Langley. Based on lessons learned from previous HWB structural design studies, improved finite-element models (FEM) of the HWB multi-bay and bulkhead assembly are developed to evaluate {{the performance of the}} PRSEUS construction. In order to assess the comparative weight reduction benefits of the PRSEUS technology, conventional cylindrical skin-stringer-frame models of a cylindrical and a double-bubble section fuselage concepts are developed. Stress analysis with design cabin-pressure load and scenario based case studies are conducted for design improvement in each case. Alternate analysis with stitched composite hat-stringers and C-frames are also presented, in addition to the foam-core sandwich frame and pultruded rod-stringer construction. The FEM structural stress, strain and weights are computed and compared for relative weight/strength benefit assessment. The structural analysis and specific weight comparison of these stitched composite advanced aircraft fuselage concepts demonstrated that the pressurized HWB fuselage section assembly can be structurally as efficient as the conventional cylindrical fuselage section with composite stringer-frame and PRSEUS construction, and significantly better than the conventional aluminum construction and the double-bubble section concept...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Complaint {{mechanisms}} {{are the focus}} of active research because of the stability, robustness and ease of manufacturing endowed by their <b>unitized</b> <b>construction.</b> In this paper, we explore an application of complaint mechanisms for active vibration isolation system, for this, a complaint actuator is used to cancel undesired disturbance, resulting in attenuated output amplitude. The scope of this study is limited only to low frequency isolation because the use of compliant mechanism in an active vibration isolation system has the greatest advantage in the low frequency range. Since many passive systems are effective and sufficient for high frequency isolation. So, the need of active systems for high frequency isolation is less than that of low frequency isolation. This paper also focuses on understanding the effects of the compliant design parameters and attempt to solve problems systematically. The technical tools like FEA and MAT-lab are used to design the compliant mechanism. This design-drawing model can be converted into working model, by comparing this design drawing model and working model can be easily analyzed on parameters such as transmissibility ratio and disturbance frequency...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop numerical procedures for static and dynamic analysis of compliant mechanisms comprised of large-deflection flexible elements. Compliant mechanisms gain some or all of their mobility from deformation of these elements. This permits the use of fewer components in mechanisms to perform useful tasks. The use of flexural pivots in place of rigid-body joints add advantages that include less wear, greater reliability, and lightweight design. Modern material science and manufacturing technology offer possibilities for <b>unitized</b> <b>construction</b> of mechanisms, e. g. with the use of plastics in an injection molding process, with reduced manufacturing costs. Analysis and synthesis of such mechanisms would be accomplished using a chain calculation technique, and a shooting method based on the Newton-Raphson iteration to meet displacement boundary conditions. This thesis reviews the chain algorithm by including shear deformation effects in the beam elements with large cross sections. A three-dimensional version of the chain algorithm is also developed. An incremental, iterative finite element procedure is presented as an effective alternative for static and dynamic analysis of compliant mechanisms. The technique is also used to analyze compliant mechanisms 2 ̆ 7 function near mobility limit positions. Under critical loading, unstable regions are reached and mechanisms experience snap-through buckling, or collapse. ...|$|E
40|$|Re-Imagining the Maison Tropicale proposes {{new system}} for prefabrication, {{applied to the}} context of {{tropical}} housing. Given the failure of contemporary prefabricated systems to provide creative solutions that can be mass-produced, this thesis refers to Jean Prouvé's Maison Tropicale as a post-WWII precedent for innovation and a lens through which the issue of prefabrication is further examined. Taking inspiration from the Maison Tropicale's lightweight, ambitious, panelized kit of parts, the thesis studied the needs of contemporary homes and integrated the above into a new concept for a <b>unitized</b> system of <b>construction.</b> The new construction system maintains the lightweight aluminum design of the original Maison Tropicale while separating structure from fittings and furnishings, producing {{a greater degree of}} flexibility and adaptability within the home. Through a methodology of materials research, analysis, design and prototyping, several iterations of full-scale wall panels were developed successively; the resulting design takes into account actual panel weight and connections, as well as questions of durability, ease of assembly, and fabrication. The final aluminum honeycomb panel system works as a kit of parts, where corner elements are rigid to allow for ease of assembly on site and to allow for design variations with minimal changes to the kit. The system's assembly sequence is thoroughly coordinated with the design of each panel's edge details; by designing these connections into the panel guarantees that architectural intentions translate to the final product, assembled on remote sites while also ensuring that only a small team of unskilled workers is required to construct the final building. Lastly, the kit of parts was applied to the design of a new home in the Tropics, accounting for local concerns such as shading building orientation, moisture and ventilation. by Margret. I Nelson.
