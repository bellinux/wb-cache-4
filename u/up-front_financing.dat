40|$|This paper investigates staged {{financing}} in {{an environment}} where an entrepreneur faces an imperfect capital market and an investor faces agency costs and uncertainty in an equity joint venture (EJV). Staged financing plays two roles in this model: to control risks and to mitigate moral hazard. Using parametric functions and comparing staged financing with <b>up-front</b> <b>financing,</b> we derive a few interesting properties of staged financing. We show that when staged financing is used together with the sharing contract, staged financing acts as an effective complementary mechanism in controlling agency problem...|$|E
40|$|Through the {{enactment}} of Ontario's Green Energy and Green Economy Act of 2009, Ontario has set targets to increase the share of renewable energy. However, widespread renewable energy development still faces several barriers. Some of the key barriers to adoption, especially for solar photovoltaic technologies, are the high up-front installation costs, the lack of attractive financing options and the dominant share of nuclear energy in Ontario's energy mix. This paper examines {{some of the key}} adoption issues in Ontario and looks at how other jurisdictions have sought alternative models for financing renewable energy projects. Using this information, a model is proposed for Ontario that will reduce the burden of high <b>up-front</b> <b>financing</b> costs for Ontarians with more accessible financing options and a plan for addressing the nuclear energy issue...|$|E

30|$|Overall, the {{leverage}} ratio L mirrors {{important aspects of}} sequential versus unstaged investment projects. First, {{as the number of}} stages of the investment increases, {{the leverage}} ratio of the compound option also increases (ceteris paribus). This reflects the relatively lower initial capital investment of sequential investment projects compared to complete irreversible <b>up-front</b> <b>financed</b> projects that inevitably have an (implicit) leverage of zero. Second, this lower initial capital investment has a risk-reducing effect since losses are limited to the option premium(s), that is, prior investment outlays. Sequential investment projects can thus be characterized as low-commitment (R&D) strategies (see Klingebiel and Adner 2012) or as “exploratory investments” (Bar-Ilan and Strange 1998) as the staging of investments implies varying degrees of commitment. Consequently, the leverage of the duplicating portfolio is a market-based operationalization of the (resource) commitment construct, and might be used as such also in future empirical research studies.|$|R

This will require, however, significant financial investment by local and national government, which in the current economic climate is very difficult. One way to reduce the energy consumption of public buildings without direct <b>up-front</b> <b>financing</b> is by way of an energy saving partnership (ESP), two examples of which are outlined and compared here: the Berlin Energy Saving Partnership and the London Re:fit programme. Based on these examples and on discussions with UK building retrofit specialists, this paper analyses drivers and barriers for the potential of ESPs in the UK. It emphasises that in order to minimise or prevent potential financial obstacles, strong support, and not just financial support, from local government is required...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} the U. S. state of New Jersey's policy to accelerate the growth of photovoltaic electricity generating capacity over the past ten years. It provides insights that may be of use to scholars and policy-makers who seek to understand how markets for photovoltaics and other renewable energy technologies may be created and sustained, and it adds to the growing set of detailed historical case studies on these issues. Aggressive state policy measures have put New Jersey second to California among the U. S. states in installed photovoltaic capacity. That growth was achieved in a series of stages. New Jersey initially experienced a boom and bust as generous up-front rebates catalyzed rapid growth in demand and exhausted the program's budget. A shift in 2007 to a policy that emphasized Solar Renewable Energy Certificates failed to sustain the growth in capacity. In response, the state began to require regulated transmission and distribution utilities to provide <b>up-front</b> <b>financing</b> for photovoltaic systems. This approach has restarted the momentum of the market, but it shifts the policy's costs into the future, while empowering a new set of players with uncertain interests over the long term.

40|$|The {{present report}} {{is the result}} of a joint project between Banverket (the Swedish rail administration), Vägverket (the Swedish Road Administration) and VTI (Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute). During winter 2007 the {{agencies}} were commissioned by the Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications to assess the legal, economic and technical prerequisites for implementing a model for Public Private Partnership (PPP, or OPS which is the domestic acronym) for road and railway infrastructure investments. Focus in the report is on establishing a framework for PPP projects which is footed in an ambition to establish efficiency in infrastructure construction and maintenance. In the proposal for model design, three components of the contract between a public sector representative and a private consortium are focused: The bundling of investment and maintenance for a long - 15 to 30 years or even longer - period of time; the use of stringent and measurable functional or performance requirements; and the private provision of <b>up-front</b> <b>financing,</b> subsequently being repaid over the lifetime of the contract period. The report also addresses risk issues at length. A more precise specification of the sources of risk in infrastructure construction is discussed and the idea of minimising expected costs as a target for allocation of risk between the parties is suggested. The necessity to have actual competition - i. e. at least three bidders - during the procurement process is established...|$|E
30|$|Whilst TIF {{offers a}} {{potential}} tool for supporting local growth, it also draws cities further into a financialised economy (Strickland 2011; Weber 2010). Strickland (2013) identifies {{a number of}} important differences between TIF in England and in the US, where the model originated. He notes that Chicago has been able to transfer risk to private developers and financiers. By contrast, TIF in the City Deals takes development and construction risk away from the private sector because the costs are <b>financed</b> <b>up-front</b> by the local authorities, which bear most of the risks.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} analyzing games {{where some}} players have private {{information about their}} "types" is usually based on the duality of "good" and "bad" types (GB approach), where "good" type denotes the type with better quality. In contrast, this paper analyzes a signalling game without types hierarchy. Different types have the same average qualities but different profiles of quality over time which are their private information. We apply this idea to analyze a financing-investment game where firm’s insiders have private information about the firms profit profile over time. If transporting cash between period is costless equilibrium is pooling with <b>up-front</b> equity <b>financing.</b> Otherwise equilibrium is either pooling with debt {{when the economy is}} stagnating, or separating when the economy is growing (some firms issue debt and some firms issue shares). This provides new theoretical results that cannot be explained by the standard GB models and which are consistent with some financial market phenomena...|$|R
30|$|It is {{too early}} to assess the overall {{performance}} of the City Deals (NAO 2013), because it will be some years before the Deals produce tangible outcomes (Nathan 2011). We can, however, offer some tentative conclusions that the City Deals, when viewed in an international context, and considered as a collective, do not represent radical decentralisation. A small number of cities have embarked upon speculative investment to <b>finance</b> <b>up-front</b> infrastructure, and austerity has amplified the risks these local authorities are taking amidst a background of the squeeze of declining local revenue. However, the UK Government has instigated a strict set of fiscal rules around mechanisms, such as TIF and Earn-back.|$|R
40|$|Many studies, both of Australia and of {{comparable}} developed economies, {{have found that}} the economic benefits from investment in urban infrastructure are substantial. However the nature of this infrastructure is often such that it is under-provided by the private sector. In Australia, much of the responsibility for the provision of urban infrastructure rests with state and local government. However throughout the 1990 ’s many of Australia’s state governments embarked on a period of fiscal restraint, seeking to improve financial positions weakened by exposure to failed state government enterprises in the early 1990 ’s. Perhaps because of the deferred consequences of reducing spending on infrastructure, a large proportion of this fiscal adjustment appears to have been borne by spending on public infrastructure. Today, policy attention at the state government level is again focussing on public infrastructure. However in spite of the now robust fiscal positions of Australia’s state governments, there remains a reluctance on their part to finance public infrastructure through debt, and raising taxes is perceived as politically unpopular. Instead, governments are exploring alternative financing instruments, such as developer charges and public-private partnerships. This paper uses a dynamic multi-regional CGE model (MMRF) to evaluate the regional macro economic consequences of four alternative methods of financing an expansion in state government spending on public infrastructure. The four methods are developer charges, payroll tax, government debt, and residential rates. The paper confirms that the services provided by public infrastructure can have significant impacts on the regional macro economy. More importantly however, the paper demonstrates that the total gains from urban infrastructure are quite sensitive to the means chosen by government to finance infrastructure investment. In contrast to <b>up-front</b> <b>financing</b> methods (such as developer charges, payroll tax, and residential rates), the paper finds that the gains from urban infrastructure are greatest when the chosen financing method provides a closer match between the timing of the burden of financing the infrastructure and the timing of the benefits provided by the infrastructure. This can be achieved by instruments such as debt, public-private partnerships, and user charges. On this basis the paper finds that a greater reliance by regional government son debt financing might be warranted, and that the gains from infrastructure expenditure are least when that expenditure is financed by developer charges. ...|$|E

50|$|Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project. Another {{approach}} has been supported by the World Bank through the Bangladesh Water Supply Program Project (BWSPP), implemented by the Department of Public Health and Engineering (DPHE). This approach, initiated in 2001, has been inspired by the RDA experience, but with two crucial modifications: First, it required sponsors {{to come up with}} the entire <b>financing</b> <b>up-front,</b> which was supposed to be recovered through revenues from the sale of water. Second, only drinking water was to be provided and no irrigation water. Finding sponsors willing to put their own capital at risk proved to be difficult. For this reason, and due to project management difficulties, only two schemes had been built as of January 2008, providing water to 2,000 households. Neither scheme has become financially viable. An NGO built and operates the schemes, since no private company was interested in doing so.|$|R
