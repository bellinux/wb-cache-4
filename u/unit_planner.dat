40|$|Geographical {{accessibility}} {{is fundamental}} when planning rescue services. At present {{there are several}} programs for computing the accessibility of stationary rescue units. This study suggests a method for evaluating geographic accessibility in scenarios containing also non-stationary units. The method supports the planning process by matching the risk of an incident occurring with the rescue units’ capabilities and accessibility. The method is implemented in the computer program Rescue <b>Unit</b> <b>Planner.</b> The result of the analysis is presented in thematic maps and graphs as level of coverage, mean response time and concentration. The method and the computer program have been evaluated in two case studies: one urban area in southern Sweden and one rural area in northern Sweden. The case studies show that that this method {{can be useful in}} the rescue service planning process...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Situated {{along the}} Pacific Belt, the Philippines is {{susceptible}} to typhoon and earthquake risks throughout the year. Within the last five years, a number of devastating floods and thousands of lost lives have emphasized the need for detailed, up-to-date, spatial and topographic data. The scarcity of topographic and land cover data has, for decades, limited the national and local government <b>units,</b> <b>planners,</b> and stakeholders from effectively addressing these issues. The Nationwide Disaster Risk and Exposure Assessment for Mitigation (DREAM) Program approached this problem using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology. This paper looked into the data acquisition methodology employed by the DREAM Program to survey 18 major river basins of the country...|$|R

40|$|Because {{conservation}} planners typically lack data {{on where}} species occur, environmental surrogates including geophysical settings and climate types {{have been used}} to prioritize sites within a planning area. We reviewed 622 evaluations of the effectiveness of abiotic surrogates in representing species in 19 study areas. Sites selected using abiotic surrogates represented more species than an equal number of randomly selected sites in 43 % of tests (55 % for plants) and on average improved on random selection of sites by about 8 % (21 % for plants). Environmental diversity (ED) (42 % median improvement on random selection) and biotically informed clusters showed promising results and merit additional testing. We suggest 4 ways to improve performance of abiotic surrogates. First, analysts should consider a broad spectrum of candidate variables to define surrogates, including rarely used variables related to geographic separation, distance from coast, hydrology, and within-site abiotic diversity. Second, abiotic surrogates should be defined at fine thematic resolution. Third, sites (the landscape units prioritized within a planning area) should be small enough to ensure that surrogates reflect species' environments and to produce prioritizations that match the spatial resolution of conservation decisions. Fourth, if species inventories are available for some planning <b>units,</b> <b>planners</b> should define surrogates based on the abiotic variables that most influence species turnover in the planning area. Although species inventories increase the cost of using abiotic surrogates, a modest number of inventories could provide the data needed to select variables and evaluate surrogates. Additional tests of nonclimate abiotic surrogates are needed to evaluate the utility of conserving nature's stage as a strategy for conservation planning in the face of climate change...|$|R

We are working with the third largest submission pool in ICA's history (after San Francisco and Montreal), though conference submissions were down slightly compared to Montreal (by 2. 4 %), totaling 2, 564 papers and 263 panels. The program will offer an exciting and provocative set of presentations, which will hopefully move us toward new ways of thinking about the field of communication. As we speak, reviewers from ICA's divisions and interest groups are evaluating submissions. Thanks to everyone who has colonized time from busy schedules to help review for the various divisions and interest groups. Thanks too to the <b>unit</b> program <b>planners,</b> who have been working tirelessly until now to make sure that things get done on time. Those of us on the planning side of the program are figuring out how best to accommodate the submission pool and work with an acceptance rate that makes sense for the association.

50|$|On 2 August 1944, First Allied Airborne Army {{was officially}} {{activated}} by {{the orders of}} General Eisenhower, and {{in less than two}} weeks it was assigned its first operation. During August 1944, American forces under General Omar Bradley had launched an operation designed to allow Allied forces to break out of Normandy after several months of slow progress against heavy German resistance, which was codenamed Operation Cobra. The operation had been a success, despite a fierce German counter-attack on 7 August codenamed Operation Lüttich, and a number of German divisions had become trapped between the four towns of Trun, Argentan, Vimoutiers and Chambois near Falaise in France in what had been labelled the Falaise Pocket. On 13 August, airborne forces under the command of First Allied Airborne Army were moved to airfields in Northern France in readiness to participate in Operation Transfigure, whose objective was to block the retreat of these German forces. Planning for the operation went to an extremely advanced stage, and was to have involved 1st Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division, Polish 1st Independent Parachute Brigade, 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division, a British infantry division which had been retrained as an air-transportable division capable of being landed alongside airborne forces, and a number of support <b>units.</b> The <b>planners</b> for Transfigure envisioned the airborne divisions and brigade landing near Rambouillet and capturing an airstrip, after which the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division could be flown in to aid in the establishment of an airhead which Allied armour could use as a forward base to advance towards Paris.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Constructing a Master Air Attack plan {{requires}} the negotiations of many constraints. Typical of these constraints are {{limitations on the}} munitions that can be delivered to each target, limitations on the platforms that can carry the munitions, as well as limitations {{on the availability of}} the platforms from a specified unit. A schedule needs to be constructed that respects the <b>unit</b> contracts, the <b>planner</b> enforced attack waves, and the packaging preferences. In the process, we seek to maximize the targets that can be attained with available resources subject to the priorities of the targets. The initialization of the genetic algorithm is accomplished by randomized greedy operations that quickly find local minima in the solution space. These greedy algorithms are implemented as genetic operators and are used not only to initialize the chromosomes with valid solutions but also to “finish off ” the good solutions that result from the genetic algorithm to ensure that any remaining resources are used and that the solution can only be improved by de-allocating some subset of the existing solution...|$|R

40|$|By {{developing}} framework {{plans on}} a large scale such as a country or a region,  planners use economic prognoses which show future needs for space for new  spatial developments expressed in <b>units</b> of surfaces. <b>Planners</b> and designers  make drawings and sketches to show where those new areas will be situated,  but they do not really measure the surfaces of spaces they created. This often  leads to incorrect images which can be wrongly understood by actors in  decision making. To avoid this problem the Netherlands Institute for Spatial  Research developed mapmaking software called RasterPlan. The purpose of  this tool is to make design decisions quantitatively checkable and transparent.  The maps which result from the RasterPlan are precise in geographical  positioning and defining the surfaces of designed areas. RasterPlan allows  realization of a quantitative program for future spatial needs for various  functions such as housing, green and water areas working, and recreation. In  addition to quantitative calculations, qualitative criteria for location choice can  be also expressed in a form of suitability maps or buffers. This paper presents  an experimental implementation of RasterPlan for the design of the future  development of the Province North Brabant. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} whether the PYP curriculum contains the elements of an authentic socio-constructivist pedagogical model. Vygotsky’s historical-sociocultural research became the principal work through which the related principles of learning and teaching were identified. The theories that guided this study focused on the development of the child as a member of a learning community, the role of the teacher as a conduit for cognitive and metacognitive development, and the pedagogical elements of the classroom environment that contribute to developmentally appropriate practice (DAP). In order to undertake this research, the senior kindergarten (K 2) level of Uptown Primary School was selected as the setting. In order to ascertain the PYP’s compatibility with socio-constructivism, several procedures were done that included a Comparison Chart of Perspectives (CCP), a Micro-analysis of a K 2 <b>Unit</b> of Inquiry <b>planner,</b> and the assessment of the participants’ educational values and beliefs, in addition, to their perceptions of teacher practices. Findings from this study suggest that the PYP’s pedagogical framework is structured according to the philosophy and practices of an authentic socio-constructivist model, one that is based on the holistic development of the child, a child-centered and interactive pedagogy, and learning as a sociocultural endeavour...|$|R

50|$|The lack {{of regular}} units also forced the Eastern Command to improvise in two ways: {{creating}} ad hoc formations to mimic regular army formations and mixing regular troops with paramilitary <b>units.</b> When Pakistani <b>planners</b> assumed India would launch its main {{attack in the}} east along the Akhaura - Brahmanbaria axis, it had no brigades available to cover this area. The 27th brigade from Mymensingh was moved to Akhaura, while two battalions from the brigade were detached to form the 93rd Brigade in Mymensingh. Similarly, the 313th Brigade was moved from Sylhet to Maulavi Bazar and a battalion from the 313th was kept at Sylhet to form {{the nucleus of the}} 202nd ad hoc Brigade. The 14th Division (which covered both the Dhaka Bowl and the Eastern Sector except Chittagong) was given responsibility for the Eastern Sector only, and the 36th ad hoc Division (containing only the 93rd Brigade) was created to defend the Dhaka Bowl. Similarly, the 314th (for Khulna) and the Rajshahi ad hoc Brigades were created and deployed in September. In mid-November, the 39th ad hoc Division was created to defend the Comilla and Noakhali districts from the 14th Division units deployed in those areas; the 14th was tasked to defend the Sylhet and Brahmanbaria areas only.

Being confronted with ever changing requests for statistical information on {{a great variety of}} spatial structures, like school districts, voting districts, building zones, catchment areas of public transport etc. municipal statisticians developed a standard regional reference system for sub-city areas as a tool for the administration (e. g. elections) and any kind of small area statistics. This standard system, the so-called “Kleinräumige Gliederung ” was finally issued as a “recommendation ” by the Union of German Municipalities in 1976, with a revised edition in 1991, following the reunification of East and West Germany. The recommendation consists of three parts (1) How to assign house-numbers (2) how to assign street numbers (in addition to street names) and how to handle changes (3) how to structure the total area of the city by establishing a hierarchical system of sections of streets with (or without) a defined range of house-numbers all located {{on one side of the}} street, building blocks, consisting of one ore more sections of streets (= sides of building blocks) and, on the 3 rd and higher levels, of districts consisting of one or more building blocks.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{disseminate}} a novel path planner which is particularly used for offline robots to build more efficient collision-free trajectories in terms of the length in more skilled fashion. Robotic path planning as one of the most important problems has been under investigation by a variety of researchers within the last few decades. Path planner refers to a unit which is responsible to perform a series of operations on the robots’ environment with the sole purpose of building proper trajectories from a start point to the goal configuration. A robot’s planner generally consists of some or all of the following units: analyzing the workspace, mapping the workspace into an alternative methodology such as a graph, optimizing the constructed map, and calculating and refining the desired trajectory. Various path planners have been proposed based on the different robots’ functionalities as well as the environmental specifications. A path planner basically uses a methodology inspiring a scientific theory or event to build optimal paths. This research tends to propose a novel path planner which is able to be successfully applied on a variety of workspaces with different constraints. Moreover, the presented planner successfully builds the shortest collision-free trajectories from an initial to the goal configurations. In addition, compared to the other majority of path planners, the illustrated path planner uses less environmental global information to build optimal paths. This leads the <b>planner</b> <b>unit</b> to allocate less of system resources such as memory, hence, increasing the performance of the planner in terms of preserving more system resources...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} systematic evaluation of road safety needs – the Safety Needs Identification Package (SNIP) and a concept called SNIP 2 – an expansion that can match identified safety needs with safety interventions at the regional and city levels. SNIP and SNIP 2 {{can be used by}} agencies involved in safety planning and management. This paper presents the SNIP concept and its implementation for safety planning on Indiana roads. SNIP utilizes GIS road and crash databases to help identify road locations that experience safety problems such as night crashes, right-angle crashes at signalized intersections, etc. It can also be applied to user-related safety needs such as drunken driving, motorcycle crashes, speeding, or young driver safety. SNIP 2 involves two new key components: (1) a catalog of safety improvement programs and (2) a safety improvement program builder that identifies the most cost-effective safety improvement programs to address the safety needs identified with SNIP. The novelty of the proposed approach is in developing the safety improvement plan based on specific needs already identified for various locations, thereby providing a realistic approach to safety planning. The known safety effectiveness of the considered safety improvement programs and their <b>unit</b> costs allow <b>planners</b> to control the level of spending. To make the optimization problem tractable for large regions with multiple alternative safety interventions, an approximate greedy search is applied to the knapsack problem to optimize recurring annualized benefits and costs. This simplified approach fits well the long-term transportation planning where a long-term “static” solution is sough while providing identification of focus areas more realistic than the current practice of developing strategic safety plans. The paper presents the details of the catalog of safety improvements preliminarily developed for Indiana and formulation of the optimization program for selecting improvement programs. It discusses the implementation issues and the expected benefits from coordinating the development of the strategic safety plans by state agencies...|$|R
