5|$|In November 1932, it was {{reported}} that new radio equipment was to be installed at Lympne and St Inglevert operating on the 15 centimetre waveband at 2,000MHz, which would be used for the announcement of departures of non-radio aircraft across the Channel. Messages sent by radio were also printed out by a teleprinter, providing a record of the communication. The British Air Ministry and the French Ministère de l'Air co-operated in the arrangements for setting <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> which was scheduled to come into operation in Spring 1933. It proved its effectiveness on 7 March 1933, when a non-radio de Havilland DH.60 Moth of British Air Transport failed to arrive at Lympne. The aircraft had ditched in the Channel and both occupants were rescued by a steamship bound for Amsterdam, the Netherlands. A new short-wave radio system came into operation on 16 January 1934, using equipment manufactured by Le Matériel Téléphonique, Paris.|$|E
5|$|The most {{powerful}} British jurist of the century, his decisions reflected the Age of Enlightenment and moved England {{on the path}} to abolishing slavery and the slave trade. He advanced commercial law in ways that helped establish the nation as the world leader in industry, finance and trade. He modernised both English law and the English courts system; he sped <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> for submitting motions and reformed the way judgments were given to reduce time and expense for the parties. For his work in Carter v Boehm and Pillans v Van Mierop, he has been called the founder of English commercial law. He is perhaps best known for his judgment in Somersett's Case (1772), where he held that slavery had no basis in common law and had never been established by positive law (legislation) in England, and therefore was not binding law (although this did not end slave trafficking altogether).|$|E

25|$|The Civil War hit {{the county}} {{education}} establishment hard. Several {{years in the}} 1860s saw no schools operating {{at all in the}} county and the county basically had to start all over in building <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> after the war. The system went from 71 districts in which 61 districts taught school for a whole three months in 1860, to only four schools total for White students in 1870. Many of the former school buildings were in serious states of disrepair. But the end of Reconstruction brought renewed interest {{and by the end of}} the 1870s, 106 White schools and 6 Black schools existed. In 1885, the superintendent became an elected position, the first being Quincy F. Neal.|$|E
25|$|Now, imagine {{starting}} at the bottom left corner of the phase diagram, in the vacuum where μ=T=0. If we heat <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> without introducing any preference for quarks over antiquarks, this corresponds to moving vertically upwards along the T axis. At first, quarks are still confined and we create a gas of hadrons (pions, mostly). Then around T=150MeV there is a crossover to the quark gluon plasma: thermal fluctuations break up the pions, and we find a gas of quarks, antiquarks, and gluons, as well as lighter particles such as photons, electrons, positrons, etc. Following this path corresponds to travelling far back in time (so to say), {{to the state of}} the universe shortly after the big bang (where there was a very tiny preference for quarks over antiquarks).|$|E
25|$|Electronic Sound {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{electronic}} music albums made by a rock musician. Once installed at EMI Studios, where Mike Vickers of the band Manfred Mann assisted in setting <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system,</b> Harrison's Moog proved to be an important addition to the Beatles' sound for what would be their final recording project, Abbey Road. With Harrison, Lennon and Paul McCartney each playing the instrument, the band incorporated white noise and other Moog sound effects, together with melodic elements played via a ribbon controller. In January 1970, Robert Moog told Billboard that Mick Jagger and George Martin also owned Moog 3Ps and that the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop was due to purchase one, but that the cost was prohibitive for musicians such as Vickers, who instead had to rent his system.|$|E

500|$|Leo VI {{achieved}} the complete codification of Byzantine law in Greek. This monumental work of 60 volumes became {{the foundation of}} all subsequent Byzantine law and is still studied today. Leo also reformed {{the administration of the}} Empire, redrawing the borders of the administrative subdivisions (the Themata, or [...] "Themes") and tidying <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of ranks and privileges, as well as regulating the behaviour of the various trade guilds in Constantinople. Leo's reform did much to reduce the previous fragmentation of the Empire, which henceforth had one center of power, Constantinople. However, the increasing military success of the Empire greatly enriched and empowered the provincial nobility with respect to the peasantry, who were essentially reduced to a state of serfdom.|$|E
500|$|The {{teaching}} of anatomy in Britain was transformed by Sir John Struthers, Regius Professor of Anatomy at the University of Aberdeen from 1863 to 1889. He {{was responsible for}} setting <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> of three years of [...] "pre-clinical" [...] academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy. This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003. As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy, published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the Tay Whale. From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the {{teaching of}} anatomy in medical schools. Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching. Ignaz Semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused. He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives. The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth. Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically.|$|E

As well, the systems need to be easy and quick to set up. Sound reinforcement companies have responded to this demand by offering equipment that fulfills multiple roles, such as powered mixers (a mixer with an integrated power amplifier and effects) and powered subwoofers (a subwoofer with an integrated power amplifier and crossover). These products minimize the amount of wiring connections that bands have to make to set <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> and they take less time to set up. Some subwoofers have metal speaker mount holes built into the top, so that they can double as a base for the stand-mounted full-range PA speaker cabinets.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the history}} of the ILA, the port of Baltimore, which was a sixth largest port in the world around the start of the 20th century, had a unique impact on the legacy of the Longshoremen's Union. Unlike the Port of New York or Boston which were {{dominated}} by Irish and German immigrants, Baltimore's stevedores and longshoremen were overwhelmingly Polish. In the 1930s about eighty percent of the Baltimore's longshoremen were Polish or of Polish descent. The port of Baltimore had an international reputation of fast cargo handling credited to the well-organized gang system that was nearly free of corruption, wildcat strikes and constant work stoppages unlike its other East coast counterparts. In fact, the New York Anti-Crime Commission and the Waterfront Commission of New York looked upon the Baltimore system as the ideal one for all ports.The hiring of longshoremen in Baltimore by the gang system dates back to 1913, when the ILA was first formed. The Polish longshoremen began setting <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> by selecting the most skilled men to lead them. This newly formed gang would usually work for the same company, which would give the priority to the gang. During the times where there was no work within the particular company, the gang would work elsewhere, or even divide to aid other groups in their work, which would speed up the work and would make it more efficient. In an environment as dangerous as a busy waterfront, the Baltimore's gangs always operated together as a unit, because the experience let them know what each member would do at any given time making a water front a much safer place. [...] At the beginning of the Second World War Polish predominance in the Port of Baltimore would significantly diminish as many Poles left to fight the war.|$|E
