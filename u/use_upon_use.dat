40|$|To {{explain the}} {{survival}} of uses, alias trusts, after the Statute of Uses, one is probably justified in assuming a sympathetic attitude toward this Equitable institution {{on the part of}} the Common Law Judges. Maitland, Equity, 29. But, however predisposed the Judges might be, they would have to satisfy themselves, perhaps others as well, that they were interpreting rather than nullifying the Statute. Only such uses could be saved as could be 2 ̆ 2 distinguished. 2 ̆ 2 The case of the <b>use</b> raised <b>upon</b> a chattel interest is clear enough, as it was without the letter, and fairly without the mischief, of the Statute. The case of the <b>use</b> <b>upon</b> a <b>use,</b> while obscure at an earlier day, was elucidated by Mr. Ames, who found the key to the riddle in the fact that, at the time of the enactment and for a century thereafter., there was no such thing as a <b>use</b> <b>upon</b> a <b>use,</b> the declaration of a second use being void for repugnancy, in Equity as well as at Law. Lectures on Legal History, 243. The case of the active use, however, seems to the writer to need further explanation than it has yet received...|$|R
50|$|The play {{goals and}} game {{experience}} of the Internet version resemble the board game version. Players are issued tiles which are then used to create interlocking words. If a player has difficulty placing a tile, that player may dump the tile into the bunch and take three more. Depending on game mode, a player may also peel or take one letter at a time once all of their displayed tiles have been <b>used.</b> <b>Upon</b> complete <b>use</b> of a player’s allotted tiles, they declare Bananas. If all words are legal, the player wins; if not, the player is given Rotten Bananas and {{is out of the}} game.For example, proper nouns and foreign words are not considered legal words. Players with non-legal words in solo games will receive a time penalty.|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} this {{monograph}} of Informing Science is a dialectic perceived to exist between meaningful <b>use</b> and reflection <b>upon</b> <b>use.</b> This dialectic between use and reflection on use (or thinking, and thinking about thinking) may be consdiered in the following way. Each of these elements is subject to change. As reflection triggers change in use, and such change triggers further reflection, a spiral comes about. Lived human experience and reflection upon experience seem to shape a double helix. This monograph contains contributions exploring particular ways in which studies of use could benefit from a relationship to philosophical frameworks such as hermeneutics and phenomenolog...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the theme}} of this monograph, this paper {{discusses}} a dialectic we perceive to subsist between meaningful <b>use</b> and reflection <b>upon</b> <b>use.</b> This dialectic between experiencing <b>use</b> and reflecting <b>upon</b> experiencing <b>use</b> (or thinking, and thinking about thinking) may be considered in the following way. Each of these elements is subject to change. As reflection triggers change in use, and such change triggers further reflection, a spiral comes about. Lived human experience, and reflection upon that experience, seems to shape a double helix. In this paper, the authors suggest a need for a hermeneutically-informed, phenomenological approach when considering the complexities of informing systems, viewed as human activity systems. It is suggested that human actors, as users of informing systems, must own and control any inquiry into use in relation to design for themselves, and that individual sensemaking processes are the key to successful interaction within the double helix metaphor...|$|R
