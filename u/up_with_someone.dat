On the same day, police investigated the possibility that the girls had arranged to meet <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> from an internet chat room, but this was later ruled out. On 10 August, a reconstruction of the girls' movements was produced using two child actresses to encourage witnesses to come forward.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards breaking <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are not all about how [...] "a boy broke your heart and you're never going to get on your feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E
500|$|Speaking {{shortly after}} the overdubbing sessions, Spector {{said that he had}} asked whether any of the Beatles would like to help him produce the album, but none of them had wanted to. He also said that his hand was forced into {{remixing}} [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] due to the poor quality of Lennon's bass playing. Others agreed: in his book Revolution in the Head Beatles scholar Ian MacDonald wrote: [...] "The song was designed as a standard to be taken up by mainstream balladeers. [...] It features some atrocious bass-playing by Lennon, prodding clumsily around as if uncertain of the harmonies and making many comical mistakes. Lennon's crude bass playing on 'The Long and Winding Road,' though largely accidental, amounts to sabotage when presented as finished work." [...] Spector said that McCartney was being hypocritical in his criticism: [...] "Paul had no problem picking up the Academy Award for the Let It Be movie soundtrack, nor did he have any problem in using my arrangement of the string and horn and choir parts when he performed it during 25 years of touring on his own. If Paul wants to get into a pissing contest about it, he's got me mixed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> who gives a shit." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1996 Valdobrev {{married his}} high school love Jana. [...] "We have many shared {{memories}} as childhood sweethearts in Stara Zagora. We were 10 when we first met. Our parents were coming back from an excursion, we {{got off the bus}} at the same station and headed in different directions. After a few meters I stopped and turned to look back. She had stopped too and was looking at me. We stood like that for a few moments, staring at each other, our parents holding our hands. Growing <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone's</b> memories and making that journey through adulthood together is probably what makes a relationship strong. No one knows me better than Jana." [...] In 1998 Jana gave birth to their daughter Maria. Three weeks after that Valdobrev had a terrible car accident that almost cost him his life and kept him immovable and out of action for a year. For that reason he couldn’t join Regis Wargnier’s Oscar-nominated film production East/West, for which he'd been cast to play opposite Catherine Deneuve and Sandrine Bonnaire.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, Will visits Psychic Sue (Camryn Manheim) at her home. Psychic Sue begins Will's reading {{which leads}} {{her to tell}} him that she is sensing a [...] "trip", not for him, but {{intended}} for someone close to him, and that she is [...] "getting" [...] China. Will is puzzled to hear that a [...] "strawberry blond hair woman, with brown eyes" [...] still loves him, and he reveals to Psychic Sue that he is gay. Will tells Grace of what occurred with Psychic Sue, which leads to Grace [...] "tripping" [...] over the steps in the kitchen, and her saying [...] "I just broke my grandmother's China." [...] Will reacts to what Psychic Sue told him. He also learns that his parents send him a package containing photos of his deceased dog, Daisy, who had [...] "thick coat of strawberry blond hair." [...] Will revisits Psychic Sue with the intention of knowing about his future love life. She tells Will that the man he will end up with is named [...] "Jack". Will tells Grace about his return visit to Psychic Sue and how he will end <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> named [...] "Jack". Will is frightened of the idea that he and his friend Jack, also gay, will end up together. Will finally tells Jack what the psychic said, which horrifies Jack, but Will and Jack realize they are meant to stay together, just in the non-romantic relationship they have always had.|$|E
2500|$|... "Maybe" [...] is the album's seventh song, {{which was}} also written three years before the album was {{released}} and before she met {{all the people who}} worked on the album with her and herself and Paul Herman, who has previously worked with Dido and Jessie J wrote the track. The song is about confusion, {{and the fact that you}} don't know for sure when you break <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> in a relationship if this person was not the love of your life and there is a question whether you have made the right decision.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Bellisario {{said that}} he [...] "kind of [...] what's going on now" [...] {{and that it was}} {{unlikely}} that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future. De Pablo agreed, saying, [...] "I would think if the characters get together, the whole mystery would be done. I {{think it will be a}} lot more fun to play the tension." [...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the things that come out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E

2500|$|Propelled by {{a string}} of hit singles, Tango in the Night became the band's biggest album since Rumours a decade earlier. However, {{following}} its release, Buckingham left Fleetwood Mac largely because of his desire not to tour and the strain he was feeling within the band. [...] "I needed to get some separation from Stevie especially, because I don't think I'd ever quite gotten closure on our relationship," [...] he said. [...] "I needed {{to get on with}} the next phase of my creative growth and my emotional growth. When you break <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> and then for the next 10 years you have to be around them and do for them and watch them move away from you, it's not easy." [...] Fleetwood Mac continued without him, and Buckingham was replaced by guitarists Rick Vito and Billy Burnette.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were many}} {{variants}} on the slave archetype. The old darky or old uncle formed {{the head of}} the idyllic black family. Like other slave characters, he was highly musical and none-too-bright, but he had favorable aspects like his loving nature and the sentiments he raised regarding love for the aged, ideas of old friendships, and the cohesiveness of the family. His death and the pain it caused his master was a common theme in sentimental songs. Alternatively, the master could die, leaving the old darky to mourn. Stephen Foster's [...] "Old Uncle Ned" [...] was the most popular song on this subject. Less frequently, the old darky might be cast out by a cruel master when he grew too old to work. After the Civil War, this character became the most common figure in plantation sketches. He frequently cried about the loss of his home during the war, only to meet <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> from the past such as the child of his former master. In contrast, the trickster, often called Jasper Jack, appeared less frequently.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{arrived at}} the scene around 11:45p.m. After about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a {{flashlight}} in his face, blinding him. Hollis, {{not sure if it}} was a prank or if he had been mistaken for someone else, told the man, [...] "Fellow, you've got me mixed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> else. You've got the wrong man." [...] The man had a pistol and told him something like, [...] "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say", and ordered them {{to get out of the}} car. They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object. Larey explained in an interview three months later with Texarkana Gazette reporter Lucille Holland that the noise was so loud she thought he had been shot, but she learned later it was the sound of his skull cracking.|$|E

40|$|Queuing up to buy myself {{lunch in}} the media tent at CHOGM {{a couple of weeks}} ago, I came across a {{depressing}} scene. A British journalist was haranguing the three people behind the counter, one of them on the verge of tears, the others stunned into silence, because the opening hours of the cafeteria didn’t suit his work schedule. It’s difficult to stand by while someone loudly makes the same point again and again, especially when you’re hungry, so I mildly suggested that he take <b>up</b> the question <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> who might conceivably have some control over opening hours, rather than harrassing the counter staff...|$|R
60|$|I couldn't {{follow the}} train of thought.

I was wondering if he couldn't have got me mixed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> else, when the telephone-bell rang outside in the hall, and the maid came in to say that I was wanted.

5000|$|After {{the release}} of Switched-On Bach, Carlos was invited to compose the soundtrack of two science fiction films, Marooned (1969), {{directed}} by John Sturges, and A Clockwork Orange (1971) by Stanley Kubrick. When the directors of Marooned changed their minds to include a soundtrack, Carlos chose to work with Kubrick, as she and Elkind were fans of his previous films, adding: [...] "We finally wound <b>up</b> talking <b>with</b> <b>someone</b> who had a close connection to Stanley Kubrick's lawyer. We suddenly got an invitation to fly to London". Before Carlos knew about the offer, she read the book and began writing a piece based on it named [...] "Timesteps". A soundtrack containing only the film cuts of the score was released as Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange in 1972, combining synthesized and classical music by Henry Purcell, Beethoven and Gioacchino Rossini with an early use of a vocoder. The album peaked the Billboard 200 chart at No. 146. Later that year, Carlos released an album of music {{not included in the}} final score titled Walter Carlos' Clockwork Orange. Carlos later described the project as [...] "a lot of fun ... a pleasurable venture".|$|R
