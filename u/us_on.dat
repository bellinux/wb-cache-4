If we are cruel, and wrathful, and so go down to hell, God is there also--in wrath: with the clean He will be clean, with the froward man He will be froward. In God we live and move, and have our being. <b>On</b> <b>us,</b> and <b>on</b> <b>us</b> alone, it depends, what sort of a life we shall live, and whether our being shall be happy or miserable. <b>On</b> <b>us,</b> and <b>on</b> <b>us</b> alone, it depends, whether we shall live under God's anger, or live under God's love. <b>On</b> <b>us,</b> and <b>on</b> <b>us</b> alone, it depends whether the eternal and {{unchangeable}} God shall be to us a consuming fire, or light, and life, and bliss for evermore.|$|R
