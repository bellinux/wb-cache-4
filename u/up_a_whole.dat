Each bit can only be a zero or a one, so if you know which bit is wrong, then it can be corrected. In a landmark paper published in 1950, he introduced a concept {{of the number of}} positions in which two code words differ, and therefore how many changes are required to transform one code word into another, which is today known as the Hamming distance. Hamming thereby created a family of mathematical error-correcting code, which are called Hamming codes. This not only solved an important problem in telecommunications and computer science, it opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new field of study.|$|E

25|$|Because the pseudonymous authors write from {{perspectives}} {{which are}} not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy {{mentioned in this article}} may or may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.|$|E

Two major academic projects have looked at Ruskin and cultural tourism (investigating, for example, Ruskin's links with Thomas Cook); the other focuses on Ruskin and the theatre. The sociologist and media theorist, David Gauntlett, argues that Ruskin's notions of craft can be traced to today's online community at YouTube and throughout Web 2.0. Similarly, architectural theorist Lars Spuybroek has argued that Ruskin's understanding of the Gothic as a combination of two types of variation, rough savageness and smooth changefulness, opens <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new way of thinking leading to digital and so-called parametric design.|$|E

25|$|Resistance: Fall of Man is a first-person shooter set in an {{alternate}} history. Many of its gameplay features stem from this, {{most notably the}} weapons. Some weapons are based on real weapons circa the 1950s, while some weapons are futuristically altered {{in accordance with the}} game's storyline. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles, such as those found in the Ratchet and Clank series, with its proprietary development engine and physics system to create unique human and Chimeran weaponry. Each weapon provides a unique play style and strategy. An example of this is found with the Auger (Chimeran). The primary fire for this weapon is simple rapid fire, but the bullets burrow through walls, actually coming out stronger on the other side, opening <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new level of strategy. The secondary fire creates a barrier that is resistant to all bullets but its own. In addition to the usual short- and long-range weapons, the game features several different types of grenades, with both historical and futuristic varieties. For example, one grenade, known as the Backlash grenade, is capable of creating a dome-shaped barrier, where the player can enter for cover. The barrier reflects shots from opposing Chimera. Some weapons are not available on the first play-through of the game but can be found at certain locations on replaying the game.|$|E

[...] This is {{in stark contrast to}} the recording of The High End of Low (2009) and Born Villain, when he was frequently [...] "dragged into the studio" [...] late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying that he realized after the first performance of [...] "Birds of Hell Awaiting" [...] that [...] " [...] just sang it.

Warner Bros. refused to release the album as a Tony Iommi solo release, instead insisting on using the name Black Sabbath.

[...] "It opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> can of worms really", Iommi explained, [...] "because I think if we could have done it as a solo album, it would have been accepted a lot more." [...] Seventh Star, which sounded little like a Black Sabbath album, incorporated more hard rock elements popularised by the 1980s Sunset Strip hard rock scene, and was panned by the critics of the era, although later reviewers such as Allmusic gave the album favourable reviews, calling the album [...] "often misunderstood and underrated".|$|E

[...] Heylin adds that [...] "It's Alright, Ma" [...] probably contained more [...] "memorable aphorisms" [...] than any of Dylan's songs. One of these lines is [...] "he not busy being born is busy dying," [...] from the song's second verse, which was used by Jimmy Carter in his [...] 1976 presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. During his presidential [...] campaign in 2000, Al Gore told talk show host Oprah Winfrey that this was his favorite quotation.

500|$|The first Mega Man gameâ€”released in 1987â€”was not {{successful}} {{enough to justify}} the immediate development of a sequel. According to Roy Ozaki, director Akira Kitamura had {{wanted to make a}} sequel to Mega Man, but producer Tokuro Fujiwara was against it. Kitamura then went to Capcom Vice-President to get permission to make the game. [...] Capcom allowed the development team to create a sequel on the condition that they work concurrently on other projects as well. The staff spent their own time on the project to improve upon the original by adding more levels and weapons, as well as improving the graphics. The project supervisor of the first Mega Man invited Inafune to the sequel's development crew; Inafune was working on a separate game at the time. In the previous title, Inafune worked as an artist and character designer but became more involved in the production process of the sequel. [...] "Working on [...] marked my second year at this, and I even got to mentor a 'new kid', which opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new world of stress for me," [...] Inafune recounted.

Work on the grandstand and the seating round the oval has been proceeded with at top speed, and spectators at the game tomorrow should have little to complain of." [...] The first game between teams representing the northern and southern halves of Tasmania took place at the oval in August 1923 in front of a crowd of 9,441. A reporter from The Examiner commented: [...] "The oval is in good order and well grassed and the new motor mower copes with the latter very effectively under favourable conditions. The whole five acres can be cut in six hours, as compared with twenty hours by the horse mower." [...] When the ground was harrowed, glass and other debris would surface; a contemporary observer, John Orchard, later remembered: [...] "they'd line <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> group of people, perhaps thirty or forty players, and we'd go along with a container alongside each other and we'd pick up everything that was likely to hurt a player." ...|$|E

Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E

2500|$|To {{explain the}} process, {{consider}} {{one third of}} one quarter. Using {{the example of a}} cake, if three small slices of equal size make up a quarter, and four quarters make <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole,</b> twelve of these small, equal slices make <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole.</b> Therefore, a third of a quarter is a twelfth. Now consider the numerators. The first fraction, two thirds, is twice as large as one third. Since one third of a quarter is one twelfth, two thirds of a quarter is two twelfth. [...] The second fraction, three quarters, is three times as large as one quarter, so two thirds of three quarters is three times as large as two thirds of one quarter. Thus two thirds times three quarters is six twelfths.|$|E
