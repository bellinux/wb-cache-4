The cognitive control loops determines urgency of network <b>alarms,</b> processes <b>urgent</b> <b>alarms</b> more quickly, and then infers root causes of the problems based on learning and reasoning. We show that we reduce a number of alarms by correlation and detect alarm priorities using an ontology model based on the policy...|$|R
40|$|We are {{witnessing}} a large increase of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) deployments, used to sense, monitor {{and act on}} the environment, because cable-free solutions are easier to deploy. However, in industrial applications, WSNs still aren’t seen as a viable option because of the required fast sampling rates and the reduced time delay, particularly in a multi-hop deployment where traffic congestion may occur. Message losses are unacceptable, particularly in what concerns critical messages containing actuation instructions or other urgent data, which may have time-constraint requirements that cannot be guaranteed. Our research focuses on integrating traffic-aware data processing strategies and network traffic prioritization to overcome congestion states, in order to guarantee that <b>urgent</b> <b>alarms</b> and commands are enacted in time. Traffic is divided into <b>urgent</b> messages (<b>alarms</b> and actuation commands), that have time-delivery requirements; and the remaining periodic sensed data. In this paper we propose an integrated approach NetDP, which applies adaptable data processing strategies (DP) and traffic reduction (DP-Manager) policies to ensure that application requirements are satisfied with minimal message losses, while simultaneously guaranteeing timely delivery of alarms. We demonstrate that NETDP solution with different data processing strategies and levels of system stress can efficiently guarantee the timely delivery of alarms and actuation messages. ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that urgent auditory warnings are likely to annoy drivers. Increased urgency could also raise drivers’ stress levels, which in turn could impact their ability to detect and react to subsequent changes in the traffic environment. We conducted a simulator experiment with 24 truck drivers to investigate the potential of <b>urgent</b> <b>alarms</b> to raise annoyance and negatively affect drivers’ subsequent responses to unrelated, critical events on the road. The drivers received two types of warnings that were designed to significantly differ in perceived urgency. Several times in the trial, an unexpected event occurred just seconds after drivers were presented with an unrelated warning, and the drivers had to brake immediately to avoid a collision. The results indicate that acoustic characteristics and semantic meaning may impact the perceived annoyance of in-vehicle warnings. Interestingly, we found a significant, negative correlation between the drivers’ experience (years of truck driving experience) and the rated annoyance for both types of warnings. Also, the drivers who received the high-urgency warning braked significantly harder and tended to brake later than the drivers who received a low-urgency warning. These results have implications for ITS systems for heavy vehicles that intend to implement auditory warning signals...|$|R

40|$|REMPLI PLC {{network is}} {{designed}} {{to cope with the}} specific characteristics of the communication channel. In [1], we have shown its good behaviours from the network performance point of view (minimized network transfer delay with small protocol overheads). However, when the REMPLI PLC is used for supporting REMPLI applications which share the same available bandwidth but require different quality of service (e. g. periodic transfer for network management services, short end to end delay for aperiodic data request services, <b>urgent</b> <b>alarm</b> handling, etc.), the REMPLI PLC must also give the possibility to serve those applications differently in order to satisfy their different QoS (Quality of Service) requirements. This comes to say that a traffic scheduling policy must be defined and implemented. The purpose of this document is, on the one hand, to describe the traffic scheduling policy adopted in REMPLI PLC as well as its implementation under the name of Dispatcher, {{and on the other hand}} to prove its benefice in providing for the different application traffic with the differentiated QoS. In this sense, the Dispatcher ensures therefore the QoS mapping between an application and a REMPLI PLC network traffic class. This document first recalls the application services defined within the REMPLI project, gives then the traffic classes that the REMPLI PLC network supports as well as the mapping between them. The adopted network traffic scheduling policy is then explained and the principle of the dispatcher described. Finally simulations have been carried out showing the interest of the proposed dispatcher...|$|E

40|$|Additional sound {{capabilities}} in visually advanced simulators may offer researchers and practitioners better resources to evaluate in-vehicle auditory signals and advanced auditory displays. In {{the first part}} of the present report, the implementation of a new audio system in the Scania truck cabin for the driving simulators II and III at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI) is described. The new audio software is based on the Open Audio Library (OpenAL) implementation for the Macintosh Operating System OS X. It communicates with the existing simulator software using the Open Sound Control (OSC) standard. The remaining program code is open, which offers the possibility of adapting the audio system to future demands and specific needs of partners within the competence centre ViP (Virtual Prototyping and Assessment by Simulation). Another aim of the present project was to investigate the potential of <b>urgent</b> <b>alarms</b> to raise annoyance and negatively affect drivers 9 ̆ 2 subsequent responses to unrelated, critical events on the road.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Highly-automated {{vehicles}} {{will provide the}} freedom for drivers to engage in secondary activities while the vehicle is in control. However, little is known regarding the nature of activities that drivers will undertake, and how these may impact drivers’ ability to resume manual control. In a novel, long-term, qualitative simulator study, six experienced drivers completed the same 30 -minute motorway journey (portrayed as their commute to work) {{at the same time}} on five consecutive weekdays in a highly-automated car; a system ‘health-bar’ indicated the overall status of the automated system during each drive. Participants were invited to bring with them any objects or devices that they would expect to use in their own (automated) vehicle during such a journey, and use these freely during the drives. Inclement weather (heavy fog) on the penultimate day of testing presented an unexpected, emergency 5. 0 -second take-over request (indicated by an <b>urgent</b> auditory <b>alarm</b> and a flashing visual icon replacing a system ‘health-bar’). Thematic video analysis shows that participants were quickly absorbed by a variety of secondary activities/devices, which typically demanded high levels of visual, manual and cognitive attention, and postural adaptation (e. g. moving/reclining the driver’s seat). The steering wheel was routinely used as a support for objects/devices. Drivers were required to rapidly discharge secondary devices/activities and reestablish driving position/posture following the unexpected, emergency hand-over request on day four. This resulted in notable changes in participants’ subjective ratings of trust {{on the final day of}} testing, with some participants apparently more sceptical of the system following the emergency hand-over event, whereas others were more trusting than before. Qualitative results are presented and discussed in the context of the re-design of vehicles to enable the safe and comfortable execution of secondary activities during high-automation, while enabling effective transfer of control...|$|R
