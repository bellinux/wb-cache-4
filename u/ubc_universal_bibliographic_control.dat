The main purpose of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> is to identify all material published in the world, regardless their format (paper, audiovisual, electronic, and whatever) and to make accessible this information to everyone. To achieve <b>universal</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> it is necessary that all the countries around the world carry out national <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> to register all the materials published in them. The basic instrument to gather and to identify materials produced in a particular country is its legislation on legal deposit, which has specific features in diverse local settings. Likewise, it is indispensable to register these materials in national bibliographies, using international standards, usually generated by the national library or other entity with similar responsibilities.

40|$|The {{scientific}} and technological developments, added to the social, economic and cultural transformations encountered during the recent years, have caused a speedy {{increase in the number}} of publications in these fields. If we are to assume that the objects of the libraries developing among the modern communities is to compile, as soon as possible, these products of information, preserve and arrange them into a system readily to serve those needing same, we must then also agree that the profession of library is indeed faced with enormously heavy responsibilities. In view of this situation, which we may call a "Publication Explotion", librarians and searchers have sicked effective methods and finally developed immense libraries, documentation centers and set up to develop an inter-organizational or even international world wide cooperation to deal with the situation. "Bibliographic Control" which means the organization and classification of the available publications, an objective pursued for long years, has tended the international organizations and experts to unite around this subject. "Bibliographic Control" runs back to many years. It was then known as "Bibliographic Organization" under which various attempts had been made both at individual and regional levels but none could prove sufficient to achieve the desired objectives. UNESCO interested itself with the subject for the first time in 1950. Coming forward with the repuired recommendations in respect of bibliographic activities, it outlined the duties of both, the member nations and those of UNESCO. The national programme for acpuisition and cataloging which was sponsored by the Library of Congress in 1965, and the "Shared Cataloging Programme" resulting out of these acti vities, were the main subjects of the 1966 IFLA Conference, where it has been referred to as the "Universal Bibliographic Control" (UBC). As a widely represented international organization, IFLA considered the international <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control,</b> a process ranging from the printing of the publication to its cataloging in the libraries, to be one of its duties. This call of the President, recommending that the concept of "Universal Bibliographic Control" be one of the main objectives of IFLA, met the positive respond of UNESCO and 190 other organizations. Eventually at the Grenoble meeting of IFLA, held in August 1973, <b>Universal</b> <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Control</b> was accepted as a general repuirement and was discussed accordingly. The repuirements, first referred to in an article by Franz-George Kaltwasser and later in the report of Dorothy Anderson, served as basic objectives for the development of the UBC process. Accordingly, to enable IFLA to start and pursue such a programme it was necessary that certain attempts were made; 1 - national level 2 - international level. If it is assumed that <b>Universal</b> <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Control</b> is a process ranging from securing a systematic workability of the bibliographic data to the printing of the publications in any part of the world and cataloging them into the libraries, it would then call for a sound systematic flow of information, an adequate clear leveling of innovations, the serial resolution of various problems, as well as research, cooperation, standardization and completion of the projects under hand. As it had already pointed out, to enable the implementation of the recommendations to be achieved on the national level, it is necessary that the problems enumerated above be first solved on national level. In the light of the national requirements indicated in the reports of the above mentioned writers, these problems may be listed as following; 1 - Collection laws: The generally accepted procedure of collecting publications is the system of "Deposit Copies". Under this collection procedure, certain copies of each new publication are delivered to a national center. 2 - Standardization: Following the collection of all publications and relevant information through the collection laws and similar procedures, comes the stage of recording. To enable this recording work to be carried out exactly and prompyly, as well as the maintenance of a smooth exchange of information it is necessary that all available data be most comprehensively standardized. It is further necessary that standardization is mainly carried out in the following fields: a- Standardization of cataloging and subject analysis, b- Standardization of physical transportation and computerized programmes. 3 - The establishment of a national bibliographic organization for carrying out all this work. Assuming that the national library would be the most suitable organization, eqaiped 192 with best technical means and personnel repaired for ful filling international standarts and other repuirements for <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control,</b> it would be natural to accept that the "National Library" should be the only organization authorized with the collection of all publications and relevant information in accordance with the collection law, which is one of the national objectives for the national <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control.</b> In this respect, the joint activities of IFLA during the 1961 Paris and 1969 Kopenhagen international coordination and cataloging meetings are the only visible developments. Thus the first extensive activities for the standardization of the bibliographic records were organized and partly realized by IFLA in 1961. Similarly matters such as cataloging methods were tabled for the first time with an international meeting, thus enabling the elimination of big differences in respect of the system of entry. Inspite of lack of an international cataloging method, the Anglo American Cataloging Rules (AACR) is the most widely used in ternational cataloging method. In order to standardize the types of entry, which is a special problem of the alphabetical cataloging, the IFLA Committee of Cataloging has developed an International Standart Bibliographic Description ISBD (M) for monographs. Further the IFLA Committee on Serials has developed an International Standart Bibliographic Description for serial publications ISBD (S). The concept of the <b>Universal</b> <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Control</b> which has been developed for organizing the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> activities at international level, has taken place at the National Information System (NATIS) Programme of Paris in 1974. Accordingly governments and public institutions' authorities have been urged to shoulder certain responsibilities for providing information and training people on these matters. Particularly in the developing countries, the <b>Universal</b> <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Control</b> (<b>UBC)</b> has been successful only when it has been included into the development plan, within the National Information System. In Turkey, the <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Control</b> which is most essential, is apparently being carried out by "Milli Kütüphane" (National Library) which is the national bibliographic center. Also efforts in this field are not as old as those in the developed countries, individual and regional efforts seem to be rather successful. Although collection and standardization, which are essential for <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control,</b> are considered as objectives in Turkey, one can hardly assert that they function effectively. Due to certain deficiencies in collection and loop holes in the standardization, plus the circumstances facing the National Library prevent a proper <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control.</b> To start and maintain an enermous matter, such as <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> programme, cannot be possibly tackled singly by any country. Nor can it be pursued independently from the international activities. It is most essential that Turkey sympathises with the NATIS and UBC programmes and starts to adopt and apply all decisions taken in the field of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> without delay...|$|R

Supported by IFLA, this conceptual change resulted in the project for the revised edition of Guidelines for authority and reference entries which is now ready under the new title Guidelines for authority records and references. The uniform heading is keeping its meaning within the same cataloguing rules but authorised heading is introduced as relevant for linking authority records internationally.

That information is generated {{on the face of}} African continent on daily bases is not in doubt as printing and publishing has become the order of the day. Libraries and information centers are expected to record and make available all that is written on request. <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> has become a major determinant of book accessibility and utilization and a key factor to information search. In many countries of the world, individuals are the chief initiators of this project and because of its place in enlightened societies, nations and international bodies have tackled this problem with all seriousness it deserves. UNESCO, for instance, has taken the bull by the horn and even formed other sub-bodies such as universal availability of publications, (UAP); universal availability of information (UAI) among others, to tackle the problem of <b>universal</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> (<b>UBC)</b> and Africa is not left out. According to Fourie and Burger (2007), the <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> project is very important, fundamental and indispensable to countries like South Africa that the effort put forward by her is currently unmatchable by any African country. The fact that a book is recorded in the library, internet, or the information centre is enough to give hope to the needful potential user that {{it may be possible to}} access and utilize it. Informational materials like books, journals, manuscripts, theses, dissertations, magazines, newspapers and a host of others are written, printed and published. As time goes on, precise data about these materials begin to wane. Their existence are usually ignored or forgotten by many, except they are included in the bibliography- the listing of the materials But the listing must be in a particular pertain which must be systematic to accommodate essential bibliographic elements which could enable a potential user to decide to trace it when in need This calls for a pattern of effective recording and arrangement which result from systematic listing of the records of human communication. One current type of bibliography, according to World Book Encyclopedia (2002) presents a systematic description of books as well as list them, summarizing what each book is about as well as its currency, binding publisher and its value. When each country seriously undertakes this task of ensuring that every book is captured under this scheme, it becomes a national bibliography; and the collective effort by various nations of the universe is the UBC. The efforts put up by individual countries in Africa will be the focus of this work. The author will consider this article under the following headings: a} <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> activities on Africa c} Problems with the compilation of Bibliographies in Africa d} Ways of enhancing <b>Universal</b> <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>Control</b> in Africa <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> activities on Africa <b>Bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> activities have generally developed in Africa randomly over the years.

This was the conceit effort made by South African Librarians towards the attainment of <b>universal</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> According to Aje (1977 : 16 (3), Sierra Leone was the first West African country to have a national bibliography.

Luke was a colonial secretary for Sierra Leone and apparently had searched important libraries in London and the secretariat library in Freetown and came out with his work entitled “A Bibliography of Sierra Leone” Another individual named Cardinell, (Aje 1977; 21 (7)) concentrated on Ghana for a national retrospective bibliography, entitled “A Bibliography of the Gold Coast 1496 - 1931 ” published in 1932. Sources of his information are said to be 19 th century work was pioneered by the Basel mission who set up printing and publishing enterprise in the field of religious publications. On the government side where activities commenced earlier than the Bassel Mission, Cardinell recorded that government printing press started functioning after 1875, producing government gazettes and reports. Thus, the first listing of government publication was part of the colonial report on the Gold Coast. All these were precursors of the monumental work produced by A. W. Cardinell. A UNESCO document by Beaudiquez (1977 : 99) also named Burundi as another country with retrospective national bibliography compiled by individual effort. Daniel Nyambarize, librarian at Universite du Burundi institute universitaire des sciences de L’ Education centre Recherche’s et de Documentation, pedagogique, compiled a bibliography “Le Burundi: essai d” une bibliographic 1959 – 1973. This was a list of publications, research reports and periodicals published between 1959 and 1973 and held in Burundi National Library. The UNESCO document by Beaudiquez (1977 : 419) states further that Benin Republic is another country with retrospective national bibliography compiled by an individual called Guillaume Da Silva. It was published by the Institute de Recherche Applique es du Benin (IRAB). No date of publication was given by this source. Other African countries with retrospective national bibliographies by individuals include Chad (1968); Costa Rice (1958); Guinea (1964); Ivory Coast (1972 - 1974); Libya (1951 - 1971); Madagascar (1952); Morocco (1970); South Africa (1910) and Zambia (no date). These retrospective bibliographies are attempts to compile all the works published in these individual countries. A close look at this same UNESCO document (1977 : 419) shows that eighteen (18) other African countries, apart from the thirteen (13) mentioned here have national bibliographies compiled by depository centers. And some of these countries have legal deposit decrees backing them up from the central government. These show a great progress made in the development of Africa’s Continental Bibliography. Another study by Samuel Kotie (1971 : 14), on the development of library studies, University of Ghana identified thirty two current national bibliographies for African countries by 1969. Whereas, at the time the International Conference on African Bibliography (1970 : 1) was held in Nairobi, Kenya from December 4 - 8, 1967, only nine African countries were listed as having national bibliographies in the true sense of the word. These include, Ethiopia Madagascar, Malawi, Nigeria, Rhodesia, Senegal, South Africa, Sierra Leone and Tanzania. Another writer on bibliography, Amosu (1968 : 14 - 18), explained the issue of the availability of bibliographies of all types on Africa subject and national bibliographies produced on Africa. She also explored methods of <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control</b> of materials on Africa, the problem of coordination for complete coverage and avoidance of serious duplication amongst other considerations. In Nigeria, the National Library of Nigeria has been charged with these responsibilities of compiling; coordinating and publishing the bibliography of all published materials on Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|Schuman (1995) {{posits that}} the {{publishers}} {{are beginning to}} realize that although they create books, librarians have tremendous power to influence readers. This statement may not totally apply to the situation in Nigeria. This is because the intellectual and commercial processes through which books are written, published and distributed, sold and used have become systematically and rigorously distorted by the unwholesome activities of some of the publishers, government officials and their agencies. The librarians have slim chances to influence readers through a professionally planned collection development policy in Nigeria. The paths of the publishers and librarians hardly across in Nigeria. The opportunity for interaction between the librarians and publishers are slim at professional and business levels. This is due to greed, ignorance or sheer inertia {{on the part of the}} publishers and governments in Nigeria – federal, state and local. Book business is big business in Nigeria. Book purchase by government officials and their agencies is big business smacking of corruption and fraudulent practices. It involves heavy bulks ranging into billion of Naira (country currency) and cutting across the three levels of government in Nigeria. This implies that books are purchased at the Federal, State and Local Government levels. The librarians at all the levels and institutions of service are not often involved in book acquisition policies, planning and strategies. Book are purchased directly from the publishers (home and abroad) by government agents and politically appointed contractors. The contractors could be cement or building materials dealers but who have some persons in government and had turned book vendors over night because of the opportunity the corrupt setting has provided. Therefore, in Nigeria book are created by the same system that ensures that books are purchased (at home and abroad) whether relevant or not, and forced up onto the shelves of the librarians who characteristically ensures that the books are passed to the users in their professional ways. The professional relationship between the librarians and the publishers in Nigeria could best be described as loose or tenuous. The Librarian, however, has the professional mandate to give library and information services. In this wise, the librarian must create and make ISBD available for use by the society. Certainly, the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) is a creation of librarianship profession which duty it is to ensure that ISBD is developed, adopted or adapted by the library community for <b>universal</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control.</b> According to IFLA (2010) : The International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) is intended to serve as a principal standard to promote <b>universal</b> <b>bibliographic</b> <b>control,</b> that is, to make universally and promptly available, in a form that is internationally acceptable, basic bibliographic data for all published resources in all countries. The main goal of the ISBD is, and has been since the beginning to provide consistency when sharing bibliographic information. The ISBD is the standard that determines the data elements to be recorded or transcribed in a specific sequence as the basis of the description of the resources being catalogued. In addition, it employs prescribed punctuation as a means of recognizing and displaying data elements and making them understandable independently of the language of the description. The Nigeria National Library is saddled with the difficult task of getting the publishers to adopt the ISBD and apply it in their publishing practices. The National Library does this by organising national workshops, seminars and conferences. Also, the state branches of the National Library organise similar and complementary interactional meetings periodically in Nigeria. The International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) phenomenon raises the issue of professional practices in the book publishing industry and librarianship. These practices are meant to bring about easy and unrestricted access to published works all over the world. The practices are further enhanced by the presence of the ever pervading force of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the consequent globalisation and trade liberalisation. In short, ISBD epitomizes part of the professional relationship that exists between librarianship and the book publishing profession. Although the relationship has existed for centuries, recent developments in the body, direction and growth of information, knowledge and patterns of use have influenced the means and methods through which information and knowledge are processed and made available to users. Certainly, the vision and mission of IFLA in the development of ISBD is to establish a mechanism through which information and knowledge are made universally available in a stable and with sustainable methodology. This calls for a system that is universally applicable and acceptable to the librarians and publishers and to the benefit of the information and knowledge users of the book medium. Still talking about the interrelationship between these two great professions - librarianship and publishing, there is the need to highlight the fact that they have collectively contributed to the building of past and present civilizations. It is appropriate to state that the modern developments are founded and anchored on the professional collaboration between librarianship and publishing. The collaboration goes beyond the economic but into the cultural milieu. Schuman (1995) relates to this interrelationship between the librarians and the publishers as follows: Their relationships transcend mere market place of vendor/buyer transactions. While publishers and librarians have both traditionally viewed their respective missions as 2 ̆ 2 gatekeepers 2 ̆ 2 of information and culture, publishers are actually the true 2 ̆ 2 gatekeepers 2 ̆ 2; they decide what to publish, when to publish, whom to publish for and what to charge. Many publishing decisions have public, social, cultural, economic, educational, political impact. Librarians are actually the 2 ̆ 2 gateways 2 ̆ 2. Librarians support a significant portion of publishers output, they buy, organize, preserve, store, and disseminate it. Ideas are kept available, affordable, and accessible through libraries. How librarians perform these functions also has a crucial effect on the social, cultural, economic, educational, and political fabric of society. That fabric is woven when writers, researchers, and creators create new information and ideas. Synergy between a healthy publishing industry and healthy libraries is essential for a democratic society. Both librarians and publishers are vital to the public 2 ̆ 7 s right to know. In the process of information creation, dissemination and utilization, the librarians, publishers and scholars are natural and mutual partners. While the scholars need access to published materials in their variety, the traditional role of the library has been to expand their access by purchasing published materials and organizing them for appropriate retrieval. The development of the ISBD forms the link that helps to explain and demonstrate the obvious commonalities of mission and professional interest that mediate mutually supportive collaboration between librarians and publishers. Although, the librarians and publishers in the developed counties have enjoyed esteemed, effective and flexible collaboration, the situation in the developing nations of Africa is at a very low ebb. Both professions are frequently unaware of the methodologies, economic concerns and policies of the other...|$|R
