5|$|To {{encourage}} further discovery, {{researchers and}} policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development, including prizes, tax incentives, and advance market commitments. A number of groups, including the Stop TB Partnership, the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative, and the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation, {{are involved with}} research. Among these, the Aeras Global TB Vaccine Foundation received a gift of more than $280 million (<b>US)</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved vaccine against tuberculosis for use in high burden countries.|$|E
5|$|By 1999, {{computer}} systems and software had finally become sophisticated {{enough to allow}} for the ability to underlay on the same workstation satellite imagery, radar imagery, and model-derived fields such as atmospheric thickness and frontogenesis in combination with surface observations to make for the best possible surface analysis. In the United States, this development was achieved when Intergraph workstations were replaced by n-AWIPS workstations. By 2001, the various surface analyses done within the National Weather Service were combined into the Unified Surface Analysis, which is issued every six hours and combines the analyses of four different centers. Recent advances in both the fields of meteorology and geographic information systems have made it possible to devise finely tailored products that take <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> traditional weather map into an entirely new realm. Weather information can quickly be matched to relevant geographical detail. For instance, icing conditions can be mapped onto the road network. This will likely continue to lead to changes in the way surface analyses are created and displayed over the next several years.|$|E
5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{programming}} on C-SPAN3 from Monday through Friday features uninterrupted live {{public affairs}} events, in particular political events from Washington, D.C. Each weekend since January 8, 2011, {{the network has}} broadcast 48 hours of programming dedicated {{to the history of}} the United States, under the umbrella title American History TV. The programming covers the history of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> founding of the nation through the late 20th century. Programs include American Artifacts, which is dedicated to exploring museums, archives and historical sites, and Lectures in History, featuring major university history professors giving lectures on U.S. history. In 2009, C-SPAN3 aired an eight-installment series of interviews from the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, which featured historian Richard Norton Smith and Vice President Walter Mondale, among other interviewees.|$|E
5|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence of The Wind Will Carry <b>Us.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> outset, Kiarostami formulates a dialectical {{relationship between}} image and sound. The camera moves from long shots of the Land Rover winding {{its way through the}} mountain paths to extreme close-ups of the film’s protagonist. Concurrently, Kiarostami aurally represents an expanse that extends far beyond what the viewer can see at any moment, even when the camera remains a considerable distance from the subject matter on-screen. Kiarostami establishes numerous spaces beyond the visual field by fragmenting his soundtrack to include other sounds such as birds singing, dogs barking and electronic devices such as cell phones and radios blaring in the distance. By referring to characters the viewer does not see or hear, Kiarostami widens the scope of his films.|$|E

25|$|The first written {{account of}} present-day Alberta comes to <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fur trader Anthony Henday, who {{explored}} {{the vicinity of}} present-day Red Deer and Edmonton in 1754–55.

Other important early explorers of Alberta include Peter Fidler, David Thompson, Peter Pond, Alexander MacKenzie, and George Simpson. The first European settlement was founded at Fort Chipewyan by MacKenzie in 1788, although Fort Vermilion disputes this claim, having also been founded in 1788.|$|E

Her father asked her if she would like a gift instead that was better than a servant and worth more than everything in the world. Upon her ready agreement, he told her to recite {{at the end of every}} prayer the Great Exaltation, Allahu Akbar 34 times, the Statement of Absolute Gratitude, Alhamdulillah 33 times and the Invocation of Divine Glory, Subhan'Allah 33 times, totalling 100. This collective prayer is called the Tasbih of Fatima.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the work}} of Assyria, Greece and Rome, little is {{actually}} known except from history or inference. It may be safely assumed that the Assyria craft kept pace with the varying taste and refinement of Greece and all the older civilizations. Important pieces of wooden Roman sculpture which once existed in Greece and other ancient countries are only known to <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> descriptions of Pausanias and other classic writers. Many examples of the wooden images of the gods, were preserved down to late historic times. The Palladium, or sacred figure of Pallas, which was guarded by the Vestal Virgins in Rome and was fabled to have been brought by Aeneas from the burning Troy, {{was one of these}} wooden figures.|$|E
25|$|Post-revolution Cuba {{has been}} {{characterized}} by significant levels of emigration, {{which has led to}} a large and influential diaspora community. During the three decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes — constituting 10% of the total population — emigrated to the United States, a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Caribbean as a whole during that period. Other common destinations include Spain, the United Kingdom, Canada, Mexico, and Sweden, among others. Those who left the country typically did so by sea, in small boats and fragile rafts. On 9 September 1994, the U.S. and Cuban governments agreed that the U.S. would grant at least 20,000 visas annually in exchange for Cuba's pledge to prevent further unlawful departures on boats.|$|E
25|$|Due to fear of an {{outbreak}} of epidemic typhus, the US Government put a typhus quarantine in place in 1917 across {{the entirety of the}} US-Mexican border. Sanitation plants were constructed that required immigrants to be thoroughly inspected and bathed before crossing the border. Those who routinely crossed {{back and forth across the}} border for work were required to go through the sanitation process weekly, updating their quarantine card with the date of the next week’s sanitation. These sanitation border stations remained active over the next two decades, regardless of the disappearance of the typhus threat. This fear of typhus and resulting quarantine and sanitation protocols dramatically hardened the border between the US and Mexico, fostering scientific and popular prejudices against Mexicans. This ultimately intensified racial tensions and fueled efforts to ban immigrants to the <b>US</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Southern Hemisphere because the immigrants were associated with the disease.|$|E
