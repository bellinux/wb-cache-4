The aim of this bachelor thesis was to examine how public librarians <b>used</b> <b>Instagram</b> in marketing purposes. The research questions we wanted to answer were: • What motives were there to <b>use</b> <b>Instagram</b> for marketing purposes for public libraries? • What interaction is created through marketing over Instagram? • How do librarians think of the <b>use</b> of <b>Instagram</b> in the future? The theoretical basis for the thesis is Gummessons model of the Relationshipsmarketingtheory (RM). RM focuses on the weight of relationships between organizations and their customers. For collecting data a qualitative method was used. Six librarians from three different libraries were elected for interviews. The result showed that public librarians generally had a positive attitude towards library marketing through Instagram. They wanted to show what the library could offer, establish their place in society and reach out to new users, and Instagram was a natural part of the marketing. The study showed that the interaction with library users was low, but the interaction with other libraries and their staff was higher. In the future, librarians had a positive attitude towards developing their <b>Instagram</b> <b>use.</b> <b>Instagram</b> would then become equated with traditional marketing, but requested more clear using guidelines.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} the industry panel session hosted by Bond University Library at the Australian Library and Information Association 2 ̆ 7 s Information Online 2013 Conference. The panel was held to discuss the use and implications of professional Instagram profiles. The panel included a professional photographer, an internet marketing expert, a social media expert, a librarian and a social media-savvy student. The inclusion of a range of perspectives from outside the library aimed to provide a holistic approach to the institutional <b>use</b> of <b>Instagram</b> and to provide inspiration. The panel took place on Wednesday 13 February 2013 in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Design/methodology/approach: The panel discussion covered three broad topic areas: the popularity of Instagram and listening to your audience. The risks, limitations and disadvantages of <b>using</b> <b>Instagram.</b> Engagement with followers and measuring the value of Instagram. Throughout the panel session live mobile polling was used to gather feedback and responses from the audience in regards to their photo-sharing practices. Real examples from Instagram profiles were shared to stimulate discussion. The session concluded with a Q 2 ̆ 6 A session from the audience. Findings: The session was attended by approximately 80 delegates. The results of the mobile polling will be included in the body of the article. Based on feedback from delegates on Twitter and Facebook (which was collated via Storify) the session was perceived as a useful introduction to a professional exploration of Instagram and photo sharing. Practical implications: The session was an opportunity for conference delegates to hear about <b>Instagram</b> <b>use</b> from professionals in other fields. Each panel member contributed a unique perspective on the <b>use</b> of <b>Instagram.</b> In particular, the inclusion of a current Bond University student on the panel allowed for a customer 2 ̆ 7 s perspective on the library 2 ̆ 7 s <b>use</b> of <b>Instagram.</b> This discussion and the feedback gathered from the audience has formed the basis for further evidence-based research.

It also extends the conversation to include mobile photo sharing, an area which has not been well addressed in the literature.
