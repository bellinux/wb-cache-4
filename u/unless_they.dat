5|$|A 2008 {{study found}} that sperm whales sleep in {{vertical}} postures just under the surface in passive shallow 'drift-dives', generally during the day, during which whales {{do not respond to}} passing vessels <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> are in contact, leading to the suggestion that whales possibly sleep during such dives.|$|E
5|$|After {{claims in}} the media that the hashtags #wikileaks and #occupywallstreet were being censored {{because they did not}} show up on the site's list of {{trending}} topics, Twitter responded by stating that it does not censor hashtags <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> contain obscenities.|$|E

50|$|Transducers (i.e., {{microphones}} and loudspeakers) {{can also}} ring. Mechanical ringing {{is more of}} a problem with loudspeakers as the moving masses are larger and less easily damped, but <b>unless</b> extreme <b>they</b> are difficult to audibly identify.|$|R
5|$|Heraldry {{in general}} {{underwent}} {{something of a}} renaissance in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, {{and many of the}} illogicalities of previous centuries were discarded.

Dissenters repeatedly petitioned Parliament to repeal the Acts, arguing that they were being treated as second-class citizens.|$|E
5|$|Most notable part of Ninja Gaiden, which {{certainly}} made it famous, was its unforgiving, challenging difficulty, especially with very steep platforms, enemies that respawn upon dying <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> are close enough, aerial enemies and complicated platforming sections, all combined, make Ninja Gaiden {{one of the}} hardest games on the NES, and its difficulty setting earned it both praise and criticism.|$|E

5|$|On 3 August 2013, Chapman made a {{substitute}} appearance in Arsenal's 3–0 FA WSL win over Liverpool. The FA decreed {{she had not}} been properly registered and Arsenal were deducted three points.

5|$|One of the {{privileges}} {{that goes with}} American citizenship {{is the opportunity to}} become a commissioned officer in the Navy.
