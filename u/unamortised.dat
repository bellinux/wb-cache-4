50|$|On 7 May 2008, the FIFA Dispute Resolution Chamber ordered Mutu to pay €17,173,990 in {{compensation}} {{to his former}} club, Chelsea FC, for breach of contract. This included €16,500,000 for the <b>unamortised</b> portion of the transfer fee paid to Parma, €307,340 for the <b>unamortised</b> portion of the sign-on fee (received by Mutu), and €366,650 for the <b>unamortised</b> portion of the fee to the Agent, but was not {{to take into account}} the determination of the damages for the amounts already paid by the club to the player (consideration for services rendered) or the remaining value of the employment contract (valued at €10,858,500). Mutu had to pay within 30 days after being informed of the decision in August 2008. Mutu lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport for the second time, but on 31 July 2009, that court dismissed his appeal, and Mutu was ordered to pay Chelsea the amount plus interest of 5% p.a. starting on 12 September 2008 until the effective date of payment; the matter was submitted to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for its determination. In addition, Mutu had to pay the costs of arbitration for both parties, including CHF 50,000 to Chelsea. The fine was the highest ever levied by FIFA.|$|E
50|$|In the 2000 off-season, he was {{acquired}} by Juventus F.C. alongside Alex Pederzoli and Giacomo Cipriani in a pack deal for €5.16 million, {{in exchange for the}} remaining 50% of Jonatan Binotto's registration rights for the same amount, with 50% of Gamberini's rights being priced at €2.32 million. His co-ownership deal was terminated in the favour of Bologna in June 2002, for a peppercorn fee, making the Turin side register a loss of €1.5 million (the residual <b>unamortised</b> transfer fee of €4.64 in three years), but with a financial income of €2.32 million as Juve did not have to pay the remaining 50% registration rights.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} the k-difference and k-mismatch {{problems in the}} pseudo-realtime model where the text arrives online and the time complexity measure is per arriving character and <b>unamortised.</b> The wellknown k-difference/k-mismatch problems are those of finding all alignments of a pattern of length m with a text of length n where the edit/Hamming distance is at most k. Offline, the literature gives efficient solutions in O(nk) and O(n √ k log k) time, respectively. More recently, a pseudo-realtime solution was given for the former in O(k log m) time and the latter in O (√ k log k log m) time per arriving text character. Our work improves these complexities to O(k) time for the k-difference problem and O (√ k log k + log m) for the k-mismatch problem. In {{the process of developing}} the main results, we also give a simple solution with optimal time complexity for performing longest common extension queries in the same pseudo-realtime setting which may be of independent interest. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{black box}} method was {{recently}} given that solves {{the problem of}} online approximate matching for a class of problems whose distance functions can be classified as being local. A distance function {{is said to be}} local if for a pattern P of length m and any substring T [i, i+m− 1] of a text T, the distance between P and T [i, i + m − 1] is equal to Σj∆(P [j], T [i + j − 1]), where ∆ is any distance function between individual characters. We extend this line of work by showing how to tackle online approximate matching when the distance function is non-local. We give solutions which are applicable {{to a wide variety of}} matching problems including function and parameterised matching, swap matching, swap-mismatch, k-difference, k-difference with transpositions, overlap matching, edit distance/LCS, flipped bit, faulty bit and L 1 and L 2 rearrangement distances. The resulting <b>unamortised</b> online algorithms bound the worst case running time per input character to within a log factor of their comparable offline counterpart. ...|$|E
