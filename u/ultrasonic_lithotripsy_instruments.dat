40|$|The {{treatment}} of urinary calculus disease has changed dramaticlly {{over the last}} 10 years. What once involved an open surgical procedure, often with a lengthy hospital stay, can now often be done as a day procedure under local anesthesia. This change has been brought about by technological advances in extracorporeal shock wave <b>lithotripsy</b> and percutaneous <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>lithotripsy,</b> as well as downsizing and fiberoptic improvements in urologic instruments...|$|R
40|$|Physical ultrasonics is {{a mature}} field {{and in this}} review some {{branches}} of the subject are discussed. After a brief introduction, various ultrasonic transducers like piezoelectric, ceramic, capacitive, electromagnetic and optical methods for generation of ultrasonic waves have been discussed. Some linear and non-linear ultrasonic phenomena are then summarized. In the case of non-linear phenomena, parametric arrays, acoustic cavitation, sonoluminescence and sonochemistry have been presented. A discussion of surface acoustic waves and devices, optical storage cell, acoustooptic effects and underwater acoustics is then given. Finally some special topics such as, acoustic emission, acoustic microscopy, sound amplification by stimulated emission of radiation, medical diagnosis and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> are discussed briefl...|$|R
40|$|Percutaneous and {{transurethral}} {{removal of}} renal and ureteral calculi {{was performed in}} 109 cases. Targeted calculi were successfully removed in 105 cases (96. 3 per cent), but in five cases combined percutaneous and transurethral procedures were required. Although endourological stone removal resulted in low morbidity rates in many other series, some major complications have also been reported. They include arteriovenous fistula, colo-cutaneous fistula, nephro-duodenal fistula and ureteral avulsion. There were two severe complications in our early experience as well. In one case, a ureteral stenosis was found seven months after two sessions of percutaneous <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> for an upper ureteral stone, {{and in the other}} case, a mid-ureteral avulsion was caused by ureteroscopic manipulation. Besides these, we experienced several minor pelvic and ureteral perforations which were easily controlled only by ureteral stent placement. Causes and management of ureteral complications in endourological treatment of renal and ureteral calculi are discussed...|$|R
40|$|An elderly {{normotensive}} man underwent percutaneous <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> for renal stone disease, {{the procedure}} lasting {{three hours and}} the fragments being washed out with 20 l 1. 5 % glycine. After two hours the inflation pressure had risen to 25 cm H 2 O and his blood pressure to 150 mm Hg. Inflation pressure continued to rise until drainage tubes were inserted into the retroperitoneal space, releasing a large volume of fluid, some of which appeared {{to be from the}} peritoneal cavity. Shortly after transfer to the recovery area the patient showed signs of the transurethral resection syndrome, with hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, and hypertension. He was treated appropriately and survived. Low infusion pressures should be used for irrigation during lithotripsy and 0. 9 % saline instead of 1. 5 % glycine. In patients given a general anaesthetic any rise in inflation pressure suggests extravasation of fluid and warrants emergency estimation of the plasma sodium concentration...|$|R
40|$|Mentor: Manoj Monga MD (Urologic Surgery) Objective: To {{conduct a}} {{comparative}} evaluation of ultrasonic, pneumatic, and dual <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> {{to predict the}} safety of probes on urinary tract tissue. Methods: Lithotriptors (medical device used to breakup kidney stones) tested were the Swiss Lithoclast Ultra (ultrasonic only - US, and ultrasonic-pneumatic combination US+P), and the Gyrus ACMI Cyberwand (dual ultrasonic). Fresh porcine ureters, bladders, and renal pelvis tissues were used for testing. A hands-free set up was used with each probe to vertically apply no pressure, 400 g, or 700 g of pressure for a duration of 3 seconds, 5 seconds or 180 seconds. Repetitive testing of each tissue/pressure/time combination was performed, {{for a total of}} 351 trials. Conclusion: All devices afforded a level of safety at tissue durations typical of inadvertent intraoperative contact (3 - 5 seconds), though the Lithoclast US-only was superior with regard to perforation for all tissue types. Overall, very similar results were observed between the Lithoclast US+P and Cyberwand. This research was supported by the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP) ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{efficacy}} of the laser lithotripter with the ultrasonic lithotripter in mini percutaneous nephrolithotomy (miniperc). Material and Methods: From June 2013 to January 2014; medical records of 77 consecutive patients who underwent miniperc operation were retrospectively evaluated. Ultrasonic lithotripter was used in 22 patients (Group 1), while laser was used in 55 patients. In the laser group, 22 patients were randomly selected who had same characteristics compared to group 1 (Group 2). Success rate, total operative time, complications according to modified Clavien classification, fluoroscopy time, haemoglobin drop, hospital stays and cost analysis were assessed. Success rates were evaluated on the second postoperative day and after the first month. Results: Total operative time (p = 0. 635) and fluoroscopy time (p = 0. 248) were not significantly different between the two groups. In the laser group, the success rate (81. 8 %) was notably more than in the ultrasonic lithotripter group (68. 2 %) but there was no statistically significance (p = 0. 296). Ten reusable ultrasonic probe were used for 22 patients, due to thinness and sensitiveness of the probe. Conversely, one single laser fiber (550 micron) was used for 22 patients. When the cost analysis of lithotripsy was considered, the cost per case was 190 dollar in group 1 and 124 dollar in group 2. (p = 0. 154) Complication rate, hospital stay and haemoglobin drop were similar in both groups. Conclusion: Laser lithotripsy seems to be more cost effective than <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> for miniperc but larger number of patients are required to confirm this estimation...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Between 1995 and 2005, we performed PCNL in 9 patients with horseshoe kidney. In 3 of them, there was a single calculus and the rest had multiple calculi in the pelvis and at least 1 in the calyxes. Ultrasonography, plain abdominal radiography, and intravenous urography (IVU) were performed in all patients. We used fluoroscopy for entering the system and then, pneumatic or <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>lithotripsy</b> was used. Results: In all except 1 patient (88. 9 %) we could access the system. Single calculi in 3 patients were removed. In 5 patients with multiple calculi, the calculus causing obstruction was removed, and in 3, the calculi located in the calyxes were removed too. Consequently, 66. 7 % were stone-free at the end of the procedure. In 2 patients, there were residual calculi in the calyxes and they underwent candidates for extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy. Conclusion: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy can be used in patients with horseshoe kidney if the patient selection is appropriate and the surgeon is experienced enough. The success rate and complications are the same as the patients with normal anatomy. However, access to the lower calyx is more difficult due to its anatomic status. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPercutaneous nephrolithotomy {{is widely}} {{accepted}} and effective treatment modality for renal stone disease. When {{compared with other}} surgical interventions such as open renal surgery, percutaneous nephrolithotomy has lower morbidity and postoperative patient discomfort, so percutaneous nephrolithotomy mostly replaced open surgery {{in most of the}} urology clinics in Turkey and worldwide. In this review it is aimed to discuss indications and limitations of percutaneous nephrolithotomy that mean the proper patient selection and also to discuss important points of surgical technique and devices for intrarenal <b>lithotripsy</b> and <b>instruments</b> for kidney drainage after the procudure that all will offer the physicians successfull outcome...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the predictive value of sonographic fragmentation in the successful treatment of sialolithiasis. The main {{objective was to}} streamline the management by treating the patients with three sessions of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>lithotripsy,</b> and to compare the success rate and complications with data from the literature. A second objective was to analyse the predictive value of data from the post procedure and follow-up sonography related to therapeutic success with regard to size, site and location of stones. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective follow-up of 25 patients (mean age of 43 ± 17. 2 years old 11 - 68; 13 women, 10 men) {{over a period of}} 31 months (October 2009 -April 2012) with one or more salivary calculi (19 parotid, submandibular 6) treated with extracorporeal lithotripsy (electromagnetic MINILITH SL 1, Storz Medical, Switzerland). No anaesthesia or analgesia was used. Each session of lithotripsy lasted on average 30 min. Minor complications were collected on an anonymised sheet. RESULTS: Complete success (absence of clinical symptoms 3 months after the end of treatment (or the last session) and residual stones 2 mm) in 48 % and failure (persistence of same or increased symptoms at 3 months or no change in size of the calculi) in 17 % of patients. Sonographic fragmentation of the stone (p = 0. 004), total energy delivered (p = 0. 008) and the total number of shock waves (n = 0. 045) are predictive factors of complete success. Size, salivary topography, ductal topography, mobilization of the stones, occurrence of minor side effects and total duration of treatment had no predictive value of complete success (p > 0. 05). There {{was no significant difference between}} the first 5 and the last 20 patients (p = 0. 367). In agreement with the literature data, the efficacy of treatment was greater for parotid than submandibular calculi. CONCLUSION: Extracorporeal lithotripsy is an alternative to conventional surgery with no major complications. Sonographic fragmentation of calculi, total energy and total number of shock waves are predictive factors of successful treatment...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} <b>ultrasonic</b> adsorption <b>lithotripsy</b> by percutaneous nephroscope on inflammation mediators and stress hormones of the patients with infectious renal calculi. Methods: A total of 62 patients with infectious renal calculi in our hospital from January 2014 to June 2015 were selected as the study object，and they were randomly divided into control group(pneumatic ballistic lithotripsy by percutaneous nephroscope group) 31 cases and observation group(ultrasonic adsorption lithotripsy by percutaneous nephroscope group) 31 cases，then the serum expression levels of inflammation mediators and stress hormones of two groups before the treatment and at 12 h- 24 h and 48 h after the treatment were compared. Results：The serum expression levels of inflammation mediators and stress hormones of two groups before the treatment were compared，all P＞ 0. 05 ，and the serum expression levels of observation group at 12 h- 24 h and 48 h after the treatment were significantly {{lower than those of}} control group，while the expression levels of two groups after the treatment were all significantly higher than those before the treatment，all P＜ 0. 05. Conclusions：The inflammation mediators and stress hormones of patients with infectious renal calculi who are treated with pneumatic ballistic lithotripsy by percutaneous nephroscope are relatively lower，and it shows that the trauma and bad stress for the body are better controlled, so its clinical application value are relatively higher...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of calculi in the urinary tract has {{been subject to}} major changes {{over the last few}} years. Since extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the first choice of treatment, there appears to be little need for endoscopic and surgical techniques. In case ESWL treatment is unsuccessful or inadequate, laser lithotripsy is a good alternative. In most cases, laser lithotripsy causes a good disintegration with use of very thin and flexible instrumentation. Hence, the risk of damage to the urinary tract is much less than with other endoscopic techniques such as <b>ultrasonic</b> and electrohydraulic <b>lithotripsy.</b> Our first results with 21 bladder and 18 ureter calculi in 25 patients were a successful disintegration of 84 % of bladder calculi and a 70 % success for ureter calculi. Only one complication of the ureteroscopic manipulation was observed. Disadvantages of laser lithotripsy are the high price of the equipment and the fact that not all calculi can be fragmented with one type of lase...|$|R
