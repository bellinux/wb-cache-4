5|$|Haynes left in May 1781 to {{take over}} the 64-gun third rate Ruby. Her next captain was George Stoney, with Captain Thomas Windsor {{replacing}} him on 31 January 1782.

5|$|In her Navy career, Mercy made four transatlantic round {{trips to}} France, {{bringing}} home almost 2,000 wounded men. After {{the end of}} World War I, the ship was based in Philadelphia, and briefly laid <b>up</b> <b>there</b> in 1924. The ship was decommissioned in 1934 and lent to the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, struck in 1938, and scrapped in 1939.|$|E

5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set <b>up</b> <b>there</b> are two firms, one foreign and one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E

5|$|After stage nine, both Juan Antonio Flecha and Johnny Hoogerland {{were awarded}} the red number bib for stage ten.

Flecha {{refused to accept the}} award on the podium after the stage; Hoogerland, having already been <b>up</b> <b>there</b> to receive the polka dot jersey, did take the award.|$|E
5|$|At 03:35, the 6th Airborne Division {{headquarters}} landed by glider in the landing-zone {{cleared by}} sappers. Only a few gliders missed the landing-zone, {{due to the}} poor weather and errors in navigation. Once the headquarters staff and accompanying airborne troops had been gathered together, the headquarters {{was moved to the}} Le Bas de Ranville area and set <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> Contact was established with the headquarters of 5th Parachute Brigade at 05:00, and with the headquarters of 3rd Parachute Brigade at 12:35, and the division linked up with 1st Special Service Brigade as it advanced from the invasion beaches at 13:53.|$|E
5|$|At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, {{many of them}} {{bearing the}} republic's vierkleur ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, {{independent}} republic. Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of high treason when they took this news to Wolseley and Sir Owen Lanyon (who had replaced Shepstone), prompting many burghers to consider rising <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature. Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British Liberal politician William Ewart Gladstone, who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his Midlothian campaign.|$|E

5|$|Devika Rani {{was sent}} to {{boarding}} school in England {{at the age of}} nine, and grew <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> After completing her schooling in the mid-1920s, she enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and the Royal Academy of Music in London to study acting and music. She also enrolled for courses in architecture, textile and decor design, and even apprenticed under Elizabeth Arden. All of these courses, each of them a few months long, were completed by 1927, and Devika Rani then took up a job in textile design.|$|E
5|$|Diodorus {{says that}} the Egyptian fleet was sent to {{circumnavigate}} Salamis, and block the northern exit from the Straits. If Xerxes wanted to trap the Allies completely, this maneuver would have made sense (especially {{if he was not}} expecting the Allies to fight). However, Herodotus does not mention this (and possibly alludes to the Egyptian presence in the main battle), leading some modern historians to dismiss it; though again, others accept it as a possibility. Xerxes had also positioned around 400 troops on the island known as Psyttaleia, {{in the middle of the}} exit from the straits, in order to kill or capture any Greeks who ended <b>up</b> <b>there</b> (as a result of shipwreck or grounding).|$|E
5|$|HB1002 {{was lost}} on 11July1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A {{hydraulic}} leak caused an engine fire, {{resulting in the}} loss of hydraulic pressure, which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> causing the hydraulic lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E

He formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist Brian May and drummer Roger Taylor. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to {{complications}} from AIDS, having confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease.|$|E
5|$|On November 1, 2011, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16, a 767-300ER, safely {{landed at}} Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport in Warsaw, Poland after a {{mechanical}} {{failure of the}} landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear <b>up.</b> <b>There</b> were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At {{the time of the}} incident, aviation analysts speculated that {{it may have been the}} first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated circuit breaker.|$|E
5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew <b>up</b> <b>there</b> to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Brigade landed between 05:30 and 07:00, and {{the reserve}} 1st Brigade landed between 09:00 and 12:00, already putting the {{timetable}} behind schedule. The 2nd Brigade, {{which was supposed}} to be heading for Baby 700 on the left, were instead sent to the right to counter a Turkish attack building <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> At 07:20 Bridges and his staff landed; finding no senior officers on the beach to brief them, they set out to locate the 3rd Brigade headquarters.|$|E
5|$|The kibbutz was {{established}} in 1926 by pioneers from the Hashomer Hatzair movement, who moved to Mandatory Palestine during the Third Aliyah from Poland. It was the first Jewish settlement {{in the southern part}} of the Jezreel Valley. It soon became a center of the Hashomer Hatzair, particularly since the first regional school of the Kibbutz Arzi network was set <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> In April 1948 the kibbutz was the epicenter of an important battle when it successfully resisted the first large-scale attack of the Arab Liberation Army commanded by Fawzi al-Qawuqji.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} in Mumbai, two motorcycle-borne MNS {{supporters}} hurled bottles at Amitabh Bachchan's bungalow at Juhu. A group of MNS workers barged inside the booking office of the Grant Road railway station, damaged the booking office windows and tore off posters of a newly released Bhojpuri film put <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> Party workers resorted to stone throwing {{in some parts of}} Kandivli, a North-Mumbai suburb that has a sizeable North Indian lower middle-class population. In the Central-Mumbai suburb of Bandra, a clash ensued when MNS workers tried to plant party flags at an open market dominated by North Indians.|$|E
