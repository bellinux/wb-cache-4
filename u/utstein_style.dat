2500|$|Dry {{drowning}} is a {{term that}} has never had an accepted medical definition, and that is currently medically discredited. Following the 2002 World Congress on Drowning in Amsterdam, a consensus definition of drowning was established. Based on this definition, drowning is the [...] "process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid." [...] This definition resulted in only three legitimate drowning subsets: fatal drowning, non-fatal drowning with illness/injury, and non-fatal drowning without illness/injury. In response, major medical consensus organizations have adopted this definition worldwide and have officially discouraged any medical or publication {{use of the term}} [...] "dry drowning". Such organizations include the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, the Wilderness Medical Society, the American Heart Association, the <b>Utstein</b> <b>Style</b> system, the International Lifesaving Federation, [...] the International Conference on Drowning, Starfish Aquatics Institute, the American Red Cross, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Emergency Physicians.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Utstein</b> <b>Style</b> {{is a set}} of {{guidelines}} for uniform reporting of cardiac arrest. The <b>Utstein</b> <b>Style</b> was first proposed for emergency medical services in 1991. The name derives from a 1990 conference of the European Society of Cardiology, the European Academyof Anesthesiology, the European Society for Intensive Care Medicine, and related national societies, held at the Utstein Abbey on the island of Mosterøy, Norway.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of cardiac}} arrest {{registries}} {{based on the}} <b>Utstein</b> <b>Style</b> include the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival, Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium, Save Hearts in Arizona Registry and Education, and the National Registry of CardioPulmonary Resuscitation.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in the city of Okayama, Japan, during a 1 -year period after the reorganization of defibrillation by Emergency Life-Saving Technicians (ELSTs) with standing orders of CPR. The data were collected prospectively according to an <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> between June 1, 2003 and May 31, 2004; OHCA was confirmed in 363 patients. Cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology (179) was witnessed by a bystander in 62 (34. 6 %) cases. Of this group, ventricular fibrillation (VF) was documented in 20 cases (32. 3 %), and 1 patient (5 %) was discharged alive without severe neurological disability. This outcome is average in Japan, but it is quite low level compared with Western countries because there is less VF in Japan. The <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> revealed that we must try to detect VF before the rhythm changes and to provide defibrillation as soon as possible in order to improve outcomes.

Patients and methods: This was an observational study of all age groups based on data from prehospital care reports in Seoul, South Korea. The collected data were reported {{according to the}} <b>Utstein</b> <b>Style</b> template for OHCA and analyzed in order to compare STA with non-STA. Univariate analysis was conducted using a binomial logistic regression model to identify predictors associated with trauma patients. Results: Eighty-three (4. 8 %) OHCA survivors were admitted to the emergency department with carotid pulse. The median time from arrest to emergency medical personnel defibrillation was statistically significantly shorter in STA cases (8. 0 minutes) than in non-STA cases (12. 0 minutes; P< 0. 001). Factors independently associated with better prognosis in terms of trauma patients were female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 0. 67; 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]: 0. 50 – 0. 91; P= 0. 01), arrest at home (OR: 0. 36; 95 % CI: 0. 27 – 0. 49; P< 0. 001), and witnessed arrest (OR: 2. 64; 95 % CI: 1. 94 – 3. 39; P< 0. 001). Conclusion: Early basic life support, performed by either a layperson or emergency medical personnel, had a positive effect on STA.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the epidemiology of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and survival after resuscitation and {{to apply the}} <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> of reporting to data collection. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: A middle-sized urban city (population 516, 000) served by a single emergency medical services system. PATIENTS: Consecutive prehospital cardiac arrests occurring between 1 January and 31 December 1994. INTERVENTION: Advanced cardiac life support according to the recommendations of American Heart Association. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival from cardiac arrest to hospital discharge, and factors associated with survival. RESULTS: Four hundred and twelve patients were considered for resuscitation. The overall incidence of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was 79. 8 / 100, 000 inhabitants/year. Fifty seven patients (16. 6 %) survived to discharge when resuscitation was attempted. 32. 5 % survived when cardiac arrest was bystander witnessed and was of cardiac origin with ventricular fibrillation as the initial rhythm. When asystole or pulseless electrical activity was the first rhythm recorded, discharge rates were 6. 2 and 2. 7 % respectively. The cause of cardiac arrest was cardiac in 66. 5 %, and ventricular fibrillation was the initial rhythm in 65. 0 % of bystander witnessed cardiac arrests of cardiac origin. 22. 1 % of patients received bystander initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The mean time intervals from the receipt of the call {{to the arrival of}} a first response advanced life support unit and mobile intensive care unit at the patient's side and to the return of spontaneous circulation were 7. 0 and 10. 3 and 12. 6 and 16. 7 min respectively. In the logistic regression model bystander witnessed arrest, age, ventricular fibrillation as initial rhythm, and the call-to-arrival interval of the first response unit were independent factors relating to survival. <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> reporting with modification of time zero was found to be an appropriate form of data collection in this emergency medical services system.

40|$|Background. Only a {{few large}} cities have {{published}} their out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survival statistics using the <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> reporting method. To date, {{to the best of}} our knowledge there has been no published OHCA survival data for a state. Objective. To describe the process, benefits, and challenges of establishing a statewide OHCA database and educational network. Methods. Arizona’s Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and Trauma System initiated a statewide, prospective, observational cohort review of all OHCA victims on whom resuscitation was attempted in the field. Emergency medical services (EMS) first care reports, voluntarily submitted by 35 departments in Arizona, were analyzed. We chronicled the development of our data-collection process along with how we obtained patient outcomes and delivered feedback to field providers. Entry data included time intervals and nodal events conforming to the <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> template. Results. In data collected between January 1, 2005, and April 1, 2006, there were 1, 484 OHCAs reported, of which 1, 104 were of presumed cardiac etiology occurring prior to EMS arrival. The OHCA incidence was approximately 0. 44 per 1, 000 population per year. In our database, bystander CPR provided an odds ratio of 3. 0 for survival (95 % confidence interval 1. 3, 6. 7). Outcomes for 1, 076 patients were obtained. Thirty-seven (3. 4 %) of the 1, 076 cardiac arrest victims survived to hospital discharge. Twentyseven (8. 6 %) of the 331 ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest victims survived to hospital discharge. Conclusion.

40|$|SUMMARYBackgroundThere are no {{publications}} in Colombia regarding {{the implementation of}} a hospital cardiopulmonary arrest registry {{despite the fact that the}} International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) already in 1991 developed, in a meeting at Utsein Abbey in Norway, a form designed to compare and improve cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers. The purpose of this work was to apply a cardiopulmonary arrest registry in the <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> at San Juan de Dios Hospital in Cali, in order to gather data concerning the reality of cardiopulmonary arrest, during the period between July and October, 2010. MethodologyProspective observational study. A cardiopulmonary arrest form was developed and communicated, and all physicians who had participated in cardiopulmonary resuscitation maneuvers during the study period were asked to complete the form. ResultsThere were 22 cases of cardiopulmonary arrest. Of these, 80 % happened in the emergency service, and 95 % were attended to by a general practitioner. Only 14 % of the records were filled correctly and, in 23 % of cases, the description had been written by the nursing staff instead of the physician. ConclusionThis study found that the vast majority of physicians do not fill a cardiopulmonary arrest form, even when they are aware of it. Commitment is lacking on the part of the government as well as the medical community regarding the correct implementation of this recommendation of critical importance for resuscitation research...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the prognosis of}} patients with ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Hong Kong and examine its relationship with the other links in the chain of survival. DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study. SETTING: Three accident and emergency departments, Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: Patients older than 18 years with non-traumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who were transported to the hospitals by ambulance between 15 March 1999 and 15 October 1999. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Demographic data, characteristics of the cardiac arrest and the response times of the emergency medical service according to the <b>Utstein</b> <b>style,</b> and survival to hospital discharge rate. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty patients were included. The incidence of ventricular fibrillation in this group of patients was 14. 1 %. The chance of survival to hospital discharge was significantly higher for patients with ventricular fibrillation than those with other rhythms of cardiac arrest (4. 4 % versus 0. 7 %). Approximately 40. 0 % of all cardiac arrests were witnessed. The bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation rate was low at 15. 6 %. The median intervals for recognition to activation of the emergency medical service, time to cardiopulmonary resuscitation, time to defibrillation, and time to advanced life support were 1, 8, 9, and 27 minutes, respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with ventricular fibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest {{have a better chance of}} survival than those with other cardiac rhythms. Further improvement requires simultaneous strengthening of all four links in the chain of survival. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the response to}} cardiac arrest in general wards. METHODS: Direct interview with the cardiac arrest team (CAT) members in 32 hospitals in Rome, Italy. RESULTS: The majority of CATs are activated by telephone but only two (6 %) hospitals have a dedicated telephone number for emergency calls. The CAT always includes a physician, who is usually an anaesthesiologist (30 hospitals, 94 %), and usually includes one or two other members (23 hospitals, 72 %). In 21 hospitals (65 %) there is less than one defibrillator per floor but in only six hospitals (19 %), CATs are equipped with defibrillators. Resuscitation guidelines are adopted by 15 teams (47 %). The <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> of data collection is used in only one hospital. The most common problems reported by the CATs are: insufficient training of ward personnel (29 hospitals, 91 %), insufficient staff (19 hospitals, 59 %) and insufficient equipment (18 hospitals, 56 %). Average maximum arrival time for the CAT to arrive is 220 s, but varies significantly between single-building and the multiple-building hospitals (88 vs. 390 s; P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the cardiac arrest teams have acceptable response times, but their efficiency may be impaired {{by the lack of}} staff, equipment and co-ordination with the ward personnel. CAT members identified a strong need for BLS training of ward personnel. More widespread introduction of standard protocols for resuscitation and reporting of cardiac arrest are necessary to evaluate aspects that may need improvement...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} climate of rising {{healthcare}} cost, resuscitation efforts performed outside the hospital are critically evaluated because of their limited success rate in some settings. As part of a quality assurance program between the 1 st January 1991 and 31 st December 1993, six centres of the Belgian CPCR study group prospectively registered cardiac arrest (CA) patients and their treatment according to the <b>Utstein</b> <b>Style</b> recommendations. In the group (n = 511) of patients initially found in ventricular fibrillation (VF) a significantly better survival rate was observed for those patients who received a 1 st defibrillatory shock by the 1 st tier (n = 142 (27. 8 %)) as compared to those defibrillated after arrival of the 2 nd tier (n = 369 (72. 2 %)). Median time to delivery of the first shock was significantly shorter (5 min) in the 1 st tier group. In a {{second part of the}} study we describe long-term management of the 28 surviving VF patients, treated by the single EMS system of Brugge between 1 st January 1991 and 30 th April 1995 : only 6 patients eventually received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), whereas coronary revascularization was performed in 9 patients, and 3 patients were discharged on amiodarone only. Satisfactory long-term survival after out-of-hospital VF can be achieved by an early shock followed by advanced life support and appropriate definitive treatment.

40|$|Three {{hundreds}} and sixty six patients with out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest, {{transported to the}} Kyushu University Hospital from 2000 to 2006,were examined using the <b>Utstein</b> <b>style</b> in witnessed cardiogenic cardiopulmonary arrest patients. Also, we examined the influence on prognosis due to {{the difference in the}} treatment of airway control in out-of-hospital settings. Nineteen patients out of 78 witnessed cardiogenic out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest patients were discharged alive and 11 were with a good prognosis. The number of cases where an initial electrocardiographic complex showed ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was higher than formerly reported in Japan and was equal to the incidence reported in Europe and America. In addition,the survival discharge rate of patients with the ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia was higher than that previously reported in Japan and was similar to European and American results. Manual airway maintenance using a bag valve mask was more successful in terms of the survival discharge rate compared to the use of advanced airway devices. By the time course, collapse to cardiopulmonary resuscitation interval, collapse to initial defibrillation interval and collapse to the return of spontaneous circulation interval were shorter in the group discharged with a good prognosis, especially in the witnessed ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia patients corresponding to former reports. Most patients with a good prognosis resuscitated before arrival at the hospital. These results suggest the prehospital treatment is the critical point other than in-hospital treatment...|$|E
