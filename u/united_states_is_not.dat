5|$|Senators {{are elected}} in even-numbered {{years when the}} President of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> being elected, similar to most other state offices in Maryland. The most recent {{election}} was in November 2014. Senators are not term-limited. Should a Senator resign from office before his or her term expires, the local central committee of the party to which the retiring senator belonged makes a recommendation to the Governor for whom to appoint to the open seat. It is tradition for the Governor to appoint the recommended person. Four of the current members of the Maryland State Senate were originally appointed, two of whom have since been elected in their own right. Newly elected Senators are sworn in and begin work on the second Wednesday of the January following their election.|$|E

5|$|To {{serve in}} the Maryland Senate, a person must be a citizen of Maryland 25 {{years of age or}} older. Elections for the 47 Senate seats are held every four years {{coincident}} with the federal election in which the President of the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> elected. Vacancies are filled through appointment by the Governor. The Senate meets for three months every year; {{the rest of the year}} the work of the Senate is light and most members hold another job during this time. It has been controlled by Democrats for a number of years. In the 2006 election, more than two-thirds of the Senate seats were won by Democrats.|$|E

Al-Hussayen maintained that he did volunteer work and was not receiving pay, and thus did not violate the conditions of his visa. He {{pleaded not guilty to}} all the charges.|$|E
25|$|Luis Moreno-Ocampo told The Sunday Telegraph that he {{is willing}} to start an inquiry by the International Criminal Court (ICC), and {{possibly}} a trial, for war crimes committed in Iraq involving British Prime Minister Tony Blair and American President George W.

However, Blair does fall under ICC jurisdiction as Britain is a State Party.|$|E
25|$|The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> as {{workplace}} family-oriented as {{many other}} wealthy countries. According to a study released by Harvard and McGill University researchers in February 2007, workplace policies for families in the U.S. are weaker than those of all high-income countries and even many middle-and low-income countries. Other differences include the fact that fathers are granted paid paternity leave or paid parental leave in sixty-five countries; thirty one of these countries offer at least fourteen weeks of paid leave. The U.S. does not guarantee this to fathers.(survey) Sweden, Denmark and Norway have {{the highest level of}} maternity benefits—Sweden provides 68 weeks paid maternity leave, Norway provides 56 weeks paid maternity leave and Denmark provides 52.|$|E

25|$|The United States Department of the Treasury has {{published}} model IGAs which follow two approaches. Under Model 1, financial {{institutions in the}} partner country report information about U.S. accounts to the tax authority of the partner country. That tax authority then provides {{the information to the}} United States. Model 1 comes in a reciprocal version (Model 1A), under which the United States will also share information about the partner country's taxpayers with the partner country, and a nonreciprocal version (Model 1B). Under Model 2, partner country financial institutions report directly to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, and the partner country agrees to lower any legal barriers to that reporting. Model 2 is available in two versions: 2A with no Tax Information Exchange Agreement (TIEA) or Double Tax Convention (DTC) required, and 2B for countries with a pre-existing TIEA or DTC. The agreements generally require parliamentary approval in the countries they are concluded with, but the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> pursuing ratification of this as a treaty.|$|E
25|$|Artemus {{is held by}} {{officials}} of an unnamed government (the nation had an arsenal of Cruise Missiles and Minutemen, though the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> directly named) who fear his powers yet want to use them militarily. As part of this plan, they persuade him to construct the Zone, and they present him to the people as an inspiring nationalistic symbol. Once the Zone is completed, the government launches a first strike nuclear attack against an unnamed foe. From that point on, life for the survivors in the Zone becomes distinctly Orwellian, revolving around {{the will of the}} omnipresent Artemus, who is accepted by the people as a benevolent messianic figure. The boy can read the thoughts of anyone in the Zone, and the people find that comforting. He has absolute power, though he is influenced by flattery to enforce the will of the government officials. Throughout much of the story, Artemus is confused and unsure of what he should do, which adds to his vulnerability to official leadership.|$|E
