40|$|Abstract: It {{has been}} {{observed}} {{over the years that}} yarn tension during high speed over-end unwinding from a helically wound stationary package is highly non linear (1). Each yarn element during unwinding performs a complex motion that involves a movement along the yarn axis and rotation about the package axis. Parameters that affect the yarn tension are linear yarn density, unwinding speed, package diameter, balloon profile, and specific yarn winding density of the cone or cheese. This paper analyses mathematically the influence of the above stated parameters at the guide eyelet on yarn <b>unwinding</b> <b>tension.</b> On the basis of the model it proposes a cost effective mechanical device for tension variation control where a movable guide eyelet is used. The proposed device helps to minimize tension variation during unwinding and to obtain more or less constant tension, which definitely improves the quality of the package prepared from cones or cheeses (for example a warp beam). The concept behind the proposed system is to move the guide eyelet with respect to reducing cone or cheese diameter according to the proposed mathematical model. This will invariably affect the uniform <b>unwinding</b> <b>tension,</b> which also improves the quality of subsequent processes such as warping, sizing, pirn winding and processes associated with package dyeing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: During the {{printing}} process, invariable tension {{is very important}} to make sure the high printing quality. It’s well known that the relation of tension and tape velocity is strong-coupling based on the model of tension control, the modeling of tension possesses varies a lot in the control process, and various disturbances are inevitable during printing. All of these make the tension control systems unstable and affect {{the printing}} quality. This paper purposes a method to decrease the strong-coupling relation between speed and tension and control the speed-tension accurately. Based on the shaft-less printing press, the <b>unwinding</b> <b>tension</b> model and servo driver model are given. Decoupling controller is designed in this paper, and simulation results show that this method can improve the coupling degree and control performance...|$|E

We address an elementary but fundamental question raised by various authors: does the molecule overwind or <b>unwind</b> under <b>tension?</b> We show {{that within the}} context of the classic Kirchhoff-Love rod model of elastic filaments, both behaviors are possible, depending on the precise constitutive relations of the polymer. More generally, our analysis provides an effective linear response theory for helical structures that relates axial force and axial torque to axial translation and rotation. © 2013 American Physical Society...|$|R
50|$|Tension {{adjustment}} is necessary due to several mechanical factors: oscillations caused by mechanical misalignments, differing inertial response (lag) of mechanical elements during web acceleration, out-of-round <b>unwind</b> and <b>tension</b> rolls, slipping through nip rolls, and over-aggressive web-guide correction. Several technical process and control issues also affect tension: tension setpoint changes, phase offset on driven rolls, tension bleed from one zone to another, and thermal effect (contraction/expansion) as the substrate passes through various processes. It {{is impossible to}} eliminate all factors requiring tension adjustment. Variance in any one factor in a zone necessitates changes in tension control and web speed. Consequently, with coupled tension zone control, jitter is inevitable in a continuous web where the controllers cause a feedback loop.|$|R

The next part explores selected hardware and its use on the rewinder. Further chapters {{are focused on the}} individual measuring chains, calibration, computations of required quantities and control algorithms. The last part compares the theoretical and measured values and evaluates the results of this essay...|$|R
40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} of yarn packages used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn <b>unwinding</b> <b>tension</b> were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the nature of package driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In textile {{production}} the yarn {{is being}} withdrawn from cross-wound packages in warping and weft insertion. During unwinding there appear {{forces in the}} yarn that are approximately proportional to {{the square of the}} unwinding velocity. During <b>unwind</b> the yarn <b>tension</b> is not constant, but it oscillates within some interval. This is especially noticeable in over-end unwinding from a static cross wound packages, where the yarn is being withdrawn with a high velocity {{in the direction of the}} package axis. Even when the yarn is not strongly stressed, so that the tension does not exceed a few percent of the breaking strength, the yarn still can break sometimes. This is why we think that a cross-wound package is not an ideal form of a package and that such packages are not always made without flaws...|$|R
