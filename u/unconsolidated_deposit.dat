50|$|Groundwater {{is located}} beneath the ground surface in soil pore spaces {{and in the}} {{fractures}} of rock formations. A unit of rock or an <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>deposit</b> is called an aquifer when it can yield a usable quantity of water. The depth at which soil pore spaces or fractures and voids in rock become completely saturated with water is called the water table. There are two broad types of aquifers: An unconfined aquifer is where the surface is not restricted by impervious rocks, so the water table is at atmospheric pressure. In a confined aquifer, the upper surface of water is overlain by a layer of impervious rock, so the groundwater is stored under pressure.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} coupling the stochastic technique that is called ‘coupled Markov chain ’ (Elfeki and Dekking, 2001), which is used for stochastic site characterization, with numerical groundwater flow and transport models. The purpose is to study the reduction of uncertainty on concentration distribution by conditioning {{on a number of}} boreholes using the Monte-Carlo approach. This study addresses some issues that have not been given much attention in the literature, namely: (1) using the so-called CMC (Coupled Markov Chain) model for modeling heterogeneity as a non-Gaussian field characterized by multi-dimensional transition probabilities rather than variograms or autocorrelation functions, (2) considering a hydrodynamic flow field that is non-uniform in the mean flow due to boundary conditions where flow is driven from the left top corner moving to the right domain boundary, and (3) utilizing the concept of forward modeling in the framework of conditioning on geological borehole information (geometrical configuration), rather than conditioning on direct measurements of the hydrogeological parameters (e. g. hydraulic conductivity, porosity, etc.). The model is applied on an <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>deposit</b> located in the central Rhine-Meuse delta in the Netherlands. The data at the site is merely used to calculate the transition probabilities used in the CMC model to generate a reference geological model {{for the rest of the}} analysis. The results show the potential applicability of the CMC model in reducing the uncertainty in concentration fields when a sufficient number of boreholes are available.

The study of the distribution and movement of groundwater is hydrogeology, also called groundwater hydrology. Image of the entire surface water flow of the Alapaha River near Jennings, Florida going into a sinkhole leading to the Floridan Aquifer groundwater. Typically, groundwater is thought of as liquid water flowing through shallow aquifers, but technically it can also include soil moisture, permafrost (frozen soil), immobile water in very low permeability bedrock, and deep geothermal or oil formation water. Groundwater is hypothesized to provide lubrication that can possibly influence the movement of faults. It is likely {{that much of the}} Earth's subsurface contains some water, which may be mixed with other fluids in some instances. Groundwater may not be confined only to the Earth. The formation of some of the landforms observed on Mars may have been influenced by groundwater.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Late Paleozoic Ice Age is {{recorded}} in the Paraná Basin as glacial deposits, deformational features and ice-related erosional landforms of the Itararé Group. Erosional landforms are often employed to build paleogeographic models that depict the location of ice masses and paleo ice-flow directions. This paper provides {{a review of the}} literature and new data on micro- to meso-scale ice-related, erosional landforms of the Paraná Basin. Examined landforms can be placed into four broad categories based on their mode of origin. Subglacial landforms on rigid substrates occur on the Precambrian basement or on older units in the Paraná Basin. They include streamlined landforms and striated pavements formed by abrasion and/or plucking beneath advancing glaciers. Subglacial landforms on soft beds are intraformational surfaces generated by erosion and deformation of <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>deposits</b> when overridden by glaciers. Ice-keel scour marks are soft-sediment striated/grooved landforms developed by the scouring of free-floating ice masses on underlying sediments. Striated clast pavements are horizons containing aligned clasts that are abraded subglacially due to the advance of glaciers on <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>deposits.</b> Only those erosional landforms formed subglacially can be used as reliable paleo ice-flow indicators. Based on these data, the paleogeography of the Paraná Basin during the Late Paleozoic Ice Age fits into a model of several glacial lobes derived from topographically-controlled ice spreading centers located around the basin instead of a single continental ice sheet...|$|R

40|$|The heavy {{precipitation}} event of November 3 - 8, 2006 dropped over 60 cm of rain onto the bare southern slopes of Mount St. Helens and generated debris flows in {{eight of the}} sixteen drainages outside the 1980 debris avalanche zone. Debris flows occurred on the upper catchments of the Muddy River, Shoestring Glacier, Pine Creek, June Lake, Butte Camp Dome, Blue Lake, Sheep Creek, and South Fork Toutle River. Debris flows were clustered on the west and south-east sides of the mountain. Of the eight debris flows, three were initiated by landslides, while five were initiated by headward or channel erosion. Six debris flows were initiated in deposits mapped as Holocene volcaniclastic deposits, while two were in 1980 pyroclastics on andesite flows. The largest (~ 975, 000 m 2) and longest (~ 8, 900 m) debris flow was initiated by landslides in the upper South Fork Toutle River Drainage. The average debris flow initiation zone elevation was 1, 750 m, with clusters around 1, 700 m and 2, 000 m elevation. The lower cluster is associated with basins that host modern or historic glaciers, while the upper is possibly associated with recent pyroclastic deposits. Upper drainages with debris flows averaged 41 % slopes steeper than 33 degrees, while those without debris flows averaged 34 %. The upper basins with debris flows averaged 6 % snow and ice cover, 21 % consolidated bedrock, and 74 % <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>deposits.</b> Basins without debris flows averaged 3 % snow and ice cover, 27 % bedrock, and 67 % <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>deposits.</b> Drainages with debris flows averaged an 89 % loss of glacier area between 1998 and 2009, while those without debris flows lost 68 %. Further comparing glacier coverage during that period found that only five of ten glaciers still existed in 2009. On average, the glaciers had reduced in area by 67 %, decreased in length by 36 %, and retreated {{by an average of}} 471 m during that period. Basin attributes were measured or calculated in order to construct a predictive debris flow model based on that of Pirot (2010) using multiple logistic regression. The most significant factors were the percentage of slopes steeper than 33 degrees, <b>unconsolidated</b> <b>deposits</b> in the upper basin, and average annual rainfall. These factors predicted the 2006 debris flows with an accuracy of 94 % in a debris flow susceptibility map for Mount St. Helens...|$|R
