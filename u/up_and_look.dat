5|$|The green rosella {{generally}} breeds at {{two years}} of age, though younger birds may pair <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> for nests. The breeding season is September to January, with one brood. The nesting site is usually a hollow over 1m (3ft) deep in a tree trunk anywhere up to 30m (100ft) above the ground. The tree chosen is generally a eucalypt such as Tasmanian bluegum, manna gum or mountain ash (E. regnans), or myrtle beech. Chimneys, holes in walls and even the vertical pipes of tennis court fences have been used. Green rosellas nested in a wall cavity at Port Arthur convict prison site in 1958 and 2009.|$|E
2500|$|When {{it comes}} to fashion, Bella isn't a girly girl. She hates {{dressing}} up, saying that makeup [...] "is a pain" [...] and that she feels uncomfortable in impractical, elegant clothes; however, Alice doesn't care what Bella thinks and continues to persuade her to dress <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> glamorous. She isn't materialistic and doesn't like spending money on luxurious items, as she stated to Edward in New Moon 'not to spend a dime on my birthday,' and that fast cars are unnecessary, saying that Edward gave her himself and anything else he gives her would throw their relationship off balance. She hates being singled out, and doesn't like her birthday being celebrated. She also has very negative views on teen marriage due to her parents' early experience, but learns to overcome them later.|$|E

2500|$|In November 1965, {{an article}} was {{published}} involving an antique oak rocking chair {{said to have}} been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was recently sold in an estate sale to Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to [...] "stand <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> around, you will find something of much value." [...] After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.|$|E
2500|$|Although Tormented {{received}} {{very little}} critical attention, reviews were positive, with critics finding fault in the album's production but praising its heaviness and aggression. AllMusic gave the album {{a very positive}} review, writing: [...] " [...] shows a band with its alternative metal heart {{in the right place}} [...] Despite some spotty production, this impressive debut unleashes a band whose amps are overloaded, and whose aim is deadly. The original version of [...] "Mudshuvel" [...] (which later appeared on Dysfunction) is one of several highlights." [...] In 1997, Steven Woltasek of CMJ New Music Report wrote: [...] "For those of you that don't know, wake <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> around for the debut release from Staind entitled [...] In the book Brave Nu World, author Tommy Udo wrote: [...] "To go back now and listen to Staind's 1996 debut, Tormented, back to back with Break The Cycle is like listening to another band". Scott Hefflon of the Lollipop wrote: [...] "Staind are savvy, street-smart, and dammit, they rock. Their studio debut, tOrmenteD, shows either a natural knack for milking the most out of a crunchy guitar, or they had some good coaching." [...] The Northeast Performer wrote: [...] "Staind's musicianship is striking, and their live performance takes their recorded material one step further: pushing the envelope, ripping up the envelope, then jumping up and down all over the envelope til there ain't a damn thing left".|$|E
2500|$|Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL {{project with}} DRDO's LRDE as a {{subsystem}} provider. This project {{to develop an}} advanced, lightweight Multi-mode fire control radar for the LCA Tejas fighter had faced challenges and was delayed and finally superseded by a program called the Uttam to develop an AESA FCR for the Tejas LCA. The MMR program was finally completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance and became a hybrid system incorporating the original DRDO antenna, gimbal stabilization and Israeli backend. The multi-mode radar has range (for detection of a small fighter target) around 100km, can track 10 targets, can engage 2 targets and uses lightweight system. Originally, DRDO developed an all new combined signal and data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The radar's critical hardware was also developed and validated. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in both look <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> down modes) but air-to-ground modes were still being worked upon and proved problematic. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought but still faced significant delay and challenges. At Aero India 2009, {{it was revealed that}} the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved Elta EL/M-2032 technology for Air-to-Ground mapping and targeting – in order to simplify testing, the Hybrid MMR basically became an Indian variant of the EL/M-2032 with an Indian antenna and gimbal system as Elta pointed out mixing and matching Indian hardware with Israeli software would in essence mean a new design with a significant time impact. The [...] "hybrid" [...] MMR has been tested, validated and will be supplied for the initial LCA Tejas fighters.|$|E

2500|$|Cruyff {{is officially}} {{considered}} as the founding father of now famous Barça-Ajax school of football (also known as 'Barçajax school'), with a distinctive footballing philosophy and predominant style of play, that {{was born in}} Barcelona but has roots in the 1970s Dutch (Amsterdam) school of Total Football. La Masia, Barça's youth academy and talent factory, was among Cruyff's lasting legacy. It {{was the brainchild of}} Cruyff. In 1979, he wanted to establish a copy of the Ajax Youth Academy in Barcelona. His proposal was accepted by president Josep Núñez. It was ten years after the inception of the youth program, La Masia, when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team. One of the first graduates, who would later earn international acclaim, was previous Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. On 11 July 2010, Spain won the World Cup final with eight players from Barcelona; seven were from La Masia, and six of them were in the starting line-up: Gerard Piqué, Carles Puyol, Andrés Iniesta, Xavi, Sergio Busquets, and Pedro. This set a record for the most players to be provided by a club side for a team in a World Cup final. On 10 January 2011, La Masia achieved a record breaking honour becoming the first youth academy to have trained all three finalists for the Ballon d'Or in a single year, with Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi and Xavi. On 25 November 2012, {{for the first time in}} the club's history, away at Levante's Estadi Ciutat de València, Barcelona played with eleven players formed at La Masia. In an English biography of Pep Guardiola, Guillem Balagué writes, [...] "Cruyff introduced some passing drills into Barça's 'arterial' system. And since then, the rondos have been not just a method but a symbol of the club's playing style: of dominating and never losing the ball. Cruyff blended several ideas and concepts and converted them into a philosophy – the seeds of which were planted throughout a club in urgent need of a footballing identity. Until then, the first team of Barcelona had been comfortably living in a world of excuses and enemies, content with their role as victims when faced with Real Madrid, an institution seen from Catalonia as the club of the Establishment," [...] and adding, “Xavi Hernández describes the style in its purest form: 'I pass the ball and move, or I pass the ball and stay where I am. I make myself available to help you; I look at you. I stop, I keep my head <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>look,</b> and, above all, I open up the pitch. Whoever has the ball is running play. That comes from the school of Johan Cuyff and Pep Guardiola. This is Barça.'" [...] On the legacy of Cruyff's football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club, former Barcelona manager Guardiola stated, [...] "Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] And one of the most famous La Masia graduates, Xavi, said, [...] "He [...] changed the idiosyncrasy of the club. He introduced the philosophy to keep the ball, to play in triangles, to attack. That philosophy remains true to this day. We're all students of Cruyff and his school of thought." ...|$|E
