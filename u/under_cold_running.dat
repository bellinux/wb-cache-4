50|$|Svið is {{prepared}} by first burning off the hair, then cleaning the head <b>under</b> <b>running</b> <b>cold</b> water while paying {{special attention to}} the eyes and ears. The head must then be sawn in half lengthwise and the brain removed; if it is frozen first, this is less messy. The brains can be cooked with the skin. When it is ready for cooking, it is put into a cooking pot, sprinkled with coarse salt and partly covered with water. When the water boils, the scum is skimmed off. The head can then be cooked covered for 60 to 90 minutes, until the flesh is cooked through but before it has begun to separate from the bone. It can then be served immediately, hot, or can be left to cool down {{so that it can be}} served cold.|$|R

50|$|Hard-boiled eggs {{can vary}} widely in {{how easy it}} is to peel away the shells. In general, the fresher an egg before boiling, the more {{difficult}} it is to separate the shell cleanly from the egg white. As a fresh egg ages, it gradually loses both moisture and carbon dioxide through pores in the shell; as a consequence, the contents of the egg shrink and the pH of the albumen becomes more basic. Albumen with higher pH (more basic) is less likely to stick to the egg shell, while pockets of air develop in eggs that have lost significant amounts of moisture, also making eggs easier to peel. Keeping the cooked eggs soaked in water helps keep the membrane under the egg shell moisturized for easy peeling. Peeling the egg <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water is an effective method of removing the shell. Starting the cooking in hot water also makes the egg easier to peel.|$|E
5000|$|Removing the [...] "sand vein" [...] (a {{euphemism}} for the digestive tract) {{is referred to}} as [...] "deveining". The sand vein can be removed by making a shallow cut lengthwise down the outer curve of the shrimp's body, allowing the dark ribbon-like digestive tract to be removed with a pointed utensil. Special deveining tools are sometimes used but knives, skewers, and even toothpicks can be used to devein. Alternatively, if the tail has been detached, the vein can be pinched at the tail end and pulled out completely with the fingers. On large shrimp, the [...] "blood vein" [...] (a {{euphemism for}} the ventral nerve cord) along the inner curve of the shrimp's body is typically removed as well. The shrimp is then rinsed <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> <b>running</b> water. Removing the vein is not essential, as it is not poisonous and is mostly tasteless. Deveining does slightly change the flavor and makes it more consistent. Shrimp also sometimes consume small amounts of sand and the vein might thus be gritty.|$|E

50|$|Through flashbacks {{it turns}} out that Stone and Vlad grew up {{together}} in the same orphanage where they were mistreated by the headmistress and The Physical Education Guider. Once Vlad stolen from a warehouse condensed milk, and the Stone is not passed it. Then Vlad persuades the boy to steal a folder with their personal affairs and to escape from the orphanage (Vlad hopes that it will take a grandmother who for whatever reason do not unmentioned issued guardianship over him at the time). On the way, Vlad says Stone that when he grows up, he will set their own rules, and no one will give them orders. But destroying folders chores, Vlad suddenly throwing stones, claiming that his grandmother will not take the two of them. Stone wanted for theft cases - and he could crawl under the window in the archive. In parting, he hands him his nail, which was used as a weapon of self-defense. Realizing that in the orphanage he was severely punished, and hope for the adoption burned together with the case (and before escaping he went up for adoption), Stone tried to cut his throat with a nail. But he is caught and returned to the orphanage, where the Headmistress and the Physical Education Guider tortured the boy <b>under</b> <b>running</b> <b>cold</b> and hot water.|$|R

40|$|Ascites {{syndrome}} is a growth-related disorder of broilers that occurs {{more often in}} fast-growing birds and at low temperatures. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate genetic and phenotypic correlations among ascites-related traits measured either <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> or <b>under</b> normal temperature conditions, and to estimate genetic correlations between ascites-related traits measured <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> and normal conditions. 2. Several traits related to ascites were measured on more than 4000 chickens <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> conditions and on more than 700 chickens under normal conditions. 3. The heritability estimates for body weight (BW) measured <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> and normal conditions were 0 · 42 and 0 · 50, respectively, for haematocrit value 0 · 46 and 0 · 17, respectively, and for ratio of right to total ventricular weight 0 · 45 and 0 · 12, respectively. 4. The genetic correlation between BW and haematocrit value <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> conditions was - 0 · 23 and between BW and ratio of right to total ventricular weight - 0 · 27. Under normal conditions, however, these genetic correlations were 0 · 55 and 0 · 50, respectively. 5. These results demonstrate that the heritability estimates of ascites-related traits as well as genetic correlations between ascites-related traits and BW depend on the temperature conditions under which animals are kept. 6. Strong positive genetic correlations (around 0 · 8) were observed between total mortality, fluid in the abdomen and ratio of right to total ventricular weight <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> conditions. The genetic correlation between ratio of right to total ventricular weight <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> and normal conditions was 0 · 91. 7. These results suggest that the ratio of right to total ventricular weight measured under normal temperature conditions might serve as a good indicator trait for ascite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Densification {{behavior}} of iron powder <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stepped compaction was studied. Experimental data were also obtained for iron powder <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stepped compaction. The elastoplastic constitutive equation {{based on the}} yield function of Shima and Oyane was implemented into a finite element program (ABAQUS) to simulate compaction responses of iron powder during cold stepped compaction. Finite element results were compared with experimental data for densification, deformed geometry and density distribution. The agreement between finite element results and experimental data was very good for iron powder. The distributions of hydrostatic pressure and the Mises stress of iron powder <b>under</b> <b>cold</b> stepped compaction were also studied...|$|R
