40|$|International audienceA novel path-planning {{algorithm}} is proposed for a tracked mobile robot to traverse <b>uneven</b> <b>terrains,</b> which can efficiently search for stability sub-optimal paths. This algorithm consists of combining two RRT-like algorithms (the Transition-based RRT (T-RRT) and the Dynamic-Domain RRT (DD-RRT) algorithms) bidirectionally and of representing the robot-terrain interaction with the robot’s quasi-static tip-over stability measure (assuming that the robot traverses <b>uneven</b> <b>terrains</b> at low speed for safety). The robot’s stability is computed by first estimating the robot’s pose, {{which in turn is}} interpreted as a contact problem, formulated as a linear complementarity problem (LCP), and solved using the Lemke’s method (which guarantees a fast convergence). The present work compares the performance of the proposed algorithm to other RRT-like algorithms (in terms of planning time, rate of success in finding solutions and the associated cost values) over various <b>uneven</b> <b>terrains</b> and shows that the proposed algorithm can be advantageous over its counterparts in various aspects of the planning performance...|$|R

Nevertheless, Sierra On-Line released B.C.'s Quest For Tires in 1983 on the ColecoVision and several home computer platforms. The game features large, smooth-scrolling levels and simplistic platform gameplay in which players jump over oncoming pitfalls and obstacles, much like Moon Patrol.

40|$|Mobile robots are {{increasingly}} getting popular in outdoor applications. Long period of continuous operations {{are common in}} such applications. Therefore, robot motions need to be optimized to minimize their energy consumption. Shortest paths do not always guarantee minimum energy consumptions of mobile robots. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to generate energy-efficient paths on <b>uneven</b> <b>terrains</b> using an established energycost model for mobile robots. Terrains are represented using grid based elevation maps. Similar to A* algorithm, the energy-cost of traversing through a particular gird depends on a heuristic energy-cost estimation from the current location to the goal. The proposed heuristic energy-cost function {{makes it possible to}} generate zigzag-like path patterns on steep hills under the power limitations of the robot. Therefore, the proposed method can find physically feasible energy-efficient paths on any given terrain, provided that such paths exist.

25|$|The initial {{idea for}} {{realising}} K9 {{was to use}} a small actor inside a robotic Dobermann costume, but that was rejected in favour of a radio-controlled prop, designed by Tony Harding and made by the BBC Visual Effects Department. The Radio Control Model Centre in Harlington Middx owned by Derek Wales was commissioned to build the electronics into the first original basic shell and consequently the centre operated the dog on set for the BBC. The robot suffered from numerous technical problems during its time in the series, often malfunctioning because the radio controls interfered with the cameras and vice versa. On location, K9 also proved unable to traverse <b>uneven</b> <b>terrain,</b> and shots had to be conceived with this in mind. Workarounds included using a concealed piece of twine to pull the character along (this string can be clearly seen in a shot of K9 on Brighton Beach), or laying wooden planks on which it could roll.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary {{stretches}} to the legs, such as {{the wall}} stretch, condition the hamstrings and the calf muscle to various movements before vigorously working them. But a study has shown that Kinesiology tape gives more promising effect in hamstring extensibility to produce more fluid movement. Thirty previously injured males showed a greater advantage of hamstring extensibility in longer durations with Kinesiology tape, or elastic therapeutic tape. However, they were more advantageous {{in the beginning of}} the exercise with a voluntary, static stretch or proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, which are stretching techniques specific to optimize the range of motion of the limb. This shows that stretches do help in the immediate time frames, whereas Kinesiology tape helps in long durations to prevent any future injuries from occurring. The environment and surroundings, such as <b>uneven</b> <b>terrain,</b> can cause the feet to position in an unnatural way, so wearing shoes that can absorb forces from the ground’s impact and allow for stabilizing the feet can prevent some injuries while running as well. Shoes should be structured to allow friction-traction at the shoe surface, space for different foot-strike stresses, or for comfortable, regular arches for the feet.|$|E
25|$|The dynamic {{interactions}} between Spinal cord and sensory input are ensured by modulating transmission in locomotor pathways in a state- and phase-dependent manner. For instance, proprioceptive inputs from extensors can, during stance, adjust {{the timing and}} amplitude of muscle activities of the limbs to the speed of locomotion but be silenced during the swing phase of the cycle. Similarly, skin afferents participate predominantly in the correction of limb and foot placement during stance on <b>uneven</b> <b>terrain,</b> but skin stimuli can evoke different types of responses depending on when they occur within the step cycle. It {{is important to note}} that inputs from the hip appear to play a critical role in spinal locomotion. Experiments on spinal animals showed that when one limb is held with the hip flexed, locomotion on that side stops while the other limb continues walking. However, when the stopped limb is extended at the hip joint to a point normally reached at the end of stance during walking, it suddenly flexes and starts walking again provided that the contralateral limb is a position to accept the weight of the hindquarters. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it.|$|E
40|$|Mobile robots {{are often}} {{utilized}} in remote and hostile outdoor environments with uncertainties and unknown dangerous.

Recently proposed Z* search algorithm is capable of finding physically feasible energy-efficient paths on <b>uneven</b> <b>terrains.</b> It can achieve the same accuracy as any brute force algorithm, but with a low computational complexity. However, neither Z* nor any other energy-efficient path planners can effectively handle path replanning triggered by environment changes such as emergence of obstacles.

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can find equally energy-efficient paths as Z* does, but at a considerably lower computational cost.
