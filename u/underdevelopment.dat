5|$|Congenital {{malformation}} or <b>underdevelopment</b> (hypoplasia) of the cerebellar vermis is {{a characteristic}} of both Dandy–Walker syndrome and Joubert syndrome. In very rare cases, the entire cerebellum may be absent. The inherited neurological disorders Machado–Joseph disease, ataxia telangiectasia, and Friedreich's ataxia cause progressive neurodegeneration linked to cerebellar loss. Congenital brain malformations outside the cerebellum can, in turn, cause herniation of cerebellar tissue, as seen in some forms of Arnold–Chiari malformation.|$|E
5|$|Employment {{possibilities}} within El Hatillo – {{a bedroom}} community of Caracas – are reduced; {{businesses in the}} municipality are almost strictly commercial, and the economy has not expanded in other directions. Office space <b>underdevelopment</b> has resulted {{from a lack of}} land for large scale office construction, making it costly to locate large offices or businesses in the area. Those seeking employment in offices or larger businesses must look outside of El Hatillo, contributing to the high traffic to, from, and in El Hatillo.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} is congenital and {{is characterized by}} a number of nasal, facial and cranial features. These include a broad and high, sometimes depressed nasal bridge (top of the nose, between the eyes) and a flattened nasal tip. This can give the nose a shortened, arch-like appearance. Hypertelorism (unusually wide-set eyes), prominent frontal bones and supraorbital ridge (the eyebrow ridge), bilateral epicanthic folds (an extra flap of skin over the eyelids), a broad forehead and an overall enlarged head circumference have also been observed. A bulging of the upper lip with an exaggerated cupid's bow shape, and maxillary hypoplasia (<b>underdevelopment</b> of the upper jaw) with retraction have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|Weak {{attacks from}} uke {{allow for a}} {{conditioned}} response from tori, and result in <b>underdevelopment</b> of the skills needed for the safe and effective practice of both partners. To counteract this, some styles allow students to become less compliant over time but, {{in keeping with the}} core philosophies, this is after having demonstrated proficiency in being able to protect themselves and their training partners. Shodokan Aikido addresses the issue by practising in a competitive format. Such adaptations are debated between styles, with some maintaining that {{there is no need to}} adjust their methods because either the criticisms are unjustified, or that they are not training for self-defense or combat effectiveness, but spiritual, fitness or other reasons.|$|E
5|$|The current monarch, Abdullah II, {{ascended to}} the throne in February 1999 {{after the death of}} his father Hussein. Abdullah re-affirmed Jordan's {{commitment}} to the peace treaty with Israel and its relations with the United States. He refocused the government's agenda on economic reform, during his first year. King Abdullah's eldest son, Prince Hussein, is the current Crown Prince of Jordan. The current prime minister is Hani Al-Mulki who received his position on 29 May 2016. Abdullah had announced his intentions of turning Jordan into a parliamentary system, where the largest bloc in parliament forms a government. However, the <b>underdevelopment</b> of political parties in the country have hampered such moves. Jordan has around 50 political parties representing nationalist, leftist, Islamist, and liberal ideologies. Political parties contested a fifth of the seats in the 2016 elections, the remainder belonging to independent politicians.|$|E
25|$|Fertility {{is further}} {{compromised}} by the <b>underdevelopment</b> of seminal vesicles and prostate.|$|E
25|$|Papillorenal {{syndrome}}, {{also called}} renal-coloboma syndrome or isolated renal hypoplasia, is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder marked by <b>underdevelopment</b> (hypoplasia) of the kidney and colobomas of the optic nerve.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{arachnoid}} cysts {{occurring in}} the middle fossa are accompanied by <b>underdevelopment</b> (hypoplasia) or compression of the temporal lobe. The exact role that temporal lobe abnormalities play {{in the development of}} middle fossa arachnoid cysts is unknown.|$|E
25|$|North Korean beers {{have low}} hop content due to taste preferences. North Korean breweries have an {{abundance}} of fresh water. Due to the <b>underdevelopment</b> of North Korea's industries, there are no pollution problems with the water. Other ingredients are imported.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the {{government}} launched {{a program to}} develop the northern region, largely with international help. Spain had shown particular interest {{in the development of}} the region, because its <b>underdevelopment</b> has fueled illegal immigration and drug trafficking across the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E
25|$|The Worcester NECTA has a {{relatively}} high percentage (12.0%) of employment in manufacturing. Next to the Barnstable Town NECTA, it has a high percentage (14.9%) of employment in the healthcare sector. It has the lowest percentage of employment (8.7%) in the leisure and hospitality sector, reflecting the relative <b>underdevelopment</b> of its tourism industry.|$|E
25|$|During thelarche, the {{developing}} breasts are sometimes of unequal size, and usually the left breast is slightly larger. This condition of asymmetry is transitory and statistically normal in female {{physical and sexual}} development. Medical conditions can cause overdevelopment (e.g., virginal breast hypertrophy, macromastia) or <b>underdevelopment</b> (e.g., tuberous breast deformity, micromastia) in girls and women.|$|E
25|$|At the Ligue d'Action française, Groulx and {{his colleagues}} hoped to inspire revival of the French {{language}} and French Canadian culture, but also to create a think tank and public space of reflection, so that the French Canadian nation's elites would find ways to remedy French Canada's <b>underdevelopment</b> and exclusion from big business.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries {{science in}} Spain was {{held back by}} severe {{political}} instability and consequent economic <b>underdevelopment.</b> Despite the conditions, some important scientists and engineers emerged. The most notable were Miguel Servet, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Narcís Monturiol, Celedonio Calatayud, Juan de la Cierva, Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, Margarita Salas and Severo Ochoa.|$|E
25|$|Wiener always {{shared his}} {{theories}} and findings with other researchers, and credited {{the contributions of}} others. These included Soviet researchers and their findings. Wiener's acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the Cold War. He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living, and to end economic <b>underdevelopment.</b> His ideas became influential in India, whose government he advised during the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The unified Romanian state {{promoted}} a common identity {{for all its}} Romanian-speaking inhabitants. Owing partly to its relative <b>underdevelopment</b> compared to other regions of Greater Romania, {{as well as to}} the low competence and corruption of the new Romanian administration in this province, the integration process of Bessarabia in the unified Romanian state was less successful than in other regions and was soon to be disrupted by the Soviet occupation.|$|E
25|$|A non-inherited {{cause of}} excess urinary {{excretion}} of proline and glycine, {{similar to that}} found in iminoglycinuria, is quite common to newborn infants younger than 6 months. Sometimes referred to as neonatal iminoglycinuria, it is due to <b>underdevelopment</b> of high-affinity transport mechanisms within the renal circuit, specifically PAT2, SIT1 and SLC6A18. The condition corrects itself with age. In cases where this persists beyond childhood, however, inherited hyperglycinuria or iminoglycinuria may be suspected.|$|E
25|$|A study {{examining}} 806 {{women who}} had babies with birth defects between 1997 and 2006, and 849 {{women who had}} healthy babies, found that smog in the San Joaquin Valley area of California was linked to two types of neural tube defects: spina bifida (a condition involving, among other manifestations, certain malformations of the spinal column), and anencephaly (the <b>underdevelopment</b> or absence of part {{or all of the}} brain, which if not fatal usually results in profound impairment).|$|E
25|$|Development {{geography}} is {{a branch of}} geography which refers to {{the standard of living}} and its quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, development is a process of change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change. However, development is not always a positive process. Gunder Frank commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of <b>underdevelopment.</b> This is covered in his dependency theory.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is by {{endoscopic}} valve ablation. Fetal {{surgery is}} a high risk procedure reserved for cases with severe oligohydramnios, to try to limit the associated lung <b>underdevelopment,</b> or pulmonary hypoplasia, that is seen at birth in these patients. The risks of fetal surgery are significant and include limb entrapment, abdominal injury, and fetal or maternal death. Specific procedures for in utero intervention include infusions of amniotic fluid, serial bladder aspiration, and creating {{a connection between the}} amniotic sac and the fetal bladder, or vesicoamniotic shunt.|$|E
25|$|Plunkett's {{task was}} frustrating. He {{was a pioneer}} {{of the concept of}} {{systematic}} rural development, who, in spite of his role in Irish affairs being often overlooked, influenced many international reformers, and can be credited {{as one of the few}} who had a long-term vision for the development of rural Ireland. He was apt to remind audiences that, even if full peasant proprietorship was achieved and Home Rule was implemented, rural <b>underdevelopment</b> would still have to be faced. But class conflict between farmers and shopkeepers intervened to frustrate much of what he aimed to do.|$|E
25|$|Endocrine {{abnormalities}} {{in other}} areas have also been present with the disorder. These include hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency and hypopituitarism. Findings affecting pituitary function in some JBS patients have included such anomalies as {{the formation of a}} glial hamartoma (a neoplasm, or tumor composed of glial cells) on a lobe of the pituitary gland, as well congenital <b>underdevelopment</b> of the anterior pituitary. Growth failure and associated short stature (dwarfism) in JBS can be attributed to growth hormone deficiency caused by diminished anterior pituitary function, with malabsorption of fats playing a subsequent role.|$|E
25|$|Because {{external}} vacuum {{expansion of}} the recipient-site tissues permits injecting large-volume fat grafts (+300cc) to correct defects and enhance the bust, the histologic viability of the breast filler (adipocyte fat) and its volume must be monitored and maintained. The long-term, volume maintenance data reported in Breast Augmentation using Pre-expansion and Autologous Fat Transplantation: a Clinical Radiological Study (2010) indicate the technical effectiveness of external tissue {{expansion of the}} recipient site for a 25-patient study group, who had 46 breasts augmented with fat grafts. The indications included micromastia (<b>underdevelopment),</b> explantation deformity (empty implant pocket), and congenital defects (tuberous breast deformity, Poland's syndrome).|$|E
25|$|Posterior {{urethral}} valve (PUV) {{disorder is}} an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and genitourinary system of male newborns. A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra {{as a result}} of abnormal in utero development. It is {{the most common cause of}} bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases followed conservatively. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung <b>underdevelopment</b> as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring. It occurs in about one in 8000 babies.|$|E
25|$|The entire {{capitalist}} system thus {{appears as a}} hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as {{the outcome of the}} uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, but it is an integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and it is precisely the unity that here determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and <b>underdevelopment</b> reciprocally determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.|$|E
25|$|Easterly and Levine further {{observe that}} studies {{of how the}} {{environment}} directly influences land and labor were tarred by racist theories of <b>underdevelopment,</b> {{but that does not}} mean that such theories can be automatically discredited. They argue that Diamond correctly stresses the importance of germs and crops in the very long-run of societal technological development. They find that regression results support the findings of Jared Diamond and David Landes that factor endowments influence GDP per capita. However, Easterly and Levine's findings most support the view that long-lasting institutions most shape economic development outcomes. Relevant institutions include private property rights and the rule of law.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} the Matei Basarab High School and taking his Baccalaureate, he enlisted at the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters, Historical Section. It was here {{that the young man}} was acquainted with his first mentors: writer-collector Alexandru Odobescu and {{archeologist}} Grigore Tocilescu, the latter of whom ensured Tzigara's employment as custodian for the National Museum of Antiquities. He was a critic of the museum's <b>underdevelopment</b> under Tocilescu's management, and wrote that the disorganized collection comprised an Egyptian mummy, copies of frescoes from the Cathedral Church in Curtea de Argeș, items from the Pietroasele Treasure, and works of Precolumbian art, alongside a scale model of the Eiffel Tower.|$|E
25|$|Revolutionary {{nationalism}} {{reflected the}} heritage and {{rhetoric of the}} military reformist regimes of the past, {{as well as the}} spirit of the 1952 Revolution. It also showed the influence of the Peruvian government of General Juan Velasco Alvarado. Many Bolivian officers believed that the military had to intervene in politics to lead the country toward reform because civilian governments had failed in that undertaking. They were convinced that it was in the main interest of the armed forces to end <b>underdevelopment,</b> which they saw as the cause of insurgency. The military would therefore fight on the internal frontiers against social injustice and economic dependence.|$|E
25|$|After the Branch Line {{opened in}} 1990, the Woodlands MRT line was envisioned {{to close the}} gap between Yishun and Choa Chu Kang. During the initial {{planning}} of the line, Sembawang station was only intended as a provisional station, to be built at a later date due to the <b>underdevelopment</b> of Sembawang. Kranji station was not planned. But on the second round of planning, the government decided to build these stations and omit Sungei Kadut station from the plan. Sungei Kadut station will be built later if the town's population justifies the necessity for the station. With the official opening of the Woodlands Extension on 10 February 1996, the Branch Line became part of the North South Line.|$|E
25|$|The {{onset of}} the Cold War had {{important}} implications for Canadian foreign policy. Significantly, Canadian officials saw Latin America as a region particularly vulnerable {{to the spread of}} communism because of vast <b>underdevelopment</b> and socio-economic disparities. More importantly for Canada, however, was the immense propagation of American economic and political dominance and Americanization throughout the world. While Canada, like the United States during the early cold war years, could be viewed as a liberal-democracy devoted to the spread of capitalism and free market ideals, the Canadian form of the ideology was inherently more accepting of socialist facets. Effectively, Canada grew closer to many Latin American states and often acted as a mediator between the United States and Latin America.|$|E
25|$|Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman {{reject the}} idea that David ruled over a united monarchy, {{suggesting}} instead that he ruled only as a chieftain over the southern kingdom of Judah, {{much smaller than the}} northern kingdom of Israel at that time. They posit that Israel and Judah were still polytheistic in the time of David and Solomon, and that much later seventh-century redactors sought to portray a past golden age of a united, monotheistic monarchy in order to serve contemporary needs. They note a lack of archeological evidence for David's military campaigns and a relative <b>underdevelopment</b> of Jerusalem, the capital of Judah, compared to a more developed and urbanized Samaria, capital of Israel.|$|E
25|$|The {{recorded}} history of Darfur {{begins with the}} reign of the Keira dynasty in the seventeenth century. In 1875, the Anglo-Egyptian Co-dominion in Khartoum ended the dynasty. The British allowed Darfur a measure of autonomy until formal annexation in 1916. However, the region remained underdeveloped through the period of colonization and into independence in 1956. The majority of national resources were directed toward the riverine Arabs clustered along the Nile near Khartoum. This pattern of structural inequality and overly <b>underdevelopment</b> resulted in increasing restiveness among Darfuris. The influence of regional geopolitics and war by proxy, coupled with economic hardship and environmental degradation, from soon after independence led to sporadic armed resistance from the mid-1980s. The continued violence culminated in an armed resistance movement around 2003.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{developed}} cores of the Old world, India was distinguished by its caste system of bound labor, which hampered economic {{and population growth}} and resulted in relative <b>underdevelopment</b> compared to other core regions. Compared with other developed regions, India still possessed large amounts of unused resources. India's caste system gave an incentive to elites to drive their unfree laborers harder when faced with increased demand, rather than invest in new capital projects and technology. The Indian economy was characterized by vassal-lord relationships, which weakened the motive of financial profit {{and the development of}} markets; a talented artisan or merchant could not hope to gain much personal reward. Pomeranz argues that India was not a very likely site for an industrial breakthrough, despite its sophisticated commerce and technologies.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle East and the Ottoman Empire {{the effect}} of {{liberalism}} was significant. During the 19th century, Arab, Ottoman, and Persian intellectuals visited Europe to study and learn about Western literature, science and liberal ideas. This led them to ask themselves about their countries' <b>underdevelopment</b> and concluded {{that they needed to}} promote constitutionalism, development, and liberal values to modernize their societies. At the same time, the increasing European presence in the Middle East and the stagnation of the region encouraged some Middle Eastern leaders, including Mahmud II and his son Abdülmecid I, Muhammad Ali Pasha, and Amir Kabir, to make socio-political changes and start modernization projects. In 1826, intellectual and academic Rifa'a al-Tahtawi was sent to Paris in one of the Muhammad Ali's scholar missions. Tahtawi studied ethics, social and political philosophy, and mathematics. He read works by Condillac, Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu and Bézout, among others, during his séjour in France.|$|E
25|$|Inconsolable Memories (2005) {{is based}} on Tomas Gutierrez Alea's film Memorias del subdesarrollo (Memories of <b>Underdevelopment)</b> from 1968, updated to include {{references}} to the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Douglas's installation consists of a 16mm projection with a photographic series of contemporary Havana, Cuba. The film is looped and when presented as an installation the film and photographs {{create a sense of}} repetition, a common feature of Douglas' work. Rather than strictly working from Alea's film in the manner Douglas worked from Hitchock's Marnie, Inconsolable Memories plays with the layers of its various sources (Cuba in the 1960s, the 1980s and the present). Some of the photographs reference the locations used in the original Alea film tying together the themes of history and memory. At issue is the utopian promise of the Cuban revolution and its decline, and as well, the parallel Cold War events of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 (examined in Alea's film) and the boatlift of 1980.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{historians have}} found that {{societies}} in the Northern Hemisphere experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer <b>underdevelopment</b> due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant respiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones. Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital {{to invest in a}} sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria often need a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease.|$|E
