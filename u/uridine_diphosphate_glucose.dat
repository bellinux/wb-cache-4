40|$|Washed human {{platelets}} {{are capable}} of depositing 1 - 4 as well as probable 1 - 6 glucosyl linkages onto preexistent glycogen primer. They are also capable of degrading (glycogenolysis) newly synthesized 1 - 4 as well as probable 1 - 6 glucosyl linkages. A higher rate of glycogen synthesis was found in platelet suspensions containing lower concentrations of platelets. This was shown to result from decreased glycogen degradation and consequent increased residual glycogen primer in low platelet suspensions. The increased glycogen content of low platelet suspensions was not a result of platelet washing, removal of platelets from plasma, or release of platelet metabolites into the media. The enzyme glycogen synthetase {{was found to be}} present at a rate of 5. 2 μmoles of <b>uridine</b> <b>diphosphate</b> (UDP) <b>glucose</b> incorporated into glycogen per gram platelets per hour at 37 °C.

The molecular {{weight of the}} enzyme is between 70, 000 and 100, 000. <b>Uridine</b> <b>diphosphate</b> d-glucose is a substrate; the diphosphoglucose derivatives of adenosine, cytidine, guanosine, and thymidine are not substrates.

When UDP-glucose {{is the only}} substrate supplied, the detergent-solubilized glucosyltransferase incorporates a single glucosyl residue onto each teichuronic acid acceptor. When both UDP-glucose and UDP-ManNAcA are supplied, the glucosyltransferase and the N-acetylmannosaminuronosyltransferase act cooperatively to elongate the teichuronic acid acceptor by multiple additions of the disaccharide repeat unit.

A small portion of the enzyme from all three sources was found to be particulate when homogenized in aqueous sucrose media. Characterization of the particulate form by discontinuous sucrose density gradient showed the enzyme to be located at two different densities, one of which corresponded to chloroplasts in the leaves and plastids in the coleoptiles and roots. Homogenization and fractionation of the oat leaves using the nonaqueous media, hexane, and carbon tetrachloride, resulted in 50 to 60 % of the enzyme being associated with chloroplasts and the remainder being associated with other membranous material.

P 450 ox has an apparent molecular mass of 55 kD, its N-terminal amino acid sequence is -ATTATPQLLGGSVP, and it contains the internal sequence MDRLVADLDRAAA. Reconstitution of P 450 ox with NADPH-P 450 oxidoreductase in micelles of L-alpha-dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine identified P 450 ox as a multifunctional P 450 catalyzing dehydration of (Z) -oxime to p-hydroxyphenylaceto-nitrile (nitrile) and C-hydroxylation of p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile to nitrile. P 450 ox is extremely labile compared with the P 450 s previously isolated from sorghum. When P 450 ox is reconstituted {{in the presence of}} a soluble <b>uridine</b> <b>diphosphate</b> <b>glucose</b> glucosyltransferase, oxime is converted to dhurrin.
