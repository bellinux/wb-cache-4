5|$|After Pete George's {{retirement}} in 1987, the <b>upkeep</b> of the Wreck fell directly upon {{the shoulders of}} the Wreck Drivers and Reck Club. In 1994, the Hapeville Plant ended their relationship with Reck Club. Since then, the Wreck has been student maintained with the assistance of local Atlanta garages. The Wreck has had numerous mechanical and cosmetic repairs over the years since Pete George's initial full rebuild.|$|E
5|$|By 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, {{was living}} as a pauper in a workhouse at Hatfield Peverel near Chelmsford. Calcraft was ordered to pay 3shillings a week towards her <b>upkeep,</b> to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister {{should be made to}} help, and that he had three {{children}} of his own to support, although there is no record of his marriage.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the greed}} of toll road {{operators}} resulted in diminishing <b>upkeep,</b> which forced the province to enact legislature allowing counties to assume {{ownership of the}} roads. It took until 1907 for Oxford County to assume the toll road; the proprietors were compensated with $15,500 ($ when adjusted for inflation from 1916).|$|E
5|$|In 1251, the sheriffs {{were ordered}} to pay fourpence a day towards the <b>upkeep</b> for the King's polar bear, a gift from Haakon IV of Norway in the same year; the bear {{attracted}} {{a great deal of}} attention from Londoners when it went fishing in the Thames while tied to the land by a chain.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only were}} stone castles {{expensive}} {{to build in}} the first place, but their maintenance was a constant drain. They contained a lot of timber, which was often unseasoned {{and as a result}} needed careful <b>upkeep.</b> For example, it is documented that in the late 12thcentury repairs at castles such as Exeter and Gloucester cost between £20 and £50 annually.|$|E
5|$|The M32 is a trunk road, {{therefore}} its {{maintenance and}} <b>upkeep</b> {{is paid for}} by Highways England, the national roads authority. Most of the road has two lanes in each direction, though an extended sliproad north of junction 2 provides a climbing lane, and the short section between junction 1 and the M4 has three lanes both ways.|$|E
5|$|The road {{connecting}} Sioux Lookout and Hudson {{with the}} Ignace–Dryden Road was initially under the <b>upkeep</b> of the Department of Northern Development. On April 1, 1937, that department was merged into the Department of Highways (DHO), {{after which the}} provincial highway network was expanded into northern Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The state {{government}} {{has decided to}} take over the <b>upkeep</b> of this temple, which is presently with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). This temple is notified as an Ancient Monument (N-AP-50) by ASI. The two sacred water tanks – Rama theertham and Lakshmana theertham – are located in the precincts of the temple.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} of any visits by eminent people to the castle, {{although there is a}} belief that in 1207 KingJohn visited and donated £5 towards the <b>upkeep</b> of its chapel. EdwardII certainly visited the castle and was there for three days in November 1323, during which time he also visited Norton Priory.|$|E
5|$|To {{help pay}} for the <b>upkeep</b> of the site, a {{greyhound}} track was built in 1927. The first meeting was held on 7 April 1928. The Arms Park (Cardiff) Greyhound Racing Company Limited signed a 50-year lease in 1937, with Cardiff Athletic Clubthe owners of the Arms Parkhaving no rights to break the agreement or to review the rental until 50 years expired.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its <b>upkeep,</b> in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|After visiting Guacanayabo and Cienfuegos late in March {{and early}} in April, Bridgeport moved to Manzanillo and {{remained}} nearby until setting sail for New York on 24 April. She arrived at New York on 30 April {{for several days}} of <b>upkeep</b> and liberty {{before moving on to}} her summer base. On 17 May, she sailed for Newport, Rhode Island, the summer base for the destroyer squadrons, and arrived there the following day to tend the destroyers of Flotilla2.|$|E
5|$|At the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif) in Jerusalem, Ahmad Pasha ibn Ridwan had a khalwa, {{known as}} the Mamluk Khalwa, built for local Sufis headed by al-Ghazi Abu al-Sa'ud, and {{for the study of}} Islamic {{jurisprudence}} in 1601. The architect of the khalwa was Abd al-Muhsin ibn Nimr, who worked Ahmad Pasha's other projects in Jerusalem. Ahmad Pasha established a waqf to fund Abu al-Sa'ud and the khalwa's <b>upkeep</b> and management.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was also}} {{concerned}} with easing overland {{transport of goods}} to Virginia. In mid-1795, he, Robert Barr, Elijah Craig, and Harry Toulmin formed a committee {{to raise funds for}} a road connecting the Cumberland Gap to central Kentucky. Breckinridge was disappointed with the quality of the route, which was finished in late 1796, concluding that the individual maintaining it was keeping most of the tolls instead of using them for the road's <b>upkeep.</b>|$|E
5|$|Created in 1894 as {{a result}} of {{legislation}} requiring each parish to have its own council, the council presently consists of 13 members and is responsible for a variety aspects of parish life: the general <b>upkeep</b> and maintenance of two recreation grounds, the village green, War Memorial, Community Centre, parish allotments, and (in part) the churchyard. The council also funds floodlights to illuminate the church. A magazine, the Ditton Gazette, is published on a quarterly basis and is circulated among the households of the parish. In February 2006, the council was awarded Quality Parish Council status.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a major {{coaching}} route, {{there were}} several obstacles along it, including the bridge over the Tyburn. A turnpike trust {{was established in the}} 1730s to improve <b>upkeep</b> of the road. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their final journey from Newgate Prison to the gallows at Tyburn near Marble Arch. Spectators drunkenly jeered at prisoners as they carted along the road, and could buy rope used in the executions from the hangman in taverns. By about 1729, the road had become known as Oxford Street.|$|E
5|$|Gisa {{obtained}} land {{grants for}} the <b>upkeep</b> {{of the church}} and canons from King Edward the Confessor and the later kings Harold Godwinson and William I of England. He is mentioned many times in the Domesday Book as the holder of land for the see, and was notorious for acquiring land throughout his bishopric. The only surviving writ of Harold's issued while Harold was king dealt with Giso's rights as bishop, and was addressed to Abbot Æthelnoth of Glastonbury, the sheriff of Somerset, and the thegns of Somerset.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the state}} created the wartime shrine board, which {{expanded}} control over state shrines and expanded the state's role. Up to that point, individual priests had been {{limited in their}} political roles, delegated to certain rituals and shrine <b>upkeep,</b> and rarely encouraged Emperor worship, or other aspects of state ideology, independently. No shrine priest, or member of the Wartime Shrine board, had previously sought public office, which some scholars, such as Sakamoto, suggest is evidence of the state's use of Shinto to its own ends, rather than the Shinto priest's attempt to achieve political power.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to stripping al-Azhar of {{its status as}} congregational mosque, Saladin also ordered the removal from the mihrab of the mosque a silver band on which {{the names of the}} Fatimid caliphs had been inscribed. This and similar silver bands removed from other mosques totaled 5,000 dirhems. Saladin did not completely disregard the <b>upkeep</b> of the mosque and according to al-Mufaddal one of the mosque's minarets was raised during Saladin's rule.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the First World War the council's Markets Committee began a {{programme}} of gradually buying back all the privately owned stalls, with the intention of encouraging demobilised servicemen to work on the market. Within a few years the market was entirely publicly owned, and the council took responsibility for the <b>upkeep</b> of the market. The city also bought out and closed many of the 30 or more inns in the area, transferring their licences to the growing suburbs.|$|E
5|$|Meredith died in Withington, Manchester in April 1958 {{at the age}} of 83, {{two months}} after the Munich air disaster, which claimed the lives of eight Manchester United players. After he spent many years in an unmarked grave, the Professional Footballers' Association, the Welsh FA, Manchester City and Manchester United all agreed {{to cover the cost of}} <b>upkeep</b> on a new headstone. Meredith is honoured in the hall of fame at the City of Manchester Stadium. It was {{announced}} in August 2007 that Meredith was one of the 10 new inductees for 2007 to the English Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|NY59 {{originated}} as the Nyack Turnpike, {{which was}} the first major thoroughfare in Rockland County. A petition was filed in 1813 to construct the turnpike. Legislation stemming from the petition was passed on April17, 1816, allowing construction to begin. The Nyack Turnpike was completed from Suffern to Nyack in the 1830s, despite many years of local opposition to the highway. Its charter was renewed multiple times throughout the 19th century, and it was designated as a toll road to help pay for its <b>upkeep.</b> In 1894, the turnpike was absorbed into the Rockland County road system.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} the changes to the ride in 1990, the special effects began to {{deteriorate}} {{due to a lack}} of <b>upkeep.</b> By the time the ride closed, many of the effects were no longer active or had been covered up. Blacklight reactant paint lined the walls, mostly in the form of handprints or outlines of scenes. These gave a 3-D appearance when the rider wore special glasses purchased at the beginning of the queue.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1950s {{the cult}} of Kataragama has taken a nationalistic tone amongst the Sinhalese people. People visit the shrine year long, and during the annual festival {{it looks like a}} carnival. People get into trance and indulge in ecstatic rituals {{formerly}} associated with Hindus such as fire walking, Kavadi and even body piercing or hook swinging. These ecstatic rituals have carried through the island and are widely practiced. Prominent Sinhalese politicians such as Dudley Senanayake and Ranasinghe Premadasa have associated with the temple <b>upkeep</b> by building, renovation and cleaning projects.|$|E
5|$|Sparty can {{be found}} {{entertaining}} MSU sporting event crowds with his antics during games. He is even lifted upon the shoulders of cheerleaders and does one-handed push ups. Besides sporting events, Sparty also attends many events around campus, the community, and the country throughout the year: alumni functions, charity events, weddings, bar mitzvahs, parades, and many other university events. Any revenues generated go to the <b>upkeep</b> of the Sparty Mascot Program, which is funded mainly by the MSU Alumni Association.|$|E
5|$|The aediles were {{in charge}} of various {{municipal}} tasks, e.g. the <b>upkeep</b> of temples, streets, and the water-supply. They were also responsible for public games, and some aspects of police work in the city. The quaestors were elected administrators, which could be put in charge of the treasury, the granaries, or various administrative postings in Italy, with the consuls, or in the provinces. In the late Republic, election to the quaestorship became the basis for a life appointment to the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The first {{document}} to recognise {{the town was}} issued in 1075, when the King of Scots, Malcolm III (reigned 1058–93) granted the shire of Kirkcaladunt, among other gifts, to the church at Dunfermline. The residents were expected to pay dues and taxes for the church's general <b>upkeep.</b> Two charters, later confirmed by Malcolm's son David I in 1128 and 1130, refer to Kircalethin and Kirkcaladunit respectively, but do not indicate their locations.|$|E
5|$|This highway {{has been}} {{associated}} with emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Sher Shah Suri, the latter became synonymous with this route due to his role in ensuring the safety of the travelers and the <b>upkeep</b> of the road. Emperor Sher Shah widened and realigned the road to other routes, and provided approximately 1700 roadside inns through his empire. These inns provided free food and lodgings to the travelers regardless of their status.|$|E
5|$|To this end, the 22nd Army Corps issued General Order 89, which stated (in part) {{that the}} guns and {{ammunition}} removed from the dismantled forts {{should be kept in}} storage. Fort Greble was chosen as one of the storage locations. As a second-class fort, Fort Greble continued to receive regular maintenance and <b>upkeep.</b> By the end of August 1865, however, with funds running low, and no further appropriations likely, this work began to slack off. As the money ran out, more and more forts were designated as second- or third-class locations, and were dismantled and the land returned to its original owners.|$|E
5|$|While {{working as}} photojournalists, the Joneses {{continued}} to volunteer on archaeological excavations around Britain, and in 1956 they began {{working as a}} freelance archaeologist for the Ministry of Works. At the time the Ministry {{was responsible for the}} <b>upkeep</b> of Ancient Monuments and, by extension, the large volume of rescue archaeology required to document archaeological sites before they were destroyed by the postwar construction boom. A small workforce of itinerant archaeologists were employed to excavate these sites in advance of development. Between 1956 and 1965, Margaret Jones directed a number of such excavations in Buckinghamshire, Yorkshire and Lincolnshire (including Old Sleaford).|$|E
5|$|After Kapoor's {{design for}} the {{sculpture}} was selected during a design competition, numerous technological concerns regarding the design's construction and assembly arose, in addition to concerns regarding the sculpture's <b>upkeep</b> and maintenance. Experts were consulted, some of whom believed the design could not be implemented. Eventually, a feasible method was found, but the sculpture's construction fell behind schedule. Cloud Gate was unveiled in an incomplete form during the Millennium Park grand opening celebration, as the grid of welds around each metal panel was still visible. The sculpture was concealed again while it was completed; in early 2005, workers polished out the seams. Cloud Gate was formally dedicated on May 15, 2006, and it has since gained considerable popularity, both domestically and internationally.|$|E
5|$|As castles {{were not}} simply {{military}} buildings but centres of administration and symbols of power, {{they had a}} significant impact on the surrounding landscape. Placed by a frequently-used road or river, the toll castle ensured that a lord would get his due toll money from merchants. Rural castles were often associated with mills and field systems due to their role in managing the lord's estate, which gave them greater influence over resources. Others were adjacent to or in royal forests or deer parks and were important in their <b>upkeep.</b> Fish ponds were a luxury of the lordly elite, and many were found next to castles. Not only were they practical in that they ensured a water supply and fresh fish, but they were a status symbol as they were expensive to build and maintain.|$|E
5|$|At the 1911 Imperial Conference Australia {{expressed}} concern about Japan's growing naval power and {{it was agreed that}} the British government would consult Australia when negotiating renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. It was also decided that the Royal Navy would continue to support the RAN and provide blue-water defence capability in the Pacific and that if there was war the ships of the RAN would be transferred to British Admiralty control. Under the Naval Defence Act (1912) the power to make the transfer was conferred in the Governor-General. The RAN would become the Australia Squadron of the Royal Navy with all ships and personnel under the direct control of the British Admiralty, while the RAN remained responsible for the <b>upkeep</b> of the ships and training.|$|E
5|$|By 1911, {{the owner}} Major Richard Winstanley {{was unable to}} pay for the <b>upkeep</b> of the castle and, {{concerned}} about its deteriorating condition, proposed placing the property into the guardianship of the Commissioners of Works. Following a survey by the architect Sir Frank Baines, which showed the ruins to need immediate repairs, the Commissioners took over the castle the following year. It was restored by Sir Charles Peers, the Inspector of Ancient Monuments, between 1912 and 1913. He stripped away any remains of the farm, cleared the vegetation from the walls and repaired the brickwork, re-cutting the moat and reconstructing a replica of the medieval bridge.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, most of Mdina's enciente had {{a system}} of double walls. The land front was flanked by four towers, one near Greeks Gate, another at {{the centre of the}} land front, the Turri Mastra (also known as Turri dila bandiera) near the main {{entrance}} and the Turri di la Camera at the southeast corner of the city. A barbican was built near Mdina's main entrance sometime after 1448. In the 1450s there were fears of a Barbary or Ottoman attack, so efforts were made to improve Mdina's walls. The main ditch was completed, and the Castellu di la Chitati was partially demolished by royal licence in 1453, due to its ruinous state and the excessive cost for its <b>upkeep.</b>|$|E
5|$|By the 1770s {{the castle}} was roofless, and was {{regarded}} as a romantic ruin by 19th-century painters and visitors to the Highlands. In 1884 the castle came under the control of Caroline, Dowager Countess of Seafield, widow of the 7th Earl of Seafield, on the death of her son the 8th Earl. On Lady Seafield's death in 1911 her will instructed that Urquhart Castle be entrusted into state care, and in October 1913 responsibility for the castle's <b>upkeep</b> was transferred to the Commissioners of His Majesty's Works and Public Buildings. Historic Environment Scotland (formerly Historic Scotland), the successor to the Office of Works, continues to maintain the castle, which is scheduled monument in recognition of its national significance.|$|E
