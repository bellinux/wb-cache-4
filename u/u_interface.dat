40|$|Rich Communication Services (RCS) is a {{framework}} that defines a set of IP-based services for the delivery of multimedia communications to mobile network subscribers. The framework unifies a set of pre-existing communication services under a single name, and permits network operators to re-use investments in existing network infrastructure, especially the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which is a core part of a mobile network and also acts as a docking station for RCS services. RCS generates and utilises disparate subscriber data sets during execution, however, it lacks a harmonised repository {{for the management of}} such data sets, thus making it difficult to obtain a unified view of heterogeneous subscriber data. This thesis proposes the creation of a unified data repository for RCS which is based on the User Data Convergence (UDC) standard. The standard was proposed by the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP), a major telecommunications standardisation group. UDC provides an approach for consolidating subscriber data into a single logical repository without adversely affecting existing network infrastructure, such as the IMS. Thus, this thesis details the design and development of a prototypical implementation of a unified repository, named Converged Subscriber Data Repository (CSDR). It adopts a polyglot persistence model for the underlying data store and exposes heterogeneous data through the Open Data Protocol (OData), which is a candidate implementation of the <b>Ud</b> <b>interface</b> defined in the UDC architecture. With the introduction of polyglot persistence, multiple data stores can be used within the CSDR and disparate network data sources can access heterogeneous data sets using OData as a standard communications protocol. As the CSDR persistence model becomes more complex due to the inclusion of more storage technologies, polyglot persistence ensures a consistent conceptual view of these data sets through OData. Importantly, the CSDR prototype was integrated into a popular open-source implementation of the core part of an IMS network known as the Open IMS Core. The successful integration of the prototype demonstrates its ability to manage and expose a consolidated view of heterogeneous subscriber data, which are generated and used by different RCS services deployed within IMS...|$|R

40|$|Background: Answering {{questions}} such as “Which genes are related to breast cancer? ” usually requires retrieving relevant publications through the PubMed search engine, reading these publications, and creating gene lists. This process is not only time-consuming, but also prone to errors. Results: We report GLAD 4 U (Gene List Automatically Derived For You), a new, free web-based gene retrieval and prioritization tool. GLAD 4 U takes advantage of existing resources of the NCBI to ensure computational efficiency. The quality of gene lists created by GLAD 4 U for three Gene Ontology (GO) terms and three disease terms was assessed using corresponding “gold standard ” lists curated in public databases. For all queries, GLAD 4 U gene lists showed very high recall but low precision, leading to low F-measure. As a comparison, EBIMed’s recall was consistently lower than GLAD 4 U, but its precision was higher. To present the most relevant genes {{at the top of}} a list, we studied two prioritization methods based on publication count and the hypergeometric test, and compared the ranked lists and those generated by EBIMed to the gold standards. Both GLAD 4 U methods outperformed EBIMed for all queries based on a variety of quality metrics. Moreover, the hypergeometric method allowed for a better performance by thresholding genes with low scores. In addition, manual examination suggests that many false-positives could be explained by the incompleteness of the gold standards. The GLAD 4 <b>U</b> user <b>interface</b> accepts any valid queries for PubMed, and its output page displays the ranked gene list and information associated with each gene, chronologically-ordered supporting publications, along with a summary of the run and links for file export and functional enrichment and protein interaction network analysis.

We obtain “quasi-optimal {{rates of}} {{convergence}} ” for transmission (interface) problems on domains with smooth, curved boundaries using a non-conforming Generalized Finite Element Method (GFEM). More precisely, we study the strongly elliptic problem P u: = − ∑ ∂j(Aij∂iu) = f in a smooth bounded domain Ω with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The coefficients Aij are piecewise smooth, possibly with jump discontinuities along a smooth, closed surface Γ, called the interface, {{which does not}} intersect the boundary of the domain. We consider a sequence of approximation spaces Sµ satisfying two conditions: (1) nearly zero boundary and interface matching, (2) approximability, which {{are similar to those}} in Babuˇska, Nistor, and Tarfulea, J.

Then, if uµ ∈ Sµ, µ ≥ 1, is a sequence of Galerkin approximations of the solution <b>u</b> to the <b>interface</b> problem, the approximation error ‖u − uµ‖H ˆ 1 (Ω) is of order O(hm µ), where hm µ is the typical size of the elements in S µ and ˆ H 1 is the Sobolev space of functions in H 1 {{on each side of the}} interface.

While these proteins mediate interactions with host cells that contribute to disease pathogenesis, the infected RBC surface proteome remains poorly characterized. Here we use a novel strategy (I-SELEX) to discover high affinity aptamers that selectively recognize distinct epitopes uniquely present on parasite-infected RBCs. Based on inertial focusing in spiral microfluidic channels, I-SELEX enables stringent partitioning of cells (efficiency[*]≥[*] 10 [superscript 6]) from unbound oligonucleotides at high volume throughput (~ 2 [*]×[*] 10 [superscript 6][*]cells[*]min[superscript − 1]). Using an RBC model displaying a single, non-native antigen and live malaria parasite-infected RBCs as targets, we establish suitability of this strategy for de novo aptamer selections. We demonstrate recovery of a diverse set of aptamers that recognize distinct, surface-displayed epitopes on parasite-infected RBCs with nanomolar affinity, including an aptamer against the protein responsible for placental sequestration, var 2 CSA. These findings validate I-SELEX as a broadly applicable aptamer discovery platform that enables identification of new reagents for mapping the parasite-infected RBC surface proteome at higher molecular resolution to potentially contribute to malaria diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine efforts.

A categorical transition system (or system) is a pair (J, K(J) →C) consisting of a shape labelled by a functor in a category in C. Systems generalize conventional labelled transition systems. By choosing a suitable universe of shapes, systems can model concurrent and asynchronous computation. By labelling in a category, rather than an alphabet or term algebra, the actions of an algorithm or process can have structure. We study a class of systems called twisted systems having the form S =(J,FJ̃ → C) where J is a reflexive graph and 				: RGrph → RGrph is the twisted graph construction. The relevance of twisted systems lies in the relationship between twists and spans. A functor FJ → Sp(C) into a bicategory of spans is equivalent to a functor FJ̃ → C. The connection with spans means that when the target category C = Set, then following Burstall, a twisted system {{can be viewed as a}} generalized flow-chart. The theory extends to modeling interacting processes. If U is a system, then a process of type U is a system S and a morphism p: S → U.

In addition to using a prototype -instance object model, these systems also use constraints to tie objects' values together, and new models for input and output. The result is a significantly different style of programming than conventional class-based object systems.
