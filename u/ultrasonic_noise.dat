5|$|Unpalatability, broadly understood, can {{be created}} {{in a variety of}} ways. Some insects such as the {{ladybird}} or tiger moth contain bitter-tasting chemicals, while the skunk produces a noxious odour, and the poison glands of the poison dart frog, the sting of a velvet ant or neurotoxin in a black widow spider make them dangerous or painful to attack. Tiger moths advertise their unpalatability by either producing <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>noises</b> which warn bats to avoid them, or by warning postures which expose brightly coloured body parts (see Unkenreflex), or exposing eyespots. Velvet ants (actually parasitic wasps) such as Dasymutilla occidentalis both have bright colours and produce audible noises when grabbed (via stridulation), which serve to reinforce the warning. Among mammals, predators can be dissuaded when a smaller animal is aggressive and able to defend itself, as for example in honey badgers.|$|R

The {{performance of the}} technique is demonstrated using ultrasonic B-scans from samples with coarse material structure. 1 Introduction The main goal of <b>ultrasonic</b> grain <b>noise</b> suppression in material flaw detection {{is to improve the}} perceptual possibilities of the operator to observe defect echoes. The suppression is defined as perceptually ideal when a received signal (or image) which contains echoes buried in noise is filtered to yield nonzero values only at the positions of the defect echoes. In statistical terms, a perceptual improvement is therefore obtained if the amplitude distribution in the filtered signal (image) is more concentrated around zero than in the raw data (contrast enhancement). A more concentrated amplitude distribution generally means smaller entropy. Thus, from an operator perception point of view, interesting results [...] ...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a number}} of deer-vehicle crash (DVC) {{countermeasure}} devices sold to the general public that indicate they use “ultrasonic ” noise to alert deer to the approach of a vehicle. These devices are commonly referred to as “deer whistles”. Deer whistles have existed for a relatively long time (they were introduced in the late 1970 s) and have even been distributed to drivers by some insurance companies for a reduced fee rate. The primary objective of deer whistle devices is to alert a deer by producing a noise that draws their attention and reduces the risk of a DVC occurring (e. g., the deer freezes or flees). The manufacturers of these devices, for the most part, indicate that they produce <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> in the range of 16 to 20 kilohertz (kHz). The devices reportedly produce this noise (which is outside the range of human hearing) as air passes through them.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} error eliminating rapid ultrasonic firing (EERUF), a {{new method}} for firing multiple ultrasonic sensors in mobile robot applications. EERUF allows ultrasonic sensors to fire at rates that are {{five to ten}} times faster than those customary in conventional applications. This is possible because EERUF reduces the number of erroneous readings due to <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> by one to two orders of magnitude. While faster firing rates improve the reliability and robustness of mobile robot obstacle avoidance and are necessary for safe travel at higher speed (e. g., V > 0. 3 m/sec), they introduce more <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>noise</b> and increase the occurrence rate of crosstalk. However, EERUF almost eliminates crosstalk, making fast firing feasible. Furthermore, ERRUF's unique noise rejection capability allows multiple mobile robots to collaborate in the same environment, even if their ultrasonic sensors operate at the same frequencies. We have implemented and tested the EERUF method on a mobile robot and we present experimental results. With EERUF, a mobile robot was able to traverse an obstacle course of densely spaced, pencil-thin (8 mm-diameter) poles at up to 1 m/sec.
