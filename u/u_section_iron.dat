40|$|The Almond River Catchment, Scotland, has {{experienced}} significant coal and oil shale mining {{over the last}} 300 years. Examination of surface water quality data from 1994 to 2008 indicates that this legacy continues to impact water quality. During low flows, elevated iron and sulphate loadings in the river are correlated with both coal and oil shale mining areas, most likely from pyrite oxidation at abandoned mine sites. On certain river <b>sections</b> <b>iron</b> loading decreases due to in-stream precipitation. Both iron and sulphate concentrations in the river water show significant flow dependence due to: the re-suspension of river bed iron precipitate; and sulphate dilution...|$|R

50|$|It took Stackpole {{two years}} to {{complete}} the statue, it starting out as a three inch figure. Stackpole went through 50 renditions before settling upon the final model which was 10 ft tall. The model was then divided into cross sections. Each cross section was enlarged eight-fold though a process using a pantograph. Scaffolding was set up and prepared for the precise assembly of the enlarged <b>sections.</b> <b>Iron</b> was used for supports, bent and shaped around the proper contours of the statue. Next, mesh wire was layered over the entire iron frame, and then covered in a final blanket of plaster. Such a construction was always meant for temporary placement.|$|R

50|$|It is the {{practice}} in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or <b>U</b> <b>sections,</b> (or mill rolled) C sections.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the resonance {{evaluation of the}} 235 <b>U</b> cross <b>sections</b> in the unresolved resonance region from 2. 25 keV up to 25 keV and its use in benchmark calculations for criticality safety applications. A criticality safety calculation for a nuclear system with an energy spectrum that peaks in the intermediate energy region requires accurate neutron cross sections in both the resolved and the unresolved resonance regions. A resolved resonance region evaluation of the 235 <b>U</b> cross <b>section</b> was performed in the 90 ’s, and the evaluation has greatly improved results of benchmark calculations. 1) Average values of the Reich-Moore resonance parameters obtained in the resolved region were used to initiate a new resonance evaluation of the 235 <b>U</b> cross <b>sections</b> in the unresolved resonance region. The experimental data used in the analysis consisted of high-resolution transmission data, plus fission and capture cross-section data measured at the Oak Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator (ORELA). The evaluation was performed using the computer code SAMMY, which incorporates a methodology for data evaluation in the unresolved resonance region...|$|R

25|$|By the 1820s {{the first}} shaped rolled rails {{had begun to}} be {{produced}} initially of a T shape which required a chair to hold them; the rails were held in position by iron wedges (which sometimes caused the rail to break when forced in) and later by wooden wedges, which became the standard. In the 1830s Robert L. Stevens invented the flanged 'tee' rail (actually a distorted I beam), which had a flat bottom and required no chair; a similar design was the contemporary bridge rail (of inverted <b>U</b> <b>section</b> with a bottom flange and laid on longitudinal sleepers); these rails were initially nailed directly to the sleeper.|$|R
