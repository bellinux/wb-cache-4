A judge of the animal might see in his eye a spark of that vicious temper which is frequently the accompaniment of the form that is most vigorous and enduring; but the weight, the hand, and {{the seat of the}} rider, added to the late regular exercise of a long journey, had subdued his stubbornness for the present. He was accompanied by the honest bonnet maker, who being, as the reader is aware, a little round man, and what is vulgarly called duck legged, had planted himself like a red pincushion (for he was wrapped in a scarlet cloak, over which he had slung a hawking pouch), {{on the top of a}} great saddle, which he might be said rather to be perched upon than to bestride. The saddle and the man were girthed on the ridge bone of a great trampling Flemish mare, with a nose turned up in the air like a camel, a huge fleece of hair at each foot, and every hoof full as large in circumference as a frying pan. The contrast between the beast and the rider was so extremely extraordinary, that, whilst chance passengers contented themselves with wondering how he got up, his friends were anticipating with sorrow the perils which must attend his coming down again; for the high seated horseman's feet did not by any means come beneath the laps of the saddle. He had associated himself to the smith, whose motions he had watched for the purpose of joining him; for it was Oliver Proudfute's opinion that men of action showed to most advantage when beside each other; and he was delighted when some wag of the lower class had gravity enough to cry out, without laughing outright: [...] "There goes the pride of Perth--there go the slashing craftsmen, the jolly Smith of the Wynd and the bold bonnet maker!" ...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} graph {{states of}} arbitrary {{number of particles}} undergoing generic decoherence. We present methods to obtain lower and upper bounds for the system's entanglement {{in terms of that}} of considerably smaller subsystems. For an important class of noisy channels, namely the Pauli maps, these bounds coincide and thus provide the exact analytical expression for the entanglement evolution. All the results apply also to (mixed) graph-diagonal states, and hold true for any convex entanglement monotone. Since any state can be locally depolarized to some graph-diagonal state, our method provides a lower bound for the entanglement decay of any arbitrary state. Finally, this formalism also allows for the direct identification of the robustness <b>under</b> <b>size</b> scaling of graph states in the presence of decoherence, merely by inspection of their connectivities.

The optimal large deviation decay rate can be arbitrarily close to the one for the corresponding probability in an infinite-server queue, which only depends on the system traffic intensity but not on any higher moments of the job size distribution. This supports in a many-server asymptotic framework the common wisdom that separating large jobs from small jobs protects system performance against job size variability. © 2013 INFORMS...|$|E

Through examples we show that the quasi-propulsive efficiency is a rational non-dimensional metric of the propulsive fitness of fish and fish-like mechanisms, consistent with the goal to minimize fuel consumption <b>under</b> <b>size</b> and velocity constraints. We perform two-dimensional viscous simulations and apply the concept of quasi-propulsive efficiency to illustrate and discuss the {{efficiency of}} two-dimensional undulating foils employing first carangiform and then anguilliform kinematics.

40|$|We {{present an}} exact {{algorithm}} for finding a decision tree that optimizes a ranking function <b>under</b> <b>size,</b> depth, accuracy and leaf constraints.

From the application point of view, it can be used to discover trees that cannot be found by heuristic decision tree learners. The key idea behind our algorithm is the relation between constraints on decision trees and constraints on itemsets.

40|$|We studied {{costs and}} {{benefits}} of life history shifts of water fleas (genus Daphnia) in response to infochemicals from planktivorous fish. We applied a dynamic energy budget model to investigate the resource allocation patterns underlying the observed life history shifts and their adaptive value <b>under</b> <b>size</b> selective predation in one coherent analysis. Using a published data set of life history shifts in response to fish infochemicals we show that Daphnia invests less energy in somatic growth in the fish treatment. This observation complies with theoretical predictions on optimal resource allocation. However, the observed patterns of phenotypic plasticity cannot be explained by changes in resource allocation patterns alone because our model-based analysis of the empirical data clearly identified additional bioenergetic costs in the fish treatments. Consequently, the response to fish kairomone only becomes adaptive if the intensity of size selective predation surpasses a certain critical level. We believe {{that this is the first}} study that puts resource allocation, energetic costs, and adaptive value of predator induced life-history shifts – using empirical data – into one theoretical framework. ...|$|E
