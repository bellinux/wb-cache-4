5|$|Porto {{were unable}} to hold onto their lead for long; two minutes after the restart, Celtic {{equalised}} when Henrik Larsson met Didier Agathe's cross to send a looping header in over Porto's goalkeeper Vítor Baía to get his tenth goal of the tournament and his 200th Celtic goal. However, within five minutes, it was 2–1 to Porto when Deco's through ball found Dmitri Alenichev, who scored with a low shot. Just three minutes later, Celtic equalised once again through Henrik Larsson when he headed in Alan Thompson's corner.

25|$|The {{transition}} to red grape varieties was slow. Plantings of Cabernet Franc in the Pomerol area were recorded, under the names Vidure and Bidure, {{as early as}} the 16th century but Merlot {{does not appear to have}} been introduced to the area <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of hundred years later. In 1760, Louis-Léonard Fontémong, a Libournais négociant, planted what appears to be the first documented instance of Merlot in the region, in a vineyard that is now part of Château Rouget. However, white wine grapes continued to dominate the vineyards of Pomerol until the late 19th century when the higher prices of red clarets and the waning Dutch influence made red wine production more enticing. When the region received its full AOC status in 1936, the AOC regulation specifically outlawed the plantings of any white grape varieties in Pomerol.|$|E
25|$|Wynter {{embarked}} from Melbourne on 15 May 1940 {{with the}} advance party of I Corps with orders {{to establish a}} base organisation in the Middle East but the convoy he was travelling with was diverted to the United Kingdom. Up <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days before it arrived, the convoy had been {{under the command of}} Brigadier Leslie Morshead of the 18th Infantry Brigade but on 18 April, Wynter discovered that the Military Board back in Australia had promoted him to major general and appointed him to command the AIF in the United Kingdom. Wynter decided that, given the immediate danger of a German invasion of the United Kingdom, his force had to be ready to fight. He therefore reorganised the troops available to form a second infantry brigade. The 18th Infantry Brigade became the Southern Command Striking Force, with {{a key role in the}} defence of southern England. However, the anticipated invasion did not eventuate.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of a colony’s life, epiponine wasps flux from {{polygyny}} (many queens) to oligogyny (few queens) to monogyny (no queen). This cycle was first proposed by West-Eberhard (1978,1981) and is referred to as cyclical oligogyny. It has been suggested that this cycle is crucial for maintaining high genetic relatedness found among epiponini colonies. The series begins when a group of workers and queens found a nest. As time passes, the colony’s total egg layers diminish due either to death or from wasp dominance interactions. The number of egg layers decrease <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of queens are left in the colony. Once the colony’s queen population is significantly reduced, then a new generation of reproductive females are conceived. Since only a couple of mothers produce this new generation, the female offspring are closely related. Sometimes new queens will leave the old nest and found their own colony, thus repeating the colony cycle.|$|E

He recorded a goal and four points over 56 games while being named both Prince George's rookie and scholastic player of the year. The following season, he improved to 10 goals and 33 points in 70 games.

Jane Hall later revealed that she had known her character, Rebecca, would be the culprit from the start. She was told by the writers it what was what they had planned.

60|$|It was not <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of weeks}} later that Andre-Louis {{realized}} what had really happened to him, {{and he found himself}} at the same time an exhausted man, for during that fortnight he had been doing the work of two. If he had not hit upon the happy expedient of pairing-off his more advanced pupils to fence with each other, himself standing by to criticize, correct and otherwise instruct, he must have found the task utterly beyond his strength. Even so, it was necessary for him to fence some six hours daily, and every day he brought arrears of lassitude from yesterday until he was in danger of succumbing under the increasing burden of fatigue. In the end he took an assistant to deal with beginners, who gave the hardest work. He found him readily enough by good fortune in one of his own pupils named Le Duc. As the summer advanced, and the concourse of pupils steadily increased, it became necessary for him to take yet another assistant--an able young instructor named Galoche--and another room on the floor above.|$|E
60|$|When {{we attempt}} to trace the first steps in each {{operation}} of our minds, we are usually baulked by the difficulty of keeping watch, without embarrassing the freedom of its action. The difficulty {{is much more than}} the common and well-known one of attending to two things at once. It is especially {{due to the fact that}} the elementary operations of the mind are exceedingly faint and evanescent, and that it requires the utmost painstaking to watch them properly. It would seem impossible to give the required attention to the processes of thought, and yet to think as freely as if the mind had been in no way preoccupied. The peculiarity of the experiments I am about to describe is that I have succeeded in evading this difficulty. My method consists in allowing the mind to play freely for a very brief period, <b>until</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> or so of ideas have passed through it, and then, while the traces or echoes of those ideas are still lingering in the brain, to turn the attention upon them with a sudden and complete awakening; to arrest, to scrutinise them, and to record their exact appearance. Afterwards I collate the records at leisure, and discuss them, and draw conclusions. It must be understood that the second of the two ideas was never derived from the first, but always directly from the original object. This was ensured by absolutely withstanding all temptation to reverie. I do not mean that the first idea was of necessity a simple elementary thought; sometimes it was a glance down a familiar line of associations, sometimes it was a well-remembered mental attitude or mode of feeling, but I mean that it was never so far indulged in as to displace the object that had suggested it from being the primary topic of attention.|$|E
