2500|$|Mineral {{rights in}} the {{subsurface}} seem to be preferred over the landowner's rights by the Mineral Tenure Act or the Petroleum and Natural Gas Act in British Columbia (also a common law province) so that recourse to Rylands is quite limited, as case law has developed over liability [...] "to compensate {{the owner of a}} surface area for loss or damage caused by the entry, occupation or use of that area" [...] (MTA) and [...] "compensation for nuisance and disturbance from the entry, occupation or use" [...] (PNGA). The compensation for [...] "entry, <b>use</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupation</b> of the Property" [...] seems not to [...] "exceed the entire [...] value of the land" [...] as written in the registry. [...] This means in effect that the relocation costs (of, say, a farming operation, or an abode) or emotional damage are likely not payable by the expropriator. [...] Even municipalities cannot exclude miners. [...] The powers of an arbitrator include compensation for land, timber and time, but expressly do not include watershed, health and welfare, or lost cattle. Miners avoid environmental review; the province has no discretion to refuse mineral leases; miners need not notify landowners of transactions; the province can exempt mines from review when mining commences; and landowners do not have rights to refuse to negotiate.|$|E
2500|$|The courts {{had been}} divided over what, in {{addition}} to an act of [...] "assistance" [...] was an appropriate mental element of fault, if any. In Abu-Saleh it was thought that it was also not enough for Ms Abu-Saleh have been dishonest about the wrong thing (tax evasion, rather than breach of trust), but this view was held to be wrong by Lord Hoffmann in the leading case, Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd. Before this, in Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan, the House of Lords had resolved that [...] "dishonesty" [...] was a necessary element. It was also irrelevant whether the trustee was dishonest if the assistant that was actually being sued was dishonest. This meant that when Mr Tan, the managing director of a travel booking company, took booking money that his company was supposed to hold on trust for Royal Brunei Airlines, and used it for his own business, Mr Tan was liable to repay all sums personally. It did not matter whether the trustee (the company) was dishonest or not. By contrast, in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley it was seemed to be held that a solicitor, Mr Leech, who paid money to Mr Yardley to buy property, was not dishonest because he genuinely thought he could do this. In Barlow Clowes International Ltd v Eurotrust International Ltd the Privy Council clarified that the test for [...] "dishonesty", however, is not subjective like the criminal law test from R v Ghosh. It is objective. If a reasonable person would think an action is dishonest, the action is dishonest, and the defendant need not appreciate that they have acted dishonestly {{by the standards of the}} community. This led the Privy Council to agree that a director of an Isle of Mann company was dishonest, because, even though he did not know for sure, he was found at trial to have suspected that money passing through his hands was from a securities fraud scheme by Barlow Clowes. The result is that, because liability is based on objective fault, more defendants will be caught. If a claimant does bring an action for dishonest assistance, or liability for receipt, Tang Man Sit v Capacious Investments Ltd affirmed the principle that the claimant may not be overcompensated by suing for the same thing twice. So, Capacious Investments Ltd could make a claim against the late Mr Tang Man Sit's personal representative for renting out its properties, and it could ask the court to assess the amounts of both (1) loss of profits, and (2) loss of <b>use</b> <b>and</b> <b>occupation,</b> but then it could only claim one.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDespite being {{inside a}} {{protected}} area, Lake Sumidouro has been {{impacted by the}} anthropogenic occupation of the surrounding area since the 1970 &# 8217;s, compromising the ecological integrity of the lake <b>and</b> the sustainable <b>use</b> of natural resources. This study examined the current trophic classification {{of the lake and}} developed methods for improving it through an integrated analysis of morphometric and limnological parameters, land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> land <b>occupation</b> in the watershed, and eutrophication potential. Data for the limnological parameters, land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> land <b>occupation,</b> <b>and</b> morphometric characteristics of Lake Sumidouro were collected in the rainy and dry seasons of 2009 and 2010. Depending on the trophic classification system used, Lake Sumidouro is classified as oligotrophic to hypereutrophic. In our study, the highest concentration of nutrients occurred in the rainy season, indicating that high nutrient inputs played an important role during this period. Areas of anthropogenic occupation comprised approximately 62. 9 % of the total area of the watershed, with pasture and urban settlement as the main types of land use. The influent total phosphorus load was estimated to be 15, 824. 3 kg/year. To maintain mesotrophic conditions, this load must be reduced by 29. 4 %. By comparing the isolated use of trophic state indices, this study demonstrated that comparing the trophic state classification with morphometric analyses, land <b>use</b> <b>and</b> land <b>occupation</b> types in the watershed, and potential phosphorus load provided better information to guide management actions for restoration and conservation. Furthermore, this approach also allowed for evaluating the vulnerability of the environment to the eutrophication process...|$|R
