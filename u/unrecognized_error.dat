40|$|Two {{fundamental}} errors led Einstein {{to reject}} generally covariant gravitational field equations {{for over two}} years as he was developing his general theory of relativity. The first is well known in the literature. It was the presumption that weak, static gravitational fields must be spatially flat and a corresponding assumption about his weak field equations. I conjecture that a second hitherto <b>unrecognized</b> <b>error</b> also defeated Einstein's efforts. The same error, months later, allowed the hole argument to convince Einstein that all generally covariant gravitational field equations would be physically uninteresting. 2 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide geoscientists with the most {{accurate}} set of the Earth's astro-climatic parameters and daily insolation quantities, able to describe the Short-Term Orbital Forcing (STOF) as represented by the ever-changing incoming solar radiation. We provide an updated review and a pragmatic tool/database using the latest astronomical models and orbital ephemeris, for the entire Holocene and 1 kyr into the future. Our results are compared with the most important database produced for studying long-term orbital forcing showing no systematic discrepancies over the full thirteen thousand years period studied. Our detailed analysis of the periods present in STOF, as perturbed by Solar System bodies, yields a very rich dynamical modulation on annual-to-decadal timescales when compared to previous results. In addition, we addressed, for the first time, the error committed considering daily insolation as a continuous function of orbital longitudes with respect to the nominal values, i. e., calculating the corresponding daily insolation with orbital longitudes tabulated at noon. We found important relative differences up to ± 5 %, which correspond to errors of 2. 5 W m^- 2 in the daily mean insolation, for exactly the same calendar day and set of astro-climatic parameters. This previously <b>unrecognized</b> <b>error</b> could have a significant impact in both the initial and boundary conditions for any climate modeling experiment.

40|$|Presented at Society of Hospital Medicine, 03 / 30 / 2015, National Harbor, MD. BACKGROUND: Medical {{errors are}} {{frequently}} encountered by trainees {{but there is}} currently no standard curriculum for educating residents about medical errors. Morning report is a case-based peer-facilitated conference in which residents learn concepts in general internal medicine. We used our standard Chief Resident facilitated morning report to enhance resident learning about medical errors. PURPOSE: Evaluate house staff experiences with medical errors and to facilitate resident discussion, understating and reporting of medical errors using a morning report format. DESCRIPTION: Our Quality Chief Resident designed and led a 50 -minute morning report by selecting 3 cases of medical errors that had occurred recently on the teaching service: (1) a missed diagnosis that {{did not result in}} harm, (2) a delay in initiation of antibiotic therapy due to prolonged administrative approvals, and (3) discovery of a previously <b>unrecognized</b> <b>error</b> by a colleague when the patient was transferred to another service. For each instance, relevant clinical aspects of the case were presented, followed by resident-lead small group discussions about the seriousness of the error, reporting obligations, patient disclosure, and provider emotions. A more formal discussion was then led by the Quality Chief and an attending hospitalist that included the following principles of patient safety and just culture: differentiating adverse events from medical error; harm and near miss; reporting obligations; ethics of disclosure; and the concept of second victim. 17 / 19 residents and 4 / 5 faculty attendees completed a voluntary anonymous survey {{at the end of the}} session. 88 % of residents reported being involved in patient care when an error had occurred and 50 % involved in an error with serious patient harm. 75 % of residents had experienced emotional distress and 71 % reported feelings of guilt related to patient errors. Only 47 % reported any previous education about medical errors. Respondents’ self-reported confidence in reporting errors rose from 31 % before the session to 77 % reported after the conference. 88 % of respondents found the session useful or very useful, and 93 % recommended continuing these sessions in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Residents commonly encounter patient care errors which frequently result in feelings of emotional distress and guilt. A peer-led case-based morning report improved resident confidence in error reporting and was felt to be useful to surveyed attendees...|$|E

40|$|Acquiring {{accurate}} measurements of water vapor {{at the low}} mixing ratios (<[*] 10 [*]ppm) encountered in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS) {{has proven to be}} a significant analytical challenge evidenced by persistent disagreements between high-precision hygrometers. These disagreements have caused uncertainties in the description of the physical processes controlling dehydration of air in the tropical tropopause layer and entry of water into the stratosphere and have hindered validation of satellite water vapor retrievals. A 2011 airborne intercomparison of a large group of in situ hygrometers onboard the NASA WB- 57 F high-altitude research aircraft and balloons has provided an excellent opportunity to evaluate progress in the scientific community toward improved measurement agreement. In this work we intercompare the measurements from the Midlatitude Airborne Cirrus Properties Experiment (MACPEX) and discuss the quality of agreement. Differences between values reported by the instruments were reduced in comparison to some prior campaigns but were nonnegligible and on the order of 20 % (0. 8 [*]ppm). Our analysis suggests that <b>unrecognized</b> <b>errors</b> in the quantification of instrumental background for some or all of the hygrometers are a likely cause. Until these errors are understood, differences at this level will continue to somewhat limit our understanding of cirrus microphysical processes and dehydration in the tropical tropopause layer...|$|R

25|$|After {{the initial}} report of {{apparent}} superluminal velocities of neutrinos, most physicists {{in the field}} were quietly skeptical of the results, but prepared to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Experimental experts {{were aware of the}} complexity and difficulty of the measurement, so an extra <b>unrecognized</b> measurement <b>error</b> was still a real possibility, despite the care taken by the OPERA team. However, because of the widespread interest, several well-known experts did make public comments. Nobel laureates Steven Weinberg, George Smoot III, and Carlo Rubbia, and other physicists not affiliated with the experiment, including Michio Kaku, expressed skepticism about the accuracy of the experiment on the basis that the results challenged a long-held theory consistent with the results of many other tests of special relativity. Nevertheless, Ereditato, the OPERA spokesperson, stated that no one had an explanation that invalidated the experiment's results.|$|R
40|$|In Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) {{coordinate}} time-series <b>unrecognized</b> <b>errors</b> and unmodelled (periodic) {{effects may}} bias nonlinear motions induced by geophysical signals. Hence, understanding and mitigating these errors {{is vital to}} reducing biases and on revealing subtle geophysical signals. To assess the nature of periodic signals in coordinate time-series Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solutions for the period 2008 – 2015 are generated. The solutions consider Global Positioning System (GPS), GLObalnaya NAvigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema (GLONASS) or combined GPS+GLONASS (GNSS) observations. We assess the periodic signals of station coordinates computed using the combined International GNSS Service (IGS) and four of its Analysis Centers (ACs) products. Furthermore, we make use of different filtering methods to investigate {{the sources of the}} periodic signals. A faint fortnightly signal in our PPP solution based on Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) products and the existence of an 8 d period for those ACs generating combined GPS+GLONASS products are the main features in the GPS-only solutions. The existence of the 8 d period in the GPS-only solution indicates that GPS orbits computed in a combined GNSS solution contain GLONASS-specific signals. The GLONASS-only solution shows highly elevated powers at the third draconitic harmonic (∼ 120 d period), at the 8 d period and its harmonics (4 d, 2. 67 d) besides the well-known annual, semi-annual and other draconitic harmonics. We show that the GLONASS constellation gaps before December 2011 contribute to the power at some of the frequencies. However, the well-known fortnightly signal in GPS-only solutions is not discernible in the GLONASS-only solution. The combined GNSS solution contains periodic signals from both systems, with most of the powers being reduced when compared to the single-GNSS solutions. A 52 per cent reduction for the horizontal components and a 36 per cent reduction for the vertical component are achieved for the fortnightly signal from the GNSS solution compared to the GPS-only solution. Comparing the results of the employed filtering methods reveals that the source of most of the powers of draconitic and fortnightly signals are satellite-induced with a non-zero contribution of site-specific errors...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of Zdanovskii's rule {{as a fundamental}} method of predicting water activities in mixed aqueous strong electrolyte solutions has been investigated. Unfortunately, when literature data available for more than 100 ternary systems (i. e., two electrolytes plus water) were examined, sufficient measurements were rarely available to test Zdanovskii's rule conclusively. This is because few mixed systems have been studied {{by more than one}} (independent) investigator and, in these few cases, the differences between reported water activities are generally much larger than typical estimates of experimental uncertainty. Most of the electrolyte systems considered in this work are found statistically to conform with Zdanovskii's rule but often only within a worryingly large tolerance in residuals. However, when data are taken from a single source, deviations from Zdanovskii's rule, significant in comparison to the stated experimental precision, can often be attributed equally well to small, <b>unrecognized,</b> systematic <b>errors.</b> This dilemma can only be resolved by more experimental measurements of sufficient accuracy to achieve better agreement between independent observers. Our findings imply that (a) confidence in deviations from Zdanovskii's rule typically depends on a subjective judgment of data quality and (b) Zdanovskii's rule, albeit often difficult to validate, provides an impressively general method for estimating water activities in mixed aqueous strong electrolyte solutions, with a certainty that, objectively, is as good as or better than current experimental capability...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} {{knowledge}} about lead toxicity {{may serve as a}} useful template to judge and predict progress in understanding other toxicants. A paradigm shift has occurred in which toxicity has been recognized at levels long held to be harmless. This shift has been accelerated by the use of newer tools for measuring outcome. Lead effects have been identified in children at blood lead levels as low as 15 micrograms/dL. They include impaired psychometric intelligence, language function, attention, and classroom behavior. Lead exposure during pregnancy results in increased risk for minor malformations and lowered infant IQ scores until at least 2 years of age. Understanding of this toxicant has been blurred by seven <b>unrecognized</b> Type II <b>errors</b> frequently encountered in the lead literature. These errors are discussed.

50|$|Two McDonnell F-101 Voodoo fighters of the 75th Fighter Squadron were {{scrambled}} from Dow Air Force Base 22 {{minutes after}} midnight on 11 April 1961 to intercept an unidentified aircraft approaching the United States. SAGE identified the incoming aircraft as a Strategic Air Command bomber {{shortly after the}} fighters were airborne. The fighters' return to Dow was complicated by a light spring rainstorm, creating an icy runway under a 500-foot cloud ceiling. Dow's tactical air navigation system glide slope function was temporarily disabled after the first aircraft landed. The second aircraft was cleared to descend to 2,200 feet, using a two-dimensional radar approach, when it hit Bald Mountain at an elevation of 1,200 feet. Both crewmen in the second aircraft were killed. Investigators concluded the airfield elevation had been incorrectly set on the aircraft altimeter, creating a 1000-foot <b>error</b> <b>unrecognized</b> when aircrew acknowledged only the last two digits of altimeter readings in radio transmissions.|$|R
40|$|The Institute of Medicine {{reported}} in 2016 that medical errors are the 3 rd {{leading cause of}} death in the United States. In the primary care setting, frequency and severity are unknown. Medical error research is limited related to evaluation of interventions conducted by medical professional liability (MPL) companies of risk mitigation strategies. The purpose of this program evaluation was to determine the impact of multifaceted patient safety and risk mitigation educational interventions conducted in primary care settings on patient safety, reporting, and liability. The program evaluation employed a retrospective secondary analysis of actuarial data from a MPL carrier 2 ̆ 7 s educational interventions of 10 randomly selected Midwestern primary care clinics. Actuarial data consisted of nonparametric testing of categorical data to examine means and averages on previously conducted assessments, questionnaire responses, occurrence reports, and claims frequency. Outcome analysis of actuarial data revealed that the study population meet assessment criteria. Further actuarial analysis suggested that actual medical error occurrence reporting was inconsistent. Retrospective analysis of questionnaire responses demonstrated that despite educational interventions, more research is warranted to examine medical error understanding, language, and prevention in the primary care setting. Outcome evaluation conclusions suggest that healthcare providers are in a pivotal position to engage in proactive strategies in the primary care settings to mitigate risk; improve patient safety; and increase overall individual, organizational, and community understanding of medical <b>error</b> prevention. <b>Unrecognized</b> medical <b>errors</b> create a burden on society.

40|$|Wang et al. (1) {{presents}} {{results that}} are in disagreement with previous studies and makes inadequate attempts to explain these differences. In light of {{the widespread use of}} nzymatic hydrolysis, these differences deserve comment. Wang et al. (1) reported that [3 -glucuronidase from Escherichia coli (E. coli, Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, catalog #G 7396) was not able to hydrolyze any morphine- 3 -glucuronide, M 3 G, from a custom made quality control material at pH 6. 8 (0. 1 M, phosphate buffer) at 50 ~using 2500 Sigma U/mL in 16 h. They further eported similar results for patient urine samples. These findings are contrary to our experience and the experience ofothers (2 - 4). Romberg andLee (2) found that essentially 100 % of M 3 G in urine was hydrolyzed with the same product as used by Wang et al. (1) (Sigma Chemical catalog #G 7396) pH 6 to 6. 5 (0. 075 M phosphate buffer) at 50 ~ using 1000 to 1500 U/mL in 3 h. Zezulak et al. (3) found that at least 90 % of M 3 G in urine was hydrolyzed at pH 6. 8 (0. 075 M phosphate buffer) at 37 ~ using 1200 U/mL within 4 h. Hackett e al. (4) found that in excess of 90 % of M 3 G in urine was hydrolyzed with the same product (Sigma catalog #G 7396) as used by Wang et al.

40|$|Reconstruction of the ACL {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} performed orthopaedic procedures. 33 The overall goal of ACL reconstruction is to provide a stable and highly func-tional knee joint that permits return to sports activities. Failure of ACL reconstruction by recurrent laxity can be attributed to a variety of factors, including traumatic rein-jury, technical (surgical) <b>error,</b> <b>unrecognized</b> ligamentous injuries, or biologic factors. In addition, although stability may be restored, the reconstruction can still be termed a failure because the knee is stiff (defined by Johnson and Fu 17 as range of motion from 10 ° through 120 °) and painful. Subsequent deterioration of the meniscus and cartilage also can result in persistent complaints and an unsatisfactory outcome. Most reports on revision ACL reconstruction have focused on failure as a result of suboptimal surgical tech-nique and the technical aspects of revision reconstruc-tion. 5, 10, 36 Tunnel placement, graft fixation, graft tensioning, failure of incorporation, and trauma can be the cause of ACL graft failure. 1 This focus in the literature may reflect the learning curve during transition from a 2 -incision or open technique to an all-arthroscopic technique. 16, 26, 35, 41, 45 The purposes of our study are as follows: (1) to analyze our institution’s experience with revision ACL surgery, (2) to evaluate for factors that predict success, and (3) to deter-mine the associations between laxity, return to sports, and functional results...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} {{elemental}} and isotopic composition of noble {{gases in the}} bulk solar wind collected by the NASA Genesis sample return mission. He, Ne, and Ar were analyzed in diamond-like carbon on a silicon substrate (DOS) and ^(84),^(86) Kr and ^(129),^(132) Xe in silicon targets by UV laser ablation noble gas mass spectrometry. Solar wind noble gases are quantitatively retained in DOS and with exception of He also in Si as shown by a stepwise heating experiment on a flown DOS target and analyses on other bulk solar wind collector materials. Solar wind data presented here are absolutely calibrated and the error of the standard gas composition is included in stated uncertainties. The isotopic composition of the light noble gases in the bulk solar wind is as follows: ^ 3 He/^ 4 He: (4. 64 ± 0. 09) × 10 ^(− 4), ^(20) Ne/^(22) Ne: 13. 78 ± 0. 03, ^(21) Ne/^(22) Ne: 0. 0329 ± 0. 0001, ^(36) Ar/^(38) Ar 5. 47 ± 0. 01. The elemental composition is:^ 4 He/^(20) Ne: 656 ± 5, and ^(20) Ne/^(36) Ar 42. 1 ± 0. 3. Genesis provided the first Kr and Xe data on the contemporary bulk solar wind. The preliminary isotope and elemental composition is: ^(86) Kr/^(84) Kr: 0. 302 ± 0. 003, ^(129) Xe/^(132) Xe: 1. 05 ± 0. 02, ^(36) Ar/^(84) Kr 2390 ± 150, and ^(84) Kr/^(132) Xe 9. 5 ± 1. 0. The ^ 3 He/^ 4 He and the ^ 4 He/^(20) Ne ratios in the Genesis DOS target are the highest solar wind values measured in exposed natural and artificial targets. The isotopic composition of the other noble gases and the Kr/Xe ratio obtained in this work agree with data from lunar samples containing “young” (~ 100 Ma) solar wind, indicating that solar wind composition has not changed within at least the last 100 Ma. Genesis could provide in many cases more precise data on solar wind composition than any previous experiment. Because of the controlled exposure conditions, Genesis data are also less prone to <b>unrecognized</b> systematic <b>errors</b> than, e. g., lunar sample analyses.

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that both sides of a gastric biopsy sample have a similar appearance, the choice of which side of a specimen is to be sectioned is usually random. We tested the hypothesis that the diagnosis reached by examining the two sides of a gastric biopsy may differ. Eighty-one antral biopsy specimens from patients with neither focal lesions nor previous gastric surgery were evaluated. After preparing 8 - 10 sections from each of the two opposite faces of each biopsy, sections were scored for Helicobacter pylori, activity, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, lymphoid follicles. The presence of other lesions was also noted. Intrabiopsy agreement (the consistency in the identification of histological lesions on the opposite sides of the same sample) was calculated by using kappa statistics. A kappa value lower than 0. 5 was considered "poor"; between 0. 51 and 1. 00 "moderate to excellent. " The intrabiopsy agreement kappa values were: activity = 0. 83, atrophy = 0. 54, intestinal metaplasia = 0. 51 and lymphoid follicles = 0. 19. A mean of 42 serial sections (ranging from a mean of 22 for lymphoid follicles to a mean of 81 for xanthogranulomata) was needed to achieve an excellent (ie, kappa > or = 0. 75) intrabiopsy agreement between the features showed at the opposite sides of a biopsy specimen.

40|$|Objectives: It had {{previously}} been found that the strength of phosphate-bonded investments is temperature sensitive. However, while the effect of heat from the cast metal {{is expected to have}} some effect on continued reactions and melting, there is no published report dealing with this. It was {{the purpose of this study}} to consider further the effects of burnout temperature on strength and the contribution of metal casting temperature and investment composition. Methods: The disc-rupture test (Luk, H. W. -K. and Darvell, B. W., Strength of phosphate-bonded investments at high temperature. Dental Materials 1991, 7, 99 - 102) was employed to determine the effect of burnout temperature (ranging from 400 to 1000 °C) on the 'actual' strength of six phosphate-bonded investments; the cast metal temperature was controlled to be the same as that of the mould. Atomic absorption was employed to investigate aspects of the composition of the investments. Results: The 'actual' strength obtained in this test was always higher than the 'service' strength observed in similar testing with the metal at a fixed temperature (1460 °C). The 'actual' strength was also temperature sensitive, but with a different pattern of variation compared with the 'service' values. All investments tested were found to behave plastically at high temperatures. Calcium, sodium, zinc and iron were found in appreciable quantities in the investments. Conclusion: Heat from the high-temperature casting metal has a material effect in decreasing the strength of phosphate-bonded investments. Such heating increases the plastic behaviour of the investment and this, together with the casting pressure, may result in a distorted mould and thus inaccurate castings, a hitherto <b>unrecognized</b> source of <b>error.</b> 'Actual' strength gives no guide to the 'service' strength, emphasizing the need for tests under service conditions.

40|$|In this work, we {{evaluate}} the current limitations of iterative similarity searches and investigate several strategies {{to improve their}} performance. To {{evaluate the}} reliability of iterative approaches as homology inference tools we create RefProtDom [...] a benchmarking dataset of diverse query domains and full-length proteins containing their homologs {{in a variety of}} architectures to simulate searches of real proteins with complex homology relationships. RefProtDom's homology annotations and boundaries were manually supplemented using local and semi-global searches, reciprocal searches, and structural classifications to ensure accurate alignment evaluation. Using RefProtDom, we identified a previously <b>unrecognized</b> source of <b>error</b> in PSI-BLAST (Position Specific Iterated BLAST) that is responsible for its profile corruption: Homologous Over-extension (HOE). HOE accounts for the largest fraction of the initial false positive errors (hard queries: 86 %; sampled queries: 68 %), and the largest fraction of false positives at iteration 5 (hard: 51 - 91 %, sampled: 49 - 69 %). We implement a (noExt) strategy to reduce the HOE error that increases PSI-BLAST's specificity 4 - 8 fold. We also show that HOE is not a similarity-measurement or statistical error, but rather an alignment strategy error to which all iterative similarity-searching methods are susceptible. The superior scores and gap penalties afforded by the rigorous strategies of PSI-SEARCH noExt and JACKHMMER, respectively, did not provide any improvement over PSI-BLAST noExt. Rigorous strategies indeed provide better sensitivity in pair-wise (e. g. SSEARCH: 6. 2 % hard family coverage; BLAST: 4. 3 %) and better specificity in profile (e. g. PSI-SEARCH: 0. 05 % hard non-homologous errors; PSI-BLAST: 2 %), searches for the unmodified methods. In the absence of a noExt modification, JACKHMMER outperforms PSI-SEARCH, and both outperform PSI-BLAST. But, HOE is such a pervasive phenomenon for all iterative methods, that addressing it is enough to level the methods' performance. Our noExt strategy effectively prevents the propagation of the HOE alignment pathology, but it does not prevent it from happening when a homology is first identified. We conclude by outlining future directions to improve alignment accuracy, which, if addressed, should allow the sensitivity of iterative searches to more closely approach that of structural comparisons...|$|R
