40|$|Abstract—As {{applications}} {{become more}} complex, {{and the level}} of concurrency in systems continue to rise, developers are struggling to scale complex data models on top of a traditional byte stream interface. Middleware tailored for specific data models is a common approach to dealing with these challenges, but middleware commonly reproduces scalable services already present in many distributed file systems. We present DataMods, an abstraction over existing services found in large-scale storage systems that allows middleware to take advantage of existing, highly tuned services. Specifically, DataMods provides an abstraction for extending storage <b>system</b> <b>services</b> in <b>order</b> to implement native, domain-specific data models and interfaces throughout the storage hierarchy.

ISDN is the answer to it which has already been deployed in the United States, Europe and Japan. However, currently the unifying basic technology is circuit switching which cannot utilize bandwidth efficiently [18, 19]. With the increasing demand for high speed communications, Broadband ISDN comes into the picture. In Broadband ISDN, the efficient use of bandwidth is [...] ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn early design stages, firms need to {{generate}} and assess their value propositions. Although both business developers and systems engineers capture customers’ needs {{to design the}} value proposition, they suffer from inefficient business and engineering processes interactions. Moreover, they lack methods to elicit the needs in a structured way and to explore the best value propositions. We propose to extend the affordance-based design for <b>systems</b> and <b>services</b> in <b>order</b> support the elicitation and capture of stakeholders’values; and to identify boundaries of the system design problem to explore the best value propositions. Hence, affordances — which describe what system provides to other systems and stakeholders — help to frame the context. Today, affordance-based design is mainly used for artifact design. We propose to extend this approach to <b>systems</b> and <b>services</b> and complement it {{with a focus on}} stakeholders’ activities and external systems’ stages. With regard to the different system design perimeters defined by affordances, value propositions are designed.

40|$|Classical {{supply chain}} design {{relies on a}} {{hierarchical}} organization to store and distribute products over a given geographical area. Within this framework a shortage in a stock affects the whole downstream of the supply chain regardless of the inventory kept in others locations. Within the Physical Internet approach, inventories are distributed in hubs towards the market and source substitution is allowed. The Physical Internet aims to integrate logistics networks into a <b>universal</b> <b>system</b> of interconnected <b>services</b> {{through the development of}} protocols and standards for the routing of smart containers of various sizes. This organization enables a distributed storage of goods in hubs thanks to containerization, thus the feasibility of multi-sourcing to one ordering point. This contribution measures the impact of such an organization on stock levels and inventory costs with service level set as a constraint. The analysis focuses on the resources levels (transportation and inventory) needed by the current supply model and by the Physical Internet in order to serve a market with a (Q,R) stock policy. Starting with two supply models and with the definition of cost models as well as inventory policy, the work is based on computer simulation. The analysis tested 3 different families of criterion in order to select dynamically the source when an order is requested: Source Substitution, Minimum Ratio and Minimum Sum. The source substitution, one of the simplest, was found the more efficient and stable according to different scenarios...|$|R

In this paper, we present two alternative models of organisation for data mining service providers.

This meant an increased reliance on voluntary enlistment and by 1950 conscripts made up only 29.1% of total French Army effectives. By contrast the Algerian War of 1954-62 involved the extensive use of conscripts, on the rationale that Algeria was legally part of metropolitan France. In 1957 with the Algerian War at its height 57% of the army consisted of conscripts, mostly from metropolitan France. It was still possible to draw on substantial numbers of Algerian Muslim volunteers and conscripts, although issues of divided loyalties made the North African troops less dependable {{towards the end of the}} war. During this period the majority of French military units were made up of a mix of volunteers and conscripts in varying proportions.
