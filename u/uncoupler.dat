This, however, is unstable and readily hydrolyzes to form 3-phosphoglycerate, the intermediate in the next step of the pathway. As a consequence of bypassing this step, the molecule of ATP generated from 1-3 bisphosphoglycerate in the next reaction will not be made, even though the reaction proceeds.

The accumulation was abolished by carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, tetrachlorosalicylanilide, 2, 4 dinitrophenol, and other <b>uncouplers</b> of oxidative phosphorylation even though oxidative phosphorylation {{would not be}} expected to occur anaerobically. In the presence of the <b>uncouplers,</b> the β-galactoside carrier remained functional and catalyzed equilibration of thiomethylgalactoside across the membrane. The <b>uncouplers</b> did not inhibit the generation of adenosine triphosphate or protein turnover, or the accumulation of α-methylglucoside and glycerol by phosphorylation. We conclude that, at least anaerobically, <b>uncouplers</b> of oxidative phosphorylation do not interfere with energy metabolism in general, but prevent the utilization of metabolic energy for the active transport of galactosides. The <b>uncouplers</b> also facilitate passage of protons across the membrane.

40|$|Two {{models of}} the action of <b>uncoupler</b> {{molecules}} in inhibiting photophosphorylation in bacterial chromatophores are considered: either <b>uncoupler</b> molecules shuttle rapidly between energy-coupling sites, or <b>uncoupler</b> molecules that are bound to particular sites in the chromatophores for a time that is comparable with the turnover time of the photophosphorylation apparatus may uncouple by a co-operative "substoichiometric' mechanism. It is found that the titre of <b>uncoupler</b> necessary to cause complete uncoupling is lowered if the rate of photophosphorylation is initially decreased by partially restricting electron flow with an appropriate titre of antimycin A. This result indicates that <b>uncoupler</b> molecules shuttle rapidly between energy coupling in which the energized intermediate between electron transport and phosphorylation is delocalized over the entire chromatophore membrane and those {{in which it is}} not. If the rate of photophosphorylation is partially restricted with the covalent H+-translocating ATP synthase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodi-imide, the titre of <b>uncoupler</b> necessary to effect complete inhibition of photophosphorylation is also decreased relative to that in which the covalent H+-ATP synthase inhibitor is absent.

Methoxyverapamil (D 600) also partially inhibited the [Ca 2 +]i response. In perforated-patch recordings, the rise in [Ca 2 +]i coincided with membrane depolarization and was greatly reduced by voltage clamping the cell to − 70 mV. <b>Uncouplers</b> also inhibited a background K+ current and induced a small inward current. <b>Uncouplers</b> reduced pHi by 0. 1 unit. Alkaline media diminished this acidification but had no effect on the [Ca 2 +]i response. FCCP and DNP also depolarized type I cell mitochondria. The onset of mitochondrial depolarization preceded changes in cell membrane conductance by 3 – 4 s. We conclude that <b>uncouplers</b> excite the carotid body by inhibiting a background K+ conductance and inducing a small inward current, both of which lead to membrane depolarization and voltage-gated Ca 2 + entry.

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} temperature dependence of energy-transducing reactions in spinach (Spinacia oleracea) chloroplasts and their sensitivity for <b>uncouplers</b> and energy-transfer inhibitors at different temperatures is presented. Arrhenius plots reveal two groups of transitions, around 19 °C and around 12 °C. Activities that show transitions around 19 °C include linear electron flow from water to ferricyanide, its coupled photophosphorylation, the dark-release of the fluorescent probe atebrin, and the slow component of the 515 nm (carotenoid) absorbance decay after a flash. The transitions around 12 °C are observed with pyocyanine-mediated cyclic photophosphorylation, light- and dithioerythritol-activated ATP hydrolysis, the dark-release of protons, and the fast 515 nm decay component. It is suggested that both groups of temperature transitions are determined by proton displacements in different domains of the exposed thylakoid membranes. The effects of various <b>uncouplers</b> and an energy-transfer inhibitor are temperature dependent.
