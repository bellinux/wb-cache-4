25|$|Stallard had {{the most}} {{abrasive}} nature that I have ever met. He could never believe {{that he could have}} a bad idea or make a bad decision. And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let <b>us</b> <b>say,</b> the delicacies of negotiation.|$|E

That is, a checker on (1,3) can move to (2,2), (2,3) or (2,4).|$|E

What is her recourse? She says, I am a U.S. citizen. That is a jurisdictional fact under this statute, and she will not have recourse to the courts? She can take it to Donald Rumsfeld, but she cannot take it across the street to an article3 court.|$|E
25|$|Certain skills, {{attributes}} and equipment, when strung together, {{can be used}} to great effect. Let <b>us</b> <b>say</b> a gunslinger from the Old West is facing a foe; he can use the Combat Reflexes ability to react before his enemy, the Fast-Draw(Pistol) skill to get his two guns out, the Gunslinger ability to allow him to skip the aiming step, and the Dual-Weapon Attack(Pistol) skill to fire both his guns at once. This would have taken around 6 turns, if he had none of these skills.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let <b>us</b> <b>say</b> a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It is no wonder that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

He would often visit and stay there {{as it was a}} central meeting place for people who {{supported}} the resurgence of Irish literature and cultural traditions. His poem, [...] "The Wild Swans at Coole" [...] was written there, between 1916 and 1917. He collaborated with Lady Gregory on a book of Irish mythology, writing the preface. [...] "One must not expect in these stories the epic lineaments, the many incidents, woven into one great event of, let <b>us</b> <b>say</b> the War for the Brown Bull of Cuailgne, or that of the last gathering at Muirthemne." ...|$|E
500|$|The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover {{had been}} {{following}} Oppenheimer since before the war, when he showed Communist sympathies as a professor at Berkeley and had been close {{to members of the}} Communist Party, including his wife and brother. He had been under close surveillance since the early 1940s, his home and office bugged, his phone tapped and his mail opened. The FBI furnished Oppenheimer's political enemies with incriminating evidence about his Communist ties. These enemies included Strauss, an AEC commissioner who had long harbored resentment against Oppenheimer both for his activity in opposing the hydrogen bomb and for his humiliation of Strauss before Congress some years earlier; regarding Strauss's opposition to the export of radioactive isotopes to other nations, Oppenheimer had memorably categorized these as [...] "less important than electronic devices but more important than, let <b>us</b> <b>say,</b> vitamins".|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} {{the decade}} critics had taken notice as well. After January 1989, the month that Vulture would 24 years later find to be the movies' worst January ever, New York Times critic Janet Maslin had had enough. Her idea of [...] "movie hell" [...] she said, {{included}} among other indignities having to watch only January releases. [...] "It's well known that January films have a character that is, let <b>us</b> <b>say,</b> distinctive ... What is it that leads film distributors to regard January as just the right resting place for so many flukes, black sheep, wild cards and also-rans?" [...] She allowed that recent years had allowed some good films, such as Radio Days and El Norte, to get attention they might note have in other months of the year. However, that January had had as one its major releases The January Man, a thriller she characterized as aptly titled, despite not even being the worst the month had to offer (that dubious honor went to Deepstar Six).|$|E

500|$|Workman, {{herself an}} ardent feminist and a {{supporter}} of women's suffrage, wanted her readers to understand how her contributions and achievements reflected all women's potential. In her writings, Workman described herself as [...] "questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety". She demonstrated that women were strong enough to thrive outside the home by showing {{how easy it was}} for her to endure strenuous physical activities like bicycling long distances in hot, humid places or mountaineering in cold temperatures and high altitudes. Workman challenged a masculine realm; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced, saying that she [...] "felt that she suffered from 'sex antagonism'". The author of the piece added: [...] "it is possible that some unconscious feeling let <b>us</b> <b>say</b> of the novelty of a woman's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man, may in some quarters have existed... there tended to arise... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness?" [...] However, in her study of Victorian mountaineering, Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations, such as in the Himalaya. Colley states, [...] "Away from such petty opinion emanating from society pressures, up high, above the snow line or in distant regions, women climbers could more fully experience equality and power... If they chose, they could be just as sportsmanlike or competitive as the men." [...] In her entry about Workman in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Tingley sums Workman up as [...] "an aggressive, determined, and uncompromising turn-of-the-century American woman traveler" [...] and [...] "one of the first women to work as a professional mountaineer and surveyor and to write about the expeditions she and her husband took to the most remote reaches of the Himalaya. She was an outspoken advocate of woman's suffrage and made it clear that she considered herself {{to be a role model}} for other women travelers and mountaineers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Leaders of the American Muslim {{community}} have condemned the practice.
