500|$|Construction {{started on}} 1 April 1991. Several points of attack {{were created to}} get the most {{rational}} work-load. The first tunnel was created [...] below the level of the roof of the cavern. First the roof was blasted, then work started downwards. The first eight months were used for excavation, and [...] of rock in 29,000 truckloads were removed. [...] of dynamite were used during blasting. The mass was used to build a new marina, a lake-side promenade and a parking facility. Throughout construction, surveillance was made continually of the rock, and the crown of the roof was measured to have settled , which was as expected. Safety planning was done in cooperation with the National Office of Building Technology and Administration, and included the use of <b>uninflammable</b> materials, creation of sufficient fire exits.|$|E
5000|$|Construction {{started on}} 1 April 1991. Several points of attack {{were created to}} get the most {{rational}} work-load. The first tunnel was created 10 m below the level of the roof of the cavern. First the roof was blasted, then work started downwards. The first eight months were used for excavation, and [...] of rock in 29,000 truckloads were removed. 170 t of dynamite were used during blasting. The mass was used to build a new marina, a lake-side promenade and a parking facility. Throughout construction, surveillance was made continually of the rock, and the crown of the roof was measured to have settled 8 to 10 mm, which was as expected. Safety planning was done in cooperation with the National Office of Building Technology and Administration, and included the use of <b>uninflammable</b> materials, creation of sufficient fire exits.|$|E
40|$|Practical {{utilization}} of ram type {{electrical discharge machining}} in <b>uninflammable</b> fluid has been expected in place of inflammable kerosine type fluid for unmanned operation in a workshop. The electrical discharge machining performance in deionized water is experimentally investigated {{on the basis of}} the analysis of the crater generated by a single pulse discharge. The experimental analysis makes it clear that the electrical discharge machining performance in deionized water is greatly affected by the electrode polarity. The metal removal rate in the normal polarity machining is higher than that in reverse polarity machining, while the electrode wear rate in the normal polarity machining is greater than that in reverse polarity machining. Therefore the electrode polarity should be properly selected according to the purpose of machining...|$|E
