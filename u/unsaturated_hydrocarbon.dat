50|$|In animal cells, {{membrane}} fluidity is modulated by {{the inclusion}} of the sterol cholesterol. This molecule is present in especially large amounts in the plasma membrane, where it constitutes approximately 20% of the lipids in the membrane by weight. Because cholesterol molecules are short and rigid, they fill the spaces between neighboring phospholipid molecules left by the kinks in their <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> tails. In this way, cholesterol tends to stiffen the bilayer, making it more rigid and less permeable.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{laboratory}} experiments have demonstrated that, even though contribution from other reaction channels cannot be neglected, <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> easily break their multiple C-C bonds to form CO after {{their interactions with}} atomic oxygen. Here we present an upgraded chemical modelling including a revision of the reactions between oxygen atoms and small <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> for different astrochemical environments. A first conclusion is that towards hot cores/corinos atomic oxygen easily degrades <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> directly to CO or to its precursor species (such as HCCO or HCO) and destroys the double or triple bond of alkenes and alkynes. Therefore, environments rich in atomic oxygen at a relatively high temperature {{are not expected to}} be rich in large <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. On the contrary, in O-poor and C-rich objects, hydrocarbon growth can occur to a large extent. In addition, new radical species, namely ketyl and vinoxy radicals, generated from other reaction channels can influence the abundances of hydrocarbons towards hot cores. We, therefore, suggest they {{should be included in the}} available databases. Hydrocarbon column densities are calculated in the 10 (13) - 10 (15) cm(- 2) range, in good agreement with their observed values, despite the small number of data currently published in the literature.

40|$|<b>Unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> {{are highly}} {{reactive}} {{species that are}} found in flames and plasma discharges being important intermediates {{in the formation of}} polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and in the processes of chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Some particular <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> have been identified in the interstellar medium where their role is not yet fully understood. Linear carbon chains are one of the simplest rigid nanostructures that can potentially conduct electron current. Most of the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are highly reactive species and for this reason they can only be studied in situ during the short time after their formation. The species are generated in the gas phase through an electrical discharge of a precursor gas and cooled in the supersonic expansion. High-resolution optical absorption spectra are recorded using a tunable dye laser. Because the concentrations of the reactive species studied are generally low, highly sensitive detection technique has to be used. This work presents a study of highly <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> by cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS). High-resolution electronic spectra of ions and radicals allow identifying them in remote environments such as interstellar medium and providing information about the physical conditions of the environment. It is shown how the information about the structure of the unknown absorbing species can be deduced from its rotationally resolved spectrum...|$|R
50|$|It is {{suggested}} that this phase is formed by lipids in solution in order {{to compensate for the}} hydrophobic effect. The tight packing of the lipid head groups reduces their contact with the aqueous phase. This, in turn, reduces the amount of ordered, but unbound water molecules. The most common lipids that form this phase include phospatidylethanolamine (PE), when it has <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> chains. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG, otherwise known as cardiolipin) in the presence of calcium is also capable of forming this phase.|$|E

40|$|The {{exposure}} of saturated hydrocarbons to ultrasound (800 kHz, 6 W/sq cm) {{in the presence}} of water results in: (1) cleavage of the carbon chain, producing saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with a lower number of carbons than the initial hydrocarbon (cracking); and (2) recombination after cleavage, producing saturated and <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> with a higher number of carbons than the initial hydrocarbon (reformation).

Bifurcated hydrogen bonds to <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> have not been observed previously. The <b>unsaturated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> studied include benzene and methylbenzenes, fused-ring aromatics, alkenes, conjugated dienes, and alkynes.
