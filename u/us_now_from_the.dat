60|$|It is {{a curious}} reflection, however, {{that in spite of}} all the later {{improvements}} in the fictile art--in spite of wheels and moulds, pastes and glazes, stamps and pigments, and all the rest of it--the most primitive methods of the first potter are still in use in many countries, side by side with the most finished products of modern European skill and industry. I have in my own possession some West Indian calabashes, cut and decorated under my own eye by a Jamaican negro for his personal use, and bought from him by me for the smallest coin there current--calabashes carved round the edge through the rind with a rude string-course, exactly like the common rope pattern of prehistoric pottery. I have seen the same Jamaican negroes kneading their hand-made porous earthenware beside a tropical stream, moulding it on fruits or shaping it inside with a free sweep of the curved hand, and drying it for use in the hot sun, or baking it in a hastily-formed kiln of plastered mud into large coarse jars of prehistoric types, locally known by the quaint West African name of 'yabbas.' Many of these yabbas, if buried in the ground and exposed to damp and frost, till they almost lost the effects of the baking, would be quite indistinguishable, even by the skilled archæologist, from the actual handicraft of the palæolithic potter. The West Indian negroes brought these simple arts with them from their African home, where they have been handed down in unbroken continuity from the very earliest age of fictile industry. New and better methods have slowly grown up everywhere around them, but these simplest, earliest, and easiest plans have survived none the less for the most ordinary domestic uses, and will survive for ages yet, as long as there remain any out-of-the-way places, remote from the main streams of civilised commerce. Thus, while hundreds of thousands of years, in all probability, separate <b>us</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ancient days of the first potter, it is yet possible for us to see the first potter's own methods and principles exemplified under our very eyes by people who derive them in unbroken succession from the direct teaching of that long-forgotten prehistoric savage.|$|E
40|$|If you’re a pet lover, {{you might}} want to take a timemachine back to Ancient Egypt where you couldarrange to keep your pet with you – forever! Al-though mummies are synonymous with ancient Egypt, few people realize that the ancient Egyptians also mum-mified animals, {{including}} their pets. Pet mummies are the kind of mummy that reso-nates most closely with <b>us</b> <b>now.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> Old Kingdom (c. 2663 - 2195 BC) onward, Egyptians are pictured in their tombs with their beloved pets, thus ensuring their continued joint existence in the Afterlife. Occasionally the pets would even have their names carved above their image, providing further insurance for their eternal life. This was particularly true of hunting dogs that were im-mortalized with their names such as “Swifter than the Gazelle ” or “Slayer of Oryx”. Devoted pet-lovers buried their animals with them. If the animal died during its owner’s lifetime, it was mummified and kept safely until the owner’s death, perhaps even in the tomb that was begun quite early in a person’s life. If the animal died after its owner’s demise, it could be mummified and placed in the tomb with its master, or in the courtyard just outside, {{as was the case with}} a pet monkey excavated outside a tomb in Thebes or a horse associated with the family of Senenmut, the architect of the magnificent funerary temple of Queen Hatshepsut built at Deir el-Bahari. Some pets, like hu-mans, enjoyed splendid burials, complete with elaborate coffins and food offerings. Pets were only one of several kinds of animal mummies, which actually far outnumber human mum-mies. Mummification was carried out in order to pre-serve the body for eternity so that the soul (ka and ba) could inhabit it in the Afterlife. A large range of animal species were mummified, including cattle, baboons, rams...|$|E

40|$|Certain areas {{related to}} the topics under {{discussion}} here lie outside my field; for instance the evaluation of risk assessment and security deficiencies in the transport sector. What has convinced me {{of the importance of}} this subject are a few very general conclusions, indeed I would say, impressions, that I have drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> truly remarkable development of our powers to analyse the risk decision-making process over some years now. In this paper, the term “uncertainty” is often used with reference to the management of risks arising from intentionally malicious acts 3. The costs of security in this sense of the term are an element of every transport budget today. In addition to the costs of prevention, surveillance and forecasting, the costs of the potential damages arising from such acts will also have to be taken into consideration from this point onwards. The events of 11 September 2001, which accelerated this trend, should suffice to convince <b>us</b> that, <b>from</b> <b>now</b> on, <b>the</b> consequences of such damages will be on a scale comparable to the costs of war ( [...] .) ...|$|R
60|$|Let <b>us</b> pass <b>now</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> infant in {{arms to the}} {{children}} in the nursery. What have the experiences of each been doing in aid of the emotional development we are considering? While its limbs have been growing more agile by exercise, its manipulative skill increasing by practice, its perceptions of objects growing by use quicker, more accurate, more comprehensive; the associations between these two sets of impressions received from those around, and the pleasures and pains received along with them, or after them, have been by frequent repetition made stronger, and their adjustments better. The dim sense of pain and the vague glow of delight which the infant felt, have, in the urchin, severally taken shapes that are more definite. The angry voice of a nursemaid no longer arouses only a formless feeling of dread, but also a specific idea of the slap that may follow. The frown on the face of a bigger brother, along with the primitive, indefinable sense of ill, brings the ideas of ills that are definable as kicks, and cuffs, and pullings of hair, and losses of toys. The faces of parents, looking now sunny, now gloomy, have grown to be respectively associated with multitudinous forms of gratification and multitudinous forms of discomfort or privation. Hence these appearances and sounds, which imply amity or enmity in those around, become symbolic of happiness and misery; so that eventually, perception of the one set or the other can scarcely occur without raising a wave of pleasurable feeling or of painful feeling. The body of this wave is still substantially of the same nature as it was at first; for though in each of these multitudinous experiences a special set of facial and vocal signs has been connected with a special set of pleasures or pains; yet since these pleasures or pains have been immensely varied in their kinds and combinations, and since the signs that preceded them were in no two cases quite alike, it results that even to the end the consciousness produced remains as vague as it is voluminous. The thousands of partially-aroused ideas resulting from past experiences are massed together and superposed, so as to form an aggregate in which nothing is distinct, but which has the character of being pleasurable or painful according to the nature of its original components: the chief difference between this developed feeling and the feeling aroused in the infant being, that on bright or dark background forming the body of it, may now be sketched out in thought the particular pleasures or pains which the particular circumstances suggest as likely.|$|R
40|$|Any {{reader of}} the paper by Laloux et al. [1] would have been left utterly {{confused}} after consulting the time series {{for the price of}} Japanese Government Bonds (JGB) around May 1995 looking for a log-periodic power law acceleration in the data. The authors of [1] now confess their error and admit that the prediction date given in [1] was incorrect and that the correct prediction was for August 1995. However, they now report [2] that the analysis leading to the prediction was made in May 1995. Obviously, this is also incorrect since the data used in the analysis, see fig. 1 of [3], does not start before June 1995. That the authors of the reply (LMAB) have severe problems regarding dating certain events becomes even clearer reading the second section of the reply. Reference [3] of the reply (corresponding to reference [5]) is essentially a 19 page answer to the criticism put forward in [4]. Nevertheless, LMAB writes that I and Didier Sornette (JS) ignores the work of J. A. Feigenbaum! Let <b>us</b> <b>now</b> turn away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> prediction experiment in question as well as the issue of whom cites whom and address the physical issues raised by LMAB. That crashes occurs for a number of different reasons and unfolds in various ways is quite obvious. For example, the bond crash of October 1998 mentioned by LMAB is generally explained {{as a result of the}} heavy investments made by German Banks in Russia. When the Rubel crashed, so did the Bundes bond. Other crashes triggered by external events are the ones on Wall Street in 1973 (OPEC oil embargo) and 1974 (Nixon’s resignation). However, no consensus regarding the origin of the world-wide crash of 1987 exists. Thi...|$|R
