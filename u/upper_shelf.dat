This enables a focus in the process on creating a finished product at the lowest cost (instead of lowering the cost of each step.) A common approach to achieving {{this is known as}} the workcell. Machines involved in building a product are placed next to each other to minimize transportation of both parts and people (an L-shaped desk with <b>upper</b> <b>shelves</b> is a good office example, which enables many office equipment to be within the reach of a worker).

40|$|The {{diversity}} of deep-water corals in the Caribbean Sea was studied using records from oceanographic expeditions {{performed by the}} R/V Pillsbury. Sampled stations were sorted according to broad depth ranges and ecoregions and were analyzed in terms of species accumulation curves, variance in the species composition and contributions to alpha, beta and gamma diversity. According {{to the analysis of}} species accumulation curves using the Chao 2 estimator, more diversity occurs on the continental slope (200 – 2000 m depth) than on the <b>upper</b> continental <b>shelf</b> (60 – 200 m depth). In addition to the effect of depth sampling, differences in species composition related to depth ranges were detected. However, the differences between ecoregions are dependent on depth ranges, there were fewer differences among ecoregions on the continental slope than on the <b>upper</b> continental <b>shelf.</b> Indicator species for distinctness of ecoregions were, in general, Alcyonaria and Antipatharia for the <b>upper</b> continental <b>shelf,</b> but also the scleractinians Madracis myriabilis and Cladocora debilis. In the continental slope, the alcyonarian Placogorgia and the scleractinians Stephanocyathus and Fungiacyathus were important for the distinction of ecoregions. Beta diversity was the most important component of gamma diversity in the Caribbean Basin. The contribution of ecoregions to alpha, beta and gamma diversity differed with depth range. On the <b>upper</b> continental <b>shelf,</b> the Southern Caribbean ecoregion contributed substantially to all components of diversity. In contrast, the northern ecoregions contributed substantially to the {{diversity of}} the Continental Slope. Strategies for th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The Paleocene {{section of}} the Eastern Sirt Basin {{consists}} of a carbonate succession which developed in response to subsidence and widespread marine transgression following Cenomanian rifting. Within the study area the principal hydrocarbon reservoir is the Upper Sabil Formation, which is sealed by Harash Formation lime mudstones. Facies ana-lysis and seismic mapping indicate that the Upper Sabil Formation consists of a prograding carbonate shelf with a rimmed platform morphology and palaeo-slopes in excess of 5 c ~ along the eastern and western flanks of the Agedabia Trough. To the south, {{the absence of a}} lagoo-nal facies and seismically defined shelf edge indicate a ramp morphology with a palaeo-slope of less than 0. 5 ~ The overlying Harash Formation ischaracterized by its cyclic nature, rela-tively high terrigenous mud content and a thickness distribution which shows it tobe infilling the pre-existing <b>Upper</b> Sabil <b>shelf</b> topography. The morphology of the <b>Upper</b> Sabil <b>shelf</b> coupled with sea-level fluctuations controlled the distribution of the depositional environ-ments within the Harash Formation. A depositional model for the Harash Formation ispro-posed which subdivides the formation into five carbonate parasequences (named cycles A-E from base to top). In an exploration context the study facilitated the identification of the dis...|$|R
60|$|It was half-past {{nine in the}} evening, and {{the wedding}} over--Mr. and Mrs. Hawkesworth gone, and the guests departed, the drawing-room had {{returned}} to its usual state. It was a very large room, so spacious {{that it would have}} been waste and desolate, had it not been well filled with handsome, but heavy old-fashioned furniture, covered with crimson damask, and one side of the room fitted up with a bookcase, so high that there was a spiral flight of library steps to give access to the <b>upper</b> <b>shelves.</b> Opposite were four large windows, now hidden by their ample curtains; and near them was at one end of the room a piano, at the other a drawing-desk. The walls were wainscoted with polished black oak, the panels reflecting the red fire-light like mirrors. Over the chimney-piece hung a portrait, by Vandyke, of a pale, dark cavalier, of noble mien, and with arched eyebrows, called by Lilias, in defiance of dates, by the name of Sir Maurice de Mohun, the hero of the family, and allowed by every one to be a striking likeness of Claude, the youth who at that moment lay, extending a somewhat superfluous length of limb upon the sofa, which was placed commodiously at right angles to the fire.|$|R
