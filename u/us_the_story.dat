Because of the heightened sexual writing in the novel, it was banned in a number of countries.

25|$|I do {{not think}} that this is {{impossible}} or even difficult. There are genius women just as there are genius men. Ingenuity is not a monopoly for men. It is not in vain that the Holy Quran tells <b>us</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of a woman who led men wisely and bravely and made her people fare the best end: it is the Queen of Sheba, whose story with Solomon is told in Surat Al Naml. I have observed in the University of Qatar that girls make better students than boys.|$|E
25|$|One major {{question}} {{in the history of}} Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to <b>us.</b> <b>The</b> <b>story</b> of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by Strabo in his Geography and Plutarch in his Parallel Lives. The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to Neleus of Scepsis. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when Apellicon of Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When Lucius Cornelius Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus and then by the philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes.|$|E

40|$|Chapter 6 tackles one of {{the most}} obvious blind spots in corpus {{approaches}} to discourse studies: the fact that communication is multimodal. Language-only corpora will tell <b>us</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> but they will not tell <b>us</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>story,</b> as confirmed by van Leeuwen (2011 : 668) in stating that ‘many forms of contemporary written language cannot be adequately understood unless we look, not just at language, but also at images, layout, typography and colour’. The chapter presents a case study of Instagram posts made in relation to the Australian federal election in July 2016. It uses corpus-assisted multimodal discourse analysis (CAMDA) to explore the contributions of both corpus methods and multimodal discourse analysis to our understanding of how ordinary Australians responded to the election. The research question posed is a simple one: Can CAMDA tell <b>us</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>story...</b>|$|R
