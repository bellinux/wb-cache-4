Square Enix launched the official Japanese website in May 2005, followed by the English website in December 2005. The websites featured videos and information regarding characters and worlds. Commercials were aired in Japan which highlighted the numerous Disney characters in the game. Although the game was announced in September 2003, a release date for the game was not set <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later.

5|$|In 1702 Bruce was {{commissioned}} by the burgesses of Stirling to design a new tolbooth for the town. Bruce provided only sketch plans, which were executed by local masons between 1703 and 1705. Bruce's last country houses were Harden House (now known as Mertoun House), built for the Scotts in the Borders, and his smallest house, Auchendinny in Midlothian. His final work, in around 1710, was for Nairne House, for the Jacobite Lord Nairne. The house was not completed <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after Bruce's death, {{and the extent of}} his involvement is unclear. Nairne House was demolished in 1760, although the cupola was retained and installed {{on the roof of the}} King James VI Hospital in nearby Perth.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, in October 2014, Lois Leveen speculated in The Atlantic {{that the}} {{original}} Shakespeare play did not contain a balcony. The word, balcone, {{did not exist in}} the English language <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after Shakespeare's death. The balcony was certainly used in Thomas Otway's 1679 play, The History and Fall of Caius Marius, which had borrowed much of its story from Romeo and Juliet and placed the two lovers in a balcony reciting a speech similar to that between Romeo and Juliet. Leveen suggested that during the 18th century, David Garrick chose to use a balcony in his adaptation and revival of Romeo and Juliet and modern adaptations have continued this tradition.|$|E

5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} {{in humans}} {{is a process}} in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments {{play an important role}} in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Because of the tour's cancellation, various {{media outlets}} {{circulated}} speculation that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned her {{plans for a}} tour as a result. Many reports were made claiming that Carey had been visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Carey did not address those rumours <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later on October 28, 2010, which was the same day she announced her new pregnancy; she admitted that she had indeed been pregnant during that time period in late 2008, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later. Carey later opted to record a new album, that would be released {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album.|$|E
5|$|Cariappa was {{appointed}} as the deputy assistant quarter master general (DAQMG) at HQ Peshawar District in 1931. The experience he had gained at headquarters, his coaching at Royal United Services Institute in 1932, and the courses he attended at Small Arms School (SAS) and the Royal School of Artillery (RSA) {{helped him to}} get through the Quetta Staff College's entrance examination. He was the first Indian military officer to attend the course. Though officers were generally given staff appointments after completion of the course, Cariappa was not given his staff appointment <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later. Until then, he rendered regimental service with his parent unit on the North-West Frontier. In March 1936, he {{was appointed}} as staff captain of the Deccan Area. In 1938, Cariappa was promoted to major and was appointed the deputy assistant adjutant and quarter master general (DAA&QMG).|$|E

5|$|Francis Hillier Taylor, {{previously}} senior history {{master at}} The Skinners' School, was appointed as Morgan's successor {{at the end}} of the spring term in 1946, a position that attracted 321 applications. During his tenure, Taylor significantly expanded the school facilities: in 1948, the headmaster's living quarters were converted to include a secretaries office, waiting room and medical inspection room (the headmaster moved to neighbouring Brook House, which was purchased by The Skinners' Company). In 1955, new geography rooms were constructed, followed three years later by a new gymnasium. Although not first used <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later, a swimming pool was constructed in 1964 at the cost of Â£9,000. Taylor also introduced some major curriculum changes, including the introduction of new subjects such as rural biology and zoology.|$|E
5|$|The Stella power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood {{on either side of}} a bend of the River Tyne: Stella South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and Stella North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby Stella Hall, a manor house close to Stella South that by the time of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British electrical supply industry <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after the Electricity Act of 1989, when the industry passed into the private sector.|$|E
5|$|As the {{university}} grew, McMaster Hall started to become overcrowded. The suggestion to move {{the university}} to Hamilton was first brought up by a student and Hamilton native in 1909, although the proposal was not seriously considered by the university <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later. By the 1920s, after previous proposals between various university staff, the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce launched a campaign to bring McMaster University to Hamilton. As the issue of space at McMaster Hall became more acute, the university administration debated {{the future of the}} university. The university nearly became federated with the University of Toronto, as had been the case with Trinity College and Victoria College. Instead, in 1927, the university administration decided to transfer the university to Hamilton. The Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec secured $1.5 million, while the citizens of Hamilton raised an additional $500,000 to help finance the move. The lands for the university and new buildings were secured through gifts from graduates. Lands were transferred from Royal Botanical Gardens to establish the campus area. The first academic session on the new Hamilton campus began in 1930. McMaster's property in Toronto was sold to the University of Toronto when McMaster moved to Hamilton in 1930. McMaster Hall is now home to the Royal Conservatory of Music.|$|E

5|$|Eastbourne Pier {{was built}} between 1866 and 1872 at the {{junction}} of Grand and Marine Parades. The pier interrupts what {{would otherwise have been}} a ribbon development of buildings â to the west, high-class hotels, with modest family hotels and boarding houses to the east. The Eastbourne Pier Company was registered in April 1865 with a capital of Â£15,000 and on 18 April 1866 work began. It was opened by Lord Edward Cavendish on 13 June 1870, although it was not actually completed <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later. On New Year's Day 1877 the landward half was swept away in a storm. It was rebuilt at a higher level, creating a drop {{towards the end of the}} pier. The pier is effectively built on stilts that rest in cups on the sea-bed allowing the whole structure to move during rough weather. It is roughly 300metres (1000ft) long. A domed 400-seater pavilion was constructed at a cost of Â£250 at the seaward end in 1888. A 1,000-seater theatre, bar, camera obscura and office suite replaced this in 1899/1901. At the same time, two saloons were built midway along the pier. Access to the camera obscura was destroyed by an arson attack in 1970, but was restored in 2003 with a new stairway built.|$|E
5|$|The next {{transport}} of sheep to North America {{was not until}} 1607, with the voyage of the Susan Constant to Virginia. However, the sheep that arrived in that year were all slaughtered because of a famine, and a permanent flock was not to reach the colony <b>until</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later in 1609. In two decades' time, the colonists had expanded their flock {{to a total of}} 400 head. By the 1640s there were about 100,000 head of sheep in the 13 colonies, and in 1662, a woolen mill was built in Watertown, Massachusetts. Especially during the periods of political unrest and civil war in Britain spanning the 1640s and 1650s which disrupted maritime trade, the colonists found it pressing to produce wool for clothing. Many islands off the coast were cleared of predators and set aside for sheep: Nantucket, Long Island, Martha's Vineyard and small islands in Boston Harbor were notable examples. There remain some rare breeds of American sheepâsuch as the Hog Island sheepâthat were the result of island flocks. Placing semi-feral sheep and goats on islands was common practice in colonization during this period. Early on, the British government banned further export of sheep to the Americas, or wool from it, in an attempt to stifle any threat to the wool trade in the British Isles. One of many restrictive trade measures that precipitated the American Revolution, the sheep industry in the Northeast grew despite the bans.|$|E
