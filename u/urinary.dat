5|$|Brachytherapy {{treatment}} for cervical or prostate cancer can cause acute and transient <b>urinary</b> {{symptoms such as}} <b>urinary</b> retention, <b>urinary</b> incontinence or painful urination (dysuria).|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal and <b>urinary</b> pH affect {{absorption}} and elimination. Gastrointestinal alkalizing (acidifying) agents increase (decrease) absorption. <b>Urinary</b> alkalizing (acidifying) agents increase {{concentration of}} non-ionized (ionized) species, decreasing (increasing) <b>urinary</b> excretion.|$|E
5|$|A <b>urinary</b> tract {{infection}} (UTI) is {{an infection}} that affects {{part of the}} <b>urinary</b> tract. When it affects the lower <b>urinary</b> tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper <b>urinary</b> tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower <b>urinary</b> tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|About 150 {{million people}} {{developed}} a <b>urinary</b> tract infection each year. They {{are more common}} in women than men. In women, {{they are the most}} common form of bacterial infection. Up to 10% of women have a <b>urinary</b> tract infection in a given year and half of women having at least one infection at some point in their lives. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35years. Recurrences are common. <b>Urinary</b> tract infections have been described since ancient times with the first documented description in the Ebers Papyrus dated to c. 1550 BC.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired <b>urinary</b> tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or fungal infections. Healthcare-associated <b>urinary</b> tract infections (mostly related to <b>urinary</b> catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. <b>Urinary</b> tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than <b>urinary</b> tract infection.|$|E
5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual {{activity}} that is not dangerous but that can be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to <b>urinary</b> or fecal incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling <b>urinary</b> catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol {{acts as a}} {{magnesium}} diuretic, {{causes a}} prompt, vigorous increase in the <b>urinary</b> excretion of magnesium and other electrolytes.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{prostatitis}} in {{the forms}} of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and chronic bacterial prostatitis (not acute bacterial prostatitis or asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis) may cause recurrent <b>urinary</b> tract infections in males. Risk of infections increases as males age. While bacteria is commonly present in the urine of older males this {{does not appear to}} affect the risk of <b>urinary</b> tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Male scuba divers {{utilizing}} condom catheters {{and female}} divers utilizing external catching devices for their dry suits are also susceptible to <b>urinary</b> tract infections.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} <b>urinary</b> catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that women take 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before <b>urinary</b> tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Urinary</b> {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for <b>urinary</b> tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Urinary</b> tract infections {{may affect}} 10% of people during childhood. Among {{children}} <b>urinary</b> tract infections {{are the most}} common in uncircumcised males less than three months of age, followed by females less than one year. Estimates of frequency among children however vary widely. In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and two years, two to 20% were diagnosed with a UTI.|$|E
5|$|Using <b>urinary</b> {{catheters}} {{as little}} and as short {{of time as}} possible and appropriate care of the catheter when used prevents infections.|$|E
5|$|Women and {{men have}} {{different}} {{experiences of the}} same illnesses, especially cardiovascular disease, cancer, depression and dementia, and {{are more prone to}} <b>urinary</b> tract infections than men.|$|E
5|$|Women {{are more}} prone to UTIs than men because, in females, the urethra is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's {{estrogen}} levels decrease with menopause, her risk of <b>urinary</b> tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora. Additionally, vaginal atrophy that can sometimes occur after menopause is associated with recurrent <b>urinary</b> tract infections.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of underwear used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent <b>urinary</b> tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease <b>urinary</b> tract infections in this group.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urinary</b> stone {{formation}} (related to alkaline urine, hypercalciuria, and low <b>urinary</b> citrate).|$|E
25|$|<b>Urinary</b> incontinence. An {{accepted}} use for amitriptyline in Australia is {{the treatment}} of <b>urinary</b> urge incontinence.|$|E
25|$|Congenital {{anomalies}} of {{the kidney}} and <b>urinary</b> tract (CAKUT) include renal parenchyma, kidneys, and <b>urinary</b> collecting system.|$|E
25|$|Intermittent <b>urinary</b> {{catheterization}} is used {{to relieve}} the bladder in people with <b>urinary</b> retention. Self-catheterization is an option in BPH when the bladder is difficult or impossible to completely empty. <b>Urinary</b> tract infection {{is the most common}} complication of intermittent catheterization. Several techniques and types of catheter are available, including sterile (single-use) and clean (multiple use) catheters, but none is superior to others in reducing the incidence of <b>urinary</b> tract infection based on current information.|$|E
25|$|If {{the cause}} is {{obstruction}} of the <b>urinary</b> tract, relief of the obstruction (with a nephrostomy or <b>urinary</b> catheter) may be necessary.|$|E
25|$|Ravnskov also {{conducted}} work on <b>urinary</b> tract infections; {{in one study}} of <b>urinary</b> tract infections in women {{he found that the}} major cause of dysuria was soap, not bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Feline lower <b>urinary</b> tract {{disease is}} a term {{that is used to}} cover many {{problems}} of the feline <b>urinary</b> tract, including stones and cystitis. The term feline urologic syndrome is an older term which is still sometimes used for this condition. It is a common disease in adult cats, though it can strike in young cats too. It may present as any of a variety of <b>urinary</b> tract problems, and can lead to a complete blockage of the <b>urinary</b> system, which if left untreated is fatal.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the <b>urinary</b> system {{as a part of}} the prenatal development, concerns the <b>urinary</b> system and sex organs. The latter is a part of the stages of sexual differentiation.|$|E
25|$|DL-Methionine is {{sometimes}} given {{as a supplement}} to dogs; It helps to reduce the chances of stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the <b>urinary</b> excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat <b>urinary</b> tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and <b>urinary</b> acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used.|$|E
25|$|Complications of {{analgesic}} nephropathy include pyelonephritis and end-stage kidney disease. Risk factors for poor prognosis include recurrent <b>urinary</b> tract infection and persistently elevated blood pressure. Analgesic nephropathy {{also appears to}} {{increase the risk of}} developing cancers of the <b>urinary</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Duloxetine {{failed to}} receive US {{approval}} for stress <b>urinary</b> incontinence amid concerns over liver toxicity and suicidal events; however, it was approved for this {{use in the}} UK, where it is recommended as an add-on medication in stress <b>urinary</b> incontinence instead of surgery.|$|E
25|$|An {{average of}} 55.5% {{of people with}} {{cerebral}} palsy experience lower <b>urinary</b> tract symptoms, more commonly excessive storage issues than voiding issues. Those with voiding issues and pelvic floor overactivity can deteriorate as adults and experience upper <b>urinary</b> tract dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Minocycline is a {{relatively}} poor tetracycline-class antibiotic choice for <b>urinary</b> pathogens sensitive to this antibiotic class, as its solubility in water and levels in the urine are less than all other tetracyclines. Minocycline is metabolized by the liver and has poor <b>urinary</b> excretion.|$|E
25|$|<b>Urinary</b> {{incontinence}} {{is often}} found in old age.|$|E
25|$|Intravesical {{infusion}} is {{into the}} <b>urinary</b> bladder.|$|E

25|$|<b>Urinary</b> {{incontinence}} and vaginal prolapse {{are well}} known adverse effects that develop with high frequency {{a very long time}} after the surgery. Typically, those complications develop 10–20 years after the surgery. For this reason exact numbers are not known, and risk factors are poorly understood. It is also unknown if the choice of surgical technique has any effect. It has been assessed that the risk for <b>urinary</b> incontinence is approximately doubled within 20 years after hysterectomy. One long-term study found a 2.4 fold increased risk for surgery to correct <b>urinary</b> stress incontinence following hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Urination is {{the release}} of urine from the <b>urinary</b> bladder through the urethra {{to the outside of}} the body. It is the <b>urinary</b> system's form of excretion. It is also known {{medically}} as micturition, voiding, uresis, or, rarely, emiction, and known colloquially by various names including peeing, weeing, and pissing.|$|E
25|$|Uro-genital, as {{frequent}} urination, <b>urinary</b> urgency, dyspareunia, or impotence.|$|E
25|$|Postrenal AKI {{refers to}} acute kidney injury caused by disease states {{downstream}} of the kidney and most often occurs {{as a consequence}} of <b>urinary</b> tract obstruction. This may be related to benign prostatic hyperplasia, kidney stones, obstructed <b>urinary</b> catheter, bladder stones, or cancer of the bladder, ureters, or prostate.|$|E
