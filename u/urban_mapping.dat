40|$|Potential of {{combining}} SAR and optical remotely sensed data for rapid <b>urban</b> <b>mapping</b> is highlight. Two groups of optical and SAR remotely sensed data are selected {{to evaluate the}} strategy. Outputs are verified and analyzed from 3 aspects. The single class and merged map accuracy are evaluated; the proposed method is compared with 2 mature algorithms; the selected classifiers are applied to 7 different fusion algorithms to make further comprehension. The outcomes illustrate the potential of synergic optical and SAR data for monitoring urbanization status and demonstrate that the proposed SAR/optical information synergy method improved the capabilities of <b>urban</b> <b>mapping</b> compared with separately using SAR and optical data. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can map built-up area, water body, and vegetation at accuracy of 99. 31 %, 91. 92 %, and 91. 72 %, respectively. These results are much better than when solo optical or SAR data was selected and better than classification results based on mature fusion methods. The main contributions of this article are as follows: the proposal of a rapid <b>urban</b> <b>mapping</b> strategy based on integration of optical and SAR data and the verifying and analysis of potential of synergic optical and SAR data for rapid <b>urban</b> <b>mapping...</b>|$|E

We developed <b>urban</b> extent <b>map</b> with ASTER/VNIR images, MOD 12 Q 1 and GRUMP by proposed method at 101 sites of the world. As the result, spatial resolution is improved to 15 m, and user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of developed map is 69 % and 48 %, better than those of MOD 12 Q 1 and GRUMP.

40|$|This paper {{engages with}} the {{ontology}} and epistemology of <b>urban</b> <b>mapping.</b> While GIS and other digital technologies have long transformed the capacities for representation of urban data here we explore {{the capacity of}} mapping to produce new ways of seeing, understanding, planning and designing the city. With a primary focus on urban morphology, distinctions and overlaps between mapping, diagramming, planning and designing are articulated within a framework of assemblage thinking. Through cases drawn from urban design research we analyse the mapping of political conflict, transport flows, functional mix and informal settlement. It is argued that <b>urban</b> <b>mapping</b> {{is a form of}} spatial knowledge production that is often diagrammatic, embodying a spatial logic that cannot be reduced to words and numbers. <b>Urban</b> <b>mapping</b> constructs interconnections between the ways the city is perceived, conceived and lived; and it can reveal capacities for urban transformation - the city as a space of possibility...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis article {{deals with}} the {{contribution}} of both the future SPOT- 5 (which will produce images with the same bands as the existing SPOT 1 - 3 ones but with an improved spatial resolution) and a sensor fusion method to <b>urban</b> <b>mapping.</b> The ARSIS concept (in French: Amelioration de la Resolution Spatiale par Injection de Structures) is used for sensor fusion. It allows the improvement of spatial resolution of the multi-band images, while preserving spectral information, by use of the high frequencies of panchromatic images. A well-proven method for <b>urban</b> <b>mapping</b> is then applied to all multi-spectral images available {{in the context of}} the study. A photo-interpretation of the latter confirms the benefit of fine image resolutions to urban roads mapping, in the limit of the sensor studied here. Then, when comparing the roads surface at all resolutions with reference extracted from accurate maps of the city, we demonstrate quantitatively that the finer the resolution, the more accurate the cartography...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to control texture {{resolution}} for rendering large-scale 3 D <b>urban</b> <b>maps.</b> Since on the 3 D maps texture data generally tend to be far larger than geometry information such as vertices and triangles, it is more effective to reduce the texture by exploiting the LOD (Level of Detail) in order to decrease whole data size. For this purpose, we propose a new method to control {{the resolution of the}} texture. In our method we classify the textures to four classes based on their salient features. The appropriate texture resolutions are decided based on the classification resulsts, their rendered sizes on a display, and their level of importance. We verify the validity of our texture classification algorithm by applying it to the large-scale 3 D <b>urban</b> <b>map</b> rendering.|$|R

We implemented the algorithm and demonstrated it against 340 scenes of ASTER satellite images. LLGC trimmed up 500 -m-resolution clusters of urban area into 15 -m-resoluton clusters. However accuracy assessment on LLGC result showed 75 % user’s accuracy, 41 % producer’s accuracy, 94 % overall accuracy and 0. 50 kappa coefficient, indicating LLGC had considerable misclassifications due to similarity in surface reflectance among non-vegetative land cover.

40|$|In {{the era of}} {{autonomous}} driving, <b>urban</b> <b>mapping</b> represents a core step to let vehicles interact with the urban context. Successful mapping algorithms have been proposed {{in the last decade}} building the map leveraging on data from a single sensor. The focus of the system presented in this paper is twofold: the joint estimation of a 3 D map from lidar data and images, based on a 3 D mesh, and its texturing. Indeed, even if most surveying vehicles for mapping are endowed by cameras and lidar, existing mapping algorithms usually rely on either images or lidar data; moreover both image-based and lidar-based systems often represent the map as a point cloud, while a continuous textured mesh representation would be useful for visualization and navigation purposes. In the proposed framework, we join the accuracy of the 3 D lidar data, and the dense information and appearance carried by the images, in estimating a visibility consistent map upon the lidar measurements, and refining it photometrically through the acquired images. We evaluate the proposed framework against the KITTI dataset and we show the performance improvement with respect to two state of the art <b>urban</b> <b>mapping</b> algorithms, and two widely used surface reconstruction algorithms in Computer Graphics.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to show that the visualization of an urban landscape by 3 D computer graphics can be used as indicators of human habitats on a worldwide basis when we think of a sustainable world in future. In the 1900 s, in Japan, 2 D digital <b>urban</b> <b>maps</b> became popular as commercial products such as automobile navigation map with GPS. They adopted the traditional map making technique consisting of map symbols and polylines. On the other hand, 3 D CG <b>urban</b> <b>map</b> making has not yet established agreed principle or guidlines how to create. The simplest methods is to create a virtual house and a building as they are, using 3 D CG architectural CAD system. This method demands enourmous amount of labor so that we can not create an <b>urban</b> <b>map</b> with thousands of houses and buildings. The second method is to express houses and buildings as boxes vertically projected on the closed polygon representing their building site. This method can show a geographical distribution of building sizes only. The database volume of this second method becomes ca. ten times larger than the counterpart 2 D digital map of the same area. The auther proposes the third method. The actual buildings and houses have different each other but there are something in common such as roof shapes.

40|$|For {{establishing}} {{sealed area}} mapping in urban areas, {{the role of}} NDVI is crucial but not completely understood. Normally a linear relationship is assumed. The limits of this linear model are tested and the restrictions analysed. For the various tests a hierarchical approach is chosen.

The degree of sealed surfaces as well as the analysis on urban sprawl is a necessity for understanding and anticipating urban change.
