5|$|The <b>Uruguay</b> <b>Round</b> of GATT {{multilateral}} {{trade negotiations}} took place from 1986 to 1994, with 123 nations becoming party to agreements achieved throughout the negotiations. Among the achievements were trade liberalization in agricultural goods and textiles, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and agreements on intellectual property rights issues. The key manifestation of this round was the Marrakech Agreement signed in April 1994, which established the World Trade Organization (WTO). The WTO is a chartered multilateral trade organization, charged with continuing the GATT mandate to promote trade, govern trade relations, and prevent damaging trade practices or policies. It became operational in January 1995. Compared with its GATT secretariat predecessor, the WTO features an improved mechanism for settling trade disputes since the organization is membership-based and not dependent on consensus as in traditional trade negotiations. This function was designed to address prior weaknesses, whereby parties in dispute would invoke delays, obstruct negotiations, or fall back on weak enforcement. In 1997, WTO members reached an agreement which committed to softer restrictions on commercial financial services, including banking services, securities trading, and insurance services. These commitments entered into force in March 1999, consisting of 70 governments accounting for approximately 95% of worldwide financial services.|$|E

40|$|How has {{the degree}} of {{institutional}} integration in Europe affected the bargaining strength of the European Community (EC) in international negotiations? In other words, does unity bring strength? This paper explores how internal divisions in the EC have impacted the process and outcomes of the Kennedy and <b>Uruguay</b> <b>Rounds</b> of GATT negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization between the European Community and the United States. Contrary to {{the conventional wisdom that}} degree of integration and external bargaining strength are positively correlated, this paper determines the conditions under which regional integration can be used as an asset or a liability in international negotiations. It argues that the EC external bargaining strength depends on the voting rules and practices at the EC level, the amount of flexibility granted to EC negotiators, and the nature of demands in external negotiations. Comparison of the US-EC negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization in the Kennedy and <b>Uruguay</b> <b>Rounds</b> suggests, indeed, that the intensification of integration in Europe has not been accompanied by a similar intensification of the EC bargaining strength vis-à-vis the US. The negotiating processes in the two rounds are examined in detail and it is concluded that it is when acting divided and unable institutionally to negotiate that the EC obtained its most favorable results. The EC bargaining position was enhanced in the earlier years because partially coordinated positions of the EC within a weak supranational polity rendered credible the threat that it would be unable to offer concessions. In a second phase of the intergration process, by contrast, the institutional constraints are fading and internal concessions made for perserving the solidarity of the integrated entity no longer seem necessary. As a result, its negotiating positions are less prone to capture by a radical country and the negotiators for the union may find themselves in a lower bargaining position than in the first period. Policy implications of these findings are examined in the conclusion...|$|R

Although the immediate impact is likely to be modest, the round will provide longer term benefits to agricultural trade through the extension of the GATT rules-based system to agriculture. The framework which has been laid should provide a sound basis for future negotiations. Within the multilateral framework, the pace of change {{is a function of the}} willingness of all parties to compromise and this is evident in the <b>Uruguay</b> <b>Round's</b> outcome which reflects the European Union's agricultural reform agenda.

It provides {{a classic example of}} how cultural differences with respect to food attributes have the potential to hamper trade and to challenge WTO agreements designed to limit trade disruptions, especially when scientific evidence is limited or spurious. After outlining the legal arguments used by the parties to the Hormones dispute, simple economic models are used to represent the EU beef market and examine the effects of the hormone-treated beef ban and its removal.

This demand was expressed comprehensively in the New International Economic Order and the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States promoted by UNCTAD in the 1970s. Although the Charter was never accepted by developing sic countries and is now dead, the political, economic, and social concerns that inspired it are still present. The Charter called for restitution for the economic and social costs of colonialism, racial discrimination, and foreign domination. It would have imposed a duty on all states to adjust the prices of exports to their imports. The realization of the New International Economic Order was an impetus for developing country support for the Tokyo Round of trade negotiations.

25|$|While the Hasbro case {{considered}} {{a special case}} of the applicability of rule of the shorter term {{in the context of}} the UCC, the case of Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc. (4 N.Y.3d 540, 2nd Cir. 2005) had the occasion to consider the matter under Berne Convention. In this case, Capitol Records claimed copyright on old British sound recordings from the 1930s, on which the copyright in the United Kingdom had expired in the late 1980s. Naxos Records, which also and in competition to Capitol distributed restored versions of these recordings, challenged this copyright claim. Sound recordings are a special case because pre-1972 sound recordings in the United States are not covered by federal law but by state law. The court concluded that since federal law did not apply, and because nothing in the Berne Convention (which is inapplicable to sound recordings anyway) or the Rome Convention usurped the State of New York's law, the works were under copyright pursuant to New York common lawwhile the <b>Uruguay</b> <b>Round</b> Agreements Act and US statutes did not, and had never, offered protection to these works; the fact that they were not under copyright in the UK as of 1996 was completely irrelevant.|$|E
500|$|In the US, bootlegs {{had been}} a grey area in legality, but the 1976 Copyright Act {{extended}} copyright protection to all recordings, including [...] "all misappropriated recordings, both counterfeit and pirate". This meant bootleggers would take a much greater risk, and several were arrested. Bootlegs have been prohibited by federal law (17 USC 1101) since {{the introduction of the}} <b>Uruguay</b> <b>Round</b> Agreements Act (URAA, PL 103-465) in 1994, as well as by state law. The federal bootleg statute does not pre-empt state laws, which also apply both prior to and since the passage of the federal bootleg statute. The US v. Martignon case challenged the constitutionality of the federal bootleg statute, and in 2004, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. struck down the port banning the sale of bootleg recordings of live music, ruling that the law unfairly grants a seemingly perpetual copyright period to the original performances. In 2007, Judge Baer's ruling was overruled, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the anti-bootlegging statute was within the power of Congress.|$|E

40|$|Quarantine policy reviews are {{becoming}} more sophisticated following the <b>Uruguay</b> <b>Round’s</b> Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Measures and, in Australia’s case, following also the 1996 Nairn Report. Yet they still focus primarily {{on the effects of}} restrictions just on import-competing producers. A fuller analysis that includes the consumers demonstrates that even if imported diseases were to wipe out a local industry, the gains to consumers may outweigh the losses to import-competing producers from removing a ban on imports. This paper provides the simplest partial-equilibrium framework for thinking more about the economics of quarantine policy measures. An empirical analysis of Australia’s ban on imports of bananas, used to illustrate the methodology, suggests a move to free trade may well cause a major contraction of banana growing in Australia but the economic welfare gains to consumers are almost certain to far outweigh the losses to producers. The paper concludes by arguing {{that there is a need}} for a comprehensive economic review of Australia’s myriad quarantine restrictions.
