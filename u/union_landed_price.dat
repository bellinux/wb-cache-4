However, since most information on <b>land</b> <b>price</b> {{is in the form of}} point data and not area data, a certain process must be established for the creation of a <b>land</b> <b>price</b> map. The authors have already developed a computer-aided system that enables the creation of precise <b>land</b> <b>price</b> maps on the basis of residential <b>land</b> <b>price</b> data for metropolitan areas in Japan at low cost but with precision. In this paper, the system is applied to Tokyo metropolitan area and creates several <b>land</b> <b>price</b> maps using the officially assessed <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> provided by the Japanese government and data from the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> surveys conducted by prefectural governments...|$|R

40|$|Master of AgribusinessDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsAllen M. FeatherstoneLand is a {{fundamental}} input in agricultural production and the factors affecting <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> are an important topic in agricultural economics research. The farmland market has several unique characteristics. <b>Land</b> <b>price</b> volatility can {{be a source of}} problems for farmers and investors, especially in periods of falling prices in locations far from markets where the impact of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> reductions is higher than in other locations. This study analyzes <b>land</b> <b>price</b> volatility in different geographical regions of Brazil. The hypothesis is that variation in <b>land</b> <b>price</b> increases with the distance to the market, indicating that <b>land</b> <b>price</b> changes will be more pronounced in areas far from markets and the effects of <b>price</b> cycles in <b>land</b> markets will increase as distance from the market increases. The results obtained in this research support the hypothesis that areas far from end markets are exposed to greater changes in <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> and those same areas are more susceptible to price cycles. The effect on price volatility was also stronger in periods of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> declines. These regions have greater incentives for expansion and investment in periods of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> increase and greater risks of disinvestment and failure in periods of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> contraction. It is difficult to predict when a cycle of expansion or crisis will start or finish, but the present study helps to understand the effects of increases or decreases in <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> when such an event occurs...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to examine the way uncertainty plays a role in built <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> This paper provides basic real option <b>pricing</b> models of <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> on the demand side in central Tokyo. The model in this research analyzes micro <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> covering individual lot data provided by the <b>Land</b> <b>Price</b> Index. Since <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> are determined by both macro economic environment and micro lot-specific attributes, this paper utilizes both time-series economic data and cross-sectional lot-specific data. The model incorporates both time-series (macro) and cross-sectional (micro) data including uncertainty terms. In addition to the total uncertainty in asset prices, this research also gives some ideas of cross-sectional uncertainty in <b>land</b> <b>price</b> variations by utilizing cross-sectional amenity variables. These cross-sectional and time-series variables including these two uncertainty variables are pooled and the OLS method is conducted. The data set consists of 4, 368 <b>land</b> <b>price</b> data from 1985 through 2000. The results from the option-based models favor the application of the real option theory in <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> The total uncertainty with respect to built asset return has a substantial effect on increasing <b>land</b> <b>prices,</b> which implies that an increase in uncertainty leads to an increase in <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> by Ritsuko Yamazaki.

This approach also allowed us to compare the theory of LEV <b>land</b> <b>price</b> calculations with the actual market prices in countries where data was available.

Accordingly, <b>land</b> <b>price</b> can be utilized as an indicator, which can identify the changes of spatial structure and socioeconomic variations caused by urban development. This study attempted to explore the changes in <b>land</b> <b>price</b> by a new road construction. Methodologically, it adopted Space Syntax, which can interpret urban spatial structure comprehensively, to identify the relationship between the forms of road networks and <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> The result of the regression analysis showed the ‘integration index’ of Space Syntax is statistically significant and has a strong correlation with <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> If the integration value is high, <b>land</b> <b>price</b> increases proportionally. Subsequently, using regression equation, it tried to predict the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> changes of each of the lots surrounding the roads that are newly opened. The research methods or study results have the advantage of predicting the changes in <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in an easy way.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of land marketization in China, the spatial patterns of residential <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in different regions {{have become increasingly}} complicated. The very high and continuously rising residential <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in many cities are causing significant challenges to economic development and social stability. Yet, there has only been {{a limited amount of}} attempts made to model and analyze the regional dynamic changes of residential <b>land</b> <b>price</b> systematically, especially in term of the spatially varying effects of key demographic and economic factors. In this study we provided a perspective analysis of the changes of residential <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in 2008, 2011 and 2014 based on the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> monitoring records of 105 cities and then conducted a geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis on the relationships between residential <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and three major impact factors (i. e., immigrant population, gross domestic product (GDP) and investment in residential buildings). Results show that the areas in which GDP had relatively strong positive impacts on residential <b>land</b> <b>price</b> expanded with time. The negative effects of immigrant population on residential <b>land</b> <b>price</b> were mainly concentrated in the cities around the Bohai Rim and the area with negative effects gradually shrank in the three studied years. Conversely, the areas with negative correlation between investment in residential buildings and residential <b>land</b> <b>price</b> gradually expanded in size over time. A geographical detector was used to examine the relative importance of factors to residential <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> It was found that the GDP had more significant influence on residential <b>land</b> <b>price</b> than other factors and the influence of the three factors to overall variation in residential <b>land</b> <b>price</b> increased over the three studied years.

40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{the concepts of}} land rent {{from the standpoint of}} modern economics and accounts for the contributing factors {{in the formation of the}} agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> during the pre-war and the post-war periods. It can be said the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in the later Taisho period was conditioned by farm rent and as far as the pure farming region is concerned, the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in the post-war period is also explained considerably by net returns per 10 ares of land, which is capitalized by an 8 percent interest rate. Furthermore, the increase in agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price,</b> based on the premises of constant return to scale and the supported price of farm products, has demonstrated that the rise in the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is sufficiently explained by technological progress in rice production. Though various factors are considered important in the contribution to the formation of the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in this paper the main emphasis is based upon the fact that the interior factors of agriculture considerably elucidate its formation throughout the pre-war and the post-war period. This is especially applicable to the agricultural <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in pure farming regions...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{progress}} of the compact city policy in Kanto region is clarified with <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> as an index objectively. As for the result of the analysis, it is summarized as follows. <b>Land</b> <b>prices</b> in Japan decreased all together in 1992. The reorganization process of the regional structure is reflected in the feature that is pointed out to the <b>land</b> <b>price</b> fluctuations for 16 years until 2008. The decline in <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in the Tokyo metropolitan area in the early 1990 ’s was caused by overestimation to commercial area having been corrected. This decline was a nationwide phenomenon, and didn’t have a regional difference. But, in the later 1990 ’s, a relative difference between Tokyo wards and the other regions had expanded because the fall rate in Tokyo wards had decreased. This tendency became clearer by the increase of <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in Tokyo wards in the early 2000 ’s. Though a relative or absolute increase of <b>land</b> <b>price</b> in Tokyo wards means progresses of functional concentration in the Tokyo metropolitan area, land use had been homogenized in the surrounding areas. Homogenizing of land use is especially remarkable in the local regions. There are some cities where commercial <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is almost the same as the residential <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> It is necessary to improve the situation of the local cities to advance the compact city policy in the whole country...|$|R

40|$|<b>Land</b> <b>price</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in guiding land resource allocation for urban planning and development, particularly in big cities of fast developing countries where infrastructures and populations change frequently. Therefore, detecting spatially implicit information in the spatial pattern of relationships between <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and related impact factors is critical. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis was conducted in this study for the purpose in Wuhan, China, by using a 10 -year panel data set of residential <b>land</b> <b>price.</b> Based on twelve factors in three aspects (land attributes, location factors and neighborhood attributes), an evaluation index system of resident <b>land</b> <b>price</b> was established. The spatial distributions of estimated coefficients and pseudo t-values of three major explanatory variables (floor area ratio, distance to nearest center business district (CBD) and distance to nearest lake), obtained from GWR analysis, indicated that their relationships of the impact factors with <b>land</b> <b>price</b> are spatially non-stationary. The positive impact of floor area ratio on <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is more significant in highly developed areas than in less developed areas. Conversely, the negative impact of distance to nearest CBD on <b>land</b> <b>price</b> is larger in highly developed areas than in less developed areas. Moreover, wealthier dwellers may be willing to pay a higher price for a good lake view (especially views of small lakes), but infrastructure barriers (near some large lakes) cause negative effect [...] The outputs of this study, which provide detailed information on the relationships between <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and impact factors in local areas, are promising for urban planners to scientifically evaluate <b>land</b> <b>price</b> and make area-specific strategies.

40|$|Rental {{rates and}} <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> {{have gone through}} {{substantial}} changes the last two decades. The prices have both gone up and down since 1990 but from 1995 to 2008 <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> increased with 272 percent and rental rates with 61 percent. What factors that have the largest impact on rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> are hard to determine but factors that may affect the price are the desire {{to live in the}} countryside and the expected profitability in agriculture. Prices of products and inputs are factors that affect the profitability in agriculture, but the profitability is also affected by agricultural policies. The economic for Swedish agriculture have changed several times over the last 20 years as a result of changing agricultural policies. The agricultural policies largely affect farmers behavior and decisions. But how do the agricultural policies affect rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices?</b> Can we see any connections between past policies and the large increase in prices that has occurred during the last 20 years? In the year 2013 it is once again time for a new agricultural policy. The content of that policy is still unclear and it is therefore impossible to predict the new policy´s impact on rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> But by studying past agricultural policies impact on rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> {{it might be possible to}} obtain an indication of future price developments. The thesis aim is to describe the development of rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in Sweden the last two decades and to investigate if the development has been affected by agricultural policies. The empirical material is based on a literature review and regression analysis that test subsidies, wheat prices, total production value and interest rates impact on rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> in Sweden between 1994 and 2008. Because of the limited time, the essay has been conducted as a qualitative study and the statistical material consists of secondary data. The conclusion is that rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> have gone through substantial changes during the past 20 years. The last time Sweden experienced a fall in <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> was in the beginning of the 90 ´s, but since Swedens entry in EU there has been a strong increase in both rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices.</b> The thesis also concludes that the change in rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> has been affected by the past agricultural policies during 1994 to 2008 and 1990 to 2008 respectively. But rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> are both dependent variables that are affected by a large number of factors and it is therefore not reasonable to conclude that the agricultural policy in itself is responsible for the whole change in rental rates and <b>land</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

Our preferred estimate, which handles a number of estimation concerns, stands at 0. 041. Our approach also yields a number of intermediate outputs of independent interest such as a distance gradient for <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> and the elasticity of unit <b>land</b> <b>prices</b> with respect to city population.
