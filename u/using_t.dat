Skeets reveals itself to be Mister Mind in disguise, having used Skeets' shell as a cocoon to evolve into a being capable of devouring the Multiverse. Booster and Rip flee into the timestream with Skeets' remains {{and return to the}} end of the Infinite Crisis. Rip and Booster witness the birth of the new Multiverse, made up of 52 {{identical}} worlds. Mister Mind attempts to trap Booster and Rip in the Phantom Zone which he devoured when it was turned on him, but he is stopped by Supernova (now Daniel Carter, who was saved from the time loop he was trapped in by Rip and given Michael's outfit), who restores the Phantom Zone to its original place. Mister Mind then devours years and events of each of the 52 worlds, altering their history in the process. The real Skeets gives Booster a pep talk which inspires him to stop Mister Mind.|$|E

A well known model is Hockney's model which simply relies on point to point communication, <b>using</b> <b>T</b> = L + (M / R) where M is the message size, L is the startup latency and R is the asymptotic bandwidth in MB/s.|$|E
50|$|The use of iboga in African spiritual ceremonies {{was first}} {{reported}} by French and Belgian explorers in the 19th century. The first botanical {{description of the}} Tabernanthe iboga plant was made in 1889. Ibogaine was first isolated from T. iboga in 1901 by Dybowski and Landrin and independently by Haller and Heckel {{in the same year}} <b>using</b> <b>T.</b> iboga samples from Gabon. Complete synthesis of ibogaine was accomplished by G. Büchi in 1966. Since then, several other synthesis methods have been developed.|$|E

50|$|The large conjunct {{approach}} {{in terms of}} movement assumes that the parallel structures of RNR are full clauses or phrases below the surface. A movement mechanism is responsible for raising the shared material out of both conjuncts to {{a position in the}} hierarchy that is above the level of the parallel structures. Given this movement, the parallel structures actually qualify as constituents before movement. The movement analysis is illustrated here <b>using</b> <b>t</b> (trace) and indices to mark the positions of the shared material before movement occurs.|$|E
5000|$|Chords may be also {{represented}} by a few different notation systems such as sheet music and electronic music. A basic example of the progression would look like this, <b>using</b> <b>T</b> to indicate the tonic, S for the subdominant, and D for the dominant, and representing one chord. In Roman numeral analysis the tonic is called the I, the sub-dominant the IV, and the dominant the V. (These three chords are the basis of thousands of pop songs, which thus often have a blues sound even without using the classical twelve-bar form.) ...|$|E
50|$|ExampleLet T be a {{sequence}} of random bits, generated by a random oracle and S be {{a sequence}} generated by a pseudo-random bit generator. Two parties use one encryption system to encrypt a message M of length n as the bitwise XOR of M and the next n bits of T or S respectively. The output of the encryption <b>using</b> <b>T</b> is truly random. Now if the sequence S cannot be distinguished from T, {{the output of the}} encryption with S will appear random as well. If the sequence S is distinguishable, then the encryption of M with S may reveal information of M.|$|E
