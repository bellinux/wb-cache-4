Playing in his final game at Michigan Stadium, Robinson split his playing time between the tailback, quarterback, and wide receiver positions. He accounted for 122 yards, including 98 rushing yards on 13 carries and 24 receiving yards on two receptions.

5|$|Prior to the 1987–88 season Vanbiesbrouck {{was hit by}} a puck {{under his}} mask in practice, which caused a non-displaced {{fracture}} of his lower jaw and a broken tooth. Fortunately for him the injury did not require his jaw to be wired shut, {{and he was able to}} return to practice the next day. He showed no ill effects from the injury, playing in 56 games, winning 27. On June 13, 1988 Vanbiesbrouck suffered nerve damage to his left wrist after a glass coffee table he was sitting on collapsed and broken glass lacerated his <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> and three tendons. He was sitting on the table assembling video equipment in anticipation of the birth of his first child. The glass broke beneath him, and as he braced for the fall, his wrist was cut by the glass. Vanbiesbrouck required five hours of microsurgery to remove glass from his wrist and repair the nerve and tendon damage. He was initially expected to miss 4–6 months, but he recovered in time to attend the Rangers pre-season training camp just 3 months later. Again he played in 56 games, and increased his win total to 28.|$|E

2500|$|Although nerves tend to lie deep {{under the}} skin except in a few places such as the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> near the elbow joint, they are still {{relatively}} exposed to physical damage, which can cause pain, loss of sensation, or loss of muscle control.

2500|$|The biceps muscle {{can only}} be used for this {{transfer}} if the other elbow flexors are intact (m. brachialis and m. brachioradialis). This procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia but can be performed under supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade. The incision depends on {{whether there is a}} contracture that needs to be released. If this is the case a wide exposure of the anterior side of the elbow joint is needed. The distal side of the incision should allow complete dissection of the tendon of the biceps. The primary tendon of the biceps is released from its insertion on the radius [...] and then rerouted medial or lateral. If the <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerve</b> is functional a lateral route is favored to prevent compression, however, the lateral route can cause compression of the radial nerve. A second incision is made to expose the triceps insertion and the triceps is dissected from its insertion on the olecranon. A hole is then drilled in the olecranon and a gauge wire is then looped in the hole. The biceps is routed through a skin tunnel to the posterior side and woven into the triceps tendon to create more length. Then the tendon is inserted to the olecranon.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on normal nerves is well known, i. e., {{an increase in}} conduction velocity {{and a decrease in}} amplitude with an elevation in temperature. There are few reports examining the effect of temperature on abnormal nerves, e. g., in demyelination. To study the effect of increased temperature on demyelinating nerves in entrapment syndromes, the authors inves-tigated 55 median and 48 <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> of 48 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, and 48 median and 48 <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> of 26 healthy subjects. All measurements were obtained at 32 °C and 37 °C. Mean reductions in median sensory amplitude occurring with heating were significantly greater in the patient group than in the control group (P 0. 000). For median sensory response amplitude, the mean de-crease was 32. 1 % in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome and 10. 7 % in the control subjects. The difference between median and <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> in the latency was significantly decreased (P 0. 027) after the nerves had heated to 37 °C. It is concluded that the elevation in temperature leads to conduction block in demyelinated sensory nerves, and that temperature provocation may be useful in the diagnosis of nerve disorders. The effect may be different in axonal and demyelinating disorders...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Repetitive microtrauma or overuse {{injuries}} {{may often}} affect upper extremities {{of the long}} term computer users. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare sensory nerve conduction velocities (SNCV) for median, radial and <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> in the wrist of computer users with the same parameters in controls who do not use computers regularly. Material and Methods: Twenty one male computer users (age: mean (M) = 28. 3 years ± standard deviation (SD) = 7. 5 years) and 21 male control subjects (age: M±SD = 24. 1 ± 4. 6 years) were recruited for the study. Limb length and the perimeters of the dominant arm and forearm were measured for each subject. The neurophysiological study consisted of measuring sensory nerve conduction of the median, <b>ulnar</b> and radial <b>nerves.</b> Results: The sensory conduction velocities of both median and <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> were significantly delayed in the dominant arm of the computer users compared to the controls. In addition, sensory conduction velocity of the median nerve was significantly delayed in the dominant extremity of the computer users compared to their non-dominant extremity. Conclusions: This study shows that computer users have a tendency toward developing median and <b>ulnar</b> sensory <b>nerve</b> damage in the wrist region. Mechanism of delayed SNCV in the median and <b>ulnar</b> <b>nerves</b> may be due to sustained extension and ulnar deviation of the wrist during computer mouse use and typing. Reduced SNCV changes were more apparent on the dominant side of the median nerve. This may indicate the increased neural deficits related to an increased use of the dominant side. Further investigation is needed to determine how to reduce potential risk factors at this stage in order to prevent development of median or ulnar neuropathy in the long term computer users...|$|R
