30|$|This paper {{presents}} a new user dependent approach in iris recognition systems. In the proposed method, consistent bits of iris code are calculated, {{based on the}} user specifications, using the <b>user's</b> <b>mask.</b> Another contribution of our work is in the iris segmentation phase, where a new pointwise level set approach with area preserving {{has been used for}} determining inner and outer iris boundaries, both exclusively performed in one step. Thanks to the special properties of this segmentation technique, there is no constraint about angles of head tilt. Furthermore, we showed that this algorithm is robust in noisy situations and can locate irises which are partly occluded by eyelid and eyelashes. Experimental results, on three renowned iris databases (CASIAIrisV 3, Bath, and Ubiris), show that our method outperforms some of the existing methods, both in terms of accuracy and response time.|$|R
40|$|Internet {{users in}} general and on-line social net- works users in {{particular}} are becoming more savvy about masking data they consider private. However, some of this masked data may be inferable from other data the <b>user</b> has not <b>masked.</b> Furthermore, even if a <b>user</b> <b>masks</b> all its data, it may still be inferable from the unmasked data of its friends, due to affinities in likes and personal attributes. In contrast to the conventional data mining approach, in which a model is built for all users, we build a rule set which is individualized for each user. In this {{paper we propose a}} novel rule induction approach (that incorporates predictive metrics) which enable a user to evaluate the potential risk incurred by unmasked attributes, friends' attributes and also the risk of befriending new users. We find that all of these risks are quantifiable and a risk ranking of attributes and friends/potential friends can be individualized for each user. We give examples and use cases and confirm the effectiveness of the approach, using a sophisticated synthetic OSN-data to define risk attribute and user combinations which coincide with the risk ranking produced by our algorithm.

40|$|Providing {{the user}} with high-delity force {{feedback}} has per-sistently challenged the eld of telerobotics. This paper presents {{a new approach}} for achieving stable, high-gain force reection via cancellation of the master mechanism’s induced motion. In a classic position-force controller, high force-feedback levels drive the system’s internal master-slave loop unstable during contact with the remote environment. Lowering the force-feedback gain ensures stability but diminishes the haptic cues available to the <b>user,</b> <b>masking</b> contacts and preventing hard objects from feeling appropriately stiff. The proposed cancellation approach permits high levels of force feedback by attenuating only the controller’s internal loop. Using {{a model of the}} master mechanism’s response to applied force feedback, an estimate of induced high-frequency movement is subtracted from the master’s measured position to approximate the user’s intended path for the slave. The can-cellation technique is described, modeled, and validated herein, including testing on a one-degree-of-freedom telerobotic system. It is shown to improve the feel of the system, tripling the testbed’s achievable force-feedback gain without compromising stability. ...|$|R

Cloud computing itself has often been referred to as a conglomeration of ideas such as Software as a Service, Web 2. 0, grid computing, and utility computing [2].

The present study {{examines}} the hypothesis that when listening to speech in fluctuating maskers, CI users cannot fuse {{the pieces of the}} message over temporal gaps because they are not able to perceive reliably the information carried by obstruent consonants (e. g., stops). To test this hypothesis, CI users were presented with sentences containing clean obstruent segments, but corrupted sonorant segments (e. g., vowels). Results indicated that CI <b>users</b> received <b>masking</b> release at low signal-to-noise ratio levels. Experiment 2 assessed the contribution of acoustic landmarks alone by presenting to CI users noise-corrupted stimuli which had clearly marked vowel∕consonant boundaries, but lacking clean obstruent consonant information. These stimuli were created using noise-corrupted envelopes processed using logarithmic compression during sonorant segments and a weakly-compressive mapping function during obstruent segments. Results indicated that the use of segment-dependent compression yielded significant improvements in intelligibility, but no masking release. The results from these experiments suggest that in order for CI <b>users</b> to receive <b>masking</b> release, it is necessary to perceive reliably not only the presence and location of acoustic landmarks (i. e., vowel∕consonant boundaries) but also the information carried by obstruent consonants...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Workflow {{modeling}} and tools for designing and editing workflows {{is an important}} part of business process automation. One of the challenges of workflow design has been the gap between business users and technical users. While technical users require detailed and formal models for execution, the focus for business users generally consists of more abstract and business-related aspects of the workflow such as the purpose of the workflow and business goals it derives from the business process. One approach aiming to address this gap are goal-oriented workflows which explicitly represent the business goals as part of the workflow semantic. This paper presents an approach and a tool called GPMN-Edit for modeling such goaloriented workflows using the Goal-oriented Process Modeling Notation (GPMN). Furthermore, GPMN-Edit allows <b>users</b> to <b>mask</b> specific details of the workflow they consider irrelevant for the task at hand while still being able to continue changing the workflow...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{distributed}} systems, {{and especially}} in pervasive environments, the users face usually difficulties to obtain permissions to use {{the resources of the}} sites they visit. Either they have an account locally, or they can show a certificate obtained beforehand that gives them the access. Problems arise when they arrive in a unknown environment, which is likely to occur in pervasive environment. In this paper, we propose the Chameleon architecture which offers users such a possible access if they appear with trusted certificates. These certificates may be gathered during their roaming in the pervasive environment, and they offer direct or transitive access to foreign sites, based on trust relationships. We describe a new kind of certificate (the X 316 certificate), to set up a contextual broader access, giving the possibility for the <b>users</b> to <b>mask</b> parts of their personal information embedded in the certificate and to show only what is mandatory for a given access. ...|$|R

This paper examined the protective effectiveness of the Serbian military's M 3 protective face mask in relation to the presence of airborne depleted uranium and its by-products. Sodium chloride in solid aerosol form was used as a test substance and adequate physical simulator of such radioactive aerosols because its granulometric (particle) size distribution met the requirements of suitability as a simulator. Determination of aerosol concentration was carried out by flame photometry method, whilst granulometric distribution was determined by an electric particles analyzer. It was established that the total internal leakage of the M 3 protective mask was as much a function of the penetration of particles through the combined M 3 filter as of the leaks along the fitting line of the <b>user's</b> face <b>mask</b> and the inhalation valve.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} whether placement of an electrode closer to the modiolus would provide a more efficient interface with the auditory nerve. A pre-curved, banded 22 -electrode array has been developed. Following comprehensive safety studies, the array was inserted in three adult patients. Detailed x-ray analyses have been conducted to specify the positions of the electrode bands. Psychophysical studies have been conducted, within each subject, using electrodes which lie at differing distances from the modiolus. These studies have shown that as the distance from the modiolus decreased, electrode threshold currents decreased and dynamic ranges increased. Thresholds were lower than in a comparison group of standard array <b>users.</b> Forward <b>masking</b> studies showed current spread to be more focused at the electrodes lying closer to the modiolus. Electrode discrimination was also better at electrodes closer to the modiolus. JND for loudness, expressed as a function of dynamic range also decreased in this condition. Thus, a preliminary profile of the parameters of interest, for an improved implant design, suggest that an array which lies closer to the modiolus can result in lower current requirements and a more localised pattern of neural excitation. 20 August - 3 SeptemberOpen Acces...|$|R

Mobility on commonly encountered rolling environments is a key aspect of function. High variation in capacity among wheelchair <b>users</b> can <b>mask</b> changes in mobility because of wheelchair design. A repeated measures protocol in which the participants use one type of wheelchair and then another minimises the impact of individual variation. Objectives: The Aspects of Wheelchair Mobility Test (AWMT) {{was designed to be}} used in repeated measures studies in low-resource areas. It measures the impact of different wheelchair types on physical performance in commonly encountered rolling environments and provides an opportunity for qualitative and quantitative participant response. This study sought to confirm the ability of the AWMT to discern differences in mobility because of wheelchair design. Method: Participants were wheelchair users at a boarding school for students with disabilities in a low-resource area. Each participant completed timed tests on measured tracks on rough and smooth surfaces, in tight spaces and over curbs. Four types of wheelchairs designed for use in low-resource areas were included. Results: The protocol demonstrated the ability to discriminate changes in mobility of individuals because of wheelchair type. Conclusion: Comparative effectiveness studies with this protocol can enable beneficial change. This is illustrated by design alterations by wheelchair manufacturers in response to results...|$|R

40|$|Forward masking is a {{phenomenon}} that occurs when one stimulus (masker) elevates the threshold for perception of a subsequent stimulus (probe). In cochlear implant listeners, it has been hypothesized that interactions between electrodes (termed channel interactions) can have a deleterious effect on speech recognition (Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998; Throckmorton and Collins, 1999). Forward masking is one measure {{that has been used}} to assess channel interactions (Shannon, 1983; Tong and Clark, 1986; Lim et al., 1986; Shannon, 1990; Blamey and Dooley, 1993; Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998), and it has also been proposed as a mechanism {{that could be used to}} assess information that is being presented to but is not received by the user (Throckmorton and Collins, 1999; Nogueira et al., 2005). Determining information that is not received by the <b>user,</b> or is <b>masked,</b> has the potential to provide guidance for the design of new speech processing algorithms that either work to reduce lost information or substitute alternate information. Nogueira et al., (2005) investigated the potential for using forward masking to estimate masked information and found a limited benefit with information substitution; however, their findings were based on normal hearing psychoacoustic forward masking patterns (Nogueira et al., 2005). Given that psychophysically measured forward masking patterns vary from subject to subject and electrode to electrode (e. g. Shannon, 1983; Shannon, 1990; Chatterjee and Shannon, 1998), measuring subject- and electrode-specific patterns has the potential to provide a more accurate assessment of masked information. In addition, the experimental time required to gather the full set of psychophysical forward masking patterns for all electrodes is far too long for clinical relevance (Throckmorton and Collins, 1999). Recently, it has been suggested that forward masking patterns can be measured physiologically via the electrically evoked compound action potential (ECAP) (e. g. Hughes and Stille, 2009) which may make it possible to measure the information necessary for a subject-specific assessment of masked information in a clinically relevant time frame. This study utilized ECAP measurements to estimate the forward masking patterns in subjects, and these masking patterns were used to estimate the masked stimuli in speech. The estimates were validated using a speech reception threshold task to assess whether speech recognition is affected by removing "masked" pulses from a subject's stimulation pattern. The results of this study suggest that forward masking patterns measured via ECAPs could potentially determine information that is not being perceived by the <b>user.</b> The <b>masked</b> stimuli were also used to statistically evaluate the segments of speech that are most vulnerable to masking. These results suggest that the amount of masking that occurs per phoneme depends on the characteristics of the subject-specific masking patterns. Thesi...|$|R
