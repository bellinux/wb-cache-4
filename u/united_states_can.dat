5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was also}} adopted {{as a method}} of execution by Guatemala in 1996, China in 1997, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, Taiwan in 2005, and Vietnam in 2013. The Philippines abolished the method in 2006, though a bill to reinstate it passed through the House of Representatives and as of July 2017 is still awaiting debate in the Senate. While it is still legal, no executions have been carried out in Guatemala since 2000, and in Thailand since 2009. The United States and China are the two biggest users of this method of execution. The U.S. had executed 1,283 people via lethal injection as of April 2017. The number of people executed annually in China is thought to surpass all other countries combined, though the actual number is a state secret, and the percentage of people killed via lethal injection and the other method of execution used there, firing squad, is also unclear. This alphabetical list features notable cases up to September 2017, and only those where lethal injection can be reliably sourced to be the method of execution. The criterion for notability is an article on the individual in the English Wikipedia, which inevitably causes a bias towards U.S. executions, as notable individuals in other countries such as Thailand and Vietnam may only have articles in their own language. A complete list of all executions in the <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>can</b> be found here.|$|E

The <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>can</b> sue on behalf of tribes to gain title to those lands.|$|E

Holding multiple elections at the same time can increase turnout; however, presenting voters with massive multipage ballots, as occurs {{in some parts of the}} <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>can</b> reduce turnouts.|$|E
25|$|Dance in Nicaragua varies {{depending}} upon the region. Rural areas {{tend to have a}} stronger focus on movement of the hips and turns.

A considerable amount of Bachata dancing influence comes from Nicaraguans living abroad, in cities that include Miami, Los Angeles and, to a much lesser extent, New York City.
