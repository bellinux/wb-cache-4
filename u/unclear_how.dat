5|$|It was <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> Hsu {{could have}} {{remained}} at large for 15 years {{and engage in}} prominent political activity without being detected. It was also <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> a convicted felon, having already fled prosecution once, was allowed out on bail without first having to surrender his passport. Prior to Hsu's second attempt to flee, James Brosnahan, Hsu's attorney in California, defended Hsu stating that Hsu's prominence showed {{that he did not}} behave like a fugitive and that Hsu was moving towards a resolution of the matter, including a plan of restitution for victims of Hsu's actions.|$|E
5|$|Presently, a few {{solutions}} {{are known for}} k = 9 and k = 10, but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> many solutions remain undiscovered for those values of k.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis has {{a strong}} {{hereditary}} component, and many genes are associated with it, but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> those genes work together. Most of the identified genes relate to the immune system, particularly the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and T cells. Genetic studies are valuable due {{to their ability to}} identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential drug targets.|$|E
50|$|It is <b>unclear</b> for <b>how</b> long Mauricius {{remained}} bishop: {{his successor}} {{may have been}} appointed in 407, or {{he may have been}} still in post in 419.|$|R
25|$|It is <b>unclear</b> exactly <b>how</b> valproate works. Proposed {{mechanisms}} include affecting GABA levels, blocking voltage-gated sodium channels, and inhibiting histone deacetylases. Valproic acid is a branched short-chain {{fatty acid}} (SCFA) made from valeric acid.|$|R
25|$|It is <b>unclear</b> exactly <b>how</b> these {{proteins}} can translocate such a {{wide variety}} of drugs, however one model (the hydrophobic vacuum cleaner model) states that, in P-glycoprotein, the drugs are bound indiscriminately from the lipid phase based on their hydrophobicity.|$|R
5|$|All serials in {{this season}} {{continue}} directly one after the other, tracing one single problematic voyage of the TARDIS crew. Despite the continuity, each serial is considered its own standalone story. This season also introduced the character of Harry Sullivan as a companion; this character was intended to undertake action scenes, during the period prior to Tom Baker being cast, when it was <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> old the actor playing the new Doctor would be.|$|E
5|$|Amylostereum chailletiiz {{is common}} in the {{temperate}} regions of North America and Eurasia. A.laevigatum can be also found in temperate Eurasia, but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> broadly this species is distributed in North America. A.areolatum is originally native in North Africa and Eurasia; it was however distributed through the 20th century in Australia, New Zealand, Southern Africa {{as well as in}} South and North America. Only A.ferreum is originally native in the tropics and {{is common in}} Brazil and the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} passing of noble titles or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share of the family property. Unlike the practice in later dynasties, the father usually sent his adult married sons away with their portions of the family fortune. Daughters received {{a portion of the}} family fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually much less than the shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> common this was.|$|E
50|$|Sir Henry Merrivale must solve an {{impossible}} crime {{when a man}} dies in his home {{in such a way}} that it seems no one could have been sufficiently close to him to have committed murder, and it is <b>unclear</b> exactly <b>how</b> or why he died.|$|R
30|$|An {{increase}} in male {{unemployment rate in}} an MSA is expected to lower {{the likelihood of a}} birth occurring in that MSA, with a lag. Theory is <b>unclear</b> about <b>how</b> the likelihood of a birth in an MSA would change with an {{increase in}} female unemployment rate.|$|R
5000|$|Lagoon Boy discovers a conch horn {{that allows}} him to call out to his Spotty, a monstrous animal from the undersea trench called the Devil's Deep. Lagoon Boy has also {{displayed}} the ability to command humpback whales. At this point, it is <b>unclear</b> just <b>how</b> much control he has over them.|$|R
5|$|At {{least one}} of the hazard maps {{published}} in the prominent El Espectador newspaper in Bogotá included glaring errors. Without proper graphic scaling, it was <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> big the map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar was {{fortified}} for {{the first}} time in 1160 by the Almohad Sultan Abd al-Mu'min in response to the coastal threat posed by the Christian kings of Aragon and Castile. Gibraltar was renamed Jebel al-Fath (the Mount of Victory), though this name did not persist, and a fortified town named Medinat al-Fath (the City of Victory) was laid out on the upper slopes of the Rock. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> much of Medinat al-Fath was actually built, as the surviving archaeological remains are scanty.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} {{played football}} for Mitchell Main {{in the winter}} of 1912–13, Kilner played as a right-back for Preston North End F.C. while posted to Preston during the war. The team won promotion from the Second Division in 1915, and took their place in the First Division when league football resumed in 1919. Sometimes playing under the name of Smith to avoid detection (although it is not certain why he did so), Kilner's first certain appearance for the team was in September 1918. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> often he represented the club.|$|E

5|$|In addition, Constantine {{appears to}} have reorganised the border forces along the Danube, {{replacing}} the old-style alae and cohortes with new units of cunei (cavalry) and auxilia (infantry) respectively. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> the new-style units differed from the old-style ones, but those stationed on the border (as opposed {{to those in the}} comitatus) may have been smaller, perhaps half the size. In sectors other than the Danube, old-style auxiliary regiments survived.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous analysis, You and Dodson find Chaoyangsaurus {{to be the most}} basal neoceratopsian, more derived than Psittacosaurus, while Leptoceratopsidae, not Protoceratopsidae, is recovered as the sister group of Ceratopsidae. This study includes Auroraceratops, but lacks seven taxa found in Xu and Makovicky's work, so it is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> comparable the two studies are. Asiaceratops and Turanoceratops are each considered nomina dubia and not included. Along with Dong Zhiming, You described Magnirostris in 2003, but to date has not included it in any of his cladograms.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> {{much impact}} Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though {{the aims of the}} deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command did not come to expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> {{much of a}} {{concurrent}} {{increase in}} fishing for great white sharks has caused the decline of great white shark populations from the 1970s to the present. No accurate global population numbers are available, but the great white shark is now considered vulnerable. Sharks taken during the long interval between birth and sexual maturity never reproduce, making population recovery and growth difficult.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> strong Matilda's {{personal}} piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong {{preference to}} be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed her to have substantial, underlying religious beliefs. Like {{other members of the}} Anglo-Norman nobility, she bestowed considerable patronage on the Church. Early on in her life, she preferred the well-established Benedictine monastery of Cluny alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the Victorines and Premonstratensians. As part of this patronage, she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-Vœu near Cherbourg.|$|E
5|$|It was Johnson's {{practice}} to avoid interference with military decisions, however he supported Morgan's request for two light artillery pieces that became hallmarks of his command. By contrast, he consistently opposed {{the command of}} General Lloyd Tilghman, trying repeatedly but unsuccessfully to have him removed. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> much military influence Johnson wielded in his position as governor, though he enjoyed a cordial relationship {{with most of the}} Confederate generals.|$|E
50|$|After losing two {{of their}} five members and being dropped from their label, Renaissance signed on to Miles Copeland's I.R.S. Records. The {{departed}} members were replaced by keyboardist/singer Peter Gosling and drummer Peter Barron. Given that the new members were not pictured on the album at all, it's <b>unclear</b> just <b>how</b> official their membership was.|$|R

50|$|It is <b>unclear</b> exactly <b>how</b> old Al is. Early in {{the first}} ongoing Deadpool series in the 1990s, Al refers to herself as a sexagenarian but she later claims to {{remember}} Flapper-dresses (popular in the 1920s) and was later referred to by Montgomery Burns, a precog at Landau, Luckman & Lake, as a septuagenarian.|$|R
5|$|Mary's mother Molly {{initially}} ran {{the fossil}} business after Richard's death, {{but it is}} <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> much actual fossil collecting she did herself. As late as 1821, she wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Joseph's time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an upholsterer, but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary had assumed the {{leading role in the}} family business.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{populations were}} devastated by {{contagious}} diseases, in particular, smallpox, {{brought to the}} Americas by European colonists. It is <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> many Native Americans were killed by foreign diseases after the arrival of Columbus in the Americas, but the numbers have been estimated {{to be close to}} 70% of the indigenous population. The damage done by this disease significantly aided European attempts to displace and conquer the native population.|$|E
5|$|The {{current rate}} of ocean {{chemistry}} change appears to be without precedent in Earth's geological history, making it <b>unclear</b> <b>how</b> well marine ecosystems {{will be able to}} adapt to the shifting conditions of the near future. Of particular concern is {{the manner in which the}} combination of acidification with the expected additional stressors of higher temperatures and lower oxygen levels will impact the seas.|$|E
50|$|Weneg (or Uneg), {{also known}} as Weneg-Nebty, is the throne name of an early Egyptian king, who ruled during the second dynasty.
