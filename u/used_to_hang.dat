5|$|The straight, {{symmetrical}} stone columns {{found in}} the Polonnaruwa Vatadage are quite similar to those seen in buildings of the Anuradhapura period. The foot of each column is carved {{in the shape of}} a lotus flower. Archaeologist Senarath Paranavithana has suggested that these stone columns had supported a wooden roof. This is widely accepted, and nails and roof tiles found in excavations seem to support this. However, another theory is that the Vatadage did not have a roof, and the stone columns were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> lamps, curtains or Buddhist symbols.|$|E
5|$|After Anne Hyde's death, a {{portrait}} of her painted by Willem Wissing was commissioned by the future Mary II; this <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> above {{the door of the}} Queen's Drawing Room of the Garden House at Windsor Castle. Two years {{after the death of his}} first wife, James married a Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who bore James Francis Edward, James' only son to survive to adulthood. James became king of England, Ireland, and Scotland in 1685, but was deposed during the Glorious Revolution of 1688. The throne was then offered by Parliament to Anne's eldest daughter Mary and her husband William III of Orange. After Mary died in 1694 and William in 1702, Anne Hyde's daughter Anne became queen of the three kingdoms and, in 1707, the first sovereign of the united Kingdom of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Pieces of {{the rope}} which was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> Corder sold for a guinea each. Part of Corder's scalp with an ear still {{attached}} was displayed in a shop in Oxford Street. A lock of Maria's hair sold for two guineas. Polstead became a tourist venue with visitors travelling from as far afield as Ireland; Curtis estimated that 200,000 people visited Polstead in 1828 alone. The Red Barn and the Martens' cottage excited particular interest. The barn was stripped for souvenirs, down to the planks being removed from the sides, broken up, and sold as toothpicks. It was slated to be demolished after the trial, but it was left standing and eventually burned down in 1842. Even Maria's gravestone in the churchyard of St Mary's, Polstead was eventually chipped away to nothing by souvenir hunters; only {{a sign on the}} shed now marks the approximate place where it stood, although her name is given to Marten's Lane in the village. Pottery models and sketches were sold and songs were composed, including one quoted in the Vaughan Williams opera Hugh the Drover and Five Variants of Dives and Lazarus.|$|E

25|$|The {{center of}} this former village is the main square or garden officially called the “Plaza de la Constitución” but {{better known as the}} “Jardín Principal” (Main Garden). Visually, what stands out is the large kiosk in the center, but {{historically}} more important is the “Arbol de los colgaldos” (Tree of the Hanged). This tree, still alive, was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> political enemies and bandits, including those opposed to the invading French Army during the French Intervention in Mexico. On weekends, vendors set up stalls selling handcrafts and other items.

25|$|The Chapel located {{immediately}} {{behind the}} Eastern Pavilion, created in 1742-48 and originally rising through two floors. The room {{was divided into}} two floors in 1929 when the new school chapel was built, all the timber panelling being reused in the new chapel. Only the plaster ceiling decoration survives, this consists of octagons, crosses and hexagons. The elaborate carved wood panelling of cedarwood came from a house in Cornwall also called Stowe. It had been carved by Michael Chuke a pupil of Grinling Gibbons. The most elaborate pieces of carving were the gallery on the south side, the octagonal pulpit dated 1707 and the elaborate reredos the reached nearly the full height of the room, the lower half having two Corinthian columns flanking the altar above which <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> a copy of Rubens's painting of 'Holy Lamb'. This in turn was flanked by rich carving of fruit and plants. Above was a very rich carving of the Royal Arms.|$|E
500|$|Intertwining pink silk ribbons are {{draped over}} the mirror and curl over its frame. The ribbon's {{function}} {{has been the subject}} of much debate by art historians; suggestions include an allusion to the fetters used by Cupid to bind lovers, that it was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> the mirror, and that it was used to blindfold Venus moments before. The critic Julián Gallego found Cupid's facial expression to be so melancholy that he interprets the ribbons as fetters binding the god to the image of Beauty, and gave the painting the title [...] "Amor conquered by Beauty".|$|E

500|$|Foxton died on 14 February 1829, and Calcraft was {{appointed}} as his successor. He {{was sworn in}} as the official Executioner for the City of London and Middlesex on 4 April 1829, a position for which he was paid one guinea a week plus an additional guinea for each execution. He also received an allowance for cats o' nine tails and birch rods, and supplemented his income by selling sections of the rope <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> his victims, for which he charged between five shillings and £1 per inch. Calcraft's first duty in his new role was the execution of Thomas Lister and George Wingfield, hanged together on 27 March 1829, Lister for burglary and Wingfield for highway robbery. Esther Hibner, known in the press as the [...] "Evil Monster", was the first woman hanged by Calcraft. She was executed on 13 April 1829, having been found guilty of starving to death her apprentice, Frances Colppits.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{tapestries}} that the Tausug <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> as house decoration: the luhul or canopy that hangs from the ceiling, and the kikitil/buras or wall tapestry. The ukkil design used for both is first traced on a starched white cloth which is then cut and sewn over a red, green, yellow, or blue background material. The ukkil design of the luhul, for example, {{is in the form of}} a tree with spreading leaves, vines, flowers, and branches. About 1 m wide, the kikitil is a smaller version of the luhul and is hung on the wall. The size of the room determines the length of the kikitil which is divided into various units correspond-ing to individualized panels. The ukkil design may be similar in all units.|$|R

500|$|Many {{cultures}} in ancient Mesopotamia had stories involving blood-drinking demons. The Persians {{were one of}} the first civilizations thought to have tales of such monsters; creatures attempting to drink blood from men are depicted on excavated pottery shards. Ancient Babylonia had tales of the mythical Lilitu, synonymous with and giving rise to Lilith (Hebrew לילית) and her daughters the Lilu from Hebrew demonology. Lilith was considered a demon and was often depicted as subsisting on the blood of babies. [...] The legend of Lilith was originally included in some traditional Jewish texts: according to the medieval folk traditions, she was considered to be Adam's first wife before Eve. In these texts, Lilith left Adam to become the queen of the demons (she actually refused to be Adam's subordinate and thus was banished from Eden by God himself) and, much like the Greek striges, would prey on young babies and their mothers at night, as well as males. Because Hebrew law absolutely forbade the eating of human flesh or the drinking of any type of blood, Lilith's blood drinking was described as exceptionally evil. To ward off attacks from Lilith, parents <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> amulets around their child's cradle.|$|E

As teenagers, the Gallagher brothers (especially Noel) were regular truants, often getting into trouble with the police. When his mother took a job working in the school canteen, Gallagher ensured that he stopped by to visit her during lunch before skipping {{the rest of the}} day. He was expelled from school at the age of 15 for throwing a bag of flour over a teacher. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> around with the football hooligan firms Maine Line Crew, Under-5s, and Young Guvnors in the 1980s, and at the age of 13, he received six months' probation for robbing a corner shop. It was during this period of probation, with little else to do, that he first began to teach himself to play a guitar his father had left him, playing his favourite songs from the radio. Gallagher was particularly inspired by the debut of The Smiths on Top of the Pops in 1983, performing their single [...] "This Charming Man". He later reflected that [...] "from that day on ... wanted to be Johnny Marr". He also appeared (and scored) for Manchester Gaelic football outfit CLG Oisín at Croke Park, Dublin in 1983.|$|E
