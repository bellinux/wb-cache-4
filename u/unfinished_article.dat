His work in Moskvityanin, Time and Epoch appears careless, but he defended their [...] "sincerity".) Grigoryev's worldview was unclear even to his friends and admirers; his final, <b>unfinished</b> <b>article</b> ("The Paradoxes of Organic Criticism"), in response to Dostoyevsky's invitation to state his critical philosophy, was typically wide-ranging. He referred to his style of criticism as [...] "organic", in contrast to [...] "theorists" [...] (Chernishevsky, Nikolai Dobrolyubov and Dmitri Pisarev), [...] "aesthetics" [...] and [...] "historians" [...] (Vissarion Belinsky). Although Grigoryev admired Belinskiy, calling him an [...] "immortal champion of ideas ... with a great and powerful spirit", he considered the latter's criticism too direct and logical.|$|E
5000|$|On {{his return}} to Saint Petersburgh, Maykov became close to the Petrashevsky circle and took part in {{compiling}} the so-called Pocket Dictionary of Foreign Words Now Part of the Russian Language (1845-46) along with N.Kirillov and Mikhail Petrashevsky himself. There he wrote some major articles: [...] "Analysis", [...] "Criticism", [...] "Ideal", [...] "Drama", [...] "Journal". The Kirillov's Dictionary, the most obvious result of French Revolution influence (and an analogue of Voltaire's Philosophy Dictionary), in the late 1840s was banned and put out of circulation. In 1849 Ivan Liprandi who investigated the Petrashevsky case, was saying that the dictionary [...] "was full of such daring things which were worse than those in hand-written copies that were circulating around". In 1845 Maykov became a co-editor of the Finsky vestnik (The Finnish Herald) magazine, founded by Fyodor Dershau. The first volume of it opened with Maykov's large (<b>unfinished)</b> <b>article</b> [...] "Social Sciences in Russia" [...] in which he formulated the main thesis of his whole literary legacy: the need for science and arts to be organically linked with social reality. The {{second part of the}} article was to be a critical analysis of [...] "the progressive thought in Russia," [...] focusing on Vissarion Belinsky, but got banned and later appeared in miscellaneous fragments.|$|E

Abstract: The article {{discusses}} {{shifts and}} continuities in practical and theoretical work on organisational learning {{since the mid}} 1980 s within a tradition at the Work Research Institute (WRI) in Oslo promoting work place democracy. Projects over 20 years are reviewed. All the projects discussed have had a participatory action research design. The point, however, is the emerging justifications for the changing approaches chosen. The learning within and across the different projects {{is a kind of}} “justificatory trajectory”. This justification and explanation constitutes the real purpose of the article. This article presents and discusses shifts and continuities in practical and theoretical work on organisational learning done by the author since the mid 1980 s, in Norway. The work has been done from within a tradition at the Work Research Institute (WRI) in Oslo promoting work place democracy since the 1960 s (ref.) 2. Several different projects over more than 20 years are reviewed. All the projects discussed have had a participatory action research design, either in small enterprises or in municipalities. The short project presentations are chronological and basically descriptive. The most interesting aspects, however, are th...|$|R

40|$|Professor Teresa Zofia Orłoś‘s <b>unfinished</b> <b>article</b> {{has become}} a {{stimulus}} to write this paper on polite forms in the Czech language. The polite forms onkání and onikání were mainly used in Czech in the 18 th century. During the Czech Revival they {{were not included in}} the literary norm (the 2 nd person pl., i. e. vykání is used), however, in everyday communication they have appeared for a long period of time. Today onikání is used as an element expressing irony or parody. In literature it is used as a means of stylization of heroes’ description, particularly characterizing „simple” people or Jews (e. g. in Jewish anecdotes). The lack of onkání and onikání in contemporary Czech shows that the norm of polite forms undergoes changes. It is not given for good...|$|E
5000|$|In March 1992, the Harvard Law Review {{published}} an <b>unfinished</b> draft <b>article</b> by Frug called [...] "A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto," [...] which explored the legal theories on violence toward women. Some {{members of the}} Review were opposed to publishing the piece, and later, {{on the anniversary of}} her murder, parodied it in He-Manifesto of Post-Mortem Legal Feminism, which was included in the Harvard Law Revue, an annual spoof of the Review. It was signed by [...] "Mary Doe, Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law" [...] and argued that Frug's theories were the concoction of paranoid feminists. Co-authors Craig Coben and Ken Fenyo later apologized in a statement, particularly to Frug's husband. They added that they did not mean to distribute the article on the anniversary of her death. The statement was signed by other members of the Review, including the then-Supreme Court editor Paul Clement. [...] Her views were considered especially infuriating by Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, who railed against her audacity, and stirred up strong sentiment against her among his students. [...] According to The New York Times: [...] On April 4, 1991, Mary Joe Frug, a prominent feminist legal scholar at the New England School of Law in Boston, was hacked to death on the streets of Cambridge. Wielding a military-style knife with a 7-inch-long blade, her assailant, as yet unknown, stabbed her four times. On April 4, 1992, the Harvard Law Review held its annual gala banquet, when the torch of the nation’s most prestigious legal journal is passed to a new generation of editors. Among those invited: the murdered woman’s husband, Gerald Frug, a member of the Harvard Law School faculty. Had he attended, he would have found on his plate a parody of his wife’s last article. The parody, titled “He-Manifesto of Post-Mortem Legal Feminism,” was produced by the Law Review’s editors and paid for by the school. It depicted Ms. Frug as a humorless, sex-starved mediocrity and dubbed her the “Rigor-Mortis Professor of Law.” The New York Times ...|$|R
40|$|Current higher {{education}} policy in England is characterised by some enduring dilemmas and challenges that the New Labour government {{has so far}} largely failed to resolve in its unprecedented three terms in office. How {{to pay for a}} mass system that is approaching 50 % participation by young people, how to achieve greater equity of access to that system and how to transform {{higher education}} to meet new social and economic needs are the principal long-term challenges among others that remain <b>unfinished</b> business. This <b>article</b> examines policymaking on expansion, diversity, funding, research and teaching during this period. It argues that the policymaking process in England, and the trajectory this has taken since 1997, may be as significant as the policies themselves in limiting future options. It identifies four characteristics of the current policymaking process and their implications for the future direction of HE policy in England: increasing centralisation, the co-option of sector initiatives for government purposes, the tensions between short-term initiatives and longer-term approaches and the predominance of ideology over research as a basis for policy. Instead, it concludes, we should be developing a mode of policymaking that is iterative, research-informed, cooperative (rather than merely ‘consultative’), strategic and that produces a long-term framework for enabling change...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{supplement}} to Anthony Pople's `Using Complex Set Theory for Tonal Analysis: an Introduction to the Tonalities Project'. At {{the end of his}} <b>unfinished</b> <b>article</b> are the beginnings of two final sections. The first was to consider `analyses of more challenging music (by Bruckner, Mahler, Delius, Debussy, Schoenberg etc.) '; the second was to focus on the opening of Berg's Der Wein and the concept of chord induction ± a topic not actually covered in the article to that point. The passages for analysis were clearly those that had made somewhat fleeting appearances in three presentations Pople gave on Tonalities at Oxford, Reading and Bristol in 2000, 2001 and 2002. 1 These extracts, from music composed {{around the turn of the}} nineteenth and twentieth centuries, will be examined here. They represent only about one third of the works analysed during the Tonalities project, but are sufficient to indicate the power of Tonalities as an analytical tool. A complete list of the 30 compositions analysed before Pople's untimely death is given in Fig. 1. 2 This article attempts to develop the material left by Pople into a `performing version'. It does not claim to reconstruct exactly what Pople would have written, but tries to make many of the points he would have made, while adding further commentary of which he would have approved. The aim is to give an insight into the analytical output of Tonalities without embarking on an overly extensive critique or development of Pople's work. At the end, some ways in which the work may be taken forward are suggested. Some of these were certainly in Pople's mind; others are entirely my own ideas...|$|E
