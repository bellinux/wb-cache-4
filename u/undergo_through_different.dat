40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} challenges of the higher education sector in Kosovo, in Europe and elsewhere, is the development and updating of the curricula (study programs), which is consistent with the needs of labour market, comparable with the similar universities abroad, along with Bologna Declaration and with recent trends in European higher education. The aim {{of this study is to}} analyse system of higher education in Kosovo: legal framework and managerial accountability of the public and private higher education institutions in the process of curriculum development (study programs), and the case study regarding to the curriculum development is conducted at University “Haxhi Zeka ” in Peja. The study is developed based on two main research methods: 1) Survey method, and 2) Roundtable discussion. In addition, a great importance is dedicated to the research, analysis, use of national and international strategic documents that consequently, administrate the process of curriculum development, respectively the higher education in Kosovo. The survey results shows that, decision-making process on curricula development <b>undergo</b> <b>through</b> <b>different</b> levels at public higher education institutions comparing with private ones. Further, curriculum of University “Haxhi Zeka ” is developed based on market researches and is consistent with the labour market needs...|$|E

50|$|In 1960 MGSSA and St Thomas Syrian Students of Mertran kakshi, as it {{merged with}} Jacobite Church, merged to form Mar Gregorios Orthodox Christian Student Movement Mgocsm. During this period the Students Movement showed {{exponential}} growth and {{is said to}} have nearly 700 units and more than 25000 members.But this 'Golden Era' was of short term and soon in 1972 both the churches split apart thus splitting erstwhile Mgocsm. From 1972 the organisation had a shunt growth as most of the units became inactive and many became non-existent. After 1976 the student's movement <b>underwent</b> <b>through</b> <b>different</b> stages, the name of the movement was changed into SOSMI (Syrian Orthodox Students Movement of India)which flourished in colleges and the school and parish units were abandoned. It had only 25 but strong units nearly 1000 members and current President H G Kuriakose Mor Theophilose, then as a priest, was the main activist. In 2002 when the revised constitution was adopted by the Jacobite Church the name of the student wing was also changed as JASSMI (Jacobite Syrian Students Movement of India).|$|R
50|$|The Kosovo Museum {{was once}} {{the seat of the}} vilayet of Kosovo, while now is housed in an Austro-Hungarian {{architecture}} yellow building. It was built by the Austrian occupants for the Turkish Army in 1898. From the 1950s and onwards, it <b>underwent</b> <b>through</b> <b>different</b> changes and served different purposes prior to becoming a museum. In this context, from 1945 to 1975 it served as the base of the Yugoslav National Army. In 1963, it was sold to the Museum of Kosovo and from 1995 to 2002, it was used as the main office for the European Agency for Reconstruction. The museum is full of rich collections of the prehistoric era. One of the most prominent piece is a small (no more than 30 cm tall) statue called “The Goddess on Throne”. The object is believed to be 6000 years old and was found in a site called “Tjerrtorja”near Pristina. in 1956 Just before the onset of the Kosovo War in 1998, the statue was unwillingly taken to Belgrade along with 1,247 other artefacts. In May 2002, by the intervention of the UN, the “Goddess on Throne” was returned to Pristina.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research of}} the high power ultrasound effect on rheological and foaming properties of ice cream model mixtures. Ice cream model mixtures are prepared according to specific recipes, and afterward <b>undergone</b> <b>through</b> <b>different</b> homogenization techniques: mechanical mixing, ultrasound treatment and combination of mechanical and ultrasound treatment. Specific diameter (12. 7 mm) of ultrasound probe tip {{has been used for}} ultrasound treatment that lasted 5 minutes at 100 percent amplitude. Rheological parameters have been determined using rotational rheometer and expressed as flow index, consistency coefficient and apparent viscosity. From the results it can be concluded that all model mixtures have non-newtonian, dilatant type behavior. The highest viscosities have been observed for model mixtures that were homogenizes with mechanical mixing, and significantly lower values of viscosity have been observed for ultrasound treated ones. Foaming properties are expressed as percentage of increase in foam volume, foam stability index and minimal viscosity. It has been determined that ice cream model mixtures treated only with ultrasound had minimal increase in foam volume, while the highest increase in foam volume has been observed for ice cream mixture that has been treated in combination with mechanical and ultrasound treatment. Also, ice cream mixtures having higher amount of proteins in composition had shown higher foam stability. It has been determined that optimal treatment time is 10 minutes...|$|R
40|$|This study explores {{a method}} to {{characterize}} temporal structure of intermittent phase locking in oscillatory systems. When an oscillatory system is in a weakly synchronized regime away from a synchronization threshold, it spends {{most of the time}} in parts of its phase space away from synchronization state. Therefore characteristics of dynamics near this state (such as its stability properties/Lyapunov exponents or distributions of the durations of synchronized episodes) do not describe system's dynamics for most of the time. We consider an approach to characterize the system dynamics in this case, by exploring the relationship between the phases on each cycle of oscillations. If some overall level of phase locking is present, one can quantify when and for how long phase locking is lost, and how the system returns back to the phase-locked state. We consider several examples to illustrate this approach: coupled skewed tent maps, which stability can be evaluated analytically, coupled Rössler and Lorenz oscillators, <b>undergoing</b> <b>through</b> <b>different</b> intermittencies on the way to phase synchronization, and a more complex example of coupled neurons. We show that the obtained measures can describe the differences in the dynamics and temporal structure of synchronization/desynchronization events for the systems with similar overall level of phase locking and similar stability of synchronized state.

40|$|Fodder for live-stock was, in Quesnay’s view, a {{critical}} {{portion of the}} farmer’s circulating capital. By increasing recourse to stabling it increased the availability of manure which in turn would increase yield per acre of land. Expenditure on fodder {{is in fact the}} single item that best of all characterizes the more general revolution in technical and social relations advocated by Quesnay for French agriculture of his time and {{often referred to as the}} passage from petite to grande culture. Yet in Quesnay’s tableau économique a quite unprecedented assumption (as far as Quesnay’s own earlier writings are concerned), according to which each class divides its expense half on agricultural produce and half on manufactured goods, makes it impossible to give explicit account of this part of capital in the diagram. The present note tries to follow the rather complex course of changes the treatment of this quantity of fodder – â€œla nourriture des bestiauxâ€ – <b>underwent</b> <b>through</b> the <b>different</b> versions of the tableau, from the first â€œeditionâ€ of 1758 to the Formule of 1767 : Quesnay’s puzzling remarks on population in the first two â€œeditionsâ€, the introduction of interests on original advances in the third, the suppression of fodder in L’Ami des Hommes, its final accounting outside the tableau in Philosophie rurale and in the Analyse de la Formule. Several obscure passages in Quesnay’s notes to the tableau are thus clarified and a better understanding of its general evolution made possible. ...|$|R
