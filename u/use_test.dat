5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to <b>use</b> <b>test</b> results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and embryonic stem cells.|$|E

25|$|Donal Nolan {{has argued}} that to {{consider}} Rylands as part of private nuisance is unsound. Private nuisance requires the claimant to {{have an interest in}} land, while Rylands does not; although exceptions to this rule have occasionally been made in private nuisance, in Hunter v Canary Wharf Ltd, the House of Lords ruled that to make exceptions would transform nuisance from a tort against land to a tort against the person, and should not be permitted. John Murphy, Professor of Common Law at the University of Manchester, agrees with Nolan, and makes the additional point that nuisance is focused on a loss of enjoyment to land, not physical damage as Rylands is. It has also been concerned that the reasonable <b>use</b> <b>test,</b> which appears in nuisance, is not 9 to cases brought under Rylands.|$|E

2500|$|The Codex Alimentarius Code of Hygienic Practice for Milk {{notes that}} milk {{pasteurization}} {{is designed to}} achieve at least a 5 log10 reduction of Coxiella burnetii. [...] The Code also notes that: “The minimum pasteurization conditions are those having bactericidal effects equivalent to heating every particle of the milk to 72°C for 15 seconds (continuous flow pasteurization) or 63°C for 30 minutes (batch pasteurization)” and that “To ensure that each particle is sufficiently heated, the milk flow in heat exchangers should be turbulent, i.e. the Reynolds number should be sufficiently high.” [...] The point about turbulent flow is important because simplistic laboratory studies of heat inactivation that <b>use</b> <b>test</b> tubes, without flow, will have less bacterial inactivation than larger scale experiments that seek to replicate conditions of commercial pasteurization.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis has been about {{automated}} <b>testing</b> in practice. <b>Using</b> <b>testing</b> tools is quite common phenomenon in software companies. A questionnaire about the <b>use</b> of <b>testing</b> tools in software quality assurance to investigate Norwegian software companies has been made. The questionnaire has been sent out {{to a number of}} Norwegian IT/software and non-IT/software companies to get feedback on their <b>use</b> of <b>testing</b> tools for projects and product development. Four interviews have been conducted {{to find out more about}} the real life practice of <b>using</b> <b>testing</b> tools in different companies. Quantitative Analysis has been used on the responses from the questionnaire and each response from the questionnaire have been statistically analyzed. The statistical analysis of the responses shows the percentage of how many people are <b>using</b> <b>testing</b> tools and why, who are still solely dependent on manual testing and why and how the software quality assurance testings is done.

40|$|Objective: To compare {{commonly}} <b>used</b> <b>tests</b> for {{the diagnosis}} of apraxia. Measures: People with unilateral left hemisphere lesions, diagnosed with apraxia, were compared in their scoring on commonly <b>used</b> <b>tests</b> for apraxia (n = 17). Setting: Rivermead Rehabilitation Centre, Oxford, England, a specialist inpatient neurological unit. Results: Production moment correlations were low, or did not reach signicance level between three tests for ideomotor apraxia (r = 0. 46 p < 0. 05 one-tailed test, r = 0. 005 NS, r = – 0. 23 NS, df = 15). Six of the seventeen apraxic patients scored above cut-off point on one test, but below cut-off point on others, indicating that commonly <b>used</b> <b>tests</b> for apraxia may not be reliable for diagnosis if used singly. Internal consistency within tests was also variable (Cronbach’s a 0. 72, 0. 85, 0. 85). Conclusion: The commonly <b>used</b> <b>tests</b> for apraxia may identify different people as ‘apraxic’, possibly by eliciting different aspects of apraxia an...|$|R

Houghton Mifflin Co., the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated a {{temporary}} restraining order and preliminary injunction sought by the copyright holders of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind against Alice Randall's The Wind Done Gone. In determining whether Randall's work rose to the level of transformative, Circuit Judge Birch used the guidelines for transformative works laid out in the Supreme Court's Campbell v. Acuff Rose Music. Birch found Randall's work to be transformative because it [...] "provided social benefit, by shedding light on an earlier work, and, in the process, creating a new one." [...] Campbell had already established that the greater the transformative value a work held, the less important the other factors in the fair <b>use</b> <b>test</b> became. [...] Despite Randall and Houghton Mifflin having released The Wind Done Gone as a commercial work, and Randall having used a substantial portion of Mitchell's work in her own, Birch found that the highly transformative nature of Randall's book overcame the other prongs of the fair <b>use</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
