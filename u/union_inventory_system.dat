40|$|The {{implementation}} of the right <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> within a company is very essential considering {{that the cost of}} inventory is quite significant to the total costs that a company has to bear. Considering about this, the authors try to analyze the diesel?s <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> used in the logging division of PT XYZ in order to find out which <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> suits this company. Since the company has implemented two different <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> during the year 2003 and 2004, that are low and high <b>inventory</b> <b>system,</b> thus, the authors will analyze each of this system in order to find out the best system. Considering that each of the <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> occur in different situation, the authors will use the ideal <b>inventory</b> <b>system,</b> that is Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), as the basis to make the calculation. Moreover, the authors will also evaluate the {{implementation of}} EOQ once it is applied in the company, includes all of the costs that are following it. Through this research, hopefully the company will be able to choose the best <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> which will be able to give the most benefits for the company...|$|R
40|$|Abstract⎯We {{consider}} a two-echelon supply chain with two retailers and one supplier. The retailers are {{supplied by the}} supplier who makes all the decisions and bears all the inventory risk. Throughout this paper, we consider two different inventory systems: a reserved <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> and a pooled <b>inventory</b> <b>system.</b> With the reserved <b>inventory</b> <b>system,</b> the supplier keeps separate inventories for each retailer. In contrast, the pooled inventory is shared by the two retailers and the supplier makes the inventory decision based on the joint demand. Under different scenarios such as whether wholesale price is a decision variable, we study and analyze the supplier’s decisions in the reserved and the pooled <b>inventory</b> <b>systems.</b> In addition, we compare the profit of the supplier and retailers in the two different systems under normally distributed demands.

50|$|Development of more {{sophisticated}} computer scanning of inventory has allowed regular use of perpetual <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> by companies. According to the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), companies can use either perpetual <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> or periodic <b>inventory</b> systems.Perpetual inventory management {{is a system}} where store balances of inventory are recorded after every transaction. It {{eliminates the need for}} the store to close down constantly for inventory stock-taking as perpetual <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> allow for continuous stock-taking. Perpetual <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> keep a running account of the company's inventory.Perpetual <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> involve more record-keeping than periodic <b>inventory</b> <b>systems.</b> Every <b>inventory</b> item is kept on a separate ledger. These inventory ledgers contain information on cost of goods sold, purchases, and inventory on hand. Perpetual <b>inventory</b> management <b>systems</b> allow for a high degree of control of the company's inventory by management. Perpetual inventory management is generally used by companies who have the ability to scan the inventory items.|$|R

40|$|The {{main subject}} of the thesis is Food and Beverage <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> in Anak Depok Restaurant, Den Dolder, The Netherland. The writers have {{identified}} that the main problem from the <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> is not quite properly controlled. The establishment has limited <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> only for food and beverage materials due to its function as the turn over cycle. It appears that the daily uses of materials are not always checked, and until now {{there has not been}} any changes in the <b>inventory</b> <b>system.</b> By implementing a good <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> of food and beverage materials can make the daily uses of those materials easy to identify, especially when it is already in limited amount. The establishment is able to improve and complete the effectiveness of the materials' turn over. The writers attempt to analyze the <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> which will be advantageus for the restaurant itself. This involves several elements of principles of purchasing, stocks and stores procedures, the <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> itself. In analysing the problem on the stock inventory of food and beverage materials, the writers use the field analysis method, which is direct observation and interviewing the staffs who are responsible in handling the purchasing of food and beverage materials. This is also connected with the turn over of those materials used in daily operation of the restaurant. The result of this analysis is used to improve the effectiveness of food and beverage materials' storage and to solve the problems occured in the <b>inventory</b> <b>system.</b> The next step is to recommend a good <b>inventory</b> <b>system,</b> including proper stock control and punctual purchasing of food and beverage materials. The controlling action involves the inventory tracking record also the purchasing of food and beverage materials, so it can be evaluated and observed whether it is already effective or not besides to find whether the problems have been solved or not...|$|R
40|$|Customer {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} marketing tool. Effective customer segmentation helps the enterprises increase profits and improve customer service level. On the other hand, due to possible detrimental consequences, supply disruptions have been receiving more and more attention. This paper aims to investigate the effect of customer segmentation on a single-product <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> {{in the presence of}} supply disruptions. The concerned <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> involves an unreliable supplier, a retailer, and customers. The retailer adopts a continuous-review (s,S) inventory policy. Partial backordering is considered when stockouts occur. This <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> is simulated. Based on different customer backorder proportions, the effect of customer segmentation on the <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> is studied under different scenarios about supply disruption severity. The experimental results show that supply disruption duration {{is an important}} factor in influencing the effect of customer segmentation on the <b>inventory</b> <b>system.</b> Some managerial insights are also derived from the results. ...|$|R

3000|$|Since {{problems}} of stochastic <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> {{have a significant}} level of complexity, queueing approach {{has been applied to}} obtain a simple performance result. In this regard, Chao (1987) developed a Markov decision process model to describe the optimal control policy for an <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> with zero lead time and market interruptions. Gupta (1996) presented an exact cost function for a lost-sale (s, Q) <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> with Poisson demand, constant lead time, and exponentially distributed supplier’s on/off periods, while a similar paper was presented by Mohebbi (2003) in this context. He developed an analytical model for computing the stationary distribution of the on-hand inventory in a continuous review <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> with lost sales in which demands and lead times were stochastic. In the study, demand process was performed upon Poisson probability distribution function and replenishment lead time based on Erlang (E k [...]). Under a continuous-time Markov chain, the author assumed two available and unavailable states at any points of time. Moreover, a modified (s, Q) policy was applied for the <b>inventory</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Inventory</b> <b>systems</b> {{deal with}} any {{activities}} to manage inventory of raw materials, work in process, finished products, spares, and equipment. As uncertainty is an inherent part of the real world, during these processes, the formulated <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> should come up with uncertain data. Due to the capability of analyzing real situations, fuzzy <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> assist decision-making processes and provide {{a better understanding of}} the behavior of production and inventory environments. In this research, for the first time, a comprehensive literature review is conducted in the state-of-the-art of fuzzy inventory models where more than 120 papers are carefully and completely investigated according to the previous works. The fuzzy <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> that are based on the economic order/production quantity (EOQ/EPQ) settings are reviewed, so as to systematically analyze the fuzzy characteristics involved in capturing the uncertainty. Thereafter, to fill the identified gaps, two fuzzy EOQ models are developed. A fully fuzzy forward EOQ model for items with imperfect quality based on two different holding costs and learning considerations with triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) is extended. According to this model, the effect of learning and fuzziness on an <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|Although {{many studies}} have {{addressed}} the diagnosing and redesign of <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> in an industrial setting, the field of operations management seems to lack {{a thorough understanding of}} the process of shaping <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> in a health care setting. In this article, a contribution is made to fill this gap by exploring the process of reshaping a hospital <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> of medicines by means of an exploratory case study. In doing so, we concentrate on the question how the outcomes of this process are affected by the different stakeholders involved. Our case study indicates that decisions made during this reshaping process are heavily influenced by the dynamics of the relationships and interactions between the stakeholders involved in the project. Based on our case study there are also some strong indications especially in a health care setting, the existence of multiple stakeholders having a multi-goal focus regarding the <b>inventory</b> <b>system</b> can have a strong influence on the outcomes of inventory projects. For project managers {{it is important to be}} aware of these characteristics and circumstances in order to help health service organisations to develop and use <b>inventory</b> <b>systems</b> more effectively.
