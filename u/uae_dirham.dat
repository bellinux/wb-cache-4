50|$|Two notable examples, <b>U.A.E.</b> <b>Dirham</b> and Saudi Riyal {{interest}} rate swaps, are {{quoted in the}} inter-bank market as spreads to US dollar {{interest rate}} swaps. AED and SAR currency exchange rates are each pegged to the USD, hence their interest rate swap markets are highly correlated to the US interest rate swap market respectively. e.g. if the SAR IRS Spread for a 5-year maturity is quoted as +150 basis points and the USD 5 year IRS fixed rate is trading at 1.00%, where the IRS fixed payments are annual and the floating payments are quarterly LIBOR, then the SAR 5 year IRS fixed rate will be 2.50%.|$|E

5000|$|Britain {{left the}} Persian Gulf {{in the early}} part of 1971, having {{announced}} their intentions in 1968, causing Dubai and Abu-Dhabi, in conjunction with five other emirates to form the United Arab Emirates. Dubai and Abu-Dhabi ensured in the negotiations that between them they could control the country effectively, enabling even greater expansion as seen today. In 1973, Dubai joined the other emirates, in introducing the <b>UAE</b> <b>dirham,</b> the uniform currency of the UAE.Dubai and Abu Dhabi between them now hold the majority of control in the UAE, which was part of their conditions for joining. To enable this, Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only emirates who have veto power over matters of national importance, whereas the other emirates only have a vote on such matters. [...] In addition to this, Dubai is represented by eight members on the Federal National Council, of whom there are forty in total. [...] Dubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only two states who retain their own judicial courts, whilst the others are part of the federal justice system of the UAE.The Jebel Ali Free Zone was introduced in 1979, providing companies with unrestricted import of labour and export of capital, which helped to jumpstart the influx of global companies seen today.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of oil shocks on the real exchange rate of the United Arab Emirates (<b>UAE)</b> <b>dirham.</b> Time series data {{were used for the}} period 1977 to 2007 covering four important oil shocks. Five variables have been used in this study, with the real exchange rate of the dirham as the dependent variable and the gross domestic product per capita, oil price, trade balance, and foreign direct investment inflows as the independent variables. In this study we used the Johansen-Juselius cointegration procedure, and conducted the Granger causality tests based on the VECM. Through this research, we found that a fixed exchange rate to the U. S. dollar is not an appropriate exchange rate regime for the UAE. This is because when the price of oil increases, and with a fixed exchange rate regime, this would lead to rapid growth in GDP and liquidity in the UAE economy. This in turn causes domestic prices to increase, which results in high levels of inflation. ...|$|E
