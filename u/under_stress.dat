5|$|McClintock {{was widely}} {{credited}} with discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered {{the process in}} bacteria, yeast, and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition. In the 1970s, Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons. Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase, which {{is required for the}} element to move within the genome. Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac. Spm has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed <b>under</b> <b>stress,</b> such as by irradiation or the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, Ac/Ds is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundBacterial {{nucleoid}} {{consists of}} genome DNA, RNA, {{and hundreds of}} nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). Escherichia coli nucleoid is compacted towards the stationary phase, replacing most log-phase NAPs with the major stationary-phase nucleoid protein, Dps. In contrast, Staphylococcus aureus nucleoid sustains the fiber structures throughout the growth. Instead, the Dps homologue, MrgA, expresses <b>under</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> conditions to clump the nucleoid, but {{the composition of the}} clumped nucleoid was elusive. ResultsThe staphylococcal nucleoid <b>under</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> was isolated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and the proteins were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We identified 299 proteins in the nucleoid <b>under</b> oxidative <b>stress,</b> including 113 csNAPs (contaminant-subtracted NAPs). Comparison with the previously identified csNAPs in log- and stationary phase indicated that one fifth of the csNAPs <b>under</b> oxidative <b>stress</b> were the constitutive nucleoid components; importantly, several factors including HU, SarA, FabZ, and ribosomes were sustained <b>under</b> oxidative <b>stress.</b> Some factors (e. g.
