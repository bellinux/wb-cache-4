50|$|Chemical {{filters are}} {{generally}} used in combination {{in order to}} get sufficient protection against UV. They protect humans from the serious effects of UV radiation by absorbing, reflecting or scattering it. The reflection and scattering effecst are done by physical <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> which are inorganic <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> such as titaniumdioxide (TiO2) and zinc oxide (ZnO). Absorption is accomplished by organic <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> which are known as chemical <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> (mainly UVB).|$|R
50|$|<b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> are {{individual}} compounds or mixtures {{that block}} or absorb ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> light. <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> {{are used in}} sunscreens to protect skin or in photography to reduce the level of ultraviolet light that strikes the recording medium. <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> can undergo transformation into less protective or more toxic products. These transformation products can have health and environmental effects.|$|R
40|$|Human {{sperm cell}} {{function}} must be precisely regulated to achieve natural fertilization. Progesterone {{released by the}} cumulus cells surrounding the egg induces a Ca 2 + influx into human sperm cells via the CatSper Ca 2 +-channel and thereby controls sperm function. Multiple chemical <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> {{have been shown to}} induce a Ca 2 + influx through CatSper, thus mimicking the effect of progesterone on Ca 2 + signaling. We hypothesized that these <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> could also mimic the effect of progesterone on sperm function. We examined 29 <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> allowed in sunscreens in the US and/or EU for their ability to affect acrosome reaction, penetration, hyperactivation and viability in human sperm cells. We found that, similar to progesterone, the <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> 4 -MBC, 3 -BC, Meradimate, Octisalate, BCSA, HMS and OD-PABA induced acrosome reaction and 3 -BC increased sperm penetration into a viscous medium. The capacity of the <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> to induce acrosome reaction and increase sperm penetration was positively associated with the ability of the <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> to induce a Ca 2 + influx. None of the <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> induced significant changes in the proportion of hyperactivated cells. In conclusion, chemical <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> that mimic the effect of progesterone on Ca 2 + signaling in human sperm cells can similarly mimic the effect of progesterone on acrosome reaction and sperm penetration. Human exposure to these chemical <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> may impair fertility by interfering with sperm function, e. g. through induction of premature acrosome reaction. Further studies are needed to confirm the results in vivo...|$|R
25|$|Light {{scattered}} {{in a blue}} sky forms a characteristic pattern of partially polarized light which {{is dependent on the}} position of the sun and invisible to human eyes. With a UV receptor in each of the lens units of a compound eye, and a <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> oriented differently in each of these units, a bee is able to detect this polarization pattern. A small piece of blue sky is enough for a bee to recognize the pattern changes occurring {{over the course of a}} day. This provides not only directional but also temporal information.|$|E
25|$|A {{black light}} {{may also be}} formed by simply using a <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> coating such as Wood's glass on the {{envelope}} of a common incandescent bulb. This was the method {{that was used to}} create the very first black light sources. Although incandescent black light bulbs are a cheaper alternative to fluorescent tubes, they are exceptionally inefficient at producing UV light since most of the light emitted by the filament is visible light which must be blocked. Due to its black body spectrum, an incandescent light radiates less than 0.1% of its energy as UV light. Incandescent UV bulbs, due to the necessary absorption of the visible light, become very hot during use. This heat is, in fact, encouraged in such bulbs, since a hotter filament increases the proportion of UVA in the black-body radiation emitted. This high running-temperature drastically reduces the life of the lamp, however, from a typical 1000 hours to around 100 hours.|$|E
2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the processed image by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>filters</b> {{are used}} widely in cosmetics, plastics, {{adhesives}} and other industrial products to protect human skin or products against direct exposure to deleterious UV radiation. With growing usage and mis-disposition of <b>UV</b> <b>filters,</b> they currently represent {{a new class}} of contaminants of emerging concern with increasingly reported adverse effects to humans and other organisms. Exposure to <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> induce various endocrine disrupting effects, as revealed by increasing number of toxicological studies performed in recent years. It is necessary to compile a systematic review on the current research status on endocrine disrupting effects of <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> toward different organisms. We therefore summarized the recent advances on the evaluation of the potential endocrine disruptors and the mechanism of toxicity for many kinds of <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> such as benzophenones, camphor derivatives and cinnamate derivatives...|$|R
40|$|Many {{substances}} {{related to}} human activities {{end up in}} wastewater and accumulate in sewage sludge. The present study focuses on the analysis of widely used <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> 3 -(4 -methylbenzylidene) camphor (4 -MBC), octyl-methoxycinnamate (OMC), octocrylene (OC) and octyl-triazone (OT) in sewage sludge originating from a monitoring network in Switzerland. Mean concentrations in stabilised sludge from 14 wastewater treatment plants were 1780, 110, 4840 and 5510 μg/kg dry matter for 4 -MBC, OMC, OC and OT, respectively. Specific loads in sewage sludge show that <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> originate mainly from private households, but surface runoff and industries may be considered as additional sources. This indicates that besides use for sunscreens and cosmetics <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> might occur in plastics and other materials and be released to the environment by volatilization or leaching. Differences between the modeled per capita loads of <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> in sewage sludge and the observed specific loads in sewage sludge are probably due to erroneous figures of production volumes, degradation and sorption during wastewater treatment as well as degradation processes during transport in the sewer or sludge treatment. Thus, {{further research is needed}} to elucidate the fate of <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> after application and release into the environment. Other compounds used as <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> should be included in future studies...|$|R

40|$|Benzophenones (BPs) are a {{class of}} widely used <b>UV</b> <b>filters,</b> which have been {{frequently}} detected within multiple environmental matrices. Disinfection is a necessary process in water treatment processes. The transformation behaviors and toxicity changes of 14 BP-type <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> during chlorination disinfection treatment were investigated in this study. A new index, the acute toxicity formation potential, was proposed to evaluate the toxicity changes and potential risks of BP-type <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> during chlorination treatment. It was found that 13 of 14 BP-type <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> exhibited toxicity decreases in the chlorination disinfection process, more or less, while one showed a toxicity increase. The toxicity changes were dependent on substitution effects, such that 2, 4 -di-hydroxylated or 3 -hydroxylated BPs exhibited significant toxicity decreases after chlorination treatment due to the ready cleavage of the aromatic ring. Importantly, the acute toxicity changes could be duplicated in an ambient water matrix...|$|R

40|$|UV {{radiation}} {{is well known}} for its harmful effect on human health and can cause sunburn, premature skin aging and skin cancer. Both organic and inorganic compounds are being used in sunscreens as <b>UV</b> <b>filters.</b> From inorganic compounds TiO 2 and ZnO are the most used, but they can cause an unexpected photo-catalytic effect and damage the skin, while organic <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> can cause allergic reactions. Therefore one of the potential candidates as natural <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> in sunscreens are clays and clay minerals, due to their positive impact on human health and chemical inertness [4]. Recent research shows that clays have the UV protection ability due to their high specific surface area, therefore providing effective coverage of skin surface. The magnitude of UV protection depends on the clay mineralogical composition...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a <b>UV</b> <b>filtering</b> material of flexible polyester film containing a silver reflective coating was compared to the widely used <b>UV</b> absorbing <b>filters</b> that are almost colorless or have a strong yellow tint. The silver-coated polyester filters caused almost no distortion of color rendition when used as a filter for fluorescent lamps and provided greater protection of artifacts than did the almost colorless filters. The use of <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> of polyester film with a reflective silver coating is recommended when filters with a strong yellow tint distort color to an objectionable degree and yet greater protection of artifacts is desired than that afforded by almost colorless filters...|$|R

While typical clear float glass blocks ~45% of UV radiation, the addition of CeOx to glass has been shown to further reduce UV transmission as well as widespread use of organic UV blocking dyes in the production of acrylic substrates. Most soda-lime glass completely absorbs short wavelength UV-B radiation below 300 nm. Low-iron glass typically blocks ~12% of UV radiation between 300 and 380 nm.|$|R

5000|$|Normally, {{the glass}} or plastic {{of a camera}} lens is {{practically}} opaque to short-wavelength UV, but transparent to long-wavelength (near-visible) UV. A <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> passes all or {{nearly all of the}} visible spectrum but blocks virtually all ultraviolet radiation. (Most spectral manipulation filters are named for the radiation they pass; green and infrared filters pass their named colors, but a <b>UV</b> <b>filter</b> blocks UV.) It can be left on the lens for nearly all shots: UV filters are often used mainly for lens protection {{in the same way as}} clear filters. A strong <b>UV</b> <b>filter,</b> such as a Haze-2A or UV17, cuts off some visible light in the violet part of the spectrum, and has a pale yellow color; these strong filters are more effective at cutting haze, and can reduce purple fringing in digital cameras. [...] Strong UV filters are also sometimes used for warming color photos taken in shade with daylight-type film.While in certain cases, such as harsh environments, a protection filter may be necessary, there are also downsides to this practice.

Herein, we demonstrate significant reduction in the ROS concentration by encapsulating an antioxidant photostabilizer with multiple <b>UV</b> <b>filters</b> into biobased ethyl cellulose nanoparticles. The developed nanoparticles display complete broadband UV protection and can form transparent and flexible films.
