Existing technologies such as skin-mounted markers and fluoroscopy are limited either in accuracy or portability. The {{purpose of this study was}} to demonstrate a proof of concept for a wearable ultrasound (<b>US)</b> <b>sensor</b> array to measure bone positions around a human joint in vivo. A single off the shelf <b>US</b> <b>sensor</b> was tested for repeatability and accuracy in measuring soft tissue depth between a skin surface and imbedded bone with (a) a gelatinous analog for human tissue, and (b) a porcine leg specimen. In measuring the gel analog the sensor was able to measure depth with a repeatability of 0. 25 mm. In measuring the porcine leg specimen, measurement accuracy was compared to a Qualisys optical motion capture system with accuracy on the order of 0. 5 mm, and the US measurement error was found to be 1. 1 mm. This study demonstrates that low cost off the shelf US sensors have acceptable quality to measure bone positions accurately in vivo. Future work must focus on integration of multiple sensors in an array and assessment of factors that may decrease accuracy during dynamic activities. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

Ultrasound (US) provides poor image quality at a low cost and high frame rate. We propose an instance-based learning system to obtain {{the best of both}} worlds: high quality MR images at high frame rates from a low cost single-element <b>US</b> <b>sensor.</b> Concurrent US and MRI pairs are acquired during a relatively brief offline learning phase involving the US transducer and MR scanner. High frame rate, high quality MR imaging of respiratory organ motion is then predicted from US measurements, even after stopping MRI acqui-sition, using a probabilistic kernel regression framework.

Therefore, {{in order to use}} IR sensor for measuring distances accurately, prior knowledge of the surface must be known. This paper describes the Phong Illumination Model for determining the properties of a surface and subsequently calculating the distance to the surface. The angular position of the IR sensor is computed as normal to the surface for simplifying the calculation. Ultrasonic (<b>US)</b> <b>sensor</b> can provide the initial information on distance to obtain the parameters for this method. In addition, the experimental results obtained by using LabView are discussed. More care should be taken when placing the objects from the sensors during acquiring data since the small change in angle could show very different distance than the actual one. Since stereo camera vision systems do not perform well under some environmental conditions such as plain wall, glass surfaces, or poor lighting conditions, the IR and US sensors can be used additionally to improve the overall vision systems of mobile robots.

The major {{goal of this}} research is {{the development and implementation of}} an active control system for a quadrotor helicopter. However, one has to consider seriously the design aspect in order to get rid of the hardware limitations and achieve control simplification. Controlling a VTOL (Vertical Taking-Off and Landing) flying robot is basically dealing with highly unstable dynamics and strong axes coupling. In addition to this, any additional on-board sensor increases the robot total weight and therefore decreases its operation time. It is necessary to find a balance between on-board electronics and robot operation time. This paper focuses the development and implementation of an obstacle avoidance controller for this miniature flying robot using four ultra-sound (US) sensors for detecting obstacles and one <b>US</b> <b>sensor</b> for controlling its altitude. In order to facilitate the controller implementation, we developed a simulation tool in Matlab/Simulink using an accurate dynamic model of OS 4.

The participants send out US pulses while a central localization unit measures the Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDoA) between four <b>US</b> <b>sensors</b> {{to calculate the}} Angle-of-Arrival (AoA). The radio frequency (RF) transceiver of the sensor nodes enables distance measurements using TDoA (US vs. RF) in addition.

Several filter stages including Kalman-filtering minimize the number of outliers and fluctuations of the calculated distances and angles. Those computed polar coordinates (angle/distance) are converted into a Cartesian form and forwarded to a base station which is connected to a PC.

In this part, the above mentioned PF will be create by three autonomous robots, equipped by <b>US</b> <b>sensors,</b> which will cooperate and update the global potential map on the remote host [12]. The 2 nd part is beginning with the calculation of the environment’s 2 D mathematical model. The calculation is realized through the tresholding of the global potential map.

In further, the Artificial Error Field (AEF), which covers the entire workspace, will be calculated and the result will depend: on the sensory system of the mobile robot/robots; on the landmark arrangement. Actually the three-dimensional AEF contains the localization errors corresponding to each “x, y ” position of the mobile robot. In respect of the user defined maximal localization error (ε max), some navigation paths (NP) can be generated. These paths are the bases to the calculation of a map for the possible routes in form of directed and weighted graph. We select the route with minimal complexity between the start and docking positions on this graph. Each point of the mobile robot’s exact trajectory must fit within the selected navigation path.

40|$|Liquid {{composite}} moulding (LCM) {{processes are}} very sensitive to deviations in raw materials and process parameters. Small deviations can lead to different fill patterns with the risk of incomplete impregnation. Providing information about ongoing processes is therefore subject of major effort in research and industry. Ultrasonic (<b>US)</b> <b>sensors</b> are particularly well suited for process monitoring of LCM, as they are able to measure all of the most crucial parameters of the filling and also cure state. Furthermore they do not require direct contact to the part, thus the part surface and the mould vacuum integrity are not affected. The DLR has developed small and low cost ultrasound sensors allowing the integration of a dense sensor network. These sensors are relatively easy to integrate into the mould and provide a large spectrum of information in comparison to conventional transducers. The sensors are applied on the outer side of the mould, from where the sound waves propagate through the wall and then interact with the part. When the sound waves reach the mould-part-interface, most of the signal is reflected back while the remaining sound waves are transmitted into the part. Prior to flow front arrival the sound signal gets reflected completely. When the interface gets wetted the reflection amplitude starts to decrease until wetting is completed. Also the through-transmission signal can be used for resin arrival detection. Both methods work very robust with almost every mould material. After calibration the velocity of the flow front and its direction can be obtained through enhanced signal analysis. This information, which is provided by every single sensor, is very valuable for reconstructing the flow pattern. The method was evaluated in a transparent mould, where the impregnation progress was documented by video. From the video the flow front position, speed and direction in reference to the sensors was later analysed by image processing. The comparison of the sensor and video signal shows strong correlation.
