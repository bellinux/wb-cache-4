5|$|Based on spectroscopy, Saturn {{is thought}} to be similar in {{composition}} to Jupiter, but the other giant planets <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> have relatively less hydrogen and helium and relatively more ices and are thus now termed ice giants.|$|E
5|$|Because {{observations}} of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for Voyager 1 was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below {{the south pole}} of Saturn {{and out of the}} plane of the ecliptic, ending its planetary science mission. Had Voyager 1 failed or been unable to observe Titan, Voyager 2s trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the Titan flyby, precluding any visit to <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b> The trajectory Voyager 1 was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> but could have been altered to avoid a Titan flyby and travel from Saturn to Pluto, arriving in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Ice giants, <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> are {{primarily}} composed of low-boiling-point {{materials such as}} water, methane, and ammonia, with thick atmospheres of hydrogen and helium. They have a significantly lower mass than the gas giants (only 14 and 17 Earth masses).|$|E

5|$|The Solar System is {{subdivided}} {{into the inner}} planets, the asteroid belt, and the outer planets. The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The outer gas giant planets are Jupiter, Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b> Beyond Neptune lies the Kuiper Belt, and finally the Oort Cloud, which may extend {{as far as a}} light-year.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{has eight}} known planets. This {{includes}} four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars), two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), and two ice giants (<b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune).</b> The Solar System also {{has at least}} five dwarf planets, an asteroid belt, numerous comets, {{and a large number}} of icy bodies which lie beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Acknowledging the problem, the IAU {{set about}} {{creating}} {{the definition of}} planet, and produced one in August 2006. The number of planets dropped to the eight significantly larger bodies that had cleared their orbit (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune),</b> and {{a new class of}} dwarf planets was created, initially containing three objects (Ceres, Pluto and Eris).|$|E

5|$|Planets are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} main types: large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials. Under IAU definitions, there are eight planets in the Solar System. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b> Six of the planets are orbited {{by one or more}} natural satellites.|$|E
5|$|The {{core region}} may be {{surrounded}} by dense metallic hydrogen, which extends outward to about 78% of the radius of the planet. Rain-like droplets of helium and neon precipitate downward through this layer, depleting the abundance of these elements in the upper atmosphere. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur on Jupiter, {{as well as on}} Saturn and ice giants <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b>|$|E
5|$|Astronomers hypothesized, {{based on}} its {{interior}} chemistry, that the comet formed in the <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> Oort cloud region of the Solar System. A comet which forms farther from the Sun {{is expected to have}} greater amounts of ices with low freezing temperatures, such as ethane, which was present in Tempel 1. Astronomers believe that other comets with compositions similar to Tempel 1 are likely to have formed in the same region.|$|E

The term cirrus is also used for certain interstellar clouds composed of sub-micrometer-sized dust grains.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and culminated {{at the start of the}} 20th with Percival Lowell's quest for PlanetX. Lowell proposed the PlanetX hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.|$|E
5|$|Outside Mars, Jupiter {{was first}} visited by Pioneer 10 in 1973. More than 20 years later Galileo sent a probe into the planet's atmosphere, {{and became the}} first {{spacecraft}} to orbit the planet. Pioneer 11 became the first spacecraft to visit Saturn in 1979, with Voyager 2 making the first (and so far only) visits to <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> in 1986 and 1989, respectively. The first spacecraft to leave the solar system was Pioneer 10 in 1983. For a time it was the most distant spacecraft, but it has since been surpassed by both Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet from the Sun and {{the largest in the}} Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but {{two and a half times}} that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E
50|$|With the dim planets <b>Uranus,</b> <b>Neptune</b> <b>and</b> dwarf planet Pluto the {{visibility}} of such an event is difficult, because of the low elongation from Sun.|$|R
5000|$|Signs of {{detriment}} for the non-visible planets <b>Uranus,</b> <b>Neptune</b> <b>and</b> Pluto are not {{firmly established}} or as widely applied {{as those of}} the seven classical planets.|$|R
50|$|Well {{before the}} {{discovery}} of the first TNO, it was suggested that interaction between giant planets and a massive disk of small particles would, via angular-momentum transfer, make Jupiter migrate inwards <b>and</b> make Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> especially <b>Neptune</b> migrate outwards. During this relatively short period of time, Neptune's resonances would be sweeping the space, trapping objects on initially varying heliocentric orbits into resonance.|$|R
5|$|Modern {{computer}} simulations show the Kuiper belt {{to have been}} strongly influenced by Jupiter and Neptune, and also suggest that neither Uranus nor Neptune could have formed in their present positions, because too little primordial matter existed at that range to produce objects of such high mass. Instead, these planets are estimated to have formed closer to Jupiter. Scattering of planetesimals early in the Solar System's history would have led to migration of the orbits of the giant planets: Saturn, <b>Uranus,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> drifted outwards, whereas Jupiter drifted inwards. Eventually, the orbits shifted {{to the point where}} Jupiter and Saturn reached an exact 1:2 resonance; Jupiter orbited the Sun twice for every one Saturn orbit. The gravitational repercussions of such a resonance ultimately destabilized the orbits of <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> causing them to be scattered outward onto high-eccentricity orbits that crossed the primordial planetesimal disc. While Neptune's orbit was highly eccentric, its mean-motion resonances overlapped and the orbits of the planetesimals evolved chaotically, allowing planetesimals to wander outward as far as Neptune's 1:2 resonance to form a dynamically cold belt of low-inclination objects. Later, after its eccentricity decreased, Neptune's orbit expanded outward toward its current position. Many planetesimals were captured into and remain in resonances during this migration, others evolved onto higher-inclination and lower-eccentricity orbits and escaped from the resonances onto stable orbits. Many more planetesimals were scattered inward, with small fractions being captured as Jupiter trojans, as irregular satellites orbiting the giant planets, and as outer belt asteroids. The remainder were scattered outward again by Jupiter and in most cases ejected from the Solar System reducing the primordial Kuiper belt population by 99% or more.|$|E
5|$|Based on estimations of the {{primordial}} mass required to form <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> {{as well as}} bodies as large as Pluto (see below), earlier models of the Kuiper belt had suggested {{that the number of}} large objects would increase by a factor of two beyond 50AU, so this sudden drastic falloff, known as the Kuiper cliff, was unexpected, and to date its cause is unknown. In 2003, Bernstein, Trilling, et al. found evidence that the rapid decline in objects of 100km or more in radius beyond 50AU is real, and not due to observational bias. Possible explanations include that material at that distance was too scarce or too scattered to accrete into large objects, or that subsequent processes removed or destroyed those that did. Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University claimed that the gravitational attraction of an unseen large planetary object, perhaps the size of Earth or Mars, might be responsible.|$|E
5|$|Every planet {{began its}} {{existence}} {{in an entirely}} fluid state; in early formation, the denser, heavier materials sank to the centre, leaving the lighter materials near the surface. Each therefore has a differentiated interior consisting of a dense planetary core surrounded by a mantle that either is or was a fluid. The terrestrial planets are sealed within hard crusts, but in the giant planets the mantle simply blends into the upper cloud layers. The terrestrial planets have cores of elements such as iron and nickel, and mantles of silicates. Jupiter and Saturn {{are believed to have}} cores of rock and metal surrounded by mantles of metallic hydrogen. <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune,</b> which are smaller, have rocky cores surrounded by mantles of water, ammonia, methane and other ices. The fluid action within these planets' cores creates a geodynamo that generates a magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|Of {{the eight}} planets in the Solar System, only Venus and Mars lack such a {{magnetic}} field. In addition, the moon of Jupiter Ganymede also has one. Of the magnetized planets {{the magnetic field}} of Mercury is the weakest, and is barely able to deflect the solar wind. Ganymede's magnetic field is several times larger, and Jupiter's is the strongest in the Solar System (so strong in fact that it poses a serious health risk to future manned missions to its moons). The magnetic fields of the other giant planets are roughly similar in strength to that of Earth, but their magnetic moments are significantly larger. The magnetic fields of <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> are strongly tilted relative the rotational axis and displaced from {{the centre of the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|The planets {{scattered}} {{the majority}} of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards. This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward. Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud; those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc. This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass. Some of the scattered objects, including Pluto, became gravitationally tied to Neptune's orbit, forcing them into mean-motion resonances. Eventually, friction within the planetesimal disc made the orbits of <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> circular again.|$|E
5|$|Titan was {{examined}} by both Voyager 1 and 2 in 1980 and 1981, respectively. Voyager 1s trajectory {{was designed to}} provide an optimized Titan flyby, during which the spacecraft was able to determine the density, composition, and temperature of the atmosphere, and obtain a precise measurement of Titan's mass. Atmospheric haze prevented direct imaging of the surface, though in 2004 intensive digital processing of images taken through Voyager 1s orange filter did reveal hints of the light and dark features now known as Xanadu and Shangri-la, which had been observed in the infrared by the Hubble Space Telescope. Voyager 2, {{which would have been}} diverted to perform the Titan flyby if Voyager 1 had been unable to, did not pass near Titan and continued on to <b>Uranus</b> <b>and</b> <b>Neptune.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first inner {{satellite}} {{to be observed}} was Amalthea, discovered by E. E. Barnard in 1892. Next were the Saturnian moons Epimetheus and Janus, observed in 1966. These two moons share the same orbit, and the resulting confusion over their status was not resolved until the Voyager 1 flyby in 1980. Most of the remaining inner satellites were discovered by spacecraft Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 during their flybys of Jupiter (1979), Saturn (1980), <b>Uranus</b> (1986) <b>and</b> <b>Neptune</b> (1989).|$|R
