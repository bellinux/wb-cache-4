50|$|The {{entrance}} proceeds through boulders {{towards the}} <b>upper</b> <b>traverse,</b> a wide bedding-plane angled 40 degrees downwards. Further passage takes the caver downwards towards the canyon. The lower levels are accessed via pitches and climbs, including Primrose Pot, which at 57 m {{is one of}} the deepest vertical pitches on the Mendips.|$|E
50|$|Ship Creek is an Alaskan {{river that}} {{flows from the}} Chugach Mountains into Cook Inlet. The Port of Anchorage {{at the mouth of}} Ship Creek gave its name ("Knik Anchorage") to the city of Anchorage that grew up nearby. The river lies entirely within the limits of the Municipality of Anchorage, Alaska. Most of its <b>upper</b> length <b>traverses</b> Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.|$|R
50|$|The {{area between}} Sumps 1 and 2, Stoke 2, {{contains}} {{a number of}} highly decorated chambers including the <b>Upper</b> Grotto, <b>Traverse</b> Grotto and the Throne Room which contains a 3 m high stalactite boss named The King and a second stalactite, 2 m high, named The Queen after Queen Victoria. The once-spectacular formations in the Princess Grotto have suffered damage since the cave was discovered. When the Bone Chamber, which is not decorated, was found it contained a number of human and animal bones, along with ash and charcoal.|$|R

Well, {{considering}} Singapore's dense traffic, which road is not? Upper Thomson is swamped with traffic lights and loaded with road signs and intersections. ...|$|R
50|$|The Beas River, {{on which}} the Pong Dam is located, {{is one of the}} five major rivers of the Indus basin. The river flows from the Beas Kund near Rohtang Pass, in the <b>upper</b> Himalayas, and <b>traverses</b> {{generally}} in a north-south direction until Largi, from where it turns sharply at nearly a right angle and flows in a westerly direction up to the Pong Dam. The river traverses a total length of about 116 km from the source to the Pong Dam.|$|R
50|$|Tram 49 is {{operated}} by the Black Country Living Museum. This double decker tram was originally built in 1909 for Wolverhampton Corporation Tramways. It is a typical Edwardian tramcar with an ornate lower saloon and open <b>upper</b> deck with <b>traverse</b> seating. Originally equipped with the Lorain system taking its power supply from studs in the road, it was later converted to run from overhead wires. Preserved in 1976, the tram was painstakingly restored by the Black Country Museum Transport Group over many years and completed in 2004.|$|R
50|$|The {{upper reaches}} of Arroyo Valle stretch into northeastern Santa Clara County where the mainstem is formed by the {{confluence}} of San Antonio Creek and Arroyo Bayo. San Antonio Creek's origin is on the western slope of 3804 ft Mount Stakes, west of the Santa Clara-Stanislaus County border, about 32 mi southeast of Livermore. San Antonio Creek traverses the San Antonio Valley as it heads west to Arroyo Valle. Arroyo Bayo also has its origin on Mount Stakes southwestern slope and <b>traverses</b> <b>Upper</b> San Antonio Valley as it also heads west to Arroyo Valle.|$|R
50|$|The valley descends in a northwestern {{direction}} from the watershed between the Rhine and the Thur, and is enclosed on the northeast by the chain of the Säntis (8216 ft) and on the southwest by that of the Churfirsten (7566 ft) and of the Speer (6411 ft). It is a fertile valley of about 45 km in length from {{the source of the}} river to Wil on the railway line between Winterthur and St. Gallen. The <b>upper</b> half is <b>traversed</b> by an excellent road, while from Nesslau there is a railway to Wil (155 m).|$|R
50|$|The Pambar River {{originates}} in the Anaimudi Hills and {{is joined by}} seasonal rivulets and a few perennial streams originating from sholas in the <b>upper</b> reaches. It <b>traverses</b> the Turner’s Valley in Eravikulam National Park and flows down into the sanctuary through the Taliar Valley between Kanthalloor and Marayoor villages and eastwards through the sanctuary. It joins the Chinnar River at Koottar. The Thoovanam water falls lie deep within the sanctuary on the Pambar River. This cascade is a major tourist attraction. The Chinnar, Pambar, Kabani and Bhavani are the only rivers of the 44 in Kerala that flow eastwards.|$|R
5000|$|The upper fort (fort supérieure) is 200 m {{above the}} lower fort. Its {{location}} allows the upper fort {{to control the}} valley, including the railroad viaduct, {{and to protect the}} lower fort. It was built between 1834 and 1848.Today, the lower fort and the subterranean steps and casemates cut into the rock above it, up to and including terraces just below the upper fort, are open during the summer months for visiting, however the upper fort is not currently safe for visitors. [...] Furthermore, a moderately difficult (AD) via ferrata exists which takes climbers from the lower fort to the <b>upper</b> fort by <b>traversing</b> the rocky hillside. In addition, there are many hiking trails in the area which allow hikers access to the upper fort.|$|R
40|$|In my {{previous}} paper, I discussed the U. S. statute, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), {{which has the}} so-called "risk-based" structure. This time, I focused on the <b>upper</b> system which <b>traversed</b> statutes, for instance, a control by the Executive Office, and extracted {{the characteristics of the}} system. The most notable features were the regulatory peer-review and the concept of the "scientific integrity". I attempted to contrive the legal significance of the risk assessment, by analyzing the regulatory peer-review and the concept of the "scientific integrity". Moreover, I discussed the relationship between the risk assessment and the administrative discretion using the concepts in "Science, Technology and Society (STS) ", for example, "science in operation". In conclusion, there was considerably limited discretion for the administrative agencies on risk assessment...|$|R
25|$|NY243 {{has been}} realigned in two {{locations}} {{since it was}} assigned. In the town of Rushford, the highway was originally routed through the hamlet of Rushford, using Buffalo and Main streets and the southern half of <b>Upper</b> Street to <b>traverse</b> the community. Plans for a bypass of Rushford were drawn up by the state as early as 1961, when the realignment was proposed {{as part of a}} larger effort to improve all of NY243 between the hamlets of Rushford and Caneadea. The project would also lessen the number of curves and eliminate high grades along the highway. It was completed sometime between 1963 and 1976. During the same period, NY98 was reconfigured near the west end of NY243 to intersect the latter at a new junction in Freedom, located just northeast of their original intersection in Farmersville. NY243 was truncated to end at the new junction while the route's former routing into Farmersville became part of NY98.|$|R

5000|$|The quarry is {{laid out}} in four main sections. Above Ardbrugh Road lie three valleys. The Far East Valley is private property, {{occupied}} by a small [...] "gated community", and closed to climbing; the East Valley which contains many important climbs; and the West Valley, which also contains many important climbs. Between the East and West valleys is a broad ridge along which the quarry railway used to run; this is used {{to gain access to}} the Upper Tier, which contains the quarry's highest cliffs. The <b>Upper</b> Tier is <b>traversed</b> by a tarmac path leading to the Killiney Hill car-park at one end, and a set of steps leading to the top of the hill at the other end; the path and steps are popular with strollers. The hilltop path follows a wall which skirts the top of the cliffs, and passes an old signalling tower which was used by the British military to signal to the neighbouring Martello towers during the 19th century.|$|R
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} via: [URL] Copyright Royal Astronomical Society [Full text {{of this article is}} not {{available}} in the UHRA]We present simultaneous UBVRIJK observations of the intermediate polar PQ Gem (RE J 0751 + 14) obtained on 1993 February 18 and 19 using the Hatfield Polarimeter on UKIRT. The light curves show double- peaked modulation on the spin period at the longer wavelengths and become single-peaked at the shorter wavelengths. Both positive and negative circular polarizations are detected on the spin period in the V to K bands, confirming previous observations by Piirola, Hakala & Coyne and suggesting emission from two magnetic poles. We present model light curves of cyclotron emission from opposite poles of a centred inclined magnetic dipole. Optimal results are obtained for an inclination of ~ 60 deg and a magnetic dipole offset of ~ 30 deg. Our model of cyclotron emission from two extended arc-shaped accretion shock regions explains the dip in the negative polarization as absorption or scattering of the cyclotron radiation by the accretion column. This occurs when the accretion region in the <b>upper</b> hemisphere <b>traverses</b> the line of sight. A wavelength- independent intensity minimum occurs half of a spin cycle later when this region passes over the limb on the white dwarf. This model is inverted with respect to that proposed by Piirola et al. and Vath et al., and is more consistent with the X-ray observations. The arcs are placed ahead of the magnetic poles, and we argue that {{this is consistent with the}} recently reported spin-down of this system. Our best estimate of the magnetic field at the pole is B_ 0 ~ 9 - 21 MG, depending on the optical depth parameter used...|$|R
