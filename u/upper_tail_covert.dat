5000|$|Like {{members of}} the Pavo genus, the Congo peafowl are omnivores with a diet {{consisting}} mainly of fruits and insects. In Salonga National Park, its diet is taxonomically narrower in secondary forest than in primary forest. The male has a similar display {{to that of other}} species of peafowl, though the Congo peacock actually fans its tail feathers while other peacocks fan their <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>covert</b> feathers. The Congo peafowl is monogamous, though detailed mating information from the wild is still needed. The peacock of the species has a high-pitched [...] "gowe" [...] calling noise while the peahen emits a low [...] "gowah". They have loud duets consisting of [...] "rro-ho-ho-o-a" [...] from both sexes.|$|E

50|$|The {{fairy pitta}} has a body length of 16-19.5 cm and is easily discernable for its plumage of seven {{different}} colors {{reminiscent of a}} rainbow. Its back and wing bows are green, scapulars (shoulders) and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are green and cobalt. There is a blue rump on <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> The <b>tail</b> is dark green with a cobalt tip, and the tarsi (legs) are yellowish brown.|$|R
50|$|Measuring 9 cm (3.5 in) and {{weighing}} 7 to 8 g, the scarlet-backed flowerpecker {{is a small}} bird with a short tail. It exhibits sexual dimorphism. The male has a navy blue face, wings and tail, with a broad bright red stripe from its crown to its <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> The female is predominantly olive green with a black <b>tail</b> and scarlet <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> and rump. Both sexes have creamy white underparts, black eyes and legs, and a dark grey arched bill. The juvenile has plumage similar to the female but has an orange bill and lacks the bright red rump.|$|R
50|$|The {{bar-breasted firefinch}} {{with a red}} head and breast and white barring or speckling on the breast. The forehead, lores and {{supercilium}} are deep red fading on the ear coverts, chin, throat and neck sides to less intensely red colour. The crown {{and most of the}} upperparts are greyish briwn and rather uniform contrasting with deep red lower rump and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> <b>Tail</b> is darker brown than back with variable amounts of red near the base. Flight feathers are dark. The underparts below the crimson breast are buffy grey. Juveniles are much duller with red being confined to the rump and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> 11cm in length.|$|R
50|$|It may be {{identified}} by the buff underside, smaller beak than in Sitta cashmirensis (Kashmir nuthatch). The white on the <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> {{is difficult to see}} in the field. It has a small bill and rufous-orange underparts with unmarked bright rufous undertail-coverts.|$|R
50|$|A {{species with}} a similar {{appearance}} is the blue-winged pitta, which {{is larger than the}} fairy pitta. The blue-winged pitta has buff crown sides and supercilia, rather than the chestnut of the fairy pitta, brighter <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts,</b> darker yellowish brown belly, and vivid blue on upper wing coverts.|$|R
50|$|The {{green peafowl}} {{differs from the}} Indian peafowl in that the male has green and gold plumage and black wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike the Indian peafowl, the green peahen {{is similar to the}} male, only having shorter <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts,</b> a more coppery neck, and overall less iridescence.|$|R
5000|$|The male {{is mainly}} grey above and white below {{except for the}} upper breast, which is grey like the upperparts, and the rump, which is white; the wings are grey with black wingtips. The female is brown above with white <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts,</b> hence females, and the similar juveniles, are often called [...] "ringtails". Their underparts are buff {{streaked}} with brown.|$|R
5|$|The {{juvenile}} {{resembles the}} adult in plumage, but the areas {{corresponding to the}} adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|R
50|$|Measuring 13 to 14 cm, the white-rumped robin has black plumage {{with a white}} rump and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> It has white {{patches on}} its sides of its breast. The abdomen is white in the {{nominate}} subspecies and black with some white in the subspecies vicarius. The female closely resembles the male, but its black feathers have brown tinges. The bill and feet are black, and the eyes are dark brown.|$|R
50|$|The {{nominate}} subspecies L. e. erythrophthalma {{is found}} in mainland Malaysia and Sumatra while L. e. pyronota occurs in Borneo. The male of the latter subspecies is a greyer bird, with black and white vermiculations, and steel blue <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> The crestless fireback is a shy bird and seldom seen; it inhabits undergrowth in lowland rainforests, and also secondary growth forest in Malaysia, up to altitudes of about 300 m.|$|R
50|$|The {{juvenile}} {{resembles the}} adult in plumage, but the areas {{corresponding to the}} adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly {{be confused with the}} juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.|$|R
50|$|The male C. p. rothschildi differs in {{that the}} breast is green {{streaked}} with yellow, the dark spot on the crown is larger and extends forward to the eye and fades backwards into the green mantle. The <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are washed with yellow and the belly is dark purple. The female has a wide green breast band streaked with yellow and a greenish-yellow patch {{on the side of}} the rump.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} male of {{the western}} form O. h. hispanica of the Iberian peninsula and north Africa has the forehead and crown white or nearly white, the mantle buff, and the wings blacker {{than those of the}} northern wheatear. The underparts are white tinged with buff. The back, <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> and most of the tail are white. The ear coverts and a line from the bill, and sometimes the throat, are black.|$|R
5000|$|The Puna teal is 19 in long, {{similar in}} size to a wood duck. They have a black cap that extends to below the eyes. Their lower face and neck are creamy white. Their <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are gray, and their rear flanks are dark brown with thin stripes. Back, chest and lower flanks are light coffee with dark brown spots. Their bill is large, light blue with a black line down the middle ...|$|R
50|$|Resplendent quetzals have a {{green body}} (showing {{iridescence}} from green-gold to blue-violet) and red breast. Their green <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> hide their <b>tails</b> and in breeding males are particularly splendid, being {{longer than the}} rest of the body. The primary wing coverts are also unusually long and give a fringed appearance. The male has a helmet-like crest. The bill, which is partly covered by green filamentous feathers, is yellow in mature males and black in females.|$|R
5000|$|The Indian peacock has {{iridescent}} {{blue and}} green plumage. The peacock [...] "tail," [...] known as a [...] "train," [...] consists not of tail quill feathers, but highly elongated <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> These feathers are marked with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. Both sexes of all species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger to her young.|$|R
50|$|The Uhehe fiscal is a slender, {{black and}} white bird growing to about 20 cm. The sexes are similar. The upper parts are dull black, with a white {{supercilium}} and white scapulars. The back, rump and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are dark grey, and the long tail is black. All the tail feathers except the two central ones have white spots. The wings are black except for a small white patch. The underparts are whitish, sometimes washed with buff. It could {{be confused with the}} southern fiscal, but its colouration is distinctly darker and it occurs at higher elevations.|$|R
50|$|Measuring 20 - 22.5 cm (9 in), the red-backed {{kingfisher}} has a streaked {{green and}} white crown, bluish-green wings and tail, and lower back, rump and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> chestnut with white breast, abdomen and nape. It has a black band stretching from the bill, through the eyes and to the ear coverts. The female is duller overall in coloration. The iris is dark brown and the legs and feet dark grey. Immature birds have speckling on their breasts. The call is a descending whistle, with a harsh alarm call given by birds near the nest.|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is particularly}} {{apparent in the}} plumage of this species. Adult males are characterized by their overall pale grey plumage contrasting with black wingtips. Compared with other harriers this species has characteristic black bands along the secondaries, both {{above and below the}} wing and rusty streaks on belly and flanks. Adult females have a broadly similar plumage to that of pallid and hen harriers. The underparts are mostly pale yellow-brown, the belly with longitudinal stripes and the wing coverts spotted. The upper parts are uniform dark brown except for the white <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> ("rump"), and the sightly paler central wing coverts.|$|R
500|$|Distinctive markings, {{especially}} on its head, make the saxaul sparrow {{unlikely to be}} confused with any other bird. It is dull-coloured, with plumage ranging between dull grey and warm sandy brown, varying between and within subspecies. Birds of the subspecies ammodendri are a sandy grey, while nigricans birds are similar but darker, and stoliczkae birds are warm brown or russet. Birds of the subspecies stoliczkae and those from the southwest of the range of ammodendri also differ from usual ammodendri birds in their lack of streaking on the rump and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> [...] Birds in Mongolia have a larger and deeper bill and broad bluish streaks on their chest.|$|R
50|$|The female {{is mainly}} brown, {{but has a}} {{chestnut}} hind neck. The extent of the white spotting on the flanks varies substantially across the species' range {{and the depth of}} colour of the females similarly varies. The female has the upper plumage, wings and tail as in the male but the black is replaced by mottled brown and the brown bars on the lower back and tail are wider. Female is similar but dull with no cheek patch, and collar is replaced with a nuchal patch. Head and under parts are buff where the male shows black. Rump and <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> light brown.|$|R

50|$|The {{green avadavat}} is {{approximately}} 10 cm long with green above, yellow below, {{black and white}} bars on the flank and reddish bill. Both sexes have pale tips to wing-coverts and tertials. The upper plumage is olive green. The <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are more yellow and the tail is black and rounded with broad feathers. The chin is pale yellow and the lower breast, belly and vent are brighter yellow. The flanks are barred with brown and white. The bill is waxy red and the legs are pale fleshy or brown. The female is slightly paler than the male. Young birds are duller with a black bill and lack the barring on the flanks.|$|R
5|$|The {{upper parts}} are {{generally}} light greyish brown with dark brown centres to the feathers, giving {{the appearance of}} stripes. These stripes are marked {{on the head and}} nape, less distinct on the rump and almost absent from the <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> The underparts are whitish with faint streaks on the belly. The feathers of the upper breast and throat are long and pointed, giving the head a spiky appearance. The wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips. The bill is short, with a sharp pointed appearance, dark blue-grey grading to a grey-black at the tip and around the nostrils. Legs and feet are blue-grey with black claws. The bare skin around the eye is dark brown and the iris a dark black-brown.|$|R
50|$|The fairy lorikeet {{grows to}} {{a length of}} about 18 cm and weighs between 24 and 34 g. The male of the {{nominate}} subspecies, C. p. pulchella, has the head, nape, breast and underparts red, the breast sometimes being streaked with yellow. The back of the crown has a purplish spot. The mantle, back and wings are dark green, as are the <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> The <b>upper</b> side of the tail is green tipped with yellow and the central tail feathers are red towards their tips. The underside of the tail is yellow and the thighs are dark purple. The beak is orange and the eye yellowish-orange. The female is similar but the lower back is yellowish-green and {{the sides of the}} rump and flanks are yellow.|$|R
50|$|This {{slightly}} smaller-sized and shorter-billed coucal has a {{very long}} hind claw, the longest within the genus. The overall plumage, {{as in many other}} coucals, is of a blackish bird with a long tail and rufous wings. They have two plumages, a breeding plumage in which the head and upper back are glossy with dark shafts to the feather and a duller non-breeding plumage in which the feather shafts on the head and back are whitish. The wing coverts also have pale shafts showing as whitish streaks on the brown feathers. The central <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are barred and very long. The iris is darker brown and not the crimson red as in the greater coucal. Juveniles have black spots, bars and have a browner colour.|$|R
2500|$|Peafowl {{are best}} known for the male's extravagant display {{feathers}} which, despite actually growing from their back, are thought of as a tail. The [...] "train" [...] is in reality made up of the enormously elongated <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> The <b>tail</b> itself is brown and short as in the peahen. The colours result not from any green or blue pigments but from the micro-structure of the feathers and the resulting optical phenomena. The long train feathers (and tarsal spurs) of the male develop only after the second year of life. Fully developed trains are found in birds older than four years. In northern India, these begin to develop each February and are moulted at the end of August. The moult of the flight feathers may be spread out across the year.|$|R
50|$|Males have a golden-yellow crest {{with a hint}} of red at the tip. The face, throat, chin, and {{the sides}} of neck are rusty tan. The wattles and orbital skin are both yellow in colour, and the ruff or cape is light orange. The upper back is green {{and the rest of the}} back and rump is golden-yellow. The tertiaries are blue whereas the scapulars are dark red. Other {{characteristics}} of the male plumage are the central tail feathers, black spotted with cinnamon, as well as the tip of the tail being a cinnamon buff. The <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are the same colour as the central tail feathers. The male also has a scarlet breast, and scarlet and light chestnut flanks and underparts. Lower legs and feet are a dull yellow.|$|R
50|$|The sexes are similar. It {{measures}} 16-17 cm {{from bill}} tip to tail tip and weighs 28 g. The adult’s upper parts are grey, with the mantle and secondary feathers tinged brownish olive. The blackish lores and ear coverts {{are separated from}} the crown by a prominent white supercilium. The chin, throat, central breast, rump, <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> and outer <b>tail</b> feathers are orange. The breast plumage moults to a deeper orange in colour for the non-breeding season. The central tail feathers are greyish-brown, and obscures the bright rufous outer tail feathers when the tail is closed. The belly is pale grey to white, and the undertail coverts buffy. The short, black bill is fairly straight, but with a slightly down-curved upper mandible. The legs and feet are black, and the eye is brown.|$|R
5000|$|The plumage has bold {{contrasts}} of yellow, white, {{and black}} or gray. Males' head and underparts are solid yellow—light lemon in most populations, [...] "brilliant golden-orange" [...] (Howell and Webb 1995) in P. c. aurantiacus of Chiapas and Guatemala. The back is black with yellow mottlings, the rump is yellow, and the <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are black with white tips. The wings and tail are black with conspicuous white spots, patches, and wingbars. Females are similar but the upperparts are more olive, with dark streaks on the crown and back. Black {{is replaced by}} gray, and the white markings on the wings, especially the white base of the primaries, are smaller. Females are very similar in pattern to female flame-colored tanagers, but much bigger, especially as to the bill. Immatures resemble females overall.|$|R

40|$|Age and sex {{criteria}} are studied of 74 Starlings, 39 ♂ ♂ (14 first-year) and 35 ♀ ♀ (27 first-year), in March. Weight, bill length, wing length, lengths of the iridescent {{parts of the}} throat and breast feathers, lengths of the white tips on the breast and abdomen {{and the amount of}} black colour on the bill are treated quantitatively. Qualitatively treated are: gloss of the plumage, gloss on the lesser secondary coverts, gloss on the breast, pointedness of breast and abdominal feathers, length of the throat feathers, gloss {{on the end of the}} outer web of the secondaries, colour of the under wing coverts and form of the <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts.</b> Skull ossification was expected to be completed in March, but finding 7 birds with an incompletely ossified skull, this character has been included in our study...|$|R
50|$|The brown-breasted flycatcher is 13-14 cm {{in length}} and weighs between 10-14 g. The overall colour of the upperparts is olive brown. Some of the feather shafts are darker. The <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are {{brighter}} rufous as are {{the edges of the}} flight feathers. The tail feathers have rufous on the outer webs. The lores are pale and the eye ring is conspicuous. The chin and throat are white while the breast and sides of the body are pale brown. The middle of the body to the vent is buffy white. Submoustachial stripes are faint but mark the boundary of the pale chin while the legs and lower mandible are pale flesh coloured. The most similar species is the Asian brown flycatcher, which has black rather than pale legs. It was named by Layard after Muttu, his servant who brought him the specimen.|$|R
50|$|The chocolate-backed {{kingfisher}} has {{the typical}} stocky kingfisher shape with dark upper parts and pure white underparts. The head and hind neck are very dark brown, the mantle is brownish black, the back is black, the rump a brilliant iridescent blue, the <b>upper</b> <b>tail</b> <b>coverts</b> are black, and the tail is pale blue. The wings are dark, {{apart from a}} brilliant azure speculum formed in the outer webs of the secondary feathers. The underparts from the throat to the vent are snowy white, apart from a small blackish flank patch, and are clearly demarcated from the dark upper parts. In flight the brilliant blue rump and speculum are distinctive. The bill is red or reddish brown. Juveniles are similar to adults, except that the breast is scalloped and the bill is blackish with an orange tip.|$|R
