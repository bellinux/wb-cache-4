Encouraged to run for the Kentucky Senate by Combs' ally and successor, Ned Breathitt, Ford won the seat and served one four-year term before running for lieutenant governor in 1967. He was elected on a split ticket with Republican Louie B. Nunn. Four years later, Ford defeated Combs in an <b>upset</b> <b>in</b> the Democratic primary en route to the governorship.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the {{presented}} in this work research was determining the limiting conditions of <b>upsetting</b> <b>in</b> three-slide forging press (TSFP). The free upsetting process and <b>upsetting</b> process <b>in</b> cylindrical impression were analyzed. Design/methodology/approach: The assumed purpose was confirmed in experimental research. For the case of <b>upsetting</b> <b>in</b> cylindrical impression, the research of limiting upsetting coefficients were made for different diameters and impression lengths. Findings: The obtained results showed large variety of limiting upsetting ratio depending on the analyzed impression geometrical parameters. It was stated, that there are 3 phenomena limiting the <b>upsetting</b> process <b>in</b> the die. The main phenomenon is the bar upsetting outside the impression. The <b>upsetting</b> processes <b>in</b> the impression are limited also by bar buckling outside the impression and overlapping inside the impressionResearch limitations/implications: The results of research allowed for stating that, besides the process geometrical parameters, friction conditions and type of the formed material influenced the limiting <b>upsetting</b> coefficients <b>in</b> the cylindrical impression. It is purposeful to make the further research determining quantitative and qualitative dependencies between these factors. Practical implications: The obtained results are the basis for designing of forming processes in TSFP <b>in</b> which the <b>upsetting</b> dominates. Especially it considers the elongated forgings and elongated preforms with thickeningsOriginality/value: The influence of the impression geometrical parameters on the limiting upsetting coefficients for the case of <b>upsetting</b> <b>in</b> cylindrical impression in TSFP has been analyzed in details. The dependencies, which should be used during designing of <b>upsetting</b> processes <b>in</b> TSFP were determined...|$|R

5|$|The {{strain of}} dual careers and {{constant}} separation {{from his wife}} led to an extended breach in his marriage. The couple began separation proceedings in 1916, and separation by mutual consent was granted in 1919. In the period 1916–22, Nielsen often lived on Funen retreating to the Damgaard and Fuglsang estates, or worked as a conductor in Gothenburg. The period was one of creative crisis for Nielsen which, coinciding with World War I, would strongly influence his Fourth (1914–16) and Fifth symphonies (1921–22), arguably his greatest works according to Fanning. The composer was particularly <b>upset</b> <b>in</b> the 1920s when his long-standing Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen was unable to undertake publication {{of many of his}} major works, including Aladdin and Pan and Syrinx.|$|E

5|$|At age 18, {{playing in}} a limited role for HV71 during the 2010–11 season, Fast scored 16 points (seven goals, nine assists) in 36 games, with a +6 plus-minus, six penalty minutes and two power play goals, {{exceeded}} most observers' expectations. Fast credited playing alongside Johan Davidsson {{as part of the}} reason for his success and growth in confidence. He was held scoreless with a -3 plus-minute in three postseason games as the first-place HV71 was swept from the first round of the playoffs by Allmänna Idrottsklubben (AIK) in an <b>upset.</b> <b>In</b> the 2011–12 season, Fast had three multi-point games, including a career-high four assists and five points against AIK on October 4. That game started a streak of 10 points (one goal, nine assists) over six games, which continued to an October 20 match against Frölunda HC. However, Fast's season was cut short after he suffered a fractured ankle during a November 29 game against Brynäs IF. He missed three months as a result, but nevertheless recorded 16 points (five goals, 11 assists) in 21 games for the season, matching his Swedish Hockey League career high in points and establishing new career highs in assists and plus-minus (+9). He also scored two goals and one assist in five postseason games.|$|E
5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 {{when he finished}} third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind <b>upset</b> <b>in</b> the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{games into}} the 2010–11 season, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played. Along the way, the Spurs {{compiled}} a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career triple-double against the Golden State Warriors. 12 days later, {{in a game}} against the Portland Trail Blazers, Duncan became the 94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only Scottie Pippen (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA Playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being <b>upset</b> <b>in</b> the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.|$|E
