5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries are characterised by an <b>unusual</b> {{physical}} deformity; for example, Le Chiffre suffered haemolacria, causing his tear ducts to weep blood. Not all of {{the villains}} have <b>unusual</b> physical traits; Mathieu Amalric's Dominic Greene was depicted without such characteristics, instead being inspired by Tony Blair and Nicolas Sarkozy.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he became}} Emperor in 1434, Zara Yaqob was not crowned until 1436 at Axum, where he resided for three years. It was not <b>unusual</b> for Ethiopian rulers to {{postpone}} their coronation until later in their reigns.|$|E

5|$|An <b>unusual</b> crop is {{the growing}} of teazels around the River Isle near Chard on the heavy clay soils around Fivehead. These are used to provide a fine finish on worsteds and snooker table cloths.|$|E

5|$|Banksia caleyi, {{commonly}} known as the red lantern banksia or Caley's banksia, is a species of woody shrub of the family Proteaceae native to Western Australia.

First described by Scottish naturalist Robert Brown in 1830, Banksia caleyi was named in honour of the English botanist George Caley. No subspecies are recognised. It is one of three or four related species with hanging inflorescences, which is an <b>unusual</b> feature within the genus.|$|E
5|$|Barkley {{played the}} power forward position, but {{occasionally}} played small forward and center. He {{was known for}} his <b>unusual</b> build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his <b>unusual</b> combination of strength and agility.|$|E

5|$|Being Cristian Nemescu's last {{completed}} project, {{the film}} stars Mădălina Ghiţescu as Marilena and Gabriel Huian as Andrei. Originally, {{the film was}} intended to be used as an exercise, and was not supposed to be longer than seven minutes. In the end, the project evolved to an <b>unusual</b> length of 45minutes; the film's approach also turned from comedy to teenage love. Reception from the public was favorable – it impressed through its unitary view and the way the screenplay, picture and sound combine together into a new and organic way, by using innovative, <b>unusual</b> techniques.|$|E

5|$|Friday Night Lights is <b>unusual</b> {{for using}} actual {{locations}} rather than stage sets and sound stage. These factors together with reliance on filming hundreds of locals as extras, gives the series an authentic feel and look.|$|E
5|$|G. minor is <b>unusual</b> {{because it}} {{frequently}} is found with embryonic skeletons of the enantiornithine bird Gobipipus. These embryos have well-developed wings, which suggest {{they would be}} able to fly very soon after hatching, unlike most modern birds.|$|E
5|$|Green Wings plot {{revolves}} around {{the lives of the}} staff of the East Hampton Hospital Trust, a fictional NHS hospital with staff ranging from the slightly <b>unusual</b> to the completely surreal.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan's {{path through}} the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly <b>unusual.</b> Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also <b>unusual</b> in that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Sandy A similar {{storm in}} 2012 with an <b>unusual</b> and {{complicated}} track due to baroclinic interactions.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, an <b>unusual</b> form of {{asymmetric}} occipital condylar dysplasia {{was found}} in two Jacob lambs; a possible link to the multi-horn trait has been suggested.|$|E

5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl {{is used as}} an additive in {{unleaded gasoline}} to boost octane rating and reduce engine knocking. The manganese in this <b>unusual</b> organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.|$|E

5|$|Mycena polygramma {{contains}} the <b>unusual</b> hydroxy fatty acids 7-hydroxy-8,14-dimethyl-9-hexadecenoic acid (0.05% {{of the total}} fatty acids) and 7-hydroxy-8,16-dimethyl-9-octadecenoic acid (0.01%).|$|E
5|$|NGC 821 is an E6 {{elliptical}} galaxy. It is <b>unusual</b> {{because it}} has hints of an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies. NGC 821 is 2.6 by 2.0 arcminutes and has a visual magnitude of 11.3. Its diameter is 61,000 light-years and it is 80 million light-years away. Another <b>unusual</b> galaxy in Aries is Segue 2. Segue 2 is a dwarf galaxy that is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds with the <b>unusual</b> ability to climb down trees head-first, unlike other birds {{which can only}} go upwards. There are about 24 species worldwide, one breeding in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|Nuthatches {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds. They have the <b>unusual</b> ability to climb down trees head first, unlike most other birds {{which can only}} go upwards. Nuthatches have big heads, short tails, and powerful bills and feet.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans is {{difficult}} to diagnose clinically as the animal may only exhibit an <b>unusual</b> gait. Consequently, OCD may be masked by, or misdiagnosed as, other skeletal and joint conditions such as hip dysplasia.|$|E
5|$|Other storms were {{individually}} <b>unusual.</b> Hurricanes Elida and Hernan also reached Category5 intensity, {{but neither}} caused any damage. Hurricane Fausto {{had no effect}} on land, but it regenerated into a weak tropical storm at an abnormally high latitude.|$|E
5|$|Peculiar {{galaxies are}} galactic {{formations}} that develop <b>unusual</b> properties due to tidal interactions with other galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Peribsen's name is <b>unusual,</b> in that Set, not Horus, was {{his patron}} deity. This {{goes against the}} Egyptian {{tradition}} of a king choosing the falcon-shaped deity Horus as his royal patron.|$|E
