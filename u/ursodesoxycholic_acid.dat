30|$|Inspissated bile {{syndrome}} in a 6  week old boy was unresponsive to oral <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid.</b> Intraoperative cholangiography revealed complete {{obstruction of}} the common bile duct. Therefore, the gallbladder fundus was pulled out through a laparoscopy port site and sutured to the fascia. A catheter was positioned into the infundibulum for irrigation with <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid.</b> At day 8 complete resolution of the plug and free passage of contrast medium into the duodenum was documented radiologically. The catheter was removed, skin closed spontaneously without a second surgery for closure of the gall bladder.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical efficacy of cyclophosphamide {{in the treatment}} of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). MethodsTwenty-four patients with PSC who received treatment in the department of gastroenterology in our hospital from January 2004 to December 2012 were selected as subjects and divided into observation group (n= 13) and control group (n= 11). The control group was treated with <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid,</b> while the observation group with <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> plus cyclophosphamide. After four weeks of treatment, clinical outcome, changes in serum bilirubin levels, and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. Categorical data were analyzed by Fisher exact probability test, and continuous data by independent-samples t test and paired-samples t test. ResultsCompared with the control group, the observation group had a significantly higher response rate (84. 62 % vs 45. 45 %, P= 0. 0489), significantly more improvements in serum total and direct bilirubin levels (t= 12. 45, P＜ 0. 001; t= 5. 60, P＜ 0. 001), and a nonsignificantly higher incidence of adverse reactions (23. 08 % vs 18. 18 %, P= 0. 741). ConclusionCyclophosphamide has significant clinical efficacy and tolerable incidence of adverse events {{in the treatment of}} PSC, so it is worthy of application in clinical treatment...|$|E
30|$|Neonatal {{hyperbilirubinemia}} {{associated with}} extrahepatic bile duct dilatation {{may be caused}} by inspissated bile. In the absence of metabolic disease or bile duct malformations this inspissation is often preceeded by sludge in the gall bladder e.g. secondary to prolonged parenteral nutrition, sepsis, or hemolysis (Gubernick et al. 1990). The resulting cholestasis may be transient with resolution of the concrements either spontaneously or after medical treatment with <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid.</b> In some cases however, medical treatment is unsuccessful and inspissated bile syndrome develops which may require surgical intervention.|$|E
40|$|Primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} (PBC) is {{a chronic}} cholestatic liver disease, characterized by progressive non-pyogenic inflammation {{in the small}} intrahepatic bile ducts, and can cause hepatic fibrosis and liver cirrhosis. The etiology and pathogenesis of PBC remain unknown. The development and progression of PBC are caused by various factors, and the major factor is environmental factors acting on patients with genetic susceptibility. <b>Ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is thought to be}} the only effective drug, but the complete response rate remains low. This article reviews the diagnosis and treatment of PBC with reference to the literature in the world...|$|E
40|$|NASH {{associates}} steatosis with parenchymal {{inflammation and}} signs of hepatocellular injuy and even apoptosis. This leads in a minority of patients to fibrosis {{and in the long}} term to cirrhosis. NASH regularly occurs in a metabolic context characterized by insulin resistance. Several drugs have been tested in randomized controlled studies. Glitazones improve insulin resistance and also NASH, but are associated with side effects particularly unwelcome in NASH patients. <b>Ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid,</b> an hydrophilic biliary acid with hepatoprotective properties, does not improve the histological lesions of NASH. Vitamin E is the only compound which showed so far a positive effect without relevant side effects. However, {{it is too early to}} recommend its long-term use in this indication. Finally, the best treatment is not with drugs, but relies on behavioural changes: NASH patients should regularly exercise...|$|E
40|$|Low-phospholipid-associated cholelithiasis {{syndrome}} (LPAC) {{is associated}} with ABCB 4 genetic mutation. ABCB 4 encodes MDR 3 protein, involved in biliary phosphatidylcholine excretion. Higher prevalence in women, biliary symptoms in young adults and <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> (UDCA) response are the main features. We report {{the case of a}} 48 -year-old man with hepatitis C, genotype 1 b, fibrosis F 3, null responder to Peg-IFNα 2 b/ribavirin and nephritic colic. In 2011 he developed jaundice, pruritus and epigastric pain. He showed increased serum levels of AST, ALT, GGT, bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein, and viral load (14, 600, 000 IU/mL). Pancreatic-CT, endoscopic ultrasonography and echo-Doppler showed non-cirrhotic chronic liver disease. The episode resolved spontaneously and one year later he suffered a similar episode. UDCA was started with excellent response. An immunohistochemistry study and sequencing of ABCB 4 did not find alteration. MLPA® technique detected heterozygous deletion of the full exon 4 confirming LPAC syndrome diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{widely used}} for the {{treatment}} of cholestatic liver disease, causes choleretic, anti-apoptotic and immunomodulatory effects. Here the effects on choleresis of its taurine conjugate tauroursodesoxycholate (TUDC), which is present in the enterohepatic circulation, were correlated with the activation of important elements of intracellular signal transduction in cultured rat hepatocytes and perfused rat liver. TUDC induced a time- and concentration-dependent activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ras and of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase) in cultured hepatocytes. Ras activation was dependent on PI 3 -kinase activity, without the involvement of protein kinase C- and genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinases. Ras activation by TUDC was followed by an activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases extracellular-signal-regulated kinase- 1 (Erk- 1) and Erk- 2. In perfused rat liver, PI 3 -kinase inhibitors largely abolished the stimulatory effect of TUDC on taurocholate excretion, suggesting an important role for a PI 3 -kinase/Ras/Erk pathway in the choleretic effect of TUDC...|$|E
40|$|Sarcoidosis is a {{systemic}} granulomatous disease which may involve many organs. In approximately 95 % of patients there is liver involvement, with noncaseating hepatic granulomas occurring in 21 to 99 % {{of patients with}} sarcoidosis. Liver involvement is usually asymptomatic and limited to mild to moderate abnormalities in liver biochemistry. The occurrence of jaundice in sarcoidosis is rare; extensive imaging procedures and the examination of liver biopsies permit a precise diagnostic. Ductopenia associated with sarcoidosis {{has been reported in}} less than 20 cases and can lead to biliary cirrhosis and liver- related death. We report here on a case of ductopenia-related sarcoidosis in which primary biliary cirrhosis and extrahepatic cholestasis have been carefully excluded. The patient follow up was 8 years. Although <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> appears to improve liver biochemistry it does not preclude the rapid occurrence of extensive fibrosis. A review of the literature of reported cases of ductopenia related to sarcoidosis is provided...|$|E
30|$|The {{probability}} for {{the need}} for a surgical intervention is high when bile ducts become dilated to more than 3  mm (Fitzpatrick et al. 2010). Bile duct dilatation, persisting jaundice and increasing laboratomy parameters such as alcalic phosphatase, ASAT, ALAT, and y-GT are regarded as indication for intervention. Besides the possibility for irrigation of the bile ducts, laparoscopy and intraoperative cholangiography are suitable to rule out biliary tract malformations as a reason for cholestasis when combined with a liver biopsy. Several procedures are described for clearance of obstructed bile ducts: percutaneous management under sedation with transhepatic puncture of the gall bladder and introduction of a wire and a balloon dilator has recently been reported (Duman et al. 2011). The majority of authors describe laparoscopic aided cholecystostomy under anesthesia with placement of a catheter into the gall bladder for repeated irrigation with saline (Gao et al. 2011) or <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gunnarsdottir et al. 2008; Lieber et al. 2012). Identification of the correct position of the port for pulling out the gall bladder as described by Gao et al. (2011) is crucial. We performed daily lavage of the gall bladder with boluses of 5  ml saline and then installed 3  ml of <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> (50  mg/ml or 50  mg/kg body weight). Sonographic controls were withheld until the stool became coloured and hyperbilirubinemia resolved. Prior to pulling the catheter, a contrast radiological study is recommended to record that complete clearance of the bile ducts has been achieved. It is not clear however, whether a second procedure is necessary after removal of the catheter. The need for gall bladder closure and detachment from the abdominal wall may depend on the type of catheter employed. With the use of a balloon catheter, closure of the gall bladder has been reported after its removal to maintain gall bladder function and to avoid adhesions (Lieber et al. 2012). We used a 4  F (16  G) central venous catheter (Certofix Mono S 415, B. Braun, Melsungen, Germany) which appeared to us ideal in length (15  cm), rigidity and its features for fixation to the skin. The smaller diameter of this catheter allowed for rapid spontaneous closure of the cholecystostomy opening after catheter removal. In the present case the cholecystostomy site was dry after 24  hours and only a minimal scar was visible at follow up after 3  months. There is no long term follow up available for both techniques however.|$|E
30|$|Intrahepatic {{lithiasis}} {{is considered}} to be very uncommon in Europe and much more frequent in Asia [10]. Since the description of MDR 3 deficiencies, an increasing number of patients are diagnosed with LPAC syndrome-related intrahepatic lithiasis. The diagnosis is frequently performed several years after the beginning of the symptoms due to their lack of specificity. The syndrome should be suspected in case of the association of several elements. The three most important are: (1) biliary symptoms in a young adult (< 40  years old); (2) symptom recurrence after cholecystectomy; (3) presence of hyperechoic material in the biliary ducts. Other minor criteria have been described, such as mild chronic cholestasis, at least one episode of cholangitis, acute pancreatitis or biliary colic, efficiency of <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> (UDCA) and similar symptoms in first-degree relatives. ABCB 4 gene mutations have been described in patients with LPAC syndrome in 25 – 56  % of cases [11 – 13]. At imaging, LPAC syndrome is associated with various MR presentations: normal MR cholangiography, isolated intrahepatic lithiasis and, rarely, bile duct dilatations. No imaging differences can be found between patients with or without ABCB 4 mutation and no specific mutation can be associated with the different presentations [12, 14].|$|E
40|$|Primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} (PBC) is an {{autoimmune disease}} in which intrahepatic bile ducts are targeted by an immune-mediated injury. This disease tends to progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis with hepatic failure. The authors report {{a case of}} a 50 -year-old rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patient, with erosions and seropositive for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies, with 18 years disease duration refractory to prednisolone and several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, either conventional or biological (adalimumab and etanercept). In April 2007, she started therapy with rituximab (RTX) with good European League Against Rheumatism response achieved 9 months later. In June 2008, she was admitted with intrahepatic cholestasis, steatorrhea, and spontaneous fractures of various ribs. After excluding cholelitiasis, as well as infectious and neoplastic diseases a liver biopsy was performed that was compatible with the diagnosis of PBC. The antinuclear antibodies (1 / 160) were positive as well as the antimitochondrial antibodies (1 / 640). Other antibodies were negative such as anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Afterwards, the patient started <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> 15 mg kg(- 1) day(- 1) with progressive improvement of cholestatic markers. A labial salivary gland biopsy was performed and showed findings compatible with the concomitant diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome. Based on this clinical report, a detailed review of the clinical aspects of PBC is presented as well as its association with other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, particularly, with RA...|$|E
40|$|Portal {{hypertensive}} biliopathy (PHB) {{is characterized}} by anatomical and functional abnormalities of the intrahepatic, extrahepatic and pancreatic ducts, in patients with portal hypertension associated to extrahepatic portal vein obstruction and less frequently to cirrhosis. These morphological changes, consisting in dilatation and stenosis of the biliary tree, are due to extensive venous collaterals occurring {{in an attempt to}} decompress the portal venous blockage. It is usually asymptomatic until it progresses to more advanced stages with cholestasis, jaundice, biliary sludge, gallstones, cholangitis and finally biliary cirrhosis. Imaging modalities of the biliary tree such as Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are essential to establish the diagnosis and the need of therapeutical interventions. Once the diagnosis is established, treatment with <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid</b> seems to be beneficial. Decompression of the biliary tree to dilate, remove stones or implant biliary prosthesis by endoscopic or surgical procedures (hepato-yeyunostomy) usually resolves the cholestatic picture and prevents septic complications. The ideal treatment is the decompression of the portal system, with transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt or a surgical porto-systemic shunt. Unfortunately, few patients will be candidates for these procedures due to the extension of the thrombotic process. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to report the first 3 cases of PHB seen in a Colombian center and to review the literature...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Cholestatic {{hepatitis}} {{is frequently}} a drug-related syndrome. We describe {{the case of}} a 57 -year-old man who developed cholestatic hepatitis two months after starting therapy with ticlopidine following a carotid endarterectomy. Materials and methods The patient presented with anorexia, nausea, and dark-colored urine. The work-up included laboratory tests and imaging studies of the liver (ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging). The authors analyze the case using the scale developed by Maria and Victorino for the diagnosis of drug-induced hepatitis, the Naranjo algorithm for adverse drug reactions, and the RUCAM algorithm for causality assessment of hepatotoxicity. They also review data from the MedLine database on cases of ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis reported during the period 1982 – 2011. Results Bilirubin, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatases, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels were elevated at admission and progressively declined after ticlopidine was discontinued. The absence of biliary obstruction at ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiography, the negative results of viral and immunologic tests, and the resolution of the syndrome after discontinuation of the drug all suggested ticlopidine-induced hepatotoxicity. The assessment of this case with toxicity algorithms confirmed that a causal link to ticlopidine was “probable” or “highly probable. ” The patient was treated with <b>ursodesoxycholic</b> <b>acid,</b> clopidogrel (75 mg/day), and (after the laboratory parameters had normalized) rosuvastatin (10 mg/day). No further clinical and laboratory abnormalities have been observed during two month follow-up. Discussion The toxicity of ticlopidine is well established: our review revealed reports of 57 cases of ticlopidine-induced cholestatic hepatitis during the period 1982 – 2011. The mechanisms underlying the toxic effects of this drug are not clear, but they are probably related to the chemical structure of the drug. The syndrome is usually completely reversible with discontinuation of the drug. We stress the importance for the appropriate use of this drug and the need for adequate follow-up of patients. </p...|$|E
