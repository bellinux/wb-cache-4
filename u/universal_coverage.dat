5|$|On October 23 Biden {{revealed}} {{his health care}} plan. It called for expanded coverage {{for children and adults}} but stops short of mandates for complete <b>universal</b> <b>coverage.</b> It aimed to encourage wellness and modernization of treatment. Biden stated it would cost between $80billion and $110billion per year. He said it could have been paid with a rollback of tax cuts of the richest 1% bracket, capital gains and dividends and the elimination of tax loopholes for hedge fund managers and private equity partners. The plan would also had increased the SCHIP program to include children 300% above the poverty level.|$|E
5|$|Jones' top {{priority}} as governor was {{the passage of}} health care reform. He appointed two health care reform study commissions, and in May 1993, he called the legislature into a special session to consider a universal health care bill. The only measure {{to come out of}} this session was a temporary tax on health care providers. Legislators also agreed to work toward a bill that could be passed in the next regular legislative session. On March 2, 1994, the Kentucky House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill that did not include <b>universal</b> <b>coverage.</b> Angered, Jones began campaigning against the bill, but the Kentucky Senate passed its version on March 22.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1993, Clinton {{made a major}} {{speech to}} Congress {{regarding}} a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving <b>universal</b> <b>coverage</b> through a national health care plan. This {{was one of the}} most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris stated that the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.|$|E
40|$|Two {{commonly}} used metrics for assessing progress toward <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage</b> involve assessing citizens’ rights {{to health care}} and {{counting the number of}} people who are in a financial protection scheme that safeguards them from high health care payments. On these metrics most countries in Latin America have already “reached” <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage.</b> Neither metric indicates, however, whether a country has achieved <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage</b> in the now commonly accepted sense of the term: that everyone—irrespective of their ability to pay—gets the health services they need without suffering undue financial hardship. We operationalized a framework proposed by the World Bank and the World Health Organization to monitor progress under this definition and then constructed an overall index of <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage</b> achievement. We applied the approach using data from 112 household surveys from 1990 to 2013 for all twenty Latin American countries. No country has achieved a perfect <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage</b> score, but some countries (including those with more integrated health systems) fare better than others.

25|$|In 2006, the Massachusetts {{legislature}} {{enacted the}} first {{plan in the}} United States to provide all Commonwealth citizens with universal health insurance coverage, {{using a variety of}} private insurance providers. Insurance coverage for low-income individuals is paid for with tax revenues, and higher income people who don't have health insurance are required to purchase it. (The health insurance market is publicly regulated, so, at least in Massachusetts, no one can be denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions or be forced to pay exorbitant rates.) The implementation of Commonwealth Care, the new <b>universal</b> <b>coverage</b> law, is proceeding, as of 2007.|$|E
25|$|During the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Hillary Clinton ran to {{the left}} of Barack Obama on {{economic}} issues. On the issue of health care, Clinton was willing to include an individual mandate to buy health insurance as part of a program for <b>universal</b> <b>coverage.</b> Obama was not willing to go so far, and came in for substantial criticism from liberals for it. Clinton proposed a Cabinet-level poverty czar position. Clinton secured more labor union backing than Obama, and Obama did better than Clinton at gaining primary votes from self-identified independents. However, on foreign policy issues, Hillary Clinton was more hawkish than Barack Obama. However, Hillary has opposed certain liberal aspects of Obamacare such as the cadillac tax.|$|E

25|$|Inequalities {{in health}} are also {{determined}} by these socioeconomic and cultural factors. Health care is inequitably distributed globally, with pronounced inequality {{for the poor}} in low- and middle-income countries. One study demonstrated that doctors treat poor populations differently, showing that disadvantaged patients {{are less likely to}} receive the recommended diabetic treatments {{and are more likely to}} undergo hospitalization due to the complications of diabetes (Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, 2003). According to the WHO, healthcare systems can most improve health equality when institutions are organized to provide <b>universal</b> <b>coverage,</b> where everyone receives the same quality healthcare regardless of ability to pay, as well as a Primary Healthcare system rather than emergency center assistance.|$|E

The Analytical Review was part of this project and its editors believed that they were preserving the knowledge of {{the past and the present}} for the future. The journal was, according to scholar Nathaniel Teich, [...] "the most important radical review adopting the encyclopedic format for the attempted <b>universal</b> <b>coverage</b> of published works".

40|$|The present Millennium Development Goals are set {{to expire}} in 2015 and their next {{iteration}} is now being discussed within the international community. With regards to health, the World Health Organization proposes <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage</b> as a 'single overarching health goal' for the next iteration of the Millennium Development Goals. The present Millennium Development Goals have been criticised for being 'duplicative' or even 'competing alternatives' to international human rights law. The question then arises, if <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage</b> would indeed become the single overarching health goal, replacing the present health-related Millennium Development Goals, would that be more consistent {{with the right to}} health? The World Health Organization seems to have anticipated the question, as it labels <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage</b> as "by definition, a practical expression of the concern for health equity and the right to health". Rather than waiting for the negotiations to unfold, {{we thought it would be}} useful to verify this contention, using a comparative normative analysis. We found that - to be a practical expression of the right to health - at least one element is missing in present authoritative definitions of universal health coverage: a straightforward confirmation that international assistance is essential, not optional. But <b>universal</b> health <b>coverage</b> is a 'work in progress'.
