40|$|Abstract: Ecological {{factors are}} known to {{influence}} the <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> of Yunnan snub-nosed monkeys (Rhi-nopithecus bieti). However, {{little is known about}} how <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> vary between age/sex classes, because the species is difficult to observe in the wild. This study provides the first detailed <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> subdivided by age/sex classes based on observations of the largest habituated group at Xiangguqing in Baimaxueshan Nature Reserve. This study was conducted from June 2008 to May 2009. We found that adult females spent more time feeding (44. 8 %) than adult males (39. 5 %), juveniles (39. 1 %), and infants (14. 2 %). Adult males allocated more time to miscellaneous activities (12. 5 %) than did adult females (3. 8 %). Infants were being groomed 6. 9 % of the time, which was the highest proportion among all age/sex classes. Adults spent more time feeding, while immature individuals allocated more time to moving and other activities. There are several reasons <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> may vary by age/sex class: 1) differential reproductive investment between males and females; 2) devel-opmental differences among the age categories; 3) social relationships between members of different age/sex classes, particularly dominance. In addition, group size and adult sex ratio may also impact <b>activity</b> <b>budgets.</b> These variations in <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> among the different age/sex classes may become a selective pressure that shapes the development and growth pattern in this species...|$|R

Species were variable in their behaviour between different sites and similarities in their <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> were not necessarily associated with their trophic group. For four species we investigated the relationship of their <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> to wave exposure and substratum composition. Staying close to the substratum was positively correlated to wave exposure for most species and foraging was negatively correlated to exposure for two species. By behaving this way, these fish may save energy by avoiding swimming in higher water flux.

Activity states were then assigned to each sampling unit, using a combination of hidden and observed states. Three activity states were identified: nonfeeding, foraging, and surface feeding (SF). From the resulting time series of activity states, transition probability matrices were estimated using first-order Markov chains. We then simulated time series of activity states, using Monte Carlo methods based on the transition probability matrices, to obtain <b>activity</b> <b>budgets,</b> accounting for heterogeneity in state duration.

This can potentially yield knowledge about the detailed <b>activity</b> <b>budget</b> of free-ranging elusive animals. The aim of this thesis was to separate behavior types to identify the <b>activity</b> <b>budget</b> of wild reindeer. Two free-ranging wild reindeer were fitted with GPS collars with integrated activity sensor and video camera. The video camera recorded video while the activity sensor simultaneously measured activity intensity. I classified the visual observations of reindeer behavior and assigned them into different behavior categories. I then paired the behavior classification with the corresponding activity measurement. By predicting the true overlap and testing the differences in activity measurements between the behavior categories, I managed to separate the main behaviors laying/standing, walking slow, walking, trotting and running. I also managed to separate the secondary behaviors occasional grazing and grazing from the other secondary behaviors. My finding demonstrates that <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> can be identified by the use of activity sensors. Unlike other studies to date, my results shows that the behavior classification of free-ranging wild reindeer can be conducted directly in the wild, while simultaneously measure <b>activity.</b> The <b>activity</b> <b>budget</b> can be coupled with known rates of energy expenditure to develop the energetic landscape. This can be used to evaluate the effect of infrastructure, and other human activities, on reindeer spatio-temporal behavior and energy balance...|$|R
40|$|How animals {{allocate}} {{their time}} to various activities has significant consequences for their survival because they reflect the different constraints on time-energy balances. Many ecological variables, such as day length, temperature, food availability, are supposed to effect on <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> allocation of temperate primates. To examine the potential influence of these three variables, the <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> of Rhinopithecus bieti was studied at Xiaochangdu, Tibet from June 2003 to March 2005. Pearson correlations were utilized to assess potential relationships between <b>activity</b> <b>budget</b> and day length, food availability and temperature, and stepwise multiple regressions to identify the priority of resting and other activities (activities besides feeding, moving and resting). Time spent resting and doing “other activities” is positively related to day length, temperature and food availability. No significant correlations were found between feeding/moving time and any of these variables. This suggests that foraging time (feeding + moving) takes priority over rest and other activities. Day length and foraging time (as independent variables) {{were related to the}} time spent in the other two activities besides feeding/moving (as dependent variables). Both time spent resting and in “other activities” were highly significant positive functions of day length, with the latter a highly significant negative function of feeding time and moving time. Resting time may therefore be interpreted as taking priority over “other activities” time. These results provide further evidence of the importance of day length, temperature and food availability to seasonal <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> [Current Zoology 56 (6) : 650 – 659, 2010]...|$|R

40|$|Activity pattern {{plasticity}} in ungulates {{serves as}} an evolutionary adaptation to optimize fitness in inconsistent environments. Given that time is a limited and valuable resource for foraging wildlife species, provisioning and attraction may affect the activity pattern plasticity and reduce complexities of time partitioning for different activities by impala in closed environments. We assessed <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> of free-ranging impala social groups in a closed environment. Social group type had an influence on the <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> of impala except for foraging and moving activity states. Both the harem and bachelor groups spent more than 30 % of their daily time foraging. Bachelor groups spent more time exhibiting vigilance tendencies than the harem groups. Season influenced the <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> of social groups other than vigilance and foraging activity states. Foraging time was highly correlated with vigilance, resting, and grooming. We concluded that provisioning and attraction may have reduced the influence of seasonality on the proportion of time spent on different activity states by impala social groups.

40|$|Sexual {{segregation}} {{is common}} in ungulates and some social mammals but its causes are still poorly understood. We developed an individual-based, spatially explicit simulation model to test whether sexual differences in activity could lead to sexual segregation. In our model, males and females differed only in their propensity to switch from an active to a passive state and vice versa, with males being more reluctant {{to get up and}} more ready to lie down than the more active females, or vice versa. The only factor in our model that affected sexual segregation was the sexual difference in the propensity to switch from an active to a passive state and vice versa. As differences in <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> increased, the degree of sexual segregation increased. Sexual segregation reached a peak when sexual differences in <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> were greatest. This high level of segregation remained, even when animals were programmed to adjust their activity to other animals in their vicinity. Our results verify the logic of the <b>activity</b> <b>budget</b> hypothesis that sexual differences in time spent active (grazing, walking) versus passive (lying, ruminating) can, in principle, result in sexual segregation. However, this does not exclude alternative mechanisms. Our model could also be applied to any social animal foraging in groups...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} sexual {{segregation}} in social animals, primarily ungulates, has lately {{been the focus}} of many studies (Bowyer et al., 2002; Ruckstuhl & Kokko, 2002; Ruckstuhl & Neuhaus, 2002; DePerno et al., 2003; Moor-ing et al., 2003, to list just a few) Since several, partially contradicting, hy-potheses have been put forward to explain this phenomenon, we recently did a review (meta-analysis) to find out if one of the main hypothesis used to explain sexual segregation in social ungulates could be used as an ultimate causal explanation of this phenomenon (Ruckstuhl & Neuhaus, 2002). To do this we compared the so-called predation-risk (or reproductive strategy) hy-pothesis, the forage-selection (or sexual dimorphism-body-size) hypothesis and the <b>activity</b> <b>budget</b> (body-size predation) hypothesis on over 30 species of ungulates.

40|$|Investigation of <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> in {{relation}} to seasonal, intrinsic (age, sex) and extrinsic (time of day, spatial) covariates enables {{an understanding of how}} such covariates shape behavioural strategies. However, conducting such investigations in the wild is challenging, because of the required large sample size of individuals across the annual cycle, and difficulties in categorising behavioural states and analysing the resulting individual-referenced and serially correlated data. In this study, from telemetry tags deployed on 63 grey seals Halichoerus grypus and 126 harbour seals Phoca vitulina we used behavioural data, and movement data within a Bayesian state–space model (SSM), to define population-level <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> around Britain. Using generalised estimating equations (GEEs) we then examined how time spent in four states (resting on land (hauled out), resting at sea, foraging and travelling) was influenced by seasonal, intrinsic and extrinsic covariates. We present and discuss the following key findings. 1) We found no evidence that regional variation in foraging effort was linked to regional population trajectories in harbour seals. 2) Grey seals demonstrated sex-specific seasonal differences in their <b>activity</b> <b>budgets,</b> independent from those related to reproductive costs. 3) In these sympatric species there was evidence of temporal separation in time hauled out, but not in time foraging. 4) In both species, time spent resting at sea was separated into inshore (associated with tidal haul out availability) and offshore areas. Time spent resting at sea and on land was interchangeable to some extent, suggesting a degree of overlap in their functionality. This may result in a relaxation of the constraints associated with a central place foraging strategy. More generally, we demonstrate how a large dataset, incorporating differing tag parameters, can be analysed to define <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> and subsequently address important ecological questions...|$|R

We analyzed the importance of the mating season and of seasonal variations in dietary composition and food competition on econciliation in wild female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata yakui) on Yakushima Island, Japan. Yakushima macaques are appropriate subjects because they are seasonal breeders and their dietary composition significantly changes among the seasons.

Conversely,conciliatory tendency is significantly lower during the mating season than in the nonmating season. Moreover, conciliatory tendency is lower when 1 or both female opponents is in estrous than when they are not. Thus the mating season has profound effects on reconciliation, whereas seasonal changes in <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> and dietary composition do not.

Sex, social tactic, season and food availability are important factors influencing <b>activity</b> <b>budgets.</b> However, few field studies have tested their influences. The African striped mouse (Rhabdomys pumilio) lives in highly seasonal habitats in southern Africa, and individuals can adopt different social tactics. We investigated seasonal changes in <b>activity</b> <b>budgets</b> of different tactics and predicted that individuals will reduce their activity in the non-breeding season to save energy when food availability is low and that young non-breeding adults (‘philopatrics’) invest mainly in activities related to gaining body mass to increase survival probability.

We conducted 90 focal observations during the non-breeding season and 73 during the breeding season. <b>Activity</b> <b>budgets</b> of striped mice were season and tactic specific, with philopatrics, but not breeders, reducing activity when food availability was low, possibly to decrease energy expenditure.

Sex-specific differences occurred during the breeding season, when female breeders foraged more than male breeders, while male breeders chased other individuals more than female breeders.

Resting, feeding, moving, social interactions and other activities accounted for 56. 6 %, 26. 3 %, 13. 0 %, 3. 3 %, and 0. 7 % of the <b>activity</b> <b>budget,</b> respectively. The group spent more time feeding and less time moving in the dry season compared to the rainy season. The diet was composed of 35 plant species belonging to 16 families, with items including leaves, fruits, seeds, buds, bark, flowers, gum, and inflorescences. Only three tree species were used as sleeping trees: Celtis integrifolia, Cola cordifolia, and Holoptelea grandis. Our findings suggest that the monkeys prefer tall (22. 53 ± SD 3. 76 m) and large-trunked (112. 07 ± SD 14. 23 cm) sleeping trees. The results of this study can be used for sound management of the white-thighed colobus in the study area and elsewhere. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The indices covers four clusters of fiscal transparency practices: data assurances, medium-term budgeting, budget execution reporting, and fiscal risk disclosures. More transparent countries are shown to have better credit ratings, better fiscal discipline, and less corruption, after controlling for other socioeconomic variables.
