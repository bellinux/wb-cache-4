5|$|Strangelets {{are small}} {{fragments}} of strange matter—a hypothetical form of quark matter—that contain roughly {{equal numbers of}} <b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> and strange quarks and that are more stable than ordinary nuclei (strangelets would {{range in size from}} a few femtometers to a few meters across). If strangelets can actually exist, and if they were produced at the LHC, they could conceivably initiate a runaway fusion process in which all the nuclei in the planet would be converted to strange matter, similar to a strange star.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES: the world is viewed from a top-down camera angle, it is divided up into many different squares that can fit on the screen, and the main character can move <b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> left, and right across the screen. The player can interact with individuals within towns by gathering information and buying or selling items and equipment. A variety of enemies can be battled on a field screen to gain experience, GP, and items. Within dungeon areas, a number of puzzles may be present and required to be solved in order for the player to advance. The player can also save at any point. A number of weapons can be found throughout the game to maneuver through obstacles such as cutting through trees and thorns.|$|E
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} and button to input commands, though home versions use a game controller with a directional pad. As the game progresses, visual cues—highlighted {{portions of the}} background or foreground—will appear on the screen to help survive the dangers that occur throughout the stage; more difficult settings omit the visual cues. Depending on {{the location of the}} cue, the player will input one of four directions (<b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> left and right) or an attack (shoot the target with a laser gun). Inputting the correct command will either avoid or neutralize the threats and progress the game, while incorrect choices result in the character's death. Reika dying too many times results in a game over. Specific moments in the game involve Reika stopping time. During these moments, players are presented with a list of three options and have seven seconds to choose the one which will save the character.|$|E

5000|$|The {{other way}} is using strict {{alternate}} picking: [...] <b>down</b> - <b>up</b> - <b>down</b> / <b>up</b> - <b>down</b> - <b>up</b> / <b>down</b> - <b>up</b> - <b>down</b> [...] [...] [...] [...] This {{may be more}} comfortable for players who are using alternate picking {{for most of their}} playing. In actuality, one (or more) of the three pitches may be varied from one repetition of the pattern to the next, for instance the top note could be toggled <b>up</b> and <b>down</b> one step.|$|R
5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: <b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> strange, charm, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E
25|$|With {{its large}} budget, {{the film was}} not a {{financial}} success. Because of this, Martine Marignac {{wanted to make a}} quick, inexpensive film; Rivette, short of ideas, began assembling a cast. He contacted Nathalie Richard, Marianne Denicourt and Laurence Côte, who gave him an idea for a film about 1920s New York City taxi dance halls; this led to 1995's <b>Up,</b> <b>Down,</b> Fragile. Richard, Denicourt and Côte star as three women struggling to overcome personal obstacles, with musical numbers at a mysterious nightclub commenting on their lives. In the film, a nod to 1920s and 1930s Hollywood backstage musicals, Anna Karina appears as a nightclub singer whose songs refer to her previous films with Godard. <b>Up,</b> <b>Down,</b> Fragile was screened at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.|$|E
25|$|Strangelets. These are {{theoretically}} postulated (but as yet unobserved) {{lumps of}} strange matter comprising nearly {{equal amounts of}} <b>up,</b> <b>down</b> and strange quarks. Strangelets {{are supposed to be}} present in the galactic flux of high energy particles and should therefore theoretically be detectable in cosmic rays here on Earth, but no strangelet has been detected with certainty.|$|E

25|$|The fermions of the Standard Model are {{classified}} {{according to how}} they interact (or equivalently, by what charges they carry). There are six quarks (<b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> charm, strange, top, bottom), and six leptons (electron, electron neutrino, muon, muon neutrino, tau, tau neutrino). Pairs from each classification are grouped {{together to form a}} generation, with corresponding particles exhibiting similar physical behavior (see table).|$|E

25|$|The Yukawa {{couplings}} of the <b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> charm, {{strange and}} bottom quarks, are hypothesized to have small values at the extremely high energy scale of grand unification, 1015GeV. They {{increase in value}} at lower energy scales, at which the quark masses are generated by the Higgs. The slight growth is due to corrections from the QCD coupling. The corrections from the Yukawa couplings are negligible for the lower mass quarks.|$|E
25|$|Both {{versions}} of the game have a different control scheme. In the PlayStation 2 version, The game uses Buzz! buzzers, four of which are bundled with the game. In the Wii version, players {{have to use the}} D-pad to choose an answer. There's also an option to use motion controls. In the motion control scheme, players hold the B button while jerking the Wii remote <b>up,</b> <b>down,</b> left or right to choose an answer.|$|E

25|$|Observations of {{the light}} baryons (those made of <b>up,</b> <b>down</b> and strange quarks) imply {{that some of these}} {{particles}} are so similar in terms of their strong interactions that they can be treated as different states of the same particle. In the modern understanding of quantum chromodynamics, this is because up and down quarks are very similar in mass, and have the same strong interactions. Particles made of the same numbers of up and down quarks have similar masses and are grouped together.|$|E
25|$|The {{body of a}} fibula {{is known}} as either the bow or the plate, {{depending}} on the basic form. A bow is generally long and narrow, and often arched. A plate is flat and wide. Plates could be solid or openwork. The body was often decorated. The head {{is the end of}} the fibula with the spring or hinge. The foot {{is the end of the}} fibula where the pin closes. Depending on the type of fibula, and the culture in question, the head of the fibula could be worn facing <b>up,</b> <b>down</b> or sideways.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} and subsequent analysis of additional particles, both mesons and baryons, {{made it clear}} that the concept of isospin symmetry could be broadened to an even larger symmetry group, now called flavor symmetry. Once the kaons and their property of strangeness became better understood, it started to become clear that these, too, seemed to be a part of an enlarged symmetry that contained isospin as a subgroup. The larger symmetry was named the Eightfold Way by Murray Gell-Mann, and was promptly recognized to correspond to the adjoint representation of SU(3). To better understand the origin of this symmetry, Gell-Mann proposed the existence of <b>up,</b> <b>down</b> and strange quarks which would belong to the fundamental representation of the SU(3) flavor symmetry.|$|E

25|$|Closely {{following}} the derivation of Black and Scholes, John Cox, Stephen Ross and Mark Rubinstein developed {{the original version}} of the binomial options pricing model. It models {{the dynamics of the}} option's theoretical value for discrete time intervals over the option's life. The model starts with a binomial tree of discrete future possible underlying stock prices. By constructing a riskless portfolio of an option and stock (as in the Black–Scholes model) a simple formula can be used to find the option price at each node in the tree. This value can approximate the theoretical value produced by Black Scholes, to the desired degree of precision. However, the binomial model is considered more accurate than Black–Scholes because it is more flexible; e.g., discrete future dividend payments can be modeled correctly at the proper forward time steps, and American options can be modeled as well as European ones. Binomial models are widely used by professional option traders. The Trinomial tree is a similar model, allowing for an <b>up,</b> <b>down</b> or stable path; although considered more accurate, particularly when fewer time-steps are modelled, it is less commonly used as its implementation is more complex.|$|E
500|$|Talking in the 1990s to his {{official}} biographer, Barry Miles, McCartney {{said that the}} lyrics address duality, reflecting his astrological sign of Gemini.
