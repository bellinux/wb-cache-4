25|$|Count Leo Tolstoi is {{a classic}} example of an {{individual}} in potential and actual conflict with his group. He was talented and had immense vitality. Until young manhood he accepted his place in the Tsarist social pattern and generally conformed to it. After some drastic experiences and much soul searching, Leo Tolstoi challenged the social system under which he lived to mortal combat. From that point <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> left home and died in a railway station in his final attempt to win out against group pressures, his life consisted of combats with members of his family, with members of the neighboring nobility, with the army, with the Tsarist autocracy and with the established church.|$|E

25|$|Belize informs Louis about Joe's {{connection}} with Cohn, whom Louis despises for his hypocritical anti-gay rhetoric. Louis goes to confront Joe directly, and Joe physically assaults him, after which Louis leaves him for good. Now abandoned {{by his wife}} and his lover, and with no one else to turn to, Joe goes to Cohn for guidance. Cohn, meanwhile, has just learned that his political enemies have moved to have him disbarred. Enraged, he vows to remain a lawyer <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> dies. Rather than comforting Joe, Cohn viciously berates him for leaving his wife for another man, forcing Joe to realize that Louis's opinion of Cohn was true. He rebukes Cohn and leaves the man to die alone. Ethel Rosenberg watches Cohn's last supporter abandon him before delivering the final blow: Cohn has been disbarred after all. Cohn dies shortly thereafter. Belize forces Louis to visit Cohn's room, where Louis recites the Kaddish for Cohn. Unseen by the living, Ethel joins Louis in the prayer, symbolically forgiving Cohn before she departs for the hereafter. Belize and Louis then steal Cohn's hoarded AZT for Prior.|$|E
25|$|The City of Christchurch {{by-election}} of 1896 was a by-election held on 13 February 1896 {{during the}} 12th New Zealand Parliament {{in the urban}} seat of the City of Christchurch. The by-election was triggered by the appointment of William Pember Reeves as Agent-General to the United Kingdom. The Liberal Government led by Richard Seddon had trouble finding a suitable candidate and delayed Reeves' resignation <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> left his home in Christchurch {{to take up the}} London post. Nonetheless, rumours of Reeves' pending resignation had been circulating for a month and candidates were lining up. The Liberal Party candidate who was secured resigned within a week of Reeves' eventual resignation, and a new candidate had to be found. Three candidates contested the election: Richard Molesworth Taylor was the official Liberal Party candidate, Tommy Taylor was a prohibitionist also with liberal views but an ardent opponent of Seddon, and Charles Lewis was the reluctant conservative candidate of the opposition. Being a Liberal Party stronghold, vote splitting between those candidates who held liberal views secured the election win for Lewis, with the Liberal Party candidate coming last.|$|E

[...] Aberhart did not resist the comparison, retorting that the pied piper had [...] "rid the capitol of all the rats"; Brownlee responded that, after doing that, he had led its children to their destruction. [...] In May 1935, after Aberhart announced that his social credit movement would contest the next provincial election, Brownlee ridiculed its candidate-selection process—in which Aberhart personally interviewed and selected more candidates for each riding than could ultimately run—as {{one in which the}} candidates would be [...] "wrapped in cellophane and carefully hidden away so they will not dry out on , <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>he</b> calls out the fittest and discards the rest".|$|E

[...] In his autobiography I Lived To Tell It All, Jones explains that the early death of his sister Ethel spurred on his father's drinking problem and, by all accounts, George Washington Jones could be physically and emotionally abusive to his wife and children when he drank. [...] In the book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Bob Allen recounts how George Washington Jones would return home {{in the middle of the}} night with his cronies roaring drunk, wake up a terrified George Glenn Jones and demand that he sing for them or face a beating.

I could say that when I was let out I found we were far down the river, that the captain expressed great regret when he found that I had been hurt so badly, that he did everything in his power for me, and that after I had been some days on board the ship he offered to land me in Holland, and to give me money to pay my fare back here if I would give him my word of honour not to divulge his name or the name of the ship, or that of the port at which he landed me.
