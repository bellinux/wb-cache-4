40|$|Trichotillomania is a {{disorder}} characterized by recurrent <b>urges</b> {{to pull out}} one’s hair, but the experiential characteristics of hair pulling <b>urges</b> are poorly understood. This study used a comparative approach to understand the subjective phenomenology of hair pulling: participants with trichotillomania symptoms were asked about their hair pulling <b>urges</b> {{as well as their}} <b>urges</b> to eat unhealthy foods. Participants who reported experiencing problematic unhealthy food <b>urges</b> were identified and asked to compare the phenomenological characteristics of their hair pulling and unhealthy food <b>urges</b> across a variety of dimensions. Results revealed significant differences for only some <b>urge</b> properties measured, and differences that existed were small to moderate in magnitude. Qualitative comparisons of the two <b>urges</b> revealed situational characteristics of hair pulling that could explain these small to moderate differences between the two <b>urges.</b> We conclude that hair pulling <b>urges</b> may be more comparable to ordinary <b>urges</b> such as unhealthy food <b>urges</b> than one might expect, but that hair pulling <b>urges</b> may nevertheless be rated as slightly more severe due to situational characteristics of these <b>urges.</b> This conception may improve clinician and lay understanding of the condition, assist with destigmatization efforts, and facilitate the development of treatment strategies...|$|R

40|$|Premonitory <b>urges</b> are a {{cardinal}} feature in Tourette syndrome and are commonly {{viewed as the}} driving force of tics, building up before and subsiding after the execution of tics. Although the urge-tic interplay {{is one of the most}} preeminent features in Tourette syndrome, the temporal relationship between tics and <b>urges</b> has never been examined experimentally, mainly due to the lack of an appropriate assessment tool. We investigated the temporal relationship between <b>urge</b> intensity and tics in 17 Tourette patients and between <b>urge</b> intensity and eye blinks in 16 healthy controls in a free ticcing/blinking condition and a tic/blink suppression condition. For this purpose, an <b>urge</b> assessment tool was developed that allows real-time monitoring and quantification of <b>urge</b> intensity. Compared to free ticcing/blinking, <b>urge</b> intensity was higher during the suppression condition in both Tourette patients and healthy controls, while tics and blinks occurred less frequently. The data show that <b>urge</b> intensity increases prior to tics and decreases after tics in a time window of approximately ± 10 sec. Tic suppression had a significant effect on the shape of the <b>urge</b> distribution around tics and led to a decrease in the size of the correlation between <b>urge</b> intensity and tics, indicating that tic suppression led to a de-coupling of tics and <b>urges.</b> In healthy controls, <b>urges</b> to blink were highly associated with eye blink execution, albeit in a narrower time frame (∼± 5 sec). Blink suppression had a similar effect on the <b>urge</b> distribution associated with eye blinks as tic suppression had on the <b>urge</b> to tic in Tourette patients. These results corroborate the negative reinforcement model, which proposes that tics are associated with a relief in <b>urges,</b> thereby perpetuating ticcing behaviour. This study also documents similarities and differences between <b>urges</b> to act in healthy controls and <b>urges</b> to tic in Tourette syndrome. </p...|$|R

40|$|Premonitory <b>urges</b> are a {{cardinal}} feature in Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Severity of premonitory <b>urges</b> {{can be assessed}} with the "Premonitory <b>Urge</b> for Tic Disorders Scale" (PUTS). However, convergent validity of the measure {{has been difficult to}} assess {{due to the lack of}} other <b>urge</b> measures. We investigated the relationship between average real-time <b>urge</b> intensity assessed by an in-house developed real-time <b>urge</b> monitor (RUM), measuring <b>urge</b> intensity continuously for 5 [*]min on a visual analog scale, and general <b>urge</b> intensity assessed by the PUTS in 22 adult Tourette patients (mean age 29. 8 [*]±[*] 10. 3 SD, 19 males). Additionally, underlying factors of premonitory <b>urges</b> assessed by the PUTS were investigated in the adult sample using factor analysis and were replicated in 40 children and adolescents diagnosed with Tourette syndrome (mean age 12. 05 [*]±[*] 2. 83 SD, 31 males). Cronbach's α for the PUTS 10 was acceptable (α[*]=[*] 0. 79) in the adult sample. Convergent validity between average real-time <b>urge</b> intensity scores (as assessed with the RUM) and the 10 -item version of the PUTS (r[*]=[*] 0. 64) and the 9 -item version of the PUTS (r[*]=[*] 0. 66) was good. A factor analysis including the 10 items of the PUTS and average real-time <b>urge</b> intensity scores revealed three factors. One factor included the average real-time <b>urge</b> intensity score and appeared to measure <b>urge</b> intensity, whereas the other two factors can be assumed to reflect the (sensory) quality of <b>urges</b> and subjective control, respectively. The factor structure of the 10 PUTS items alone was replicated in a sample of children and adolescents. The results indicate that convergent validity between the PUTS and the real-time <b>urge</b> assessment monitor is good. Furthermore, the results suggest that the PUTS might assess more than one dimension of <b>urges,</b> and it may be worthwhile developing different subscales of the PUTS assessing premonitory <b>urges</b> in terms of intensity and quality, as well as subjectively experienced control over tics and premonitory <b>urges.</b> </p...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addressing}} addictive {{behavior and}} other potentially destructive behavior compelling to the participant, CBTraining uses an approach of <b>urge</b> conditioning/desensitization. This approach stands {{in stark contrast}} to what is commonly most instinctive to people (<b>urge</b> avoidance), and seems counter-intuitive at first. The approach of <b>urge</b> desensitization has been applied to patients with gambling addictions, and research has shown it to be effective.When a person is trying to quit smoking, for instance, the instinct is to remove all smoking paraphernalia from his presence. While this [...] "out of sight, out of mind" [...] approach seems to make sense, it does nothing to actually deal with the emotionally driven <b>urge</b> to smoke. CBTraining contends that, in fact, this white-knuckled method of willpower only lends the <b>urge</b> more power. With <b>urge</b> conditioning/desensitization, the participant is asked to actually create <b>urges</b> in order to become comfortable with having them. As the strategic format of CBTraining unfolds through the training, the <b>urges</b> are methodically stripped of their power.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Drinking <b>urges</b> during {{treatment}} for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are common, can cause distress and predict relapse. Clients {{may have little}} awareness of how their drinking <b>urges</b> {{might be expected to}} change during AUD treatment in general and in response to initiating abstinence. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test whether drinking <b>urges</b> change on a daily level during treatment and after initiating abstinence. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis was performed using daily drinking <b>urge</b> ratings from two randomized clinical trials. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Women (n = 98) and men (n = 79) with AUDs in separate clinical trials of out-patient AUD-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Daily dichotomous indicators of any drinking <b>urges</b> or acute escalations in <b>urges</b> (i. e. at least two more <b>urges</b> compared with the previous day) were examined using generalized linear mixed growth-curve modeling. FINDINGS: Participants who initiated abstinence reported reductions in <b>urges</b> immediately thereafter (log odds ratios: women B = - 0. 701, P 3 ̆c 0. 001; men B = - 0. 628, P = 0. 018), followed by additional, gradual reductions over time (women B = - 0. 118, P 3 ̆c 0. 001; men B = - 0. 141, P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Participants who entered treatment abstaining from alcohol also reported significant reductions in <b>urges</b> over time (women B = - 0. 147, P 3 ̆c 0. 001; men B = - 0. 142, P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Participants who drank throughout treatment had smaller (women B = - 0. 042, P = 0. 012) or no reductions in <b>urges</b> (men B = 0. 015, P = 0. 545). There was no evidence that <b>urges</b> increased systematically in response to initiating abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Drinking <b>urges</b> during out-patient behavioral {{treatment for}} alcohol use disorders may be maintained in part by alcohol consumption. Initiating abstinence is associated with reductions in drinking <b>urges</b> immediately and then more gradually over time...|$|R
