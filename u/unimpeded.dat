5|$|As the {{universe}} cooled, the rest mass energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate {{that of the}} photon radiation. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely <b>unimpeded.</b> This relic radiation {{is known as the}} cosmic microwave background radiation. The chemistry of life may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when {{the universe}} was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E
5|$|Organised {{into two}} groups, the Chindits' first {{operation}} (codenamed Longcloth) began on 8 February 1943. No. 2 Group, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel S.A. Cooke, was formed from the 13th King's and divided into five independent columns, {{two of which}} (Nos 7 and 8) were commanded by majors from the battalion. No Japanese opposition was encountered initially, allowing the Chindits to cross the Chindwin River and advance into Burma <b>unimpeded.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gia Long tolerated the Catholic {{faith of}} his French allies and {{permitted}} <b>unimpeded</b> missionary activities {{out of respect}} to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At {{the time of his}} death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Hargood sailed from Macau {{with the}} China Fleet on 7 February, passing <b>unimpeded</b> into the Indian Ocean. Alava did belatedly send Europa and frigate Fama back to Macau in May, but this {{achieved}} nothing. Rainier {{ensured that the}} 1800 China Fleet was well defended, but no further attacks were made on British shipping from China before the Peace of Amiens in 1802. Early in the Napoleonic Wars, in 1804, a powerful French squadron attacked the China Fleet at the Battle of Pulo Aura, but the East Indiamen succeeded in bluffing the French into withdrawing after a brief exchange of fire.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of Chester Cathedral gives {{a warm and}} mellow appearance because of the pinkish colour of the sandstone. The proportions appear spacious because {{the view from the}} west end of the nave to the east end is <b>unimpeded</b> by a pulpitum and the nave, although not long, is both wide and high compared with many of England's cathedrals. The piers of the nave and choir are widely spaced, those of the nave carrying only the clerestory of large windows with no triforium gallery. The proportions are made possible partly because the ornate stellar vault, like that at York Minster, is of wood, not stone.|$|E
5|$|After a short return, Georgia QB Stafford {{went to work}} on the Georgia 24-yard line. Two {{incomplete}} {{passes and}} one sack later, Georgia was again punting. Virginia Tech again was in excellent field position, starting on their own 47-yard line. Instead of rushing the ball, as had been the trend for the Tech offense up to that point, Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer called for a trick play. At the snap, quarterback Sean Glennon lateraled the football to wide receiver Eddie Royal. Rather than running the ball, Royal threw the ball downfield, catching the Georgia defense off guard. Tight end Sam Wheeler, the target of the throw, had been left uncovered by a defense expecting a run. The pass was completed, and Wheeler ran <b>unimpeded</b> 53yards for a touchdown. The play took 19seconds to execute, and gave Virginia Tech a 21–3 lead with 4:00 remaining in the half.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Howe defied naval {{convention}} {{by ordering}} his fleet to turn towards the French {{and for each}} of his vessels to rake and engage their immediate opponent. This unexpected order was not understood by all of his captains, {{and as a result}} his attack was more piecemeal than he intended. Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered; in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety <b>unimpeded</b> by Howe's fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade {{for the remainder of the}} war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.|$|E
5|$|Even faster {{weakening}} ensued through October24 as {{the hurricane}} traversed the Sierra Madre mountains; its eye disappeared from satellite imagery {{within hours of}} moving ashore. The system weakened below hurricane strength by 03:00UTC as it passed west of Guadalajara. Patricia accelerated inland between a trough over Northwestern Mexico and the ridge over the Gulf of Mexico. Convection dramatically decreased in organization and the low- and mid- to upper-level circulation centers of the cyclone soon decoupled. The system degraded into a tropical depression by 12:00UTC as little organized convection remained, and the storm dissipated shortly thereafter over central Mexico. <b>Unimpeded</b> by the mountains of Mexico, the mid- to upper-level circulation of Patricia, accompanied by considerable moisture, continued northeast and interacted with a cold front over the western Gulf of Mexico. The new system produced flooding rains across large areas of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas.|$|E
5|$|L'Hermite's {{three other}} ships all survived the {{hurricane}} relatively intact {{and were able}} to continue their journey to Europe <b>unimpeded,</b> the British squadrons in the area also dispersed by the summer storms. In late September the squadron broke up, Régulus sailing for Brest and arriving on 5 October, the only French ship of the line to enter or leave the port all year. Président was less successful: at 03:30 on 27 September, while sailing in the Bay of Biscay at , Captain Labrosse sighted six ships of the line. This overwhelming force was a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis, which had been sent to the Bay of Biscay to await the return of Willaumez from the Caribbean. Immediately giving chase, Louis found that his ships of the line were not fast enough to catch the French frigate, which began to outdistance {{the main body of the}} squadron. However one of the small 18-gun sloops attached to the squadron, HMS Despatch under Captain Edward Hawkins was able to keep pace with the frigate, coming within firing range at 18:45.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{created the}} first chance {{of the game in}} the 20th minute. A pass from John Barnes sent Steve Nicol clear to shoot, but his effort saw the ball roll wide of the far post. Liverpool created a further {{opportunity}} six minutes after – from a free-kick delivered by Barnes on the left, Rush managed to outjump his marker and head the ball {{in the direction of the}} Arsenal goal. It however hit the near post and rebounded in the direction of Arsenal goalkeeper John Lukic. Minutes after the half-hour mark, Liverpool scored the opening goal – a long ball from Barry Venison went behind the Arsenal defence and reached Peter Beardsley. <b>Unimpeded,</b> he controlled the ball and shot it with his right foot to score. Arsenal's Kevin Richardson missed a chance to level the scoreline after good play by Lee Dixon; from outside the penalty box he scuffed his shot and the ball went over the crossbar.|$|E
5|$|Louisville {{took over}} on offense needing {{to get a}} {{touchdown}} to regain a lead before the waning clock finally ran out of time. After the Tech kickoff and a touchback, the Cardinals took over at their 20-yard line. Michael Bush ran for 10yards and a first down, and Hunter Cantwell scrambled for six more on a rushing play. Facing third down and needing four yards, Cantwell dropped back to pass for the first down. As the pass soared through the air, Tech defender James Anderson jumped and caught the ball, intercepting it. Still on his feet, Anderson quickly rushed the other way and, <b>unimpeded,</b> ran 39yards {{into the end zone}} for a Virginia Tech touchdown. The score and extra point energized Virginia Tech's offense and defense and gave the Hokies an 11-point lead—35–24—with 4:45 remaining in the game.|$|E
5|$|The Austro-Hungarian assault {{began at}} Lazarevac, a {{strategically}} located town {{just south of}} Belgrade whose capture would have given them access to the Mladenovac railway line {{and the ability to}} outflank the Serbian forces holding the road to Belgrade. Further south, the Austro-Hungarians attacked the Serbian 1st Army. During this assault, they made the mistake of attacking its stronger right flank and were met with determined Serbian resistance which prevented them from gaining any ground. Military historian David Jordan notes that had the Austro-Hungarians attacked the junction splitting the 1st and Užice armies, they {{might have been able to}} split the Serbs down the centre and gotten hold of an <b>unimpeded</b> passage to the Morava River. The Serbian 1st Army was quick to reinforce its left flank, realizing that any subsequent attack against it would be far less easy to repel.|$|E
5|$|The {{floods and}} mudslides killed {{many people in}} Haiti, {{although}} the exact total will likely never be known. On November19, officials reported 531deaths, and by two days later the total was potentially as high as 2,000. On November24, the death toll reached 824, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported on December21 that Gordon killed 1,122people in the country. Most of the deaths occurred in Port-au-Prince, Jacmel, and Léogâne. Damage was heavier in Haiti than elsewhere along Gordon's track due to poor infrastructure consisting of shacks on flood-prone denuded hills. The country suffers large death tolls from many hurricanes, caused in part by human activity. Large-scale deforestation left Haiti with about 1.4% of its forests as of 2004, leaving denuded mountain slopes that allows rainwater to wash down <b>unimpeded.</b> The lack of tree cover contributed to the devastating floods that caused most of Gordon's deaths.|$|E
5|$|Tigranes, who was {{residing}} at Tigranocerta in {{the summer}} of 69, was not only astonished by the speed of Lucullus' rapid advance into Armenia but {{by the fact that he}} had even launched such an operation in the first place. Unable to reconcile with this reality for a certain period of time, he belatedly sent a general named Mithrobarzanes with 2,000 to 3,000 cavalrymen to slow down Lucullus' advance but his forces were cut to pieces and routed by the 1,600 cavalry led by Sextilius, one of the legates serving under Lucullus. Learning of Mithrobarzanes' defeat, Tigranes entrusted the defense of his namesake city to Mancaeus and left to recruit a fighting force in the Taurus Mountains. Nevertheless, Lucullus' legates were able to disrupt two separate detachments coming to the aid of Tigranes and even located and engaged the king's forces in a canyon in the Taurus. Lucullus, nevertheless, chose not to pursue Tigranes while he had an <b>unimpeded</b> path towards Tigranocerta; he advanced and began to lay siege to it.|$|E

25|$|In {{order for}} an {{electrostatic}} discharge to occur, two preconditions are necessary: firstly, a sufficiently high electric potential between two regions of space must exist, and secondly a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free, <b>unimpeded</b> equalization {{of the opposite}} charges.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} views will be {{obstructed}} due to new {{construction in the}} immediate future. After more than 40 years of <b>unimpeded</b> north and northwest views, in spring 2006 construction began on vacant lots immediately northwest of the towers {{at the intersection of}} North Dearborn and West Kinzie Streets for separate projects, including a mid-rise hotel and a high-rise office building, which will partially obscure views from Marina City in these directions. Also in 2006, site preparation began on a high-rise office building west of Marina City at North LaSalle Street and the Chicago River which, when completed, will eliminate the <b>unimpeded</b> view of the western horizon from Marina City's uppermost floors and roofdecks.|$|E
25|$|By this time, {{there were}} few canals in Ohio still in operation, {{but many of them}} {{remained}} intact across the state. To alleviate flooding conditions, local government leaders used dynamite to remove the locks in the canals to allow the water to flow <b>unimpeded.</b> This destruction ended the era of canal transportation in Ohio history.|$|E
25|$|Dulles's iconic main {{terminal}} houses ticketing, baggage claim, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, an international arrivals building for passenger processing, the Z gates, information facilities and other support facilities. The terminal {{was recognized by}} the American Institute of Architects in 1966 for its design concept; its roof is a suspended catenary providing a wide enclosed area <b>unimpeded</b> by any columns.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} {{differs from}} maximum life span. Life expectancy is an average {{for all people}} in the population — including those who die shortly after birth, those who die in early adulthood (e.g. childbirth, war), and those who live <b>unimpeded</b> until old age. Lifespan is an individual-specific concept — maximum lifespan is therefore an upper bound rather than an average.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} keep the {{interior}} uncluttered, a number of convenience functions were integrated into multifunction controls. For example, the power windows and mirrors were controlled by a single instrument. Also, the center-mounted instrument cluster was canted slightly toward the driver. The displacement of these gauges {{to the middle of the}} dash was intended to offer an <b>unimpeded</b> view of the hood and the road ahead.|$|E
25|$|The {{neutrino}} is {{so named}} because it is electrically neutral and because its rest mass is so small (-ino) that it was originally thought to be zero. The weak force has a very short range, gravity is extremely weak on the subatomic scale, and neutrinos, as leptons, {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction. Thus, neutrinos typically pass through normal matter <b>unimpeded</b> and undetected.|$|E
25|$|The view southward, {{particularly}} from the lower cairn is unexpectedly good. Looking directly down the Glenderaterra Valley and the Vale of St John, the gap gives an <b>unimpeded</b> view as far as Loughrigg and Steel Fell. Additionally above the flanks of Lonscale Fell Great Gable and the Scafells appear. The nearer fells by contrast turn their backs upon Great Calva, the northward vista being less inspiring.|$|E
25|$|A {{convertible}} {{is a type}} {{of automobile}} in which the roof can retract and fold away having windows which wind-down inside the doors, converting it from an enclosed to an open-air vehicle. Many different automobile body styles are manufactured and marketed in convertible form. Ben P. Ellerbeck conceived the first practical retractable hardtop system in 1922—a manually operated system on a Hudson coupe that allowed <b>unimpeded</b> use of the rumble seat even with the top down.|$|E
25|$|The Taukkyan Roadblock was an {{engagement}} in the Burma campaign in World War II. It {{was an attempt to}} clear a roadblock held by elements of the Japanese 33rd Division, which was preventing the evacuation of the main force of the Burma Army from Rangoon. After heavy fighting throughout 7 March 1942, and a counterattack that night, the roadblock was taken on the early morning of 8 March, with little resistance. As a result, the Burma Army was able to withdraw northwards <b>unimpeded,</b> and avoid being captured in Rangoon by the Japanese forces.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} around Croton {{continued in}} 203 BC, but as Livy puts it himself, {{there are no}} clear accounts of the events. Livy is particularly suspicious of a story that the consul Cnaeus Servilius Caepio killed 5,000 Carthaginian soldiers in a pitched battle. One thing is sure – Servilius could not prevent Hannibal from departing safely to Africa. Appian informs that for the transportation of his veterans Hannibal even built more ships {{in addition to the}} fleet that arrived in Croton from Carthage. This was <b>unimpeded</b> by the Romans.|$|E
25|$|The Chords Bridge is a {{cantilever}} spar {{cable-stayed bridge}} {{designed by the}} Spanish architect and engineer Santiago Calatrava, built for the light rail, close to {{the most frequently used}} entrance to Jerusalem, in the neighborhood of Kiryat Moshe. The bridge carries the trams in a grade separated manner over a busy road intersection. Incorporated in the bridge is a glass-sided pedestrian crossing, enabling pedestrians to cross <b>unimpeded</b> from the Kiryat Moshe area to the Central Bus Station grounds. The bridge, which cost about $70 million (NIS 246 million), was inaugurated on June 25, 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 1858, Charles Rigault de Genouilly {{attacked}} Vietnam {{under the}} orders of Napoleon III following the failed mission of diplomat Charles de Montigny. His stated mission was to stop the persecution of Catholic missionaries {{in the country and}} assure the <b>unimpeded</b> propagation of the faith. Rigault de Genouilly, with 14 French gunships, 3,000 men and 300 Filipino troops provided by the Spanish, attacked the port of Đà Nẵng in 1858, causing significant damages, and occupying the city. After a few months, Rigault had to leave the city due to supply issues and illnesses.|$|E
25|$|Using neutrinos as a probe {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the mid-20th century {{as a way to}} detect conditions {{at the core of the}} Sun. The solar core cannot be imaged directly because electromagnetic radiation (such as light) is diffused by the great amount and density of matter surrounding the core. On the other hand, neutrinos pass through the Sun with few interactions. Whereas photons emitted from the solar core may require 40,000 years to diffuse to the outer layers of the Sun, neutrinos generated in stellar fusion reactions at the core cross this distance practically <b>unimpeded</b> at nearly the speed of light.|$|E
25|$|When {{the area}} came under French colonial control in 1898, as French Sudan, the French {{authorities}} formally abolished slavery in 1905. Despite this declaration, traditional patterns of servitude persisted. Although some slaves left their positions of servitude following {{the declaration of}} 1905, many remained and {{in much of the}} country, slavery continued more or less <b>unimpeded.</b> With the political opening of the creation of the French Fourth Republic in 1946, large number of slaves left their positions and the slavery issue became a key political issue for the Sudanese Union – African Democratic Rally (US-RDA) party.|$|E
25|$|Gravitational waves {{have two}} {{important}} and unique properties. First, {{there is no}} need for any type of matter to be present nearby in order for the waves to be generated by a binary system of uncharged black holes, which would emit no electromagnetic radiation. Second, gravitational waves can pass through any intervening matter without being scattered significantly. Whereas light from distant stars may be blocked out by interstellar dust, for example, gravitational waves will pass through essentially <b>unimpeded.</b> These two features allow gravitational waves to carry information about astronomical phenomena heretofore never observed by humans, and as such represent a revolution in astrophysics.|$|E
25|$|In 1664, {{following}} the First Anglo-Dutch War, King Charles II of Great Britain had New Netherland seized. The settlement around the fort was renamed Albany. Worship continued <b>unimpeded</b> at the church, {{even as the}} Dutch briefly assumed control of the colony again during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. In 1686, the city was incorporated under British sovereignty as {{the capital of the}} Province of New York. Its founding document, the Dongan Charter, gave the church title to the pastures then south of the city as partial payment for a loan; the church rented the lots out to local farmers.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the system}} worked {{when it came}} to quelling rebellions, it was a failure in {{defending}} China and asserting its power. The Song had to rely on new gunpowder weapons introduced during the late Tang and bribes to fend off attacks by its enemies, such as the Khitan, Tanguts, Jurchens, and Mongols, as well as an expanded army of over 1 million men. In addition, the Song was greatly disadvantaged by the fact their neighbors had taken advantage of the era of chaos following the collapse of the Tang to advance into Northern China <b>unimpeded.</b> The Song also lost the horse-producing regions which made their cavalry extremely inferior.|$|E
