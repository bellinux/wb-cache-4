5|$|A {{key point}} of {{contention}} in the case was the <b>unmatched</b> left leg found after the bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined {{to be that of}} Lakesha Levy, a female member of the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to be re-opened so that her leg could replace another <b>unmatched</b> leg that had previously been buried with her remains. The <b>unmatched</b> leg had been embalmed, which prevented authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine the leg's owner. Jones argued that the leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe #2. The prosecution disputed the claim, saying that the leg could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg.|$|E

5|$|The twenty-five {{square foot}} Cori {{laboratory}} at Washington University was deemed a National Historic Landmark by the American Chemical Society. Not {{only did the}} Coris conduct groundbreaking research there, but they mentored many scientists. Six of these {{went on to win}} Nobel Prizes, which is <b>unmatched</b> in scientific history.|$|E
5|$|Kraków {{contains}} also {{an outstanding}} collection of monuments of Jewish sacred architecture <b>unmatched</b> anywhere in Poland. Kraków was an influential centre of Jewish spiritual life before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, with all its manifestations of religious observance from Orthodox to Chasidic and Reform flourishing side by side. There were at least 90 synagogues in Kraków active before the Nazi German invasion of Poland, serving its burgeoning Jewish community of 60,000–80,000 (out of the city's total population of 237,000), established since the early 12th century.|$|E
5|$|The Round Church was <b>unmatched</b> in its ceramic {{decoration}} by any {{church in}} Preslav, {{and was the}} only known building {{in the city to}} rely heavily on polychrome ceramic tiles. Ceramic and mosaic icons were a highlight of the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of the images were enclosed in ellipses.|$|E
5|$|Williams' {{popularity}} {{is said to}} be <b>unmatched</b> in Canadian political history; his high approval ratings lasted right up until his retirement. Although Williams' premiership was considered quite controversial in Canada at large, except for his first year in office, his own provincial approval ratings and those of his government have been consistently in the seventy to eighty percent range {{for the majority of the}} time he was in office. According to polling organisation Corporate Research Associates (CRA), Williams remains by far the most popular provincial or federal leader in the country.|$|E
5|$|With Soishiro Satake, Maeda {{formed the}} head of the second {{generation}} of Kodokan judoka, which had replaced the first {{by the beginning of the}} 20th century. Satake, at 175cm and 80kg, was <b>unmatched</b> in amateur sumo but admitted that he himself was not able to match Maeda in judo. Satake would later travel to South America with Maeda and settle in Manaus, Amazonas State, while Maeda continued traveling. Satake would become the founder, in 1914, of the first historically registered judo academy in Brazil. He and Maeda are considered the pioneers of judo in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{window on}} the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, which used Hubble's <b>unmatched</b> {{sensitivity}} at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new {{window on the}} early Universe. The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery {{of some of the}} most distant objects yet discovered, such as MACS0647-JD.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 646people {{were inside}} the building when the bomb exploded. By {{the end of the}} day, 14 adults and 6 children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. The toll eventually reached 168confirmed dead, not including an <b>unmatched</b> left leg that could have belonged to an unidentified 169th victim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 who were in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one woman in a parking lot across the street, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building, and a rescue worker struck on the head by debris.|$|E
5|$|At the 1910 election, Labour gained sixteen {{additional}} {{seats to}} hold a total of forty-two of the seventy-five House of Representatives' seats, and all eighteen Senate seats up for election {{to hold a}} total of twenty-two out of thirty-six seats. This gave Labour control of both upper and lower houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry, Australia's first elected federal majority government, Australia's first elected Senate majority, and the world's first Labour Party majority government. The 113 acts passed {{in the three years}} of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period. The 1910–13 Fisher government represented the culmination of Labour's involvement in politics, and was a period of reform <b>unmatched</b> in the Commonwealth until the 1940s, under John Curtin and Ben Chifley.|$|E
5|$|Hydraulic mining, which Pliny {{referred}} to as ruina montium ("ruin of the mountains"), allowed base and precious metals to be extracted on a proto-industrial scale. The total annual iron output is estimated at 82,500tonnes. Copper was produced {{at an annual rate}} of 15,000t, and lead at 80,000t, both production levels <b>unmatched</b> until the Industrial Revolution; Hispania alone had a 40% share in world lead production. The high lead output was a by-product of extensive silver mining which reached 200t per annum. At its peak around the mid-2nd century AD, the Roman silver stock is estimated at 10,000t, five to ten times larger than the combined silver mass of medieval Europe and the Caliphate around 800AD. As an indication of the scale of Roman metal production, lead pollution in the Greenland ice sheet quadrupled over its prehistoric levels during the Imperial era, and dropped again thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{the first}} Ranfurly Shield match was played. The shield, a provincial {{challenge}} trophy won by defeating the holder, {{was to become}} the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby. Due to their <b>unmatched</b> provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield. The first shield challenge was played against Wellington, who were not expected to pose much of a threat. Auckland had not lost at home in six years, but, with Cunningham in the side, Auckland lost 6–3. The second notable match that season was against the touring British Isles who were conducting a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The Aucklanders defeated the British Isles side 13–0, with Cunningham scoring a try and contributing significantly to the dominance of his team's forwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 {{the first}} Ranfurly Shield match was played. The shield, a provincial {{challenge}} trophy won by defeating the holder, {{was to become}} the most prestigious trophy in domestic New Zealand rugby. Due to their <b>unmatched</b> provincial record at the time Auckland were awarded the shield. The first shield challenge was played against Wellington, who were not expected to pose much of a threat. Auckland had not lost at home in six years, but, with Gallaher in the side, were upset 6–3 by the Wellingtonians. Gallaher was then selected for the New Zealand team that faced the touring British Isles in what was New Zealand's first Test match on home soil. The British team were conducting a tour of Australia and New Zealand, and had finished their Australian leg unbeaten.|$|E
5|$|Kyousuke's {{younger sister}} is Rin Natsume, the main heroine of Little Busters!, and is {{initially}} {{the only female}} member of the Little Busters. She does not communicate well with others due to her poor social skills and {{can be seen as}} inarticulate. Due to this, she is shy, and is usually seen alone. Rin loves cats and at school takes care of several strays. Riki's roommate and fellow member of the Little Busters is Masato Inohara who loves to work out and improve his muscle mass. He has a particular fondness for Riki, which he is more than willing to express out aloud. Masato's rival and fellow member of the Little Busters is Kengo Miyazawa who is skilled in the art of kendo and seemingly has a cynical personality, but his passion for the Little Busters is <b>unmatched</b> by any of the other members.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{won every}} {{game in the}} 1948 season, a feat that went <b>unmatched</b> until the Miami Dolphins (coached by Brown disciple Don Shula) did it in 1972. Cleveland then won the AAFC {{championship}} {{for the fourth time}} in a row in 1949. By then, however, the league was struggling for survival, {{due in part to the}} Browns' dominance. Attendance at games dwindled in 1948 and 1949 as fans lost interest in lopsided victories, and at the end of the 1949 season the AAFC dissolved. Three of its teams, the San Francisco 49ers, the Baltimore Colts and the Browns, merged into the NFL. The Browns picked up a few good former AAFC players from other teams, including offensive guard Abe Gibron and defensive end Len Ford, but some observers saw Brown's team as the lone standout in an otherwise minor league.|$|E
5|$|The Marx Brothers {{had been}} stage {{performers}} {{since the early}} 1900s. By the 1930s, their act consisted of wisecracking leader Groucho, the chronically silent Harpo, the overly ethnic Chico, and the strangely normal Zeppo. The plot of the seminal comedy Duck Soup (1933) is quite convoluted. Groucho's plebeian character is named king of the fictional Freedonia, and he is pursued by two bumbling spies played by Chico and Harpo. Zeppo plays a typically normal secretary. Groucho's con artist character leads Freedonia into war with neighboring Sylvania. The plot essentially exists to {{provide a framework for}} several comedic bits and long sketches. The film was unsuccessful at the box office and the anarchic zaniness and subversive nature of the comedy in the film would be <b>unmatched</b> in the brothers' post-Code work, which was more standardly burlesque.|$|E
5|$|The Mycenaean Greeks {{were also}} pioneers {{in the field}} of engineering, {{launching}} large-scale projects <b>unmatched</b> in Europe until the Roman period, such as fortifications, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, dams and roads suitable for wheeled traffic. They also made several architectural innovations, such as the relieving triangle. They were also responsible for transmitting a wide range of arts and crafts, especially of Minoan origin. The Mycenaean civilization was in general more advanced compared to the Late Bronze Age cultures of the rest of Europe. Several Mycenaean attributes and achievements were borrowed or held in high regard in later periods; so, it would be no exaggeration to consider Mycenaean Greece as a cradle of civilization.|$|E
5|$|The hoard {{contains}} about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; {{the number is}} imprecise because there are <b>unmatched</b> broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (piperatoria); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that {{the owners of the}} Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are gilded in parts to accentuate the decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Triggers six playable {{characters}} (plus one optional character) {{come from}} different eras of history. Chrono Trigger begins in AD 1000 with Crono, Marle and Lucca. Crono is the silent protagonist, {{characterized as a}} fearless young man who wields a katana in battle. Marle (Princess Nadia) lives in Guardia Castle; though sheltered, at heart she's a princess who enjoys hiding her royal identity. Lucca {{is a friend of}} Crono's and a mechanical genius; her home is filled with laboratory equipment and machinery. From the era of AD 2300 comes Robo, or Prometheus (designation R-66Y), a robot with near-human personality created to assist humans. Lying dormant in the future, Robo is found and repaired by Lucca, and joins the group out of gratitude. The fiercely confident Ayla dwells in 65,000,000 BC. <b>Unmatched</b> in raw strength, Ayla is the chief of Ioka Village and leads her people in war against a species of humanoid reptiles known as Reptites.|$|E
5|$|Maccabi Tel Aviv have {{a record}} 23 cup titles, {{followed}} by Hapoel Tel Aviv, who have 15, including two <b>unmatched</b> runs of {{three in a row}} (1937 to 1939, and 2010 to 2012). The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the next most successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major Tel Aviv clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba are presently the only club with more than one final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three times, every time they have reached it. By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon Tel Aviv have yet to lift the trophy. The most decisive cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar Tel Aviv beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E
5|$|On the hardwood, he was {{considered}} the consummate defensive center, noted for his <b>unmatched</b> defensive intensity, his stellar basketball IQ and his sheer will to win. Russell excelled at playing man-to-man defense, blocking shots, and grabbing defensive and offensive rebounds. Opponent Wilt Chamberlain said Russell's timing as a shot-blocker was unparalleled. Russell “was the smartest player ever {{to play the game}} ” according to Bill Bradley, Russell’s erstwhile Knicks opponent writing in 2009. He also could score with putbacks and made mid-air outlet passes to point guard Bob Cousy for easy fast break points. He also was known as a fine passer and pick-setter, featured a decent left-handed hook shot and finished strong on alley oops. However, on offense, Russell's output was limited. His NBA career personal averages show him to be an average scorer (15.1 points career average), a poor free throw shooter (56.1%), and average overall shooter from the field (44%, not exceptional for a center). In his 13 years, he averaged a relatively low 13.4 field goals attempted (normally, top scorers average 20 and more), illustrating that he was never {{the focal point of the}} Celtics offense, instead focusing on his tremendous defense.|$|E
5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the homologous chromosomes from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be <b>unmatched</b> when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
5|$|The main villain of Crimson Echoes is King Zeal, revived by Lavos {{through the}} Frozen Flame. Confused and {{saddened by the}} loss of his kingdom, he is easily {{manipulated}} by Lavos, who uses him to attempt revenge on Crono and his friends. He later learns of his deception, and seeks to dominate Lavos and recreate his kingdom through <b>unmatched</b> temporal power. While under Lavos's influence, he recruits Dalton and Kasmir to his cause. Kasmir is an illusionist who served under Magus in the Mystic War. King Zeal gives him the Masamune, and he assumes leadership of the Mystics after 600A.D. Other foes come from the Reptite timeline, an alternate universe temporarily brought into existence by King Zeal's meddling. They number the Dragon God—a Reptite artificial intelligence created in an alternate timeline—and the Xamoltan time travelers, who were used by King Zeal and survive into the restored human world. The party also visit 1A.D., the era of the founding of Guardia. There, they meet Cedric the Executor, the ruthless first King of Guardia, as well as Antaeus, the ancestor of Porre.|$|E
25|$|Let our graph {{have two}} {{partitions}} U, V. The key {{idea is to}} add two dummy vertices {{on each side of}} the graph: uDummy connecting it to all <b>unmatched</b> vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all <b>unmatched</b> vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an <b>unmatched</b> vertex in U to <b>unmatched</b> vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.|$|E
25|$|In {{constructing}} matchings in undirected graphs, it {{is important}} to find alternating paths, paths of vertices that start and end at <b>unmatched</b> vertices, in which the edges at odd positions in the path are not part of a given partial matching and in which the edges at even positions in the path are part of the matching. By removing the matched edges of such a path from a matching, and adding the <b>unmatched</b> edges, one can increase the size of the matching. Similarly, cycles that alternate between matched and <b>unmatched</b> edges are of importance in weighted matching problems.|$|E

25|$|The couple {{earned the}} first perfect 40 {{of the series}} for their salsa in the semi-finals, {{followed}} by an additional 3 in the finals giving them a perfect total of 120 points, a feat <b>unmatched</b> {{in the history of}} the competition. On 20 December 2014, the couple were crowned the champions of the series.|$|E
25|$|After Rich’s passing, {{pantomime}} {{was criticized}} as losing the artistry he exhibited with his performances, relying instead more on spectacle and choral numbers. It wasn't until after his death, {{that many of}} his rivals, David Garrick included, would recognize his work. Garrick even said his pantomime performances were <b>unmatched</b> in his time.|$|E
25|$|Salonikan Jews were {{unique in}} their {{participation}} in all economic niches, not confining their business to a few sectors, {{as was the case}} where Jews were a minority. They were active in all levels of society, from porters to merchants. Salonika had a large number of Jewish fishermen, <b>unmatched</b> elsewhere, even in present-day Israel.|$|E
25|$|The Qianlong Emperor {{began his}} reign with about 33.95 million silver taels in Treasury surplus. At {{the peak of}} his reign, around 1775, even with further tax cuts, the {{treasury}} surplus still reached 73.9 million silver taels, a record <b>unmatched</b> by his predecessors, the Kangxi and Yongzheng emperors, both of whom had implemented remarkable tax cut policies.|$|E
25|$|Taylor made {{a concerted}} effort to {{decrease}} the amount of sledging committed by his team, a trait that brought criticism of Australian teams during other eras.
