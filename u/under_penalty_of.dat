However, the rules also allow for less rigid enforcement in amateur events.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, an {{accounting}} teacher arrives, believing demonstrations {{are being held}} to determine which class will be cut, much to the anger of Ron. He gives a very boring accounting lecture, which puts Justin to sleep. The next day, Leslie is before the Pawnee Disciplinary Committee on charges of abuse of power. Leslie calls Justin as a witness and questions him {{as to whether he}} enjoyed the party, to which he answers an emphatic yes. Afterward, the committee rules no further action will be taken, mainly because Leslie turned herself in and paid $1,000 restitution to the recreation center so no classes would be cut. When Ann asks why she did it, Leslie said it was to get an honest answer from Justin about the date, <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> perjury. The episode ends with Justin encouraging Tom to ask Wendy out.|$|E

5|$|Michigan, led by {{the young}} and hot-headed Mason, responded {{with the passage of}} the Pains and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it a {{criminal}} offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip, <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> a fine up to $1,000, up to five years imprisonment at hard labor, or both. Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. Brown of the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E
5|$|One {{night during}} {{preparations}} for the expedition, the hermai, heads of the god Hermes on a plinth with a phallus, were mutilated throughout Athens. This was a religious scandal and {{was seen as a}} bad omen for the mission. Plutarch explains that Androcles, a political leader, used false witnesses who accused Alcibiades and his friends of mutilating the statues, and of profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries. Later his opponents, chief among them being Androcles and Thessalus, Cimon's son, enlisted orators to argue that Alcibiades should set sail as planned and stand trial on his return from the campaign. Alcibiades was suspicious of their intentions, and asked to be allowed to stand trial immediately, <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death, in order to clear his name. This request was denied, and the fleet set sail soon after, with the charges unresolved.|$|E

25|$|Societal {{attitudes towards}} {{same-sex}} relationships have varied {{over time and}} place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death.|$|E
25|$|In 1679 Pope InnocentXI {{publicly}} condemned sixty-five of {{the more}} radical propositions (stricti mentalis), taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, Suarez and other casuists as propositiones laxorum moralistarum and forbade anyone to teach them <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> excommunication. Despite this papal condemnation, both Catholicism and Protestantism {{permit the use of}} ambiguous and equivocal statements in specific circumstances.|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 17th century Jews began again to re-enter France. This resulted in a new edict of 23 April 1615 which forbade Christians, <b>under</b> the <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death and confiscation, to shelter Jews or to converse with them.|$|R

25|$|Brown consecrated Francis Schuckardt {{without a}} pontifical mandate (i.e. {{permission}} from the Pope), which is normally required by the Code of Canon Law <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> excommunication. However, traditionalists cite over a dozen historical instances where Bishops were legitimately consecrated {{in a period of}} sede vacante. Traditionalists also point out the superiority of the essential doctrine of Apostolic Authority over the changeable dictates of ecclesiastical law, and hold that Christ would not leave his flock without shepherds.|$|E
25|$|Today, Catalan is {{the main}} {{language}} of the Catalan autonomous government and the other public institutions that fall under its jurisdiction. Basic public education is given in Catalan, except for two hours per week of Spanish medium instruction. Businesses are required to display all information (e.g. menus, posters) in Catalan <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> fines. There is no obligation to display this information in either Occitan or Spanish, {{although there is no}} restriction on doing so in these or other languages. The use of fines was introduced in a 1997 linguistic law that aims to increase the public use of Catalan and defend the rights of Catalan speakers.|$|E
25|$|In quidditch, a {{power play}} arises when {{a member of}} the {{opposing}} team is given a yellow or red card. A player <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> yellow is given one minute within the penalty box or until the other team scores. If a player is granted a red card, another player must be substituted in the original's stead and must wait in the penalty box for two minutes (even if the other team scores). A player's second yellow becomes a red card. If the keeper is penalised, a chaser must be given the keeper headband and becomes the keeper in that player's place for a team can never be missing a keeper.|$|E
50|$|A sacrament may be {{administered}} validly, but illicitly, if a condition imposed by canon {{law is not}} observed.

25|$|With the {{collapse}} of official government sanctioned pagan rites, private cults attempted to infiltrate the temples.

25|$|Davis alleges {{the founders}} conspired to give {{themselves}} illicit distributions through a tax fraud scheme {{and that the}} founders also formed various competing companies with XanGo assets. He is also claiming that the founders took steps to freeze {{him out of the}} company ‚Äî ignoring Davis‚Äô objections to wrongful conduct, falsifying board minutes to reflect unanimous consent to actions to which he had voiced objections, XanGo employees were told not to talk to Davis <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> termination, that founders also falsely claimed to XanGo employees that he had resigned his position at XanGo and disparaged him. As a result, Davis said XanGo withheld bonus/distribution payments to Davis as well as discontinuing employee benefits.|$|E
25|$|His first orders {{included}} mandatory {{church attendance}} for all settlers (and piousness for white servants), the stocking of arms (swords and guns), and a curfew for black slaves. Additionally, {{a system of}} alarms were {{set up in the}} case of hostile ships. A settler who spotted a ship was to fire his gun and alert his neighbor, who would in turn alert the next. Any rule broken resulted in a fine of 10 to 1000 pounds of tobacco, depending on the offense. Taylor notes that none may leave the island without the governor's permission <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> 500 to 1000 pounds of tobacco, and that Dyppel was a strict disciplinarian in these matters.|$|E
25|$|After lengthy preparations, {{the fleet}} {{was ready to}} sail. The night before they were to leave, someone {{destroyed}} many of the hermai‚Äîthe stone markers representing Hermes, placed around the city for good luck. This event was taken very seriously by the Athenian people as it was considered a bad omen for the expedition, as well as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy to overthrow the government. According to Plutarch, Androcles, a political enemy of Alcibiades, used false witness to claim that Alcibiades {{and his friends were}} responsible. Alcibiades volunteered to be put on trial <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death in order to prove his innocence (wanting to avoid his enemies charging him, in his absence, with more false information), but this request was denied.|$|E

The bank or business will provide a Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification, or a similar form. The individual or entity must enter their TIN on the form and, if the account or investment will earn interest or dividends, also must certify {{that they are not}} subject to backup withholding due to previous under-reporting of interest and dividends.|$|R
25|$|Since Baptism {{can only}} be {{received}} once, the sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation is the principal means by which Catholics may obtain forgiveness for subsequent sin and receive God's grace and assistance not to sin again. This is based on Jesus' words to his disciples in the Gospel of John 20:21‚Äì23. A penitent confesses his sins to a priest who may then offer advice or impose a particular penance to be performed. The penitent then prays an act of contrition and the priest administers absolution, formally forgiving the person of his sins. A priest is forbidden <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> excommunication to reveal any matter heard under the seal of the confessional. Penance helps prepare Catholics before they can validly receive the Holy Spirit in the sacraments of Confirmation (Chrismation) and the Eucharist.|$|E
25|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, BJU and alumnus Billy Graham, who had {{attended}} Bob Jones College for one semester and received an honorary {{degree from the}} university in 1948, engaged in a controversy about the propriety of theological conservatives cooperating with theological liberals to support evangelistic campaigns, a controversy that widened an already growing rift between separatist fundamentalists and other evangelicals. Negative publicity caused by the dispute precipitated a decline in BJU enrollment of about 10% in the years 1956‚Äì59, and seven members of the university board (of about a hundred) also resigned in support of Graham, including Graham himself {{and two of his}} staff members. When, in 1966, Graham held his only American campaign in Greenville, the university forbade any BJU dormitory student from attending <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> expulsion. Enrollment quickly rebounded, and by 1970, there were 3300 students, approximately 60% more than in 1958.|$|E
25|$|The Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 {{was passed}} {{in order to protect}} Royal Navy ships, dockyards, and stores from damage; at the time, ships were built of {{flammable}} oak wood and tar, and the naval yards were full of these supplies. Punishment for violating the act was a death sentence. The first section created the offence of arson in the royal dockyards by making it an offence to burn or destroy Royal Navy ships, stores, or ammunition <b>under</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> death anywhere in the British Empire. The Act also provided that benefit of clergy was not an available defence for the crime. The second section also stated that offenders could be tried if the offence occurred anywhere outside of the realm. The act put a version of arson in statute law for the first time, as all arson previously had been under common law. Though Scotland had its own similar offence of wilful fire raising.|$|E
2500|$|The Lieber Code (1863) was {{the first}} {{codification}} of the international customary laws of land war and an important step towards humanitarian law.

60|$|The list is {{accordingly}} read over, and the householders of County Leitrim are {{summoned to}} appear and answer to their names <b>under</b> a <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> two pounds. A lamentable deficiency, however, is apparent; one only {{here and there}} answers to his name {{as it is called}} out in the sonorous and practised voice of the clerk of the crown. A notice is then given that they will be again invoked <b>under</b> a <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> ten pounds, which, in spite of the fear which pervades the minds of jurymen that this will be a lock-up affair, entailing a bedless night and a meagre supper, surreptitiously supplied through the windows of the court-house, has the desired effect, and Cornelius O'Reilly, Patrick Tierney, Anthony Reynolds, &c., &c., reply to the call, and the court becomes sufficiently full of strong, thick-set, comfortable men.|$|R
60|$|Another clause should be, {{that none}} of these twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty pounders may be {{suffered}} to marry, <b>under</b> the <b>penalty</b> <b>of</b> immediate deprivation, their marriages declared null, and their children bastards; for some desponding people, take the kingdom to be not in a condition of encouraging so numerous a breed of beggars.|$|R
