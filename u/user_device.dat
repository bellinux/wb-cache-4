50|$|There {{are three}} main {{initiation}} schemes: WLAN scanning initiation, user initiation and remotely managed initiation. In the WLAN scanning-based initiation the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> periodically performs WLAN scanning. When a known or an open Wi-Fi network is found, an offloading procedure is initiated. In the user-initiated mode, a user is prompted to select which network technology is used. This happens usually once per a network access session. In the remotely managed approach, a network server initiates each offloading procedure by prompting the connection {{manager of a}} specific <b>user</b> <b>device.</b> Operator-managed is a subclass of the remotely managed approach. In the operator-managed approach, the operator is monitoring its network load and user behavior. In the case of forthcoming network congestion, the operator initiates the offloading procedure.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{the term}} RAT {{is used in}} discussions of {{heterogeneous}} wireless networks. The term is used when a <b>user</b> <b>device</b> selects between the type of RAT being used to connect to the Internet. This is often performed similar to access point selection in IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) based networks.|$|E

40|$|Index Terms—Ad hoc {{wireless}} networks, information access, content distribution, mobile networks It {{is commonly}} acknowledged that <b>user</b> <b>devices</b> {{in the not-too-distant}} future will more and more resemble a communi-cation hub, sporting arrays of GPS navigators, web browsers, videogame consoles and screens flashing the latest news or local sightseeing information. In this context, most pieces of information are likely to be of general use, and therefore a sensible dissemination and caching policy would be desirable. In this work, we focus on such an environment: few and far between access points, or gateway nodes, in a highly-populated network area where <b>user</b> <b>devices</b> are equipped with a data cache and communicate through the ad hoc networking paradigm. <b>User</b> <b>devices</b> create a cooperative en...|$|R

5000|$|Both IEEE 802.11, which {{includes}} Wi-Fi, and IEEE 802.16, {{which includes}} WiMAX, define Peer-to-Peer (P2P) and wireless ad hoc networks, where an end user communicates to users or servers on another Local Area Network (LAN) using its access point or base station. However, 802.11 supports also direct ad hoc or {{peer to peer}} networking between end <b>user</b> <b>devices</b> without an access point while 802.16 end <b>user</b> <b>devices</b> must be in range of the base station.|$|R

50|$|A {{progressive}} download is {{the transfer}} of digital media files from a server to a client, typically using the HTTP protocol when initiated from a computer. The consumer may begin playback of the media before the download is complete. The key difference between streaming media and progressive download is in how the digital media data is received and stored by the end <b>user</b> <b>device</b> that is accessing the digital media.|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method for initial ranging in {{wireless}} communication systems is provided. A plurality of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) blocks are received by an OFDMA base station transceiver from {{a plurality of}} remote <b>user</b> <b>devices</b> in wireless communication with the base station. A ranging subchannel is extracted from the OFDM blocks. The number of active codes in the ranging subchannel is determined, active codes are identified, and carrier frequency offsets (CFOs) are estimated for each active code. Timing delays and power levels for each active code are then estimated. The estimated CFOs, timing delays, and power levels are broadcasted by the base station to the remote <b>user</b> <b>devices,</b> so that the <b>user</b> <b>devices</b> can utilize same to adjust transmission parameters to optimize power levels and synchronize communication with the base station...|$|R

50|$|More {{and more}} users have {{multiple}} devices with ad hoc connectivity. The data sets replicated on these devices {{need to be}} synchronized among an arbitrary number of servers. This is useful for backups and also for offline operation. Indeed, when user network conditions are not good, then the <b>user</b> <b>device</b> will selectively replicate a part of data that will be modified later and off-line. Once the network conditions become good, the device is synchronized. Two approaches exist to tackle the distributed synchronization issue: user-controlled peer-to-peer synchronization and cloud master-replica synchronization.|$|E
50|$|Security {{is not a}} {{major concern}} anymore, since {{critical}} data is stored on servers in highly secured data centers.

TLS (see IETF RFC 5246) and its predecessor SSL (see IETF RFC 6101) security protocol is deployed between the web server and the web browser on the end <b>user</b> <b>device.</b> Lost devices is not a problem since both the data and the programs reside on the servers housed in the data centers and not on the mobile devices.|$|E
