50|$|SLAs can be {{classified}} as short spindle, in which the <b>upper</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> on the spindle is inside the wheel, or long spindle, in which the spindle tucks around the tire and the <b>upper</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> sits above the tire.|$|E
50|$|Short spindle SLAs tend {{to require}} stiffer {{bushings}} at the body, as the braking and cornering forces are higher. Also {{they tend to}} have poorer kingpin geometry, due to the difficulty of packaging the <b>upper</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> and the brakes inside the wheel.|$|E
50|$|The {{caster angle}} or castor angle is the angular {{displacement}} of the steering axis from the vertical axis of a steered wheel in a car, motorcycle, bicycle or other vehicle, measured in the longitudinal direction. It is the angle between the pivot line (in a car an imaginary line {{that runs through the}} centre of the <b>upper</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> to the centre of the lower ball joint) and vertical. Car racers sometimes adjust caster angle to optimise their car's handling characteristics in particular driving situations.|$|E
2500|$|... 84–87 front {{suspension}} is a wider direct {{derivative of}} the Chevrolet Chevette and Pontiac T1000. It employs a double A-arm (or double wishbone) design common {{prior to the}} advent of struts, and has naturally good geometry. A drawback of this design, however, means that the car's front suspension has four <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Nevertheless, the tie-rods allow toe-in/out adjustability. Minimal camber adjustments exist on 1984 to 1987 models without an after-market upgrade that replaces the <b>upper</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> with slotted mounting points units. The joints have typical grease fittings for regular lubrication commonly found on pre-2000 autos.|$|R

50|$|The front {{suspension}} {{was closely}} derived from {{that on the}} Morris Minor, using longitudinal torsion bars for springing. The rest of the front suspension consisted of lower arms pivoting on trunnions with <b>upper</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> supporting the wheel and acting on hydraulic lever arm dampers. These provided superior ride comfort over rough roads when compared to early telescopic dampers, {{at the expense of}} 'sloppy' handling and body control at high speeds. Improvements in road surfaces, the development of the motorway network, the huge increase in the performance of even standard family cars and advances in the design of telescopic dampers since Minor was launched in 1948 made this type of damper wholly obsolete by 1971. Nonetheless this setup was adopted to keep development and tooling costs to a minimum.|$|R
5000|$|Chrysler's new {{electronic}} ignition system was standard equipment on all engines, and starter motors were revised for faster engine cranking. The K-frame was modified {{to accommodate a}} new spool-type engine mount that limited engine roll to 3°. The <b>upper</b> <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were upgraded to the larger B-body units. Along with these chassis changes, the wheel bolt pattern on Darts with disc brakes was enlarged from 4 in to the 4.5 in pattern common to the larger B- and C-body Chrysler-built passenger cars. Darts with 4-wheel drum brakes continued with the smaller bolt pattern. The standard rear axle was still the 7¼" [...] unit, but the heavy-duty option was now an 8¼" [...] item rather than the previous 8¾" [...] rear axle. Standard rear axle ratios were 2.76:1 with automatic transmission and 3.23:1 with manual, though other ratios were available. Vent wings were deleted from the Swinger but not from the 4-door sedans. A new [...] "Quiet Car" [...] package was available, consisting of extra sound insulation, premium exhaust hangers and an exhaust resonator.|$|R
50|$|The kingpin axis is {{the line}} between the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> of the hub. On a MacPherson strut, the top pivot point is the strut bearing, and the bottom point is the lower <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> The {{inclination}} of the steering axis is measured as the angle between the steering axis and the centerline of the wheel. This means that if the camber angle is adjustable within the pivot points the scrub radius can be changed, this alters the width and offset of the tires on a vehicle.|$|R

5000|$|In non-MacPherson strut {{automobile}} suspension, the two <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> {{are called}} the [...] "upper ball joint" [...] and [...] "lower ball joint". Lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> are sometimes larger and may wear out faster, because the fore and aft loads, primarily due to braking, are higher at the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> (Torque reaction and drag add at the bottom joint, and partly cancel at the top joint.) Also, lateral cornering loads are higher at the bottom joint. Depending on the suspension design, the vertical load from the suspension spring may be handled entirely by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or entirely by the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> The damper load, (which is low in normal conditions, zero when stationary, but in peak bump or rebound rate may be almost {{as large as the}} spring load) is usually, but not always, taken on the same <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> as the spring load. The anti-roll bar loading is often, but not always, taken on the bottom <b>ball</b> <b>joint.</b> It may be taken by the top <b>ball</b> <b>joint,</b> or directly from the steering knuckle by ball-jointed drop links.|$|R

5000|$|Sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> do {{not require}} {{lubrication}} as they are [...] "lubed for life". Formerly most <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> had grease fitting (sometimes called a grease zerk) and were designed for periodic addition of a lubricant, however almost all modern cars use sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to minimise maintenance requirements. The lubricant was usually a very high-viscosity lubricant. It is commonly believed that standard <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> will outlive sealed ones because eventually the seal will break, causing the joint to dry out and rust. [...] Additionally, the act of adding new lubricant pushes out old and dry lubricant, extending {{the life of the}} joint. This was supposed to be done at intervals of 1000 to 2000 miles on many vehicles, which is incompatible with the service interval on modern cars, often 12000 miles or more, and in any case was rarely attended to by owners, resulting in severe wear and possible <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> failure, which can result in serious accidents. For this reason, almost all <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> on modern European or Far Eastern cars are the sealed for life type. New technology especially applied to the internal bearing design has allowed <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to meet these longer service intervals. The special design's incorporate sintered metal bearings which replace OEM sealed polymer/plastic version and improved dust boot seal's that work much better at retaining the grease.|$|R

50|$|The SY II {{received}} a revised front suspension {{to address a}} well-documented weakness in the front lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints.</b> Specifically, the original design had the <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> under constant tension, which resulted in some complete failures of the joint (causing the wheel to detach from the suspension and steering) and premature wear requiring lower control arm replacements after as little as 30000 km. With the new design, the lower <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> were now under compression, thus eliminating the premature wear issue.|$|R
50|$|While {{there is}} no exact {{lifespan}} that can be put on sealed <b>ball</b> <b>joints,</b> they can fail as early as 80000 miles km in modern vehicles, and much sooner in older vehicles. Signs of a failing <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> may start with a sudden burst sound {{as a result of}} <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> dismantling. Then it keeps on with clicking, popping or snapping sound when the wheel is turned and eventually turn into a squeaking sound {{at the end of a}} stop, when the gas pedal is used and/or also when hitting bumps. Another symptom could be 'thud' noises coming from front suspension when going over bumps. Dry <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> have dramatically increased friction and can cause the steering to stick or be more difficult.|$|R
50|$|To {{permit a}} high degree of freedom, the control {{cylinders}} resemble typical miniature pneumatic or hydraulic cylinders, but mount the back of the cylinder on a <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> and threaded rod. This <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> permits the cylinders to float freely inside the frame, such as when the wrist joint rotates and flexes.|$|R
50|$|The two arms, the spindle, and the body, form a four-bar link. Use of {{the linkage}} {{at the lower}} {{suspension}} connection of either a MacPherson strut or a short long arms suspension readily gives an effective virtual <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> outboard of the spindle, which is very useful for a suspension designer, allowing negative scrub radius whilst allowing the <b>ball</b> <b>joints</b> to move in and thus {{out of the way}} of the brakes. Some manufacturers use a double <b>ball</b> <b>joint</b> arm to replace both wishbones on a short long arms suspension. This provides further opportunity for optimising the geometry.|$|R
