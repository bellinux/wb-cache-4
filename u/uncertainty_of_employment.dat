40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{as a result of}} the critical issue of the ageing population and the implications this will have on the workforce. An employment option for older workers is to become self-employed and to start their own small businesses, rather than to continue working in mainstream employment, which becomes increasing difficult as employees age. The option of self-employment may be a viable option for older people as <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> tenure in mainstream employment continues to increases over time and is a way to utilise work skills and competencies that have been acquired over years of work experience. The results show that self-employment is not necessarily a first choice for many older people, as the perceived high level of risk associated with starting a business is a significant barrier. For those that do start their own business, which is an increasing trend, the age of the new business owner has an influence on the type of business information and related training they require in order to operate their businesses successfully. The {{study was conducted}} in the first quarter of 2005 and employed both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. 270 small business owners participated in quantitative part of the study and an addition 15 older small business owners were interviewed in order to gain more in-depth insights into the issues facing older small business owners...|$|E

40|$|The {{changing}} {{requirements in}} the modern labour market {{have led to a}} new form of economic geography of employment, where skills, wages and the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> play a primary role in the spatial division of labour. The main purpose of this project is to investigate the use of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) as a tool to illustrate employment and unemployment in Östergötland County for giving information {{on the development of the}} labour market. In addition, the use of GIS for population data analysis with the help of Oracle’s map viewer is closely examined. This descriptive thesis reveals that the labour market is characterized by the geographic extension of the market and its determination by how far the supply and demand forces go and the important role that GIS plays in illustrating the distribution of workforce in Östergötland’s labour market. GIS is an analytical tool for employer/employee demographics that can be used for visualization but also for analysis and pre-processing purposes with the use of graphic tools. With the use of thematic maps, GIS can visualise spatial data with labour data according to certain demographic criteria. GIS technology has ways of mapping thematically the local labour market demand and supply. In addition, it is capable of constructing a comprehensive workforce development system that can integrate the job seekers and employers. GIS can facilitate the development of visual web-based mapping systems that allow users to investigate and find employees within various industries...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} labor contracts {{as a form}} {{of insurance}} contracts. It assumes that workers are risk averse with the time perspective (or planning period) of a worker combining a period of T distinct spells t, with length of a spell being the same for all workers (a spell might be a year for example). Workers are assumed to differ only according to their time perspective: For example some workers planning period may consist of only one spell (T= 1), while for others it may be three spells (T= 3). The analysis starts with the assumption that workers are hired on a neoclassical spot contract {{at the beginning of each}} spell. Then it shows that, if workers objective is to maximize the sum of their incomes over all spells in their planing period, income risk that derives from the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> caused by stochastical business cycles in each spell will be more threatening to workers with a shorter time perspective T than to those with a longer time perspective. Therefore, if a firm offers an institutionalized contract that bears no employment risk and covers the worker´s individual planning period T, the worker´s willingness to pay risk premiums by wage concessions decreases, the longer is his planning period. On this pure risk theoretical point of view, the firm will prefer workers with short individual planning periods in order to maximize their insurance premiums. Thus this paper contradicts the common argument that long term contracts are advantageous to firms...|$|E
40|$|Introduction : Nursing staff {{working with}} intellectually {{disabled}} in-patients experience unique stress {{factors that can}} influence their personal well-being and work performance. Objectives : To compile a profile of stress factors experienced by nursing staff working with intellectually disabled in-patients at the Free State Psychiatric Complex (FSPC). Methods : This descriptive study included 89 nursing staff members from this environment. A questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic information and determine personal and occupational stressors. The data were summarised by frequencies and percentages (categorical variables) and means or percentiles (numerical variables). Results : Most participants were aged between 46 and 55 (41. 2 %), female (93. 2 %) and black (93. 2 %), and 76. 7 % had children or dependant minors. The main stressors among participants were pressure providing financially {{for their children and}} dependant minors (71. 2 %), caring for them (39. 4 %) and fearing them moving away (25. 8 %). Occupational stressors included high workload (66. 3 %), lack of decision-making by superiors (58. 1 %), underpayment (53. 5 %), endangerment of physical health (52. 3 %) and safety (50. 0 %), working hours (51. 2 %), pressure of expectations from superiors (48. 8 %), <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> (48. 8 %), work responsibilities (47. 7 %) and perceiving that skills and training were not appreciated. They experienced stress regarding health issues such as hyper- and hypotension (35. 3 %). Because of stress 34. 5 % of participants took leave, 34. 5 % developed depression and 14. 3 % had panic attacks. Conclusion : Most of the respondents experienced personal and occupational stress that influenced their health, which poses serious challenges for the management of the FSPC. Security should be upgraded, medical and psychological support for the staff and care facilities for their dependants should be provided, and financial problems experienced by these staff members should be addressed. The workload of the nursing staff at FSPC needs urgent attention. This can be done by means of a workforce analysis to determine minimum staffing levels for nursing. <br /...|$|E

We consider a simple Dixit/Pindyck-style model {{to show that there}} is a negative relationship between exchange rate variability and job creation. The underlying idea is that <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> future earnings raises the “option value of waiting ” to create a job. It also turns out that a higher reservation wage, a better bargaining position of workers and higher costs of job creation strengthen the adverse impact <b>of</b> <b>uncertainty</b> on <b>employment.</b> Thus, the link between exchange rate variability and employment should be stronger in most European countries than in the US.

40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of {{secondary}} schools in the Kirinyaga district of Central Province of Kenya have experienced riots and boycotts. The major objective {{of this study was}} to understand why students disrupt the normal processes of schooling. Students 2 ̆ 7 perceptions were obtained by examining their attitudes, ideas, opinions, morals, and myths about these uprisings. The study was phenomenological in nature and was informed by the symbolic interactionism (Bogdan 2 ̆ 6 Biklen, 1992). Data were collected from six diverse secondary schools: three all boys schools, two all girls schools, and one co-educational school. Multiple sources of data and methods of collection allowed for triangulation. In-depth interviews were conducted with 29 ex-students, nine staff members, and one central office administrator. Interviews were open-ended, interactive, and designed to encourage the respondents to share their stories, beliefs, and standpoints. Written case histories, school-level and district-level documents, and students 2 ̆ 7 records helped contextualize the interviews and past events. Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis (Glaser 2 ̆ 6 Strauss, 1967). Respondents spoke to causes, dimensions, conditions, types, processes, and consequences of the disruptions. It was found that some disruptions were spontaneous and fueled by students 2 ̆ 7 established cultural norms which dictated fights for power and status. Other disruptions were carefully planned to draw the attention of school administrators and teachers to perceived grievances and issues that students cared about. The data also indicated that some of the disruptions were instigated by adult members of the community who were motivated by financial and power gains. Furthermore, respondents narrated experiences of physical hurt and psychological harm, plus damage to school property and financial losses incurred during riots and boycotts. It was observed that the secondary students were not motivated about their schooling experiences. For many students schools lacked relevance given the rapid changes and dislocations experienced by their culture, and the <b>uncertainties</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment.</b> The study acknowledges it is difficult for schools to respond adequately to deep-seated stresses of modernization processes. The study concludes by recommending fundamental changes in educational structure and certification in order to overcome archaic vestiges of the British system in formerly colonized Kenya...|$|R

Since 1992, the Ministry of Health of Indonesia (MOH-RI) has implemented a contract scheme for medical doctor in the HC. This study is an explorative study in searching major factors influencing the performance of contract medical doctor. Another objective {{of this study is to}} develop an approriate supervision model of the contract medical doctor in HC. Respondent consist of key policy makers at MOH-RI, provincial health officer and district health officer from Central Kalimantan, East Nusa Tenggara and South-East Sulawesi. Other respondent are 280 contract medical doctors who has been worked more than one year from 11 selected provinces. Focus group discussion, indepth interview and observation are used as the main methods for data collection at the policy makers level. Mailing questionaires are sent to the contract medical doctor as the main data collection method. The result of this study shows that age, motivation before and during employment, boring situation, job satisfaction and overtime of works are significant factors in influencing the performance of contract medical doctors. The most important finding is the <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> post <b>employment</b> contract that made low performance of contract medical doctors. The creation of good environment, team works, good and appropriate supervision, and orientation of the HC programs in matching with the need and demand of the local problems should be carried out in improving the contract medical doctors in HC. Post employment contract should be prepared appropriately by the MOH-RI in order to increase the performance of contract medical doctor optimally.   Key Word: contract medical doctor, performance. <br /...|$|R
40|$|Search {{frictions}} {{imply that}} is costly {{to find a}} good partner. As a result the decision to accept a partner takes into account the opportunity of finding an alternative, hence, the acceptance decision of an economic partnership is the answer to the question: is the quality of the partner good enough? Conversely, search frictions imply that once a good partner is found, it is costly to lose her, and this should if possible be avoided. This dissertation analyzes the effect of uncertainty in duration of good matches, and the investments an agent is willing to make ex ante in order to have good (enough) relationships. ^ To be concrete, I focus my attention on the uncertainty of losing one 2 ̆ 7 s partner {{over the course of a}} partnership, e. g. a worker losing a job at a firm, and how this uncertainty affects economic choices. For the worker this choice could be to take up alternative employment, for the firm which wages to pay to avoid turnover. Also, in a related setting but with different focus, I study the (signaling) investments an economic agent is willing to make to be accepted as a partner by other self-interested agents, when all agents are of different quality. ^ In the second chapter of this dissertation I look at the uncertainty about the duration of relationships caused by a termination hazard on both sides of the partnership, how these risks interact, and how the firm designs a wage schedule over the course of the employment relationship to mitigate the participation risks. In the third chapter (written jointly with Roberto Pinheiro), I investigate whether a higher <b>uncertainty</b> <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> duration co-occurs with lower wages in the labor market equilibrium, when firms differ with respect to the separation hazard. We find that for the most part average wages of 2 ̆ 7 risky employment 2 ̆ 7 are lower, and these companies are smaller, as has been found empirically. In the last chapter, I study the matching and signaling patterns, when agents have search for their counterpart, while signaling their quality. The search frictions give rise to different patterns (matching in classes). ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the issue if {{and to what}} extent young firms differ from incumbents regarding the use <b>of</b> non-standard <b>employment,</b> trust-based working time arrangements and overtime hours {{in the light of the}} qualitative changes <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> structures that are taking place in industrialized countries, such as rising shares <b>of</b> non-standard <b>employment</b> and borders between work and private life that become increasingly blurred. Based on a microeconometric analysis of the IAB Establishment Panel, a representative survey of about 16, 000 employers in Germany, we find that young establishments rely significantly more often on limited contracts and freelance work than incumbent businesses in order to hedge the higher risks and <b>uncertainties</b> <b>of</b> young firms. Likewise, trust-based working time arrangements and overtime hours are more an issue in young than in incumbent firms, indicating a higher level of subjectivated work in young firms. Additionally, we provide basic evidence that these differences are not purely transitory but on the contrary rather stable as the firms grow older, which makes young firms contribute a substantial part to the ongoing qualitative changes <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> structures...|$|R
