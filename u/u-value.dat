The DER, and TER (Target Emission rate) calculated through either the UK Government's Standard Assessment Procedure for Energy Rating of Dwellings (SAP rating), 2005 edition, or the newer SBEM (*Simplified Building Energy Model) which is aimed at non-dwellings, became the only acceptable calculation methods. Several commercial energy modeling software packages have now also been verified as producing acceptable evidence by the BRE Global & UK Government. Calculations using previous versions of SAP had been an optional way of demonstrating compliance since 1991(?). They are now a statutory requirement (B.

25|$|However, metal spacers conduct heat (unless {{the metal}} is {{thermally}} improved), undermining {{the ability of}} the insulated glass unit (IGU) to reduce heat flow. It may also result in water or ice forming {{at the bottom of the}} sealed unit because of the sharp temperature difference between the window and surrounding air. To reduce heat transfer through the spacer and increase overall thermal performance, manufacturers may make the spacer out of a less-conductive material such as structural foam. A spacer made of aluminum that also contains a highly structural thermal barrier reduces condensation on the glass surface and improves insulation, as measured by the overall <b>U-value.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method to determine building envelope thermal transmittance (known as <b>U-values)</b> and air infiltration rate {{by a combination}} of Energy modeling (DesignBuilder and EnergyPlus), regression models and genetic algorithm at quasi-steady state conditions. DesignBuilder is used to develop the thermal model of an office building, including physical building models, materials specification, occupancy schedules, detailed HVAC system and components for energy simulation purposes. Specifically, the simulation was carried out in EnergyPlus at diverse <b>U-values</b> and air infiltration rates to produce a large datasets. Subsequently, the results were used to generate a linear regression model to evaluate the associations of thermal demands with <b>U-values</b> and air infiltration rate. Genetic algorithm was then applied to obtain a set of <b>U-values</b> and air infiltration rate with the minimum difference between field measurement and model prediction. The calibrated <b>U-values</b> and air infiltration rate were employed as inputs in EnergyPlus to model one workday heat consumption.

40|$|The {{selection}} of optimum pane spacing for glazing systems {{has been a}} topic of ongoing debate in the window manufacturing industry. Arguments are often based on speculation, intuition and results from tests not specifically designed {{to examine the effects}} of pane spacing. This study presents a set of measured centre-glass <b>U-values</b> taken from experiments where pane spacing was carefully varied while holding all remaining conditions unchanged. Heat flux measurements were made using a guarded heater plate apparatus. Glazing systems were all double glazed, air filled and tested in the vertical position. Measured centre-glass <b>U-values</b> were compared to calculated <b>U-values.</b> These calculations were performed using a version of the VISION glazing system thermal analysis program which was modified in order to model the guarded heater plate test conditions. VISION runs were also carried out in order to predict the optimum pane spacing as a function of variations in glazing system design, fill gas type, weather condition, and the number of panes incorporated in the glazing system. VISION results were combined with results of the window frame thermal analysis program, FRAME. FRAME was used to estimate the average edge-glass and frame <b>U-values</b> for several design options.

50|$|The U-factor or <b>U-value,</b> is {{the overall}} heat {{transfer}} coefficient that describes how well a building element conducts heat or the rate of transfer of heat (in watts) through one square metre of a structure divided by the difference in temperature across the structure. The elements are commonly assemblies of many layers of components such as those that make up walls/floors/roofs etc. It measures the rate of heat transfer through a building element over a given area under standardised conditions. The usual standard is at a temperature gradient of 24 °C (75.2 °F), at 50% humidity with no wind (a smaller U-factor is better at reducing heat transfer). It is expressed in watts per meter squared kelvin (W/m²K). This means that the higher the <b>U-value</b> the worse the thermal performance of the building envelope.
