25|$|In September 2007, Steven {{returns and}} begins {{stalking}} Ian, {{pretending to be}} Ian's late wife, Cindy. He lures Ian to an empty block of flats, and takes him hostage. Arriving back in Walford, he spends time reminiscing with Peter and Lucy, though Ian's new wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) is initially wary of him, especially when he attempts to kiss her. When Steven's grandmother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement) tells him that Ian always considers Steven his first born, blood related or not, Steven starts to regret what he has done. Wanting to confide in his sister, Steven takes Lucy to the flat where Ian is being held. Horrified, Lucy escapes and contacts Jane, while Ian confronts Steven about the reasons for his actions. Steven tells Ian that he blames him for his mother's imprisonment and death. He is angry that Ian had not retrieved him from New Zealand; living with his biological father {{had not been a}} happy experience, and he had ended <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> rejected and in the way.|$|E
500|$|Caballero and Walsh had {{conflicts}} {{on making}} sure the stop motion version of Bikini Bottom will resemble the 2D world of the series. Caballero said that [...] "We didn't want to make exact sculptural copies of the cartoon drawings and layouts, just because it might've ended <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> too 'perfect' or something. So we chose to re-appropriate real world objects as much as possible." [...] Art director Kelly Mazurowski focused on [...] "digging through salvage yards", picking the right materials {{to be used in}} the set. Caballero described this process as [...] "'puppetizing' the world of Bikini Bottom." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron Lewis of GamePro {{praised the}} game's story, depth and presentation, while Paul Curthoys of Official Xbox Magazine remarked {{that the game}} [...] "bothers with {{emotions}} and moments that most games don't concern themselves with", describing it as [...] "a great science-fiction novel in video game form." [...] In contrast, Edge concluded that the space opera setting failed to provide [...] "the myth and exotica to adequately follow Star Wars". The publication also criticized the cast of characters and overall tone, saying that Mass Effect [...] "strives so hard {{to be taken seriously}} that it winds <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> relentlessly dour." [...] Kristan Reed of Eurogamer noted the game's slow start and overwhelming setting, observing that it would confuse players before they know what the main game is about.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Timberlake assures {{his love}} {{interest}} {{that they are}} [...] "making love like professionals" [...] and declares: [...] "If you’ll be my strawberry bubblegum, I’ll be your blueberry lollipop". In addition, he sings about the girl's many characteristics and sensual qualities, and proclaims that he will love her until they [...] "make it pop". The Boston Globes James Reed wrote that the lyrics are silly, but irresistible, while Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post found [...] "Strawberry Bubblegum" [...] as seductive as its title, but according to her, [...] "if you had {{too much of it}} you might end <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> a little sick". Additionally, Timberlake sings lyrics about he has [...] "recipe for a good time". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club felt that the lyrics' sense of humor is somewhat similar to [...] "Pop" [...] by 'NSYNC.|$|E
500|$|Musgrave commented, [...] "the art style does {{sometimes}} {{hinder the}} gameplay", and Willington {{was critical of}} the story mode, which he said had a [...] "weak plot" [...] and lacked character development. The Download.com staff also noted some lags and software bugs, while Musgrave and Allen stated the controls sometimes had problems recognizing swipes. Squires commented that a problem {{of the game is}} its level cap limit when the player is using only one character. However, according to Musgrave, the game's energy system was [...] "the biggest point of controversy"; he, Willington, Allen, and Mike Fahey of Kotaku criticized it. In opposition, McElroy said the energy system is a [...] "microtransaction hook" [...] that is easily surmountable without spending any real money, and Squires affirmed that because of the duration of a run it [...] "ends <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> a lot fairer in practice than it sounds on paper".|$|E
500|$|... "Animal" [...] {{was written}} by Miike Snow's three members, Christian Karlsson, Pontus Winnberg and Andrew Wyatt, in {{collaboration}} with Henrik Jonback. In an interview with Dustin Fitzharris of Out, Wyatt explained that the song has an ambiguous meaning, [...] "It can deal with addiction. It can deal with just the basic instincts – {{some of them are}} wonderful {{and some of them are}} very dangerous." [...] In a separate interview with Joe Zadeh for Clash, Wyatt deemed it a [...] "very simple song" [...] and elaborated on its subject matter, [...] "Directing your attention to man's underlying nature and how sometimes things in society just don't work out to meet your needs. And a lot of people end <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> very dissatisfied. And the way people feel the need to fit into certain circumstances without even thinking about what they want." [...] "Animal" [...] was recorded at Robotberget, the band's own studio in Stockholm, Sweden. The band produced the track and then mixed it with Anders Hvenare.|$|E

500|$|While {{researching the}} book, Taraborrelli {{realized}} {{that one of}} the greatest misconceptions about Madonna was the general perception that she was cold and unemotional in her personal relationships. The opposite proved true; Madonna was indeed emotionally vulnerable, and Taraborelli cited as an example the icon's 1990 relationship with actor Warren Beatty. Their relationship was generally perceived as nothing more than a means to promote their film Dick Tracy, and Madonna was regarded under the circumstances as opportunistic. Taraborelli discovered however that Madonna actually had strong feelings for Beatty. The actor however was not as emotionally invested as Madonna, and the relationship ended with her heart being broken. Taraborelli observed, [...] "So, what I think will surprise people with this story are the many times that Madonna has ended <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> alone and rejected. She has built her entire career on an image of indestructibility. But at least in her personal life, and again, I make that distinction, because this isn't necessarily true in her business life, {{she is one of the}} most fragile subjects I've ever written about...This book is really about placing her life into the proper historical context, and once again answering the why questions about her." ...|$|E
500|$|After the game's release, Hubbard {{identified}} the realistic expectations {{set by the}} team as a strong point in the game's development, saying that [...] "given our budget, team size, and development cycle, {{the best we could}} hope to do was to create a fun, engaging 60s espionage game that would make up in presentation what it lacked in innovation." [...] Other positive aspects of the process included the aforementioned mission statement, along with the flexible systems used in development, the cohesion of the team, and effective scheduling. On the other hand, Hubbard cited difficulties in fleshing out the final team, as well as inefficient pre-production, delays due to waiting on technology, and the major difficulties in finding a publisher. Hubbard also mentioned the cinematic cutscenes as lengthy and problematic, partly because of technical difficulties, and partly because of conceptual flaws on his behalf, with regard to screenwriting. Regarding gameplay, he said that [...] "ne of the main failings of NOLF [...] was that it ended <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> a lot more scripted and linear than it was intended to be". Hubbard also expressed dissatisfaction with the balance between action and intrigue: [...] "Unfortunately, we came up a little short on intrigue. Stealth was too unforgiving. Once you were spotted, you were playing an action game." [...] The team paid attention to these points while developing No One Lives Forever 2.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Terri Schwartz {{gave the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.8 out of 10, calling the {{blackout}} plot [...] "fairly throwaway" [...] but a backdrop to [...] "tell {{far more interesting}} stories", with Luna's Reyes continuing to be the strongest new element of the season. Schwartz criticized the episode's killing and resurrection of May as [...] "one of the weaker storytelling tricks in an otherwise solid episode—and as expected, May came back and is just fine." [...] Writing for Nerdist, Joseph McCabe had mixed feelings about the episode's political angle {{and the use of}} Inhumans as a stand-in for minorities, but praised the chemistry between Coulson, Mack, and Fitz, and the further exploration of Jeffrey Mace. McCabe was highly critical of guest star Lorenzo James Henrie, calling him [...] "no more charismatic here than he was in Fear the Walking Dead, and his character is every bit as unsympathetic as his misguided rebel was on that show, wheelchair or no." [...] Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush was particularly negative, feeling the episodes' different storylines [...] "ended <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> like three disparate stories with some notable reaching'. He felt the Inhuman prejudice storyline and attack by looters on Gabe were forced, and that the May storyline did not [...] "really [...] our idea of where the AI or ghostly threads will end up". Fitzpatrick did think that the introduction of Nagra would [...] "help Season 4 find its footing again" [...] with a more focused overarching story.|$|E

60|$|The reason--long {{afterwards}} ascertained--of this unprovoked {{attack on}} the boat's crew, was the old story. A party of godless white men had previously visited {{that part of the}} coast and treated the poor natives with great barbarity, thus stirring <b>up</b> <b>feelings</b> of hatred and revenge against all white men--at least for the time being.

500|$|Carlo Santos of the Anime News Network {{described}} Dragon Balls setting as [...] "a {{melting pot}} of sci-fi, fantasy, and folklore". Santos praised its quick {{development of new}} characters and storylines, and claimed that the series' crowning achievement is in its dynamic fight scenes. However, he did not enjoy the cliché training and tournament segments, nor its crude humor. His colleague Allen Divers praised the manga's story and humor as being very good at conveying all the characters' personalities. Divers also called Viz's translation {{one of the best}} of all the English editions of the series due to its faithfulness to the original Japanese. Animerica felt the series had [...] "worldwide appeal," [...] using dramatic pacing and over-the-top martial arts action to [...] "maintain tension levels and keep a crippler crossface hold on the audience's attention spans". Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux described Toriyama as a [...] "super-cartoonist," [...] a blend of Carl Barks, Jack Kirby, and Peyo. He gave Dragon Ball a perfect rating and called it one of the best manga and comic books he has ever read. Ridwan Khan of Animefringe.com commented that the manga had a [...] "chubby" [...] art style, but as the series continued the characters became more refined, leaner, and more muscular. He cited one slight problem in Viz's release; the translation uses informal language to capture Goku's country accent, but it ends <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> [...] "forced and odd". Khan prefers the manga over the slow pacing of the anime adaptations. Ollie Barber writing for Forbes echoed Khan stating with a lot less padding, the manga's [...] "pacing is a lot tighter and makes you realize how talented Dragon Ball's creator Akira Toriyama truly is when he chooses to flex his storytelling muscles".|$|E
500|$|Survivor {{contains}} themes {{interpreted by}} the public as {{a reference to the}} group's internal conflict. The title track, [...] "Survivor", which set the theme used throughout the album, features the lyrics [...] "I'm not gonna blast you on the radio... I'm not gonna lie on you or your family... I'm not gonna hate you in the magazine" [...] caused [...] Roberson and Luckett to file a lawsuit against the group; the lyrics were perceived to be a violation over their agreement following a settlement in court. In an interview, Knowles commented: [...] "The lyrics to the single 'Survivor' are Destiny's Child's story, because we've been through a lot,... We went through our drama with the members... Any complications we've had in our 10-year period of time have made us closer and tighter and better." [...] In another song called [...] "Fancy", which contains the lyrics [...] "You always tried to compete with me, girl... find your own identity", was interpreted by critic David Browne, in his review of the album for Entertainment Weekly magazine, {{as a response to the}} lawsuit. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarized Survivor as [...] "a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny's Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife.... It's a record that tries to be a bold statement of purpose, but winds <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> forced and artificial." [...] Despite the album's receiving critical praise, Knowles' close involvement has occasionally generated criticism. Knowles wrote and co-produced the bulk of Survivor. Browne suggested that her help made Survivor a [...] "premature, but inevitable, growing pains album". In the majority of the songs on their final studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004), the verses are divided into three sections, with Knowles singing first, followed by Rowland, then Williams; the three harmonize together during the choruses.|$|E

2500|$|Children in the Israeli–Palestinian {{conflict}} {{refers to}} the impact of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict on minors in Israel and the Palestinian territories. Laurel Holliday, in her 1999 book Children of Israel/Palestine, writes that two [...] "ethnically distinct peoples – both Palestinians and Israeli Jews – lay claim to the very same sand, stone, rivers, vegetation, seacoast, and mountains" [...] and that the stories she presents show that [...] "Israeli and Palestinian children grow <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> that they are destined for conflict with their neighbors".|$|E
2500|$|In a mixed review, Rolling Stone editor Jody Rosen {{wrote that}} [...] "Clarkson remains a {{slightly}} wearying one-note artist--she's a wounded lover, bellowing her pain and scorching the earth. But wow--that voice." [...] The A.V. Club was more critical, writing that [...] "the album {{suffers from a}} heavily produced electro-sheen, and ends <b>up</b> <b>feeling</b> more manufactured than magical". Sputnikmusic was ambivalent towards Clarkson's attempt at [...] "something with a deeper purpose" [...] and questioned: [...] "What do you listen to Kelly Clarkson for: {{the integrity of the}} songs, or the hooks?" [...] Andy Gill of The Independent found no [...] "development" [...] in Clarkson's singing and panned its music as [...] "an overlong string of standard putdown R and bogus emotional turmoil, the songs blitzed with generic power-ballad overkill." ...|$|E

She uses her telepathic powers and briefly takes on the alias [...] "The Silencer" [...] to see what Peter is capable of. Chat begins dating Peter afterward. After Chat discovers Emma's schemes, Chat seeks Spider-Man's help, leading to a confrontation between him and Emma. Eventually, Emma confesses her crush on Peter, which she began to have after first looking into his mind and realizing his earnest heroic beliefs and motives. She also reveals that she had caused everything in an attempt to break him and Chat <b>up,</b> <b>feeling</b> that she could neither date Peter while he was with Chat, nor could she spend time with Chat like she used to. By breaking them up, Emma hoped that at least she could reclaim Chat's friendship.
