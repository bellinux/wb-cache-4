40|$|Branching Processes in a Random Environment (BPREs) (Z_n:n≥ 0) are a {{generalization}} of Galton Watson processes where in each generation the reproduction law is picked randomly in an i. i. d. manner. We determine here the <b>upper</b> large <b>deviation</b> {{of the process}} when the reproduction law may have heavy tails. The behavior of BPREs {{is related to the}} associated random walk of the environment, whose increments are distributed like the logarithmic mean of the offspring distributions. We obtain an expression of the upper rate function of (Z_n:n≥ 0), that is the limit of -P(Z_n≥ e^θ n) /n when n→∞. It depends on the rate function of the associated random walk of the environment, the logarithmic cost of survival γ:=-_n→∞P(Z_n> 0) /n and the polynomial decay β of the tail distribution of Z_ 1. We give interpretations of this rate function in terms of the least costly ways for the process (Z_n: n ≥ 0) of attaining extraordinarily large values and describe the phase transitions. We derive then the rate function when the reproduction law does not have heavy tails, which generalizes the results of Böinghoff and Kersting (2009) and Bansaye and Berestycki (2008) for <b>upper</b> large <b>deviations.</b> Finally, we specify the <b>upper</b> large <b>deviations</b> for the Galton Watson processes with heavy tails...|$|R

40|$|For first passage {{percolation}} on Z^ 2 with i. i. d. bounded edge weights, {{we consider}} the <b>upper</b> tail large <b>deviation</b> event; i. e., the rare situation where the first passage time between two points at distance n, is macroscopically larger than typical. It was shown by Kesten (1986) that the probability of this event decays as (-Θ(n^ 2)). However the question of existence of the rate function i. e., whether the log-probability normalized by n^ 2 tends to a limit, had remained open. We show that under some additional mild regularity assumption on the passage time distribution, the rate function for <b>upper</b> tail large <b>deviation</b> indeed exists. Our proof can be generalized to work in higher dimensions and for the corresponding problem in last passage percolation as well. The key intuition behind the proof is that a limiting metric structure which is atypical causes the <b>upper</b> tail large <b>deviation</b> event. The formal argument then relies on an approximate version of the above which allows us to dilate the large deviation environment to compare the upper tail probabilities for various values of n.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{the distribution of}} pure-tone hearing thresholds of a Caucasian population living {{in the south of}} France aged 70 years and older. To establish age- and sex-adjusted normative hearing thresholds based on results of subjects free of noise and ototoxic drug exposure and to compare them with hearing thresholds of exposed (E) subjects. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal epidemiologic cohort study. SETTING: Montpellier suburb, south of France. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 778 subjects 70 years old and older were examined. Noise exposure, ototoxic medication use, and medical history were collected. Hearing thresholds were obtained via pure-tone audiometry. After excluding patients with ear-related disease, 659 subjects were further analyzed (270 men and 389 women). Noise or ototoxic medication exposure was found in 364 subjects (E subjects), whereas 295 had no exposure (nonexposed [NE] subjects). METHODS: Median pure-tone thresholds, lower deviation, and <b>upper</b> <b>deviation</b> were calculated for the NE subjects with a statistical method similar to the ISO 7029 norm and were compared with thresholds of E subjects. RESULTS: Hearing thresholds, especially in high frequencies, increased with age more for women than for men. Median thresholds of E subjects were significantly higher than those for the NE sample in men. CONCLUSION: Age- and sex-adjusted hearing thresholds could well be useful {{in the study of the}} impact of environmental and genetic factors on hearing loss in the elderly. The next step would be to quantify the impact of noise, ototoxic drug exposure, and genetics using these age- and sex-adjusted thresholds...|$|E
