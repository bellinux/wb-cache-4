5|$|The chapel walls {{have three}} {{horizontal}} tiers with six {{windows in the}} upper tier down each side. There were also two windows at each end, but these have been closed <b>up</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> altar when Michelangelo's Last Judgement was painted, obliterating two lunettes. Between the windows are large pendentives which support the vault. Between the pendentives are triangularly shaped arches or spandrels cut into the vault above each window. Above {{the height of the}} pendentives, the ceiling slopes gently without much deviation from the horizontal. This is the real architecture. Michelangelo has elaborated it with illusionary or fictive architecture.|$|E
5|$|Life on {{the island}} was very {{isolated}} due to its inaccessibility. Until as late as 1894 it had no landing place, which meant that boats had to be landed directly {{on the beach and}} pulled <b>up</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> waterline. Particularly in winter, when storms raged through the Pentland Firth, Stroma could be cut off for weeks at a time. Such episodes posed serious risks to the islanders, as they had no doctor. The winter of 1937 illustrated the problems that the weather could pose; during January and February that year, the island was cut off for three weeks by violent gales which demolished houses along the seafront and washed boats 100 yards (90m) inland. Stroma's isolation came at an especially bad time, as most of the population had caught influenza and supplies of food dwindled to the point that some items had to be rationed. Eventually two boats were able to reach the island, carrying supplies and a doctor from Caithness, along with three weeks' worth of mail.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} has been used at least for millennia if not longer since it is also used by the great apes, {{as well as other}} primates. Robert Francoeur notes that evidence of the missionary position's use appears in ancient pottery and art in the Fertile Crescent {{as well as in the}} art of Early Greeks, Romans, Peruvians, Indians, Chinese and Japanese. The majority of the positions described in the Kama Sutra involve the woman lying on her back with her legs in a variety of positions. According to Canongate, ancient art shows missionary as being less popular than woman-on-top positions in Ur, Greece, Rome, Peru, India, China and Japan. But Francoeur states that the ancient Chinese preferred male-on-top because of their belief that males are born face down and women face up. Kagaba natives in Colombia preferred missionary because of the stability it offers; they believed that if the woman moved during intercourse, the earth would slip off the shoulders of the four giants who held it <b>up</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> waters. Some Kerala tribes believe that the male-on-top position is the only way to conceive warriors.|$|E

500|$|The {{result was}} a large, five-sided, star-shaped fort with four angular bastions, revetted in brick, with an outer curtain of defences, {{including}} two moats and a redoubt; two new gatehouses defended the entrance from the north. Two gun lines of gun platforms, facing the river, stretched alongside either {{the side of the}} fort. The Henrician blockhouse was incorporated into the defences, but the Elizabethan earthworks were destroyed. The interior of the fort was raised <b>up</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> level of the marshes to prevent flooding, and barracks and other buildings were constructed inside. The writer John Evelyn praised the new fort as [...] "a Royal work indeede". Further work after 1694 replaced the wooden gun platforms alongside the river with more durable stone equivalents.|$|E
500|$|The Berkshire No. 7 {{is a small}} {{wood and}} steel canal barge that {{measures}} [...] long with a [...] beam.

Clouette describes the hull as being [...] "nearly rectangular in profile, section and plan, with squared-off stern and bluntly rounded bow. Low bulwarks with scuppers rise slightly to a peak where they join the prominently projecting stem". The superstructure is primarily of a single low coaming with convex hatch covers that runs almost the full length of the shop.

500|$|The {{second stage}} of {{construction}} in the 17th and 18th centuries, when the tower was under the charge of the Vatican librarian, involved Mgr. Filippo Luigi Gilii, a clergyman of St. Peter's Basilica. Earlier in 1797, Pius VI gave approval to placing a Latin inscription Specula Vaticana {{at the entrance to}} the upper part of the tower, which was implemented by Cardinal Zelada with plans to enhance the instrumentation system in the tower's observatory. The original observatory was then set <b>up</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> second level of the tower with the agreement of Pope Pius VI. Its instrumentation, apart from many normal devices (such as meteorological and magnetic equipment, with a seismograph and a small transit and pendulum clock,) was noted for the Dolland Telescope. The instrumentation facilitated recording of occurrences of eclipse, appearance of comets, Satellites of Jupiter and Mercury’s transit. As an addition, under the patronage of Pope Pius X, four rotary observatory domes were also added at strategic locations on the [...] long fortification walls, more than a thousand years old.|$|E

500|$|The {{only known}} skull, {{belonging}} to the largest specimen, measures [...] from the premaxilla at the front {{to the back of}} the occipital condyle. The widest part of the skull behind the eyes is only [...] wide in comparison. The skull was similar to those of other ornithomimosaurs in being low and narrow, but differed in that the snout was more elongated. The skull bone walls were rather thin, about [...] It had a rounded, flattened beak, which would have been covered by keratin in life. The nostrils were turned upwards, and the nasal bone was a narrow strap that extended <b>up</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> eye sockets. The outer diameter of the sclerotic rings in the eyes was small, , compared to the size of the skull. The lower temporal fenestrae, openings behind the eyes, were partially closed off by the jugal bones, similar to Gallimimus. The jaws were toothless and down-turned, and the lower jaw was very massive and deep compared to the slender and low upper jaw. The relative size of the lower jaw was closer to that of tyrannosaurids than to other ornithomimosaurs. The snout was spatulate (flared outwards to the sides) and [...] wide, which is wider than the skull roof. This shape is similar to the snout of duck-billed hadrosaurids.|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes <b>up</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E
500|$|A lone [...] "Zero" [...] {{emerged from}} the cloud cover below Air Group 18, {{attempting}} to sneak up on the formation from behind. Harris spotted the enemy early on and led his division down in pursuit, chasing the Japanese fighter away from the air group {{and back into the}} cloud cover from which it had appeared. Harris and company followed him down through the clouds into the open skies above Fabrica airfield, where a [...] "hornets nest" [...] of enemy planes was waiting for them. A melee ensued, causing one Zero to break ranks {{in the face of an}} attack by Burley. Burley hit his target but did not have time to verify the kill—another Zero came in from behind, forcing him to take evasive action. Fortunately, Harris was behind this second Japanese fighter and shot him down just a moment later. Flying back toward the bombers, Harris spotted a single Zero Type 32 [...] "Hamp" [...] climbing in front of him, headed in the same direction and apparently intent on attacking the bomber squadrons. Harris pulled <b>up</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> enemy and turned inside of him, putting a burst into the plane from 7 o'clock. It went down in flames. Harris then observed the pilots from his division fighting hard over the air strip, so he doubled back to render assistance. As he headed down, he was jumped from 7 o'clock, by two Hamps. He pulled up hard and swung left, allowing his pursuers to overshoot their runs before he tacked back to the right, putting himself above and behind them. Harris dove on his former pursuers with his guns firing, causing one plane to explode and the other to flee the scene. Once more seeking out his division, Harris approached a cluster of planes that turned out to be still more Zero 32s. Harris's Hellcat had no problem outpacing them. After he'd put enough distance between himself and the group, he looped back and approached the enemy formation head on in a low side run. His target, the last Zero in formation, exploded a mere [...] from Harris, who finally spotted some fellow Hellcats. He broke off his engagement to follow the other VF-18 pilots to the rendezvous point.|$|E
