5|$|The {{continuing}} high operational {{tempo of}} the Army after East Timor further emphasised {{the need to}} develop the capability of the Army Reserve. Since then increasing numbers of Reservists have been deployed overseas in varying capacities as well as undertaking periods of full-time service in Australia to maintain capabilities within Regular units heavily committed to deployments to Iraq, Afghanistan, East Timor and the Solomon Islands. In lower intensity areas, such as East Timor and the Solomon Islands, formed units of Reservists raised from personnel drawn from many <b>units,</b> <b>have</b> been deployed on peacekeeping duties to relieve the pressure being placed upon the Regular Army and allowing them to focus on the higher intensity combat zones in Iraq and Afghanistan. In addition to this Australian Army Reserve <b>units</b> <b>have</b> been deployed on border security duties with the Royal Australian Navy as part of Operation Relex, as well as participating regularly in multinational exercises such as Rifle Company Butterworth.|$|E
5|$|The station {{also has}} six gas {{turbines}} providing backup for breakdowns, or shut downs in the National Grid. Their annual output is generally low, generating 75MW {{and three of}} the <b>units</b> <b>have</b> been mothballed and are out of operation, but they could be refurbished. Emissions from these units are released through the station's second, smaller chimney, to the south of the main stack.|$|E

5|$|A {{detachment}} of four Australian F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft provided air defence for the US military {{base on the}} island of Diego Garcia during the campaign against the Taliban, which was called Operation Slipper. The initial detachment was provided by No. 77 Squadron RAAF between December 2001 and 10 February 2002. This detachment was replaced by a detachment from No. 3 Squadron RAAF which was deployed between 10 February 2002 and 20 May 2002. No further Australian <b>units</b> <b>have</b> been deployed to Diego Garcia. The United States Air Force commented favourably on the RAAF contingent's professionalism during this deployment.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s country {{passenger}} services were run down, and older wooden rolling stock was now approaching their use by date. As a result, the N type carriages were introduced from 1981, {{followed by the}} converted H type stock from 1984. Since then, diesel multiple <b>units</b> <b>have</b> become the norm for new purchases, with the Sprinter introduced in 1992, and the VLocity from 2005.|$|E

50|$|On the PC (DOS and Microsoft Windows platforms), two {{encodings}} became {{established for}} Japanese and Traditional Chinese {{in which all}} of singletons, lead units and trail units overlapped: Shift-JIS and Big5 respectively. In Shift-JIS, lead <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the range 81-9F and E0-FC, trail <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the range 40-7E and 80-FC, and singletons had the range 21-7E and A1-DF. In Big5, lead <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the range A1-FE, trail <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the range 40-7E and A1-FE, and singletons had the range 21-7E (all values in hexadecimal). This overlap again made processing tricky, though at least most of the symbols had unique byte values (though strangely the backslash does not).|$|R
50|$|There {{were also}} two main classes of F7's: {{passenger}} and freight. Most passenger <b>units</b> <b>had</b> {{upper and lower}} headlights, but this wasn't always the rule. Many freight <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the upper Mars or Pyle brand warning light as well. And some passenger <b>units</b> only <b>had</b> a single upper headlight, i.e. the Pennsylvania. Many <b>units</b> <b>had</b> the upper lights plated over later in life, or the door light removed/plated over and the Mars/Pyle light removed. These early warning lights had lots of moving linkages and a motor that were high maintenance for the shops.|$|R
5|$|F-22 fighter <b>units</b> <b>have</b> been {{frequently}} {{deployed to}} Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. In February 2007, on the aircraft's first overseas deployment to Kadena Air Base, six F-22s of 27th Fighter Squadron flying from Hickam AFB, Hawaii, experienced multiple software-related system failures while crossing the International Date Line (180th meridian of longitude). The aircraft returned to Hawaii by following tanker aircraft. Within 48 hours, the error was resolved and the journey resumed.

5|$|For {{the sake}} of convenience, some derived <b>units</b> <b>have</b> special names and symbols. Such units may {{themselves}} be used {{in combination with the}} names and symbols for base units and for other derived units to express the units of other derived quantities. For example, the SI unit of force is the newton (N), the SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa)—and the pascal can be defined as one newton per square metre (N/m2).|$|E
50|$|Every {{reactive}} <b>unit</b> <b>has</b> {{the same}} reactivity regardless of other factors. For example, a reactive group A on a 20-mer (a polymer with 20 monomer <b>units)</b> <b>has</b> the same reactivity as another group A on a 2000-mer.|$|R
50|$|The <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> an {{operational}} strength of 16 Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2s. It was later re-equipped with Bf 109G-6s. The <b>unit</b> <b>had</b> also one captured Hawker Hurricane Mk.IIA in its possession, {{but it never}} flew any operational sorties.|$|R
50|$|The <b>unit</b> <b>has</b> {{been based}} at Levashevo since 1960.

The Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar has preserved three units, of which two (602 and 616) were operated by GM-Gruppen and one (615) is kept for spare parts. NSB has kept one unit as reserve at Ål Station. The remaining <b>units</b> <b>have</b> been scrapped, put aside or sold as spare part units.|$|E
5|$|Portions of JSOC <b>units</b> <b>have</b> {{made up the}} {{constantly}} changing special operations task force, operating in the U.S. Central Command area of operations. The Task Force 11, Task Force 121, Task Force 6-26 and Task Force 145 are creations of the Pentagon's post-11 September campaign against terrorism, and it quickly became the model for how the military would gain intelligence and battle insurgents in the future. Originally known as Task Force 121, it was formed {{in the summer of}} 2003, when the military merged two existing Special Operations units, one hunting Osama bin Laden in and around Afghanistan, and the other tracking Sadaam Hussein in Iraq.|$|E
