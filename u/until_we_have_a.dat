He stated that since the inchoate stages of Pennsylvania's development, the state had prioritized education as a tenet of success, [...] "Our constitutional injunctions have been followed by repeated legislative enactments, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> system in operation which places the means of education within the reach of every member of the community." [...] The quest for universal education for the people of early Pennsylvania was an undertaking that Porter gave great respect.|$|E

For example, Crick advocated a form of positive eugenics in which wealthy parents would be encouraged to have more children. He once remarked, [...] "In the long run, it is unavoidable that society will begin {{to worry about the}} character of the next generation... It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs and <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky to try and do anything in the way of eugenics...

2500|$|In 2004, Jackson {{released}} her eighth studio album, Damita Jo. The album debuted at number two on Billboard 200, was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and sold over three million copies worldwide. However, its singles received minimal airplay {{due to a}} blacklist of Jackson's music and videos on many music channels and radio formats caused by legalities surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. Jackson then decided to start {{to work on a}} new project in the coming year, involving her then-fiancé, record producer Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned to executive produce the project, in addition to a number of other producers. She decided to create a modern record, while returning to dance music, in the vein of her hit album, Control (1986). Producer Jimmy Jam revealed that while recording the album, Janet became more confident with her writing ability, doing the bulk of the writing. He also commented, [...] "We're all kind of back in there doing it again together, which I really enjoy." [...] It's the physical nature of sitting in the same room and really hashing it out. It's like, 'You're not going to leave <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lyric,' so it's fun." [...] Jackson and Jimmy both agreed that Dupri molded well into their tri due to him being a fan of Jam and Lewis' work and vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|Quantrill {{then joined}} {{a group of}} Missouri ruffians and became {{somewhat}} of a drifter. The group helped protect Missouri farmers from the Jayhawkers for pay and slept wherever they could find lodging. Quantrill traveled back to Utah and then to Colorado, but returned {{in less than a}} year to Lawrence, Kansas, in 1859. It was at this time that he began to formulate his political views, especially those regarding slavery. Initially, before 1860, Quantrill appeared to support the anti-slavery side. For instance, he wrote to his good friend W.W. Scott in January 1858 that the Lecompton Constitution was a [...] "swindle" [...] and that James H. Lane, a Northern sympathizer, was [...] "as good a man as we have here." [...] He also called the Democrats [...] "the worst men we have for they are all rascals, for no one can be a democrat here without being one." [...] However, in February 1860, Quantrill wrote a letter to his mother expressing his views on the anti-slavery supporters. He told her the pro-slavery movement was right and that he now detested Jim Lane. He said that the hanging of John Brown had been too good for him and that, [...] "the devil has got unlimited sway over this territory, and will hold it <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> better set of man and society generally." ...|$|E

The first single from the album was [...] "Ignorance" [...] and was released July 7, 2009. Paramore was the special guest with Bedouin Soundclash, The Sounds and Janelle Monáe at the No Doubt Summer Tour 2009, starting in May 2009 in outdoor amphitheaters and arenas across the US and Canada. The official music video for [...] "Ignorance" [...] aired on all MTV platforms, networks, and websites on August 13, 2009. Paramore, along with Paper Route and The Swellers, toured in support of Brand New Eyes in the fall of 2009. Some tour dates were postponed due to Hayley Williams becoming infected with laryngitis. [...] "Brick By Boring Brick", [...] "The Only Exception", [...] "Careful" [...] and [...] "Playing God" [...] were the album's following singles. To promote the album, the band recorded a performance for MTV Unplugged.|$|E

For if the actual existence of wealth be dependent {{on the power of}} its possessor, it follows that the sum of wealth held by the nation, instead of being constant, or calculable, varies hourly, nay, momentarily, with the number and character of its holders! and that in changing hands, it changes in quantity. And farther, since the worth of the currency is proportioned to the sum of material wealth which it represents, if the sum of the wealth changes, the worth of the currency changes. And thus both the sum of the property, and power of the currency, of the state, vary momentarily as the character and number of the holders. And not only so, but different rates and kinds of variation are caused by the character of the holders of different kinds of wealth. The transitions of value caused by the character of the holders of land differ in mode from those caused by character in holders of works of art; and these again from those caused by character in holders of machinery or other working capital.

Look back to {{the main}} type, Fig. II., page 55, and apply its {{profiles}} in due proportion to the feet of the pillars at E in Fig. IX. p. 72: If each step in Fig. II. were gathered accurately, the projection of the entire circular base would be less in proportion to its height than it is in Fig. II.; but the approximation to the result in Fig. X. is quite accurate enough for our purposes. (I pray the reader to observe that I have not made the smallest change, except this necessary expression of a reduction in diameter, in Fig. II. as it is applied in Fig. X., only I have not drawn the joints of the stones because these would confuse the outlines of the bases; and I have not represented the rounding of the shafts, because it does not bear at present on the argument.) Now it would hardly be convenient, if we had to pass between the pillars, to have to squeeze ourselves through one of those angular gaps or brêches de Roland in Fig. X. Our first impulse would be to cut them open; but we cannot do this, or our piers are unsafe.

If there were distinctions made in Cambridge they were not against literature, and we found ourselves {{in the midst of}} a charming society, indifferent, apparently, to all questions but those of the higher education which comes so largely by nature. That is to say, in the Cambridge of that day (and, I dare say, of this) a mind cultivated in some sort was essential, and after that came civil manners, and the willingness and ability to be agreeable and interesting; but the question of riches or poverty did not enter. Even the question of family, which is of so great concern in New England, was in abeyance. Perhaps it was taken for granted that every one in Old Cambridge society must be of good family, or he could not be there; perhaps his mere residence tacitly ennobled him; certainly his acceptance was an informal patent of gentility. To my mind, the structure of society was almost ideal, and <b>until</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> perfectly socialized condition of things I do not believe we shall ever have a more perfect society. The instincts which governed it were not such as can arise from the sordid competition of interests; they flowed from a devotion to letters, and from a self-sacrifice in material things which I can give no better notion of than by saying that the outlay of the richest college magnate seemed to be graduated to the income of the poorest.|$|E
