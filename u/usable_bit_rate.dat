30|$|In those {{simulation}} results, FDASH requests many segments {{at a low}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{until the}} target buffer level is reached. After reaching the target buffer level, the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the next segment gradually increases. In Fig.  6, the FDASH client requests the segment of 1500  kbps at 73  s for the first time, which is the 34 th request, while the proposed scheme requests a segment of 1500  kbps at 18  s for the first time, which is the 7 th request. In other words, the FDASH client has to wait 136  s (34 [*]×[*]D) to view the video at 1500  kbps. The SARA increases the client buffer level quickly by requesting many low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segments and requests a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment {{when there is a}} sufficient buffer level. However, because it requests an excessively high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment, the download time for the segment is too long and the client buffer is quickly consumed. This causes an abrupt decrease in the segment <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> Moreover, since the SARA method increases the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> step by step from the low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> following an abrupt reduction in the <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes frequently. In addition, although FDASH and SARA show small variations when the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> increases, they generally show large variations when the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> decreases.

30|$|In Figs.  10 and 11, {{which are}} the results in the two Wi-Fi environments, FDASH shows the lowest average <b>bit</b> <b>rate,</b> {{although}} its number of <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes is smallest. SARA shows a higher average <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> than that of FDASH. However, it shows {{the largest number of}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> changes, and its variation in <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is also the largest. The proposed scheme shows a similar number of changes as FDASH. In addition, the proposed scheme shows the smallest variation and the highest average <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of all the schemes evaluated. Thus, it is clearly shown that the proposed method appropriately meets each element of a given QoE matrix.|$|R

30|$|The <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{distribution}} {{across the}} layer mainly influences {{the performance of}} the ML transmission schemes. As can be observed for the Stronger sequence, with an even <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> distribution and an advantageous scheme settings, the ML transmission schemes can show a benefit or an increase in terms of coverage at a similar Ucc value. The results for Wineyard and Reuter sequence only show a small increase or for the latter sequence even no increase in terms of coverage. For both sequences, only the video stream provides a quite even <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> distribution, but the audio <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is relative high compared to the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the video at QCIF resolution. Note that at higher resolutions the video <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> ratio is much higher whereas the audio <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> remains constant.

50|$|As {{is obvious}} by its {{definition}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{is a measure}} of the rate of information content of the digital video stream. In the case of uncompressed video, <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> corresponds directly to the quality of the video (remember that <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is proportional to every property that affects the video quality). <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> is an important property when transmitting video because the transmission link must be capable of supporting that <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> is also important when dealing with the storage of video because, as shown above, the video size is proportional to the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and the duration. <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> of uncompressed video is too high for most practical applications. Video compression is used to greatly reduce the <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> BPP {{is a measure of}} the efficiency of compression. A true-color video with no compression at all may have a BPP of 24 bits/pixel. Chroma subsampling can reduce the BPP to 16 or 12 bits/pixel. Applying jpeg compression on every frame can reduce the BPP to 8 or even 1 bits/pixel. Applying video compression algorithms like MPEG1, MPEG2 or MPEG4 allows for fractional BPP values.|$|R
