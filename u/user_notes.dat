40|$|Annotation is an {{integral}} part of reading, comprehending, commenting, and authoring notes and documents. In this paper we present a system for recognizing annotations in a flexible digital notebook that may contain a variety of content ranging from text, to images, to handwritten notes. To accomplish the recognition task in real-time makes the complicated annotation parsing problem more difficult. Our approach differs from previous approaches in several ways. First, our approach handles annotations on ink notes, which are significantly more ambiguous than annotations on printed documents and hence more difficult to recognize. Second, our approach is entirely learned from data, so it is easy to adapt to other scenarios. Third, our approach is more thoroughly evaluated than previous systems. On a test set of real <b>user</b> <b>notes,</b> the system has achieved an average recall of 0. 9258 on all annotation types.

Replication origins are best {{understood in the}} budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where several complementary studies have mapped their locations genome-wide. We have collated these datasets, taking account of the resolution of each study, to generate a single list of distinct origin sites. OriDB provides a web-based catalogue of these confirmed and predicted S. cerevisiae DNA replication origin sites. Each proposed or confirmed origin site appears as a record in OriDB, with each record comprising seven pages. These pages provide, in text and graphical formats, the following information: genomic location and chromosome context of the origin site; time of origin replication; DNA sequence of proposed or experimentally confirmed origin elements; free energy required to open the DNA duplex (stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization or SIDD); and phylogenetic conservation of sequence elements. In addition, OriDB encourages community submission of additional information for each origin site through a <b>User</b> <b>Notes</b> facility.

The initial survey year age variable, ‘Age, 67, ’ {{was provided by the}} Census Bureau based on information collected during the 1966 household screening; complete information is available for most respondents. As age inconsistencies were discovered, Census made date of birth information available in the late 1970 s. Additional age variables have been collected in the “Household Roster ” section of the questionnaire for those interviewed in recent rounds (i. e., ‘Age of Respondent, 87 ’ and ‘Age of Respondent, 89 ’). During the 1981 interview, respondents were asked whether the Census birth date information was correct. In 144 cases, the respondent reported a birth date different from that originally provided by Census; the 1981 variable contains revised birth dates for those cases. The 1987 and 1989 “Household Roster ” collected additional date of birth information for the respondent. During the 1995 – 99 surveys, the respondent was asked to confirm or correct the most recent birth date information available. Table 4. 1. 1 provides reference numbers for date of birth and age variables; Table 4. 1. 2 presents age distributions for the Mature Women.

40|$|The <b>User</b> <b>Notes</b> are {{intended}} to clarify the sections of the MLO for the various audiences who will use it: lighting designers, city officials, engineers, citizen groups, and others. Every effort {{has been made to}} keep the language technically accurate and clear, but since different disciplines may use the same term in different ways, or have different interpretations, some guidance may be helpful. While these Notes can not be a full tutorial on modern lighting design, it is hoped that the Notes will help facilitate the dialogue necessary to adopt the MLO. Background The problems of light pollution first became an issue in the 1970 s when astronomers identified the degradation of the night sky due to the increase in lighting associated with development and growth. As more impacts to the environment by lighting have been identified, an international “dark sky ” movement is advocating for the precautionary approach to outdoor lighting design. Many communities have passed anti-light-pollution laws and ordinances. However, {{there is little or no}} agreement among these laws, and they vary considerably in language, technical quality, and stringency. This is confusing for designers, engineers, and code officials. The lack of a common basis prevents the development of standards, educational programs, and other means of achieving the goal of effective lighting control. This MLO will allow communities to drastically reduce light pollution and glare and lower excessive light levels. The recommended practices of the IES can be met using readily available, reasonably priced lighting equipment. However, many conventional lighting practices will no longer be permitted, or will require special permits. This Model Lighting Ordinance (MLO) is the result of extensive efforts by the International Dark Sky Association (IDA) and the Illuminatin...|$|E

40|$|The TINTE main {{documentation}} {{consists of}} three parts, the first two of which/ 1 /,/ 2 / have been published (in German) in the late eighties. In the first part the problems of modelling the nuclear and thermo-gas-dynamic behaviour of the primary circuit of a high temperature gas cooled reactor (HTGR) have been discussed in detail. It has been explained how the multiconnected system can be decomposed into single tasks to be solved separately. The solution of the total system is thus found by iteration of the partial results. In {{the second part of}} the documentation some major applications of TINTE are demonstrated. Among them the analyses of dynamic reactor experiments performed at the AVR reactor / 4 / are of special interest. These results play a major role in the TINTE validation process, and the very good conformance obtained with the experimental data validate the TINTE calculations to a considerable extent. Earlier post-calculations of the AVR experiments with a previous version of the TINTE code have been described in / 5 /. Moreover, the basic algorithms as used in TINTE together with some applications have been shown in / 4 /. Since not all of the capabilities of TINTE could be addressed in these analysis, the validation process was continued, e. g. with the evaluation of the VELUNA corrosion experiments / 6 /. An addendum to the principal considerations of / 1 / has been added as a supplement to / 2 /. Here the gas flow in an optional 1 -D component and flow network is described, which may be used to enhance the 2 -D reactor model for special situations. This flow network was necessary to model non-central pipes and other three-dimensional gas flow paths. It allows the description of co-axial pipes and a lumped parameter simulation of the primary side ofheat exchangers or steam generators. One example in / 4 / shows that under certain limitations even a simulation of a gas-gas heat exchanger and the incorporation of the secondary loop is possible with the aid of that flow-network. In this addendum the possibility is also introduced to calculate the pressure inside the reactorfrom a given (fixed or variable in time) gas inventory. This is of relevance for accident analyses, where a failure of the pressure enclosure is assumed. If the pressure increases significantly gas may be removed from the system by burst discs or safety valves. This document starts with a description of the TINTE code structure (Section 4), while Section 5 is dedicated to the description and interpretation of the main input data. Section 6 deals with the preparation of the nuclear data base, the generation of the cross-section polynomial expansions and the necessary interface codes. Aspects included here are the evaluation of nuclide vectors (prepared by burn-up codes) and the preparation of spectrum calculations with variation of temperatures, buckling and concentrations for spectrum relevant nuclides. <b>User</b> <b>notes</b> on the code installation and calculational procedures are presented in Section 7, while Sections 8 and 9 discuss the TINTE control options and output data options, respectively.
