2500|$|The band showed promise but had yet {{to evolve}} into a decent line-up capable of {{fulfilling}} it and spent several years treading water.

[...] While on a visit to Scotland, American engineer and producer Niko Bolas, a long-time Neil Young and Rolling Stones associate, tuned into a Travis session on Radio Scotland, and heard something in the band's music which instantly made him travel to Perth to see them. Healy: [...] "He told us we were shit, took <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> for four days, and taught us how to play properly, like a band. He was ballsy, rude, and New York pushy.

[...] The band recorded a five-song demo, which included the song [...] "All I Want to Do Is Rock".|$|E

Additionally, the song contains some references to founding Pink Floyd member, Syd Barrett. The song was written after an argument between Gilmour, Waters, and co-producer Bob Ezrin during production of <b>The</b> Wall <b>in</b> which Gilmour and Ezrin challenged Waters to come up with one more song for the album.

It featured the number 1 R singles [...] "Forever My Lady," [...] "Stay," [...] and [...] "Come and Talk to Me." [...] Mr. Dalvin recalls how the album Forever My Lady was created, “The last version of the album that was released only took us a week to finish because we had already written the songs. It was about getting our sounds right because the vocals were already done. It was <b>us</b> going back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> recreating <b>the</b> beats and the melodies... Most of the songs were written before we left North Carolina. My brother was 16 and I was 14 when we wrote the songs..." [...] The album went on to sell over three million copies.|$|R
5000|$|The Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, {{who often}} backed Seger {{in his studio}} {{recording}}s, sent Seger a demo of the song during the recording of Stranger in Town.

5000|$|He {{also talked}} about when they {{originally}} recorded the EP, saying: [...] "We had already recorded this shit {{all the way back}} when my foot was broken. This is last year when we did this. I was on crutches. So we were originally going to put it out August 9th, the three-year anniversary of How Fly, but we realized the publishing company might come for us. Not so much on my part, because I feel like I’m still underground, but my brother done got so far up I thought they might feel some kind of way. If it was just me, it might fly under the radar, but to protect my brother we had to do it the right way. So it just took forever to get it right. This shit had been done. The only reason we went back in the studio and you’re seeing these pieces of video of <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> is because we recently went back in the studio like two weeks ago out in Cali just to listen to everything ’cause you know, I don’t listen to nothing that I record. So Wiz was like “Come on, let’s go listen to this in the studio and make sure everything’s gravy." [...] He also spoke about how it was recording the EP with Wiz Khalifa, saying: [...] "Honestly, it’s exactly the same. It’s just we got way more trees to twist up and way more for everything. It used to be we got X-amount for pizza, X-amount for bud, X-amount for drink and then we gotta pay for studio time. But now it’s like… Laughs We just do whatever we want. It’s really the same, but we just put the cheat code in. So now we got like infinite bullets and 30 lives." [...] On May 10, 2013, the music video for [...] "Toast" [...] was released.|$|E
5000|$|Although heralded by {{many critics}} as [...] "the future of music," [...] Capitol Records was unsure how to market Bonepony’s unique amalgam of musical styles. Therefore, the label was unmotivated {{to market the}} band and did nothing {{in the way of}} promotion. As Johnson explains, [...] "...it was like a seven record deal with their option each time, and we were {{supposed}} to be guaranteed to make two albums, but we did Stomp Revival, and they seemed real pumped on it in the beginning but, I think they weren’t quite sure how to market the record. A lot of changes were going on in the music business then, you know, Dave Matthews hadn’t quite hit yet, Blues Traveler, they were on their fourth record which hadn’t really quite hit yet either. And it was a real backlash of all the Seattle music that was going on, a lot of guessing as to what was going to be the next hot thing." [...] In 1997, Capitol Records rejected the group's proposed second album and dropped the band from the label. According to Scott, [...] "I think they signed us in hopes that it was going to be a real rootsy thing but it wasn’t so much, and a lot of the blame of us not doing great I think has to be placed on us, too. But we really have only one market where we could play and make any money and that was Nashville. So here we are trying to tour on a record with all this major label support behind us, but we couldn’t draw flies in any other market. And anybody that plays in a band knows, you gotta have a crowd if you’re going to be sustained. It’s gotta be real and genuine support and not hype support; you can’t buy it. So I think Capitol was disappointed with sales on the first record and they put <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>studio</b> to make the second one and they didn’t like the direction the music was going. I think they were going “how would I market this? I don’t hear a radio hit…” so they dropped us. We were seven songs into the second record and we got dropped, which we were all excited about at the time because it was a lot of hard work. But I’m proud of what we’ve done since then, we forged ahead and did our own thing." ...|$|E

This situation eventually creates {{the so called}} “war of format” between the two most popular high definition formats, the Blu-ray from Sony/Hitachi and the HD DVD from Toshiba. Unlike the war of format before, for example is VHS versus Betamax war, that determinated mostly by the consumer, the format war between Blu-ray and HD DVD is strongly affect by the abilities of the companies behind the two format to consentrate and integrate their business moghul and also to make alliance between competitiors.
