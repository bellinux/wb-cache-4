40|$|Markov {{models are}} {{commonly}} used to asses the dependability/performability of fault-tolerant systems. Computation of many dependability/performability measures for repairable fault-tolerant systems requires the transient analysis of irreducible Markov models. Examples of such measures are the <b>unavailability</b> at <b>time</b> t and the expected interval <b>unavailability</b> at <b>time</b> t. Randomization (also called uniformization) is a well-known Markov transient analysis method and has good properties: numerical stability, well-controlled computation error, and ability to specify the computation error in advance. However, the randomization method is computationally expensive when the model is stiff, {{as is the case}} for Markov models of repairable fault-tolerant systems when the mission time of interest is large. Steady-state detection is a technique recently proposed to speedup randomization when the model is irreducible. This paper points out that another method, regenerative randomization, which has the same good properties as randomization, also covers irreducible models, and compares, for the important class of irreducible failure/repair models with exponential failure and repair time distributions and repair in every state with failed components, the efficiency of the regenerative randomization method with that of randomization with steady-state detection. In the frequent case in which the initial state is the state without failed components the regenerative randomization method can be faster than randomization with steady-state detection, specially when the model is large and the failure rates are much smaller than the repair rates. For other initial probability distributions, the regenerative randomization method seems to perform worse than randomization with steady-state detection. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{new type}} of ad hoc networks is Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) which envision Inter-Vehicle Communications. Since, nodes in VANETs are both mobile as well as carrier of information; the network may not have full communication connectivity {{all the time and}} they may form several clusters where the nodes in each cluster may communicate with each other directly or indirectly. Multi-clustering happens whenever the minimum distance between two adjacent nodes becomes more than the transmission range of a node. Therefore, two important performance measures which affect the functionality in VANETs are communications connectivity and path availability. In this thesis, we study the statistical properties of these performance measures in VANETs at the steady state. First, it is assumed that the nodes travel along a multi-lane highway which allows vehicles to overtake each other. We derive the probability distributions of the node population size and node's location in the highway segments. Then, we determine the mean population size in a cluster and probability that nodes will form a single cluster. Then we extend the single highway model to a network of highways with arbitrary topology. We determine the joint distribution of the node populations in the highways' segments by application of the BCMP theorem. We model the number of clusters within the node population in a network path as a Markovian birth-death process. This model enables derivation of the probability distribution of the number of clusters and determination of mean durations of continuous communication path availability and <b>unavailability</b> <b>times</b> as functions of mobility and node arrival parameters. At the end, mean packet delay is presented for end to end communication in a path. We give numerical results which illustrate the effect of mobility on continuous communication path availability and communication delay.

Two standard elevation angles of 50, 550 {{as well as some}} elevation angles for links to recently launched Nigeria Communication Satellite, (NigComsat- 1) were used in the computation of the propagation impairments for the 37 locations. Linearly and circularly polarized waves were considered. The International Telecommunication Union Radiowave Propagation models (ITU-RP) were used in the investigation of the propagation impairments. The study is divided into three parts; firstly, the collection and analysis of meteorological data from Tropical Rain Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) satellites such as rain accumulation, profiles of temperature, pressure, and relative humidity, surface temperature and pressure were validated with the available ground data in Nigeria to form statistics on monthly and annual basis. These are reprocessed to derive propagation parameters, such as; one-minute rainfall rate, water vapour density, total cloud liquid water content, and integrated water vapour content. Secondly, an appropriate ITU-RP propagation model was selected for each of the propagation impairment and was used to calculate each attenuation distribution for a percentage of <b>time</b> <b>unavailability.</b> Thirdly, the attenuation due to all impairments were combined based on the annual cumulative distribution and percentage of <b>time</b> <b>unavailability</b> between 0. 01 to 10 %. The calculation of the propagation parameters are based on the measured mean annual data in each location for the period of 4 to 9 years. Propagation impairments were also computed at Ku, Ka and V bands for links to NigComsat- 1 at 0. 01 to 10 % of <b>time</b> <b>unavailability</b> in an average year. The results of all impairment were compared on regional basis by using a colour chart for all the 37 locations in Nigeria. The results of the predicted propagation impairments are as follows: rain attenuation is highly severe in Abakaliki the South-East (SE) region followed, in descending order, by Yenagoa the South-South (SS), Ibadan South-West (SW), Jos Middle-Belt (MB), Damaturu North-East (NE), and Kastina North-West (NW) regions. Cloud attenuation is highly severe in Abakaliki the SE region followed, in descending order, by Jos (MB), Gombe (NE), Dutse (NW), Ikeja (SW), and Calabar (SS) regions. Gaseous attenuation is highly severe in Calabar the (SS regions) followed, in descending order, by Ikeja (SW), Abakaliki (SE), Abuja (MB), Dutse the (NE) and Kastina (NW) regions. Tropospheric scintillation is very high in Calabar (the SS region) followed, in descending order, by Ikeja (SW), Owerri (SE), Abuja (MB), Dutse (NE) and Kastina (NW) regions. Combined impairments due to multiple sources of simultaneously occurring atmospheric attenuation is highly severe in Abakaliki the (SE region) followed, in descending order, by Uyo (SS), Ikeja the (SW), Markudi (MB), Maiduguri (NE) and Katsina (NW) regions.

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper is}} among the first works to {{document}} experimental results for application-aware H. 264 Scalable Video Coding (SVC) support over Wireless LANs. Application-aware support is achieved by introducing a bandwidth throttling device, called Virtual BottleNeck (VBN), before the WLAN Access Point. Throttling is set to a bandwidth slightly smaller than the actual WLAN capacity (either known or estimated), so that all packet/frame losses occur inside the VBN. Here, loss events are controlled by a scheduling mechanism devised to operate with information taken from the H. 264 Network Abstraction Layer Units (NALUs). Despite its relative simplicity, the implemented scheduler exhibits effective video adaptation performance and close to optimal bandwidth efficiency. Setting up the trial was not trivial {{due to the lack}} of suitable publicly available tools. We filled this gap by implementing and integrating several separate software modules, e. g., streaming server, NALU dependency filtering, video frame concealment, etc. As a final result, the experimental trial supports the full delivery chain for an SVC stream with the only limitation of an off-line stream conversion for play-out and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) measurement purposes, due to the <b>unavailability</b> of real <b>time</b> SVC players.

Our aim is to find conditions concerning controller failure time, under which the system’s {{stability and}} L 2 gain properties are preserved to a desired level. For stability, by using a piecewise Lyapunov function, we show that if the unavailability rate of the controller is smaller than a specified constant and the average time interval between controller failures (ATBCF) is large enough, then global exponential stability of the system is guaranteed. For L 2 gain, also by using a piecewise Lyapunov function, we show that if the unavailability rate of the controller is smaller than a specified constant, then the system with an ATBCF achieves a reasonable weighted L 2 gain level, and the weighted L 2 gain approaches normal L 2 gain when the ATBCF is sufficiently large.

40|$|Contingencies {{studied in}} lever-pressing {{procedures}} {{were incorporated into}} a popular computer game, "Star Trek," played by college students. One putative reinforcer, the opportunity to destroy Klingon invaders, was scheduled independently of responding according to a variable-time schedule that alternated unpredictably with equal periods of Klingon <b>unavailability</b> (mixed variable <b>time,</b> extinction schedule of reinforcement). Two commands ("observing responses") each produced stimuli that were either correlated or uncorrelated with the two components. In several variations of the basic game, an S-, or bad news, was not as reinforcing as an S+, or good news. In addition, in other conditions for the same subjects observing responses were not maintained better by bad news than by an uninformative stimulus. In both choices, more observing tended to be maintained by an S- for response-independent Klingons when its information could be (and was) used to advantage with respect to other types of reinforcement in the situation (Parts 1 and 2) than when the information could not be so used (Part 3). The findings favor the conditioned reinforcement hypothesis of observing behavior over the uncertainty-reduction hypothesis. This extends research to a more natural setting and to multialternative concurrent schedules of events of seemingly intrinsic value...|$|R
