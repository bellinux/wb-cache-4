2500|$|Using this information, Goodman and Gilman {{reasoned}} that this agent {{could be used}} to treat lymphoma, since lymphoma is a tumor of lymphoid cells. They first set <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> model—they established lymphomas in mice and demonstrated they could treat them with mustard agents. Next, in collaboration with a thoracic surgeon, Gustaf Lindskog, they injected a related agent, mustine (the prototype nitrogen mustard anticancer chemotherapeutic), into a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. They observed a dramatic reduction in the patient's tumor masses. Although this effect lasted only a few weeks, and the patient had to return for another set of treatment, this was the first step to the realization that cancer could be treated by pharmacological agents. [...] Publication of the first clinical trials was reported in the New York Times.|$|E
60|$|There {{were days}} {{when all the}} air was vexed with roars and squalls of ferocity and agony from the arena, until the last animal in the cages was excited and ill at ease. In truth, since it was Mulcachy's boast that he could break the best animal living, no end of the hardest cases fell to his hand. He had built a {{reputation}} for succeeding where others failed, and, endowed with fearlessness, callousness, and cunning, he never let his reputation wane. There was nothing he dared not tackle, and, when he gave <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal,</b> the last word was said. For it, remained nothing but to be a cage-animal, in solitary confinement, pacing ever up and down, embittered with all the world of man and roaring its bitterness to the most delicious enthrillment of the pay-spectators.|$|E

50|$|Common water snakes {{have many}} predators, {{including}} birds, raccoons, opossums, foxes, snapping turtles, and other snakes and people. They defend themselves vigorously {{when they are}} threatened. If they are picked <b>up</b> by <b>an</b> <b>animal,</b> or person, they will bite repeatedly, as well as release excrement and musk. Their saliva contains a mild anticoagulant, which can cause the bite to bleed more but poses little risk to humans. Smaller ones tend to flatten to look larger in size.|$|R

5000|$|A halter {{is used to}} {{lead and}} tie <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal.</b> [...] It is used on many {{different}} types of livestock. Halters are most closely associated with Equidae such as horses, donkeys, and mules. However, they are also used on farm animals such as cattle and goats and other working animals such as camels, llamas, and yaks. Halters generally are not used on elephants or on predators, though there are halters made for dogs.|$|E

50|$|For {{a period}} {{the area that}} the spring was located on was not {{open to the public}} due to it being on royal hunting grounds. In 1669, King Frederick III decided to set <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> park in the area and his son, Christian V, {{extended}} the size of the park by 3-4 times after he became king in 1670. The area was named Jægersborg Dyrehave, its present name, in 1671. The park was off-limits to the general public under Christian V and this did not change until 1756, under Frederick V.|$|E
50|$|A hackamore, put simply, is {{headgear}} {{that controls}} a horse via pressure {{points on the}} face, usually with a nosepiece instead of a bit. A hackamore {{is not the same}} thing as a halter, as a halter is primarily used for leading and tying <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal.</b> Bitless bridles are similar to hackamores, but some designs use different leverage principles for control. Hackamores and bitless bridles use a headstall with reins attached to some type of noseband or nosepiece. Various designs allow control and good communication to the horse and may, in some cases, be more comfortable to the horse, particularly a young animal or one with a mouth injury.|$|E

50|$|In June 2011, the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (PCE) {{released}} a report in favour of 1080 to control possums, rats, and stoats, especially in large and remote areas.

The PCE came to a number of conclusions, including not having a moratorium on 1080 use, and setting <b>up</b> <b>a</b> Game <b>Animal</b> Council.

The dogs were sent to Sir Edward Hallstrom who had set <b>up</b> <b>a</b> native <b>animal</b> study center in Nondugi, {{and from there to}} the Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia. In 1957, Ellis Troughton examined the two singing dog specimens from the Taronga Zoo and classified them as a distinct species Canis hallstromi in honour of Hallstrom.|$|R
5000|$|Horse halters are {{sometimes}} confused with a bridle.The primary {{difference between a}} halter and a bridle is that a halter is used by a handler {{on the ground to}} lead or tie <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal,</b> but a bridle is generally used by a person who is riding or driving an animal that has been trained in this use. A halter is safer than a bridle for tying, as the bit of a bridle may injure the horse's mouth if the horse sets back while tied with a bridle, and in addition, many bridles are made of lighter materials and will break. On the other hand, a bridle offers more precise control.|$|E

Max, Maya, Dewey, and Buck (Old Jack's stunt double) were played by dogs seen in Disney's Snow Dogs.

50|$|The {{park was}} founded by John Holer, a Slovenian {{immigrant}} {{who had worked for}} circuses in Europe before coming to Canada in the late 1950s. Holer had escaped Yugoslavia after a family winery had been nationalized and moved to Switzerland to live with an uncle. He developed his interest in working with animals and joined a circus which travelled in Europe and North America. A circus visit to the Niagara area inspired him to set <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> attraction and he immigrated to Niagara. He worked at various jobs and with a partner bought part of the Harry Oakes estate and built the attraction on the site, doing some of the building and repairs himself.|$|E

50|$|Turbans {{are part}} of the {{national}} dress in Afghanistan. They are used more widely here than elsewhere in the Muslim world, and are worn {{in a wide range of}} styles and colours. In the country's south-east, turbans are wrapped loosely and largely, whereas in Kabul the garment tends to be smaller and tighter. In traditional Afghan society, a related piece of extra cloth called a patu serves practical purposes, such as for wrapping oneself against the cold, to sit on, to tie <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> or to carry water in the cap. Different ethnic groups in Afghanistan wear different lungees with different patterns, way of styling it, fabric, stripes, lengths and colouration. Some styles are, however, nationwide. The styles extend and overlap into western Pakistan.|$|E

5000|$|In 1953 Newman Turner and {{his family}} sold Goosegreen Farm {{and moved to the}} Ferne Estate, near Shaftesbury on the borders of Dorset and Wiltshire, to run the home farm on organic lines. Ferne had been the home of the Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, who had set <b>up</b> <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> {{sanctuary}} there. His hope had been to establish an animal hospital using natural methods of treatment but this did not work out, owing to objections to him publishing from the Ferne estate. [...] Having by now qualified as a medical herbalist in the human field and consulted at the Society of Herbalists' Culpeper shops, founded by Hilda Leyel (Mrs C. F.

In 1958 the family moved to Letchworth Garden City where he established a practice in osteopathy, naturopathy and medical herbalism.

40|$|In my diploma thesis I {{decided to}} write about {{relationship}} between society and animals, mostly because I love animals very much. Although slow, I think that relationship between society and animals is changing to better in last few years. In lots of cases a child is growing <b>up</b> with <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> since his young ages, animals are included in preschool programs in different ways, and not rarely children have animals on visit or even in their own group in kindergarden. Also, in specialized literature, we can find lots of cases of positive influence that <b>an</b> <b>animal</b> has on <b>a</b> child. Changes in last few years also brought more including of animals to man everyday life. In media is more talking about negative attitude towards animals, which I think is really important, because talking and drawing attention to the problem, {{is the only way}} to get rid of it. Nowadays, there is a lot of civil initiatives, which are defending animals rights, more popular are also animal assisted therapies. The empirical part is focused on relationship of children towards animals, therefore which animals do they have for pets, which are they scared of and maybe do they search consolation in animals when they are sad? I also wanted to know how preschool teachers help to develop positive relationship of children towards animals. ...|$|R
