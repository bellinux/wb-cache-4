40|$|Tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. var. DRK) {{were grown}} hydroponically to {{determine}} the effect of an uneven distribution of nutrients in the root zone on blossomend rot (BER) and Ca and K concentrations in the fruits. The plants were grown in rockwool with their root system divided into two portions. Each portion was irrigated with nutrient solutions with either the same or the different electrical conductivity (EC) in the range 0 to 6 dS m(- 1). Solutions with high EC supplied to both sides of the root system significantly increased the incidence of BER. However, when only water or a solution of low EC was supplied to one portion, BER was reduced by 80 %. Fruit yields were significantly higher (P < 0. 01) for plants that received solutions of the <b>uneven</b> EC <b>treatments</b> (6 / 0 or 4. 5 / 0 EC treatment). Plants supplied with solutions of uneven EC generally had higher leaf and fruit concentrations of Ca but lower concentrations of K than those supplied with solutions of high EC. There was no difference in Ca concentration at the distal end of young fruits of the <b>uneven</b> EC <b>treatment</b> but it was reduced in the high EC treatments. The concentration of K in the mature fruits of the <b>uneven</b> EC <b>treatments</b> was lower than that of the high EC treatments and higher or similar that of the 3 / 3 or 2. 5 / 2. 5 EC treatments (controls). A clear relationship was found between the incidence of BER and the exudation rate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the {{regulatory}} issues concerned with marketing repellents and to try to identify areas where changes may be needed. Repellents are covered unevenly by the various Federal and State pesticide laws. These laws were generally formulated to deal with pesticides and other highly toxic chemicals used to control 2 ̆ 2 pests. 2 ̆ 2 However, repellents discourage pests due to their disagreeable properties rather than their toxicity. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has recently introduced reduced risk pesticide guidance which limits reporting requirements and hastens review. Those states that follow the Federal lead do not represent a problem. However, such states as California, Florida, and New York, that conduct their own detailed reviews, have not yet moved to adopt the Federal reduced-risk guidance and often require additional data beyond those required at the Federal level. In addition, foreign countries deal differently with repellents. Canada does not have biochemical or reduced risk guidance and therefore reviews repellents as regular pesticides. The European Union 2 ̆ 7 s new biocides law includes repellents and has significant information requirements. On the other hand, other countries such as New Zealand and Australia have no or minimal registration requirements for repellents.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for equipment used for this type of treatment.

The treatment can be used on metals, alloys, semiconductor or insulators, especially dielectrics; and for applying coatings. Typical applications include forming protective oxide or nitride coatings on electrode surfaces; oxidation of silicon to form the gate insulator of a metal oxide semiconductor device; structurized etching of silicon with chloro- or fluoro-alkanes; and structurized amination of a polymer surface, e. g. with nitrogen, ammonia and/or hydrazine. ADVANTAGE - Most existing methods for modifying predetermined surface areas use photolithography.

40|$|Our {{task was}} threefold: (1) to examine {{what is and}} is not known about {{evacuation}} in peacetime disaster situations; (2) to systematically order and organize the literature and other research data; and, (3) to make recommendations from our findings and observations. About 150 literature sources and other newly gathered as well as previously gathered research data were examined. An analytical model of evacuation behavior was developed positing a relationship between community context, threat conditions, social processes, patterns of behavior including the withdrawal movement, and consequences for community preparedness for evacuation. Policy, planning, operational and research implications were derived suggesting future actions and efforts. Our study did find that we do currently have some research-based knowledge and understanding about evacuation phenomena in disasters. The literature and research data give us a comprehension beyond common sense notions, and in fact, at times, the evidence suggests that citizens in general and officials in particular may be working with incorrect assumptions and beliefs about the phenomena. On this topic, as is true of many other matters about disaster behavior, mythologies and misconceptions about evacuation abound. For example, to the extent that there are research observations, they show that the withdrawal movement itself usually proceeds relatively well. The flight tends to be orderly, reasonable {{from the perspective of the}} evacuees, and generally effective in removing people from danger. The problems with evacuation occur before and after the flight behavior itself. Organizational preparations for and initiation of mass evacuation efforts tend to be poor. Planning is often unrealistic, assumes that evacuees have to controlled and generally does not address the distinctive and special problem which can be involved in mass evacuations. Little consideration in plans or in actuality is given to the fact that evacuation involves going to some area, as well as from some locality, and almost always returning to the original place o f departure. A number of implications and recommendations follow form our analysis of the literature and research data. Thus, we argue that evacuation should be approached as a proactive policy matter important in itself rather than being treated primarily as reaction to warning activities. In some ways, peacetime evacuation ought to be viewed as distinctive and separate phenomena parallel to the treatment of crisis relocation in the literature on wartime emergencies. Planning might visualize evacuation not as an outcome, but as a flow process with different emergent stage involving various kinds of contingencies. Evacuation does not always develop in a singular and linear path, but may involve multiple and disjunctive paths. Operational activities in connection with evacuation must consider the full range of the patterns of behavior that are involved, from the warning to the withdrawal to the shelter and to the return stage. The heterogeneity of the population at different stage requires different organizational actions. We also found that the research base about evacuation phenomena is not strong. Evacuation has not been a major focus of systematic study, and knowledge of the phenomena is often surface and very <b>uneven.</b> Theoretical <b>treatments</b> of evacuation are even fewer and less informative as a whole that the descriptive and case study literature which provides the bulk of the findings and impressions about the topic. Priority in the future ought to be given to in-depth research on unexplored topics (e. g., the non-movers), little systematically examined areas (e. g., the shelter stage) and selected operationally important subjects (e. g [...] , the evacuation of institutionalized populations). At a more theoretical level, study needs to be done on understanding the meshing of individual and organizational behavior in mass emergencies...|$|R
40|$|The Siwalik {{formations}} {{of northern}} Pakistan consist of deposits of ancient rivers that existed throughout the early Miocene {{through the late}} Pliocene. The formations are highly fossiliferous with a diverse array of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates, which in combination with exceptional lateral exposure and good chronostratigraphic control allows a more detailed and temporally resolved study of the sediments and faunas than is typical in terrestrial deposits. Consequently the Siwaliks {{provide an opportunity to}} document temporal differences in species richness, turnover, and ecological structure in a terrestrial setting, and to investigate how such differences are related to changes in the fluvial system, vegetation, and climate. Here we focus on the interval between 10. 7 and 5. 7 Ma, a time of significant local tectonic and global climatic change. It is also the interval with the best temporal calibration of Siwalik faunas and most comprehensive data on species occurrences. A methodological focus of this paper is on controlling sampling biases that confound biological and ecological signals. Such biases include uneven sampling through time, differential preservation of larger animals and more durable skeletal elements, errors in age-dating imposed by uncertainties in correlation and paleomagnetic timescale calibrations, and <b>uneven</b> taxonomic <b>treatment</b> across groups. We attempt to control for them primarily by using a relative-abundance model to estimate limits for the first and last appearances from the occurrence data. This model also incorporates uncertainties in age estimates. Because of sampling limitations inherent in the terrestrial fossil record, our 100 -Kyr temporal resolution may approach the finest possible level of resolution for studies of vertebrate faunal changes over periods of millions of years. Approximately 40, 000 specimens from surface and screenwash collections made at 555 localities form the basis of our study. Sixty percent of the localities have maximum and minimum age estimates differing by 100 Kyr or less, 82 % by 200 Kyr or less. The fossils represent 115 mammalian species or lineages of ten orders: Insectivora, Scandentia, Primates, Tubulidentata, Proboscidea, Pholidota, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Rodentia. Important taxa omitted from this study include Carnivora, Elephantoidea, and Rhinocerotidae. Because different collecting methods were used for large and small species, they are treated separately in analyses. Small species include insectivores, tree shrews, rodents, lagomorphs, and small primates. They generally weigh less than 5 kg. The sediments of the study interval were deposited by coexisting fluvial systems, with the larger emergent Nagri system being displaced between 10. 1 and 9. 0 Ma by an interfan Dhok Pathan system. In comparison to Nagri floodplains, Dhok Pathan floodplains were less well drained, with smaller rivers having more seasonally variable flow and more frequent avulsions. Paleosol sequences indicate reorganization of topography and drainage accompanying a transition to a more seasonal climate. A few paleosols may have formed under waterlogged, grassy woodlands, but most formed under drier conditions and more closed vegetation. The oxygen isotopic record also indicates significant change in the patterns of precipitation beginning at 9. 2 Ma, in what may have been a shift to a drier and more seasonal climate. The carbon isotope record demonstrates that after 8. 1 Ma significant amounts of C 4 grasses began to appear and that by 6. 8 Ma floodplain habitats included extensive C 4 grasslands. Plant communities with predominantly C 3 plants were greatly diminished after 7. 0 Ma, and those with predominantly C 4 plants, which would have been open woodlands or grassy woodlands, appeared as early as 7. 4 Ma. Inferred first and last appearances show a constant, low level of faunal turnover throughout the interval 10. 7 – 5. 7 -Ma, with three short periods of elevated turnover at 10. 3, 7. 8, and 7. 3 – 7. 0 Ma. The three pulses account for nearly 44 % of all turnover. Throughout the late Miocene, species richness declined steadily, and diversity and richness indices together with data on body size imply that community ecological structure changed abruptly just after 10 Ma, and then again at 7. 8 Ma. Between 10 and 7. 8 Ma the large-mammal assemblages were strongly dominated by equids, with more balanced faunas before and after. The pattern of appearance and disappearance is selective with respect to inferred habits of the animals. Species appearing after 9. 0 Ma are grazers or typical of more open habitats, whereas many species that disappear can be linked to more closed vegetation. We presume exceptions to this pattern were animals of the mixed C 3 /C 4 communities or the wetter parts of the floodplain that did not persist into the latest Miocene. The pace of extinction accelerates once there is C 4 vegetation on the floodplain. The 10. 3 Ma event primarily comprises disappearance of taxa that were both common and of long duration. The event does not correlate to any obvious local environmental or climatic event, and the pattern of species disappearance and appearance suggests that biotic interactions may have been more important than environmental change. The 7. 8 Ma event is characterized solely by appearances, and that at 7. 3 Ma by a combination of appearances and disappearances. These two latest Miocene events include more taxa that were shorter ranging and less common, a difference of mode that developed between approximately 9. 0 and 8. 5 Ma when many short-ranging and rare species began to make appearances. Both events also show a close temporal correlation to changes in floodplain deposition and vegetation. The 7. 8 Ma event follows the widespread appearance of C 4 vegetation and is coincident with the shift from equid-dominated to more evenly balanced large-mammal assemblages. The 7. 3 to 7. 0 Ma event starts with the first occurrence of C 4 -dominated floras and ends with the last occurrence of C 3 -dominated vegetation. Absence of a consistent relationship between depositional facies and the composition of faunal assemblages leads us to reject fluvial system dynamics as a major cause of faunal change. The close correlation of latest Miocene species turnover and ecological change to expansion of C 4 plants on the floodplain, in association with oxygen isotopic and sedimentological evidence for increasingly drier and more seasonal climates, causes us to favor explanations based on climatic change for both latest Miocene pulses. The Siwalik record supports neither “coordinated stasis” nor “turnover pulse” evolutionary models. The brief, irregularly spaced pulses of high turnover are characteristic of both the stasis and pulse models, but the high level of background turnover that eliminates 65 – 70 % of the initial species shows there is no stasis in the Siwalik record. In addition, the steadily declining species richness and abrupt, uncoordinated changes in diversity do not fit either model...|$|R

I indicate that in these countries two rules – of imagined familiarity and imagined utility, both in the sauce of economic axiology – are being used in the contemporary public discourse as an articulation of the existence legitimacy for those who may be indicated and labelled as somehow different and specifically “non-native”. I argue that these imaginaries and increasingly economic grounds of group, as well as individual, meaning and worth assessment are also a justification of the social groups <b>uneven</b> <b>treatment</b> in spite of official recognising the anti-discriminatory and multiculturalistic rules. The Polish affirmative action addressed to the natives is given here as an example of carelessness and negligence in law establishing - bearing in mind the genesis of Poland’s relative ethno-cultural homogeneity and democracy - that may occur very troublesome in the context of growing multiculturality. lukaszk@amu. edu. plInstytut Archeologii i Etnologii, Polska Akademia Nau...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} registering multiple point sets. Solutions to this problem are often approximated by repeatedly solving for pairwise registration, which results in an <b>uneven</b> <b>treatment</b> of the sets forming a pair: a model set and a data set. The main drawback of this strategy is that the model set may contain noise and outliers, which negatively affects the estimation of the registration parameters. In contrast, the proposed formulation treats all the point sets on an equal footing. Indeed, all the points are drawn from a central Gaussian mixture, hence the registration is cast into a clustering problem. We formally derive batch and incremental EM algorithms that robustly estimate both the GMM parameters and the rotations and translations that optimally align the sets. Moreover, the mixture's means {{play the role of}} the registered set of points while the variances provide rich information about the contribution of each component to the alignment. We thoroughly test the proposed algorithms on simulated data and on challenging real data collected with range sensors. We compare them with several state-of-the-art algorithms, and we show their potential for surface reconstruction from depth data. Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures, 5 table...|$|E
40|$|Product market reform (i. e. liberalization, or deregulation, {{of product}} markets) in Europe is considered, {{in a recent}} book edited by Tito Boeri et al. (2006), from three major perspectives: for its spread and timing (an {{empirical}} matter); for its efficiency justification, impact and further potential (a normative — welfare-economic — question); for its political conditions (an issue of public choice and political economy). Thus, the book considers {{a number of issues}} — possibly too large a number, as a vast and complex matter is squeezed into a mid-sized book (336 pages in all). The multiple authorship (involving contributions to the main text and comments on it by a number of academics and researchers) does not help, as it results into <b>uneven</b> <b>treatment</b> and considerable discontinuities. At the same time, however, the book is interesting and useful, in that it singles out extremely relevant issues, offers new and penetrating insights, and delivers a clear (and, to the present reviewer, convincing) policy message. In short: in Europe, for a long time, product markets have been made the object of very heavy, inefficient, regulation; their working has thus been constrained and distorted, with damagin...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{multicore}} processors with an on-chip memory controller {{form the}} base for NUMA (non-uniform memory architecture) multiprocessors. Each processor accesses part of the physical memory directly and {{has access to the}} other parts via the memory controller of other processors. These other processors are reached via the cross-processor interconnect. As a consequence a processor’s memory controller must satisfy two kinds of requests: those that are generated by the local cores and those that arrive via the interconnect from other processors. On the other hand, a core (respectively the core’s cache) can obtain data from multiple sources: data can be supplied by the local memory controller or by a remote memory controller on another processor. In this paper we experimentally analyze the behavior of the memory controllers of a commercial multicore processor, the Intel Xeon 5520 (Nehalem). We develop a simple model to characterize the sharing of local and remote memory bandwidth. The <b>uneven</b> <b>treatment</b> of local and remote accesses has implications for mapping applications onto such a NUMA multicore multiprocessor. Maximizing data locality does not always minimize execution time; it may be more advantageous to allocate data on a remote processor (and then to fetch these data via the cross-processor interconnect) than to store the data of all processes in local memory (and consequently overloading the on-chip memory controller) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} {{conceived}} {{more as a}} collaborative study than as comparative research in the strict sense. The emphasis was on national studies, not on comparison among countries. Given the exploratory nature of the research, each national study had great freedom to define, conceptually and empirically, the "field " of social policy, thus acknowledging the complexity and ubiquity {{of the concept of}} social policies. The knowledge that specialists from one country in the region have regarding another country is not necessarily sufficient to guarantee a common ground of shared understanding. Most of the studies provided a scant and <b>uneven</b> <b>treatment</b> of, or intentionally omitted references to, the historical trends, social structure, and state of the art of social protection systems. It was assumed that such information was relatively well known. The results of the national studies and, in particular, the debate resulting from the last seminar, held in Montevideo in September 1994, showed that, despite the great heterogeneity among countries, a core of common problems warrants careful analysis. These can be summarized as follows: l Latin American countries are undergoing profound and accelerated transformations induced by changes in the international system. In light of a process of globalization and virtual "shrinking " of the world, and compelled to find a new place in an increasingly competitive international system, the countries of Latin America had t...|$|E
40|$|The study {{about the}} {{reception}} of international obligations concerning the {{protection of geographical indications}} and its effectiveness in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is particularly relevant from a legal and economic development perspective. Geographical indications have become noteworthy in recent years due to their inclusion in a treaty that binds the practical entirety of the international community. Prior to that event, their regulation lacked international consensus and received an <b>uneven</b> <b>treatment</b> in different jurisdictions, which provides an opportunity to analyze the integration of the resultant obligations in Puerto Rico’s legal system and the limits that its political relationship with the United States imposes upon the possibilities of the effective protection of geographical of Puerto Rican indications in international trade. The economic potential of geographical indications can be significant, in view of their application to coffee and rum, two products of substantial importance to the local economy. Considering that geographical indications have no presence in Puerto Rico’s legal system, as they are not even defined, the recent discussions regarding two legislative bills about Puerto Rican appellations of origin confirm the importance of the study. Time is of the essence, because as other jurisdictions continue to claim protection of their products, unprotected products will miss the opportunity of being among the products distinguished by their quality and geographical origin [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The paper {{describes}} solutions of {{the problem}} raised during treating the turbine wheel of a turbocharger. The treatment of a complex surface with a hard grinding wheel {{requires a lot of}} time. This method does not provide the required quality because of the inaccessibility of some parts of the turbine blades. The problem is solved by polishing with loose abrasive grains. The abrasive medium is compressed with compressed air through a special device. Materials and Methods: The SolidWorks 2016 software was used to design the tool. The design of the part for determining actual loads and deflections was calculated taking into account the comparison of the operating parameters with the permissible values. Results: The main parameters of the part tratment are the pressure of the loose abrasive on the working surfaces of the blades and the speed of rotation of the part on the mandrel of the installation (cutting speed). During treating, the part experiences significant static and dynamic loads. The tension can lead to inadmissible deflection of the mandrel to secure the part, <b>uneven</b> <b>treatment</b> of its complex surfaces and defects. The performed calculations showed that in polishing the surfaces of parts of a complex, load profile and deflections on the workpiece and the mandrel are within the permissible values. Discussion and Conclusions: The presented method provides stable qualitative and productive treatment of the complex surfaces. The findings from this study contribute to the current technology of metal processing...|$|E
40|$|Establishing noise {{exposure}} criteria for marine mammals {{has proven to}} be a difficult and contentious issue. Over the last decade, several attempts have been made to provide scientifically-based exposure criteria. While representing the best available science on the issue, these criteria, and the assumptions underpinning them, have led to considerable discussion among both scientists and policy-makers. However, one area where there has been little or no debate is that of appropriate statistical and other numerical procedures used in the various criteria-establishing methodologies. A common issue, arising from a desire to include as much data as possible, is pseudoreplication. Examples from acoustic criteria are the use of many data points from a single animal to establish a value for one species and the use of several points from one species to set values for a functional hearing group. Less fundamental, but equally problematic for the application of the criteria to policy, is the failure to adequately represent uncertainty around proposed criteria through the use of confidence intervals. Other issues are also present in the <b>uneven</b> <b>treatment</b> of different data in terms of transformation protocols and extrapolation, but also in the determination of which outliers to discard. Each of these errors introduces bias into the resulting criteria. Thus, despite the paucity of relevant data, we need to meet such statistical standards to truly provide objective advice that rises to the level of the best available science...|$|E
