2500|$|Pines {{are mostly}} monoecious, having {{the male and}} female cones on the same tree, though a few species are sub-dioecious, with {{individuals}} predominantly, but not wholly, single-sex. The male cones are small, typically 1–5cm long, and only present for a short period (usually in spring, though autumn in a few pines), falling as soon as they have shed their pollen. The female cones take 1.5–3 years (depending on species) to mature after pollination, with actual fertilization delayed one year. At maturity the female cones are 3–60cm long. Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales, with two seeds on each fertile scale; the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile, without seeds. The seeds are mostly small and winged, and are anemophilous (wind-dispersed), but some are larger and have only a vestigial wing, and are bird-dispersed (see below). At maturity, the cones usually open to release the seeds, but in some of the bird-dispersed species (e.g. whitebark pine), the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open. In others, the seeds are stored in closed ("serotinous") cones for many years until an environmental cue triggers the cones to open, releasing the seeds. [...] The most common form of serotiny is pyriscence, in which a resin binds the cones shut <b>until</b> <b>melted</b> by a forest fire.|$|E

50|$|During initiation, {{the wire}} heats {{with the passing}} current <b>until</b> <b>melting</b> point is reached. The heating rate is high enough that the liquid metal has no time to flow away, and heats further until it vaporizes. During this phase the {{electrical}} resistance of the bridgewire assembly rises. Then an electric arc forms in the metal vapor, leading to drop of electrical resistance and sharp growth of the current, quick further heating of the ionized metal vapor, and formation of a shock wave. To achieve the melting and subsequent vaporizing of the wire in time sufficiently short to create a shock wave, a current rise rate of at least 100 amperes per microsecond is required.|$|R

50|$|The {{ingredients}} {{often include}} butter or margarine, molasses, sugar, and sometimes white vinegar. The molasses {{is the critical}} ingredient, for it is less sweet than sugar and has a slightly bitter flavour that gives bonfire toffee its unique taste. One recipe calls for 230 g of butter, 230 g of treacle, and 450 g of brown sugar. The mixture is cooked over medium heat <b>until</b> <b>melted,</b> and allowed to boil (while constantly stirring rapidly) for 15 minutes. The hot mixture is then poured into buttered forms (such as a cake pan or special forms). Recipes calling {{for the use of}} vinegar vary these ingredients. For example, one recipe from 1922 calls for 550 g of dark brown sugar, 280 ml of molasses, one tablespoon (15 ml) of vinegar, one tablespoon (15 ml) of butter, and one teaspoon (5 ml) of sodium bicarbonate (or baking soda). White vinegar gives the toffee a slightly sharper taste, and alters the chemistry of the toffee so that it is not so brittle. It also helps the toffee to set. Other recipes call for about 5 imppt L of water, and vary the amount of the other ingredients. Some recipes call for the use of golden syrup (In the US this is light molasses mixed with corn syrup) instead of molasses/treacle.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDue to the {{concerns}} {{about the effect of}} greenhouse gases on the climate, Geologic CO 2 storage is a very active area of research. One of the biggest risks associated with such projects is the possibility of leakage. Detrimental environmental consequences present a need to study potential leakage scenarios. Stored CO 2 may leak if possible leakage pathways are available and favourable. Pressure and temperature decrease from the leakage source to the surface. Below the CO 2 saturation pressure, liquid condensation of the CO 2 occurs. At even lower temperatures and pressures, in the presence of water, hydrate formation occurs. CO 2 -hydrate forms when free water is available and the temperature is below 283 K and pressure is below 647 psi. During leakage, decreases in the temperature and pressure results in a CO 2 phase change that affects the leakage flux. The {{purpose of this study is}} to estimate the leakage flux for different scenarios taking thermodynamic phase changes into account. An analytical model was built to predict steady state leakage flux taking the phase transitions into account. Several important limiting assumptions were required to perform these calculations. A numerical model with coupled mass and energy balances was developed and used to estimate the flux under less restrictive assumptions than the analytical model. Hydrate formation was modelled using the Van der Waals-Platteeuw model. Example analytical calculations indicate that for a uniform permeability pathway the CO 2 leakage flux decreases by a factor of about two due to CO 2 condensation and about three when hydrate forms compared with the isothermal leakage rate. These calculations illustrate the importance of the pressure and temperature of the leakage source (aquifer) and the amount of water in the pathway (fault) among other variables. Example numerical calculations indicate a cyclical nature of the leakage flux under certain conditions. Hydrate formation results in partial to complete blockage of the fault <b>until</b> <b>melted...</b>|$|E

However, this approximation is not absolute and can break down even for relatively simple materials such as the four metal alloys CuIn₂, AgIn₂, AuIn₂ and AlIn₂,. All the material's structures were explored at varying temperatures using the C 1 and C 16 structures.

Improper water elimination leads to misinterpretation of thermal relaxations in PVA composites {{in agreement with}} the previous report for pristine PVA.
