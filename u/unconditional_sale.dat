50|$|The District Court {{agreed with}} Skylink and because Chamberlain did not {{explicitly}} restrict the consumer's use of alternate transmitters, this was deemed an <b>unconditional</b> <b>sale</b> that implicitly authorized customers to use other transmitters. The court {{also noted that}} Chamberlain's construction and interpretation of the DMCA would make its own consumers violate §1201(a)(1), which prohibits circumvention of a technological measure that controls access.|$|E
5000|$|Under {{pressure}} from creditors and their lawyers, U.S. courts gradually developed a highly technical distinction between an absolute, <b>unconditional</b> <b>sale,</b> {{in which the}} seller simply became another unsecured creditor of the buyer, and a conditional sale, in which {{the sale of the}} goods was made dependent upon some condition (such as payment of the price in installments). Thus, the buyer's breach of a material condition, in turn, made it possible for the seller to declare the contract had ended, that the [...] should be restored, and to repossess the goods accordingly. Since the buyer had breached, he had forfeited his right to reimbursement of any portion of the price already paid, or in the alternative, those payments could be regarded as a crude form of rent {{for the use of the}} goods.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Robertson {{was elected}} unopposed as the {{secretary}} of Unions NSW (formerly the Labor Council of New South Wales), replacing Michael Costa. One of his first acts as secretary was to organise a blockade of the New South Parliament to protest the introduction of workers compensation law reforms. The blockade did not change the government's plans. During his term as secretary, Robertson headed the organisation as it sold its holiday property [...] "Currawong" [...] to finance a campaign to stop the implementation of WorkChoices by the Federal Howard government. The deal {{was said to have}} benefited the developers as the purchase was at [...] "about half the price" [...] of other bids for the property. Currawong had been established in 1949 to allow the union movement to provide poor children with holidays. Robertson denied the deal was at less than value, as it was an <b>unconditional</b> <b>sale</b> compared to other bids which were conditional on building approval.|$|E

40|$|A bedrock {{principle}} of patent law — patent exhaustion — proclaims that an authorized {{sale of a}} patented article exhausts the patentee’s rights {{with respect to the}} article sold. Over one hundred and fifty years of case law, however, has produced two conflicting notions of patent exhaustion, one considering exhaustion to be mandatory regardless of whether the patentee subjects the sale to express patent restrictions, and another treating exhaustion as a default rule that applies only in <b>unconditional</b> <b>sales.</b> The uncertainty surrounding the patent exhaustion doctrine casts a significant legal cloud over patent licensing practices in the modern economy and has emerged as a central subject in scholarly debate on the nature and scope of intellectual property rights. This Article takes a normative approach to patent exhaustion and argues that the correct exhaustion rule should be a “default-plus” rule that combines a default-rule component with a patent misuse test that is independent of the exhaustion analysis. The default-rule component would allow patentees to avoid exhaustion through express patent restrictions, while the patent misuse test would ensure that such restrictions do not violate public policy. This Article contends that this default-plus rule is superior to the mandatory rule in terms of theoretical foundation, malleability, and circumvention. Adopting this default-plus rule would minimize legal impediments to socially beneficial patent restrictions while preserving maximum flexibility in accommodating new technologies and licensing practices...|$|R

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. A {{significant proportion of}} catch by artisanal fishers in Ghana is sold through wealthy middle-women, known as “fish mothers,” who often pre-finance fishing trips. This study examined the determinants of catch sales through fish mothers.   Data used came from artisanal fishermen at major coastal fishing communities in Ghana. The effects of select variables were examined with a Double Hurdle model assuming the fisherman’s marketing decision first relates {{to whether or not}} to sell to fish mothers, and secondly, what percentage of fish catch is sold to them. Self-financing of fishing trips was found to negatively impact fish sold to fish mothers. Artisanal fishermen were 19 % less likely to sell to fish mothers if they self-finance, and that self-financing will result in a 10 % downward change in the unconditional percentage fish sold to fish mothers. The impact of price, percentage of high value fish landed, boat size, number of fishing trips per year as well as fishing experience were found to positively impact the fishermen’s decision.   The estimated average partial effects suggested that boat size had the strongest effect on fish sold through the fish mothers, with about 146 % and 91 % change, respectively on conditional and <b>unconditional</b> <b>sale</b> of fish catch, which is likely caused by higher catches. Fishermen used a range of canoe (boat) sizes from 8 m to 27 m, with an average of 16. 4 m. Price, percentage of high value fish landed, the number of fishing trips per year and fishing experience had relatively smaller positive effects...|$|E
40|$|Rules in English law {{regarding}} {{transfer of}} rights {{with respect to}} land and movables can generally fit into {{the framework of the}} abstract system. As a default rule throughout English property law, a separate stage of conveyance is necessary to complete the transfer of title, although in cases of <b>unconditional</b> <b>sale</b> of ascertained goods, it is possible to transfer title by the transferor’s intent alone. A study of the Sale of Goods Acts and detinue demonstrates that the contract of sale itself has never been a means of conveyance throughout English legal history. No matter whether a conveyance is made by solo consensu or by additional means, a separate intent to convey remains distinct from the intent to bargain. So long as the conveyance is valid according to its own rules, invalidating factors in the underlying basis of that conveyance in principle do not infect the validity of the conveyance itself. Revesting of title by rescinding the contract of sale induced by fraudulent misrepresentation is an exception, but the underlying rationale in those cases is flawed. From a normative perspective, the alleged ‘unfairness’ to the transferor under extreme circumstances is not self-evident. Arguments such as ‘initial impaired consent subtraction’ or ‘assumption of insolvency risk plus swollen assets’ might serve as possible ways to determine such ‘unfairness’. Nonetheless, these arguments remain problematic if employed to justify the need for causality. A unique characteristic of English law is that in certain impaired consent transfer cases, although title transferred cannot revest at law, equity may grant a right under a constructive trust with numerous proprietary attributes. However, this is nevertheless consistent with the operation of the English abstract system, for such an equitable interest acquired by the transferor, unlike what he could acquire under a causal system, is by its nature not a right in rem. With these observations, English law could provide at least three lessons for the ongoing debate in Chinese academia about whether Chinese law should adopt the principles of separation and abstraction. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|E
5000|$|The {{district}} court’s conclusion, however, that Quanta overruled Mallinckrodt {{reflects the}} ambiguity in Quanta itself. The Static Control court noted that “sales of Lexmark Prebate cartridges were unconditional” because “no potential buyer {{was required to}} agree {{to abide by the}} Prebate terms before purchasing a cartridge.

40|$|Abstract [...] Murabahah {{contract}} is an <b>unconditional</b> contract of <b>sale</b> between the seller and buyer, where the goods, cost price, markup and payment date are clearly defined, agreed and documented. The important element {{is that the}} price in murabahah should be mutually agreed upon based on the cost and margin. This paper aims to discuss the above costs (direct and indirect) from shariah {{point of view and}} recommend the opinion which can be applied in modern murabahah transaction. This paper is a concept paper where the data from the views of shariah was gathered regarding to cost used in trading and comparison with the conventional financial cost has been made to show the direct and indirect cost in murabahah financing is accepted on unaccepted by the Shariah. The study found that the direct and indirect cost in murabahah financing is accepted by the Shariah, however it is only recommended for the cost which contributes to the product. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{rational}} expectations storage model {{is used to}} simulate monthly corn prices, which are used to evaluate marketing strategies to manage price risk. The data are generated and analyzed in two formats: for long-run outcomes over 10, 000 "years" of monthly prices and for 10, 000 cases of 40 -year "lifetimes". Three categories of strategies are analyzed: frequency of post-harvest cash <b>sales,</b> <b>unconditional</b> hedges, and conditional hedges. The comparisons {{are based on the}} simulated probability distributions of net returns. One conclusion is that diversifying cash sales, without hedging, is not an efficient means of risk management. Unhedged storage does not reduce risk and, on average, reduces returns. The analysis of the 40 -year lifetimes demonstrates, however, that rational decision-makers can face "lucky" and "unlucky" time periods. Thus, although the long-run analysis suggests that routine hedging reduces the variance (and the mean) of returns compared to the base case of selling in the spot market at harvest, the variance of returns (and their means) from both strategies will vary from lifetime to lifetime. Efficient strategies for producers with increasing utility functions vary from lifetime to lifetime, suggesting that efficient strategies likely vary from year-to-year. Nonetheless, strategies that take advantage of locking in returns to storage when relative prices are favorable are efficient in the second-degree sense and appear robust across different lifetimes. We also illustrate that conclusions are influenced by the measure of risk used. Perhaps the major conclusion is, however, that risk-management analysis is complex and potentially filled with pitfalls. Marketing,...|$|R
