25|$|The {{early history}} of Combermere is obscure as most of its records were {{destroyed}} before the 17th century. For the first hundred or so years after its foundation, the abbey {{appears to have been}} reasonably prosperous. In 1146–53, Abbot William successfully founded a daughter house at Poulton, which was endowed by Robert Pincerna (also Robert the Butler); it later moved to a site near Leek, Staffordshire, becoming Dieulacres Abbey. Both Combermere and Poulton are mentioned in about 1195 as Cistercian foundations in the area surrounding Chester. Several other daughter houses followed. Stanlow Abbey on the Wirral Peninsula was founded in 1178 by John FitzRichard, Baron of Halton, later moving to Whalley Abbey in Lancashire, and in 1219, a small daughter house was founded at Hulton in Staffordshire by Henry de Audley. In 1220, the abbot was reprimanded for <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building,</b> but an inspection by Abbot Stephen of Lexington in 1231 found no particular problems with the abbey. Combermere received a royal visit in 1245, and at that time the abbey was granted a market and fair at what is now known as Market Drayton in Shropshire.|$|E

5000|$|By mid 2009, {{the water}} crisis was {{so large and}} widespread, that WASA decided to {{transport}} tanks of water on trucks to major areas of the capital. Earlier the same month, he said that [...] "due to dependence on deep tube wells, water layers in the city are dropping around three metres a year on average" [...] about the excessive use of underground water of the capital through around a thousand illegal deep tube wells, and filling up of low-lying land, canals and water bodies are causing the underground water level to drop alarmingly. Various researchers say that this could put the citizens in severe water crisis {{in the future and}} also cause land to subside. As a result, the capital braced for one of their history's worst water logging problems, that Abedin believed was resulted from <b>unauthorised</b> <b>buildings</b> being built on land filled up from ponds and lakes. He also brought attention to more than a 100,000 illegal links in the national water supply network which costs the nation around Tk 350 million a year.|$|R
40|$|A {{particular}} and worrying {{form of urbanization}} are “informal settlements ” or <b>unauthorised</b> <b>buildings</b> (abusivismo edilizio), a phenomenon which is particularly accentuated in southern Italian cities, especially in Campania Region. Nevertheless their challenges – economic, social and environmental – have been widely recognized in international and national programs fostering urban sustainability. In Italy, as in other European countries, the actions set out by current regulations to address illegal settlements follow several approaches: repressive, mitigatory and comprehensive. This last approach provides the legalization of informal settlements or buildings {{on the basis of}} a pecuniary sanctions to obtain a “retrospective building permit”. The sanctions could represent a significant item of revenue and capital expenditure (or investment) in financing the public city. In this perspective, the article wants to extend the question with reference to some cities of the Campania Region, where there are numerous types of informal settlements. Considering the different assessment procedures used by municipalities in order to determine the value of illegal works and analyzing some municipal budgets, both the efficiency and effectiveness of this tool will be evaluated, as well as the capability of local authorities in the informal settlements management for the promotion of sustainable city...|$|R
50|$|During Communist Albania {{the city}} was renamed to Stalin City (Qyteti Stalin) and was a closed {{military}} district. The city was extensively developed in the 1950s and is of interest to students of communist architecture, although following {{the collapse of communism}} there has been much <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> and modification to the original buildings. It is home of one of airbases of the Albanian Air Force, although since 2005 the country's air force has ceased flying the aged MiG fighters provided by the Soviet Union and China and has been reduced to rotary wing aircraft only.|$|E
50|$|The 2012 protest on 1 July was {{the largest}} protest yet, with activists {{claiming}} 400,000 took part and police claiming 63,000 took part, both of {{which would have been}} the largest attendance at 1 July protests. These protests coincided with the 15th anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong attended by Hu Jintao and his swearing in of new chief executive CY Leung, who is alleged to be a closet member of the Communist Party of China, and has conflicts of interests over his business interests and has had <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> work at his home.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Lam led the Development Bureau in {{cracking}} down <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> works largely {{found in the}} indigenous villages in the New Territories. The change in law enforcement policy was opposed by leaders of rural communities and the Heung Yee Kuk, a statutory body representing rural interests. The Heung Yee Kuk staged protests against Lam and accused her of [...] "robbing villagers of their fundamental rights". Lam also tried to tackle the [...] "Small House Policy", which has been subject to abuse amidst a land crunch. The policy gives male indigenous villagers in the New Territories the right {{to build a house}} close to their ancestral homes but the policy has drawn criticism because in some cases, it has been abused for profit.|$|E
40|$|For a {{long time}} jurists point out the “desegregation” of the {{criminal}} law system {{and the loss of}} the effectiveness of penalties: rarely punishment follows a crime. In the mega-cities, in particular, there is a widespread sense of insecurity; not only for the big crimes but for the frequency of malfeasance. So “micro-criminality” and widespread malfeasance become part of illegal daily life (<b>unauthorised</b> <b>buildings,</b> illegal odd job, traffic, …). Citizens realises the existence of an “informal” settlement to worm one’s way into the borderline of social disease and the core of institutions. In Italy, under pressure of criminal emergency (terrorism, “mafia”, organized crime, corruption, …) the prevention and the fight against malfeasance are only a “practical” problem of police. There isn’t an adequate scientific formulation of the security-good. There isn’t a clear perception of turbulent climax in urban tissue. The European Parliament (December 1993) adopted a “proposal on common criminality in big urban centres and its contact with organised crimes”. The concentration of biggest social tensions in the mega-cities (informal city) makes necessary the creation of direct relationships between local and central authorities (formal cities). This collaboration permits the definition of an innovative town and country control, oriented to afford social marginality not only by violence...|$|R
40|$|Over the years, several {{security}} {{measures have been}} employed to combat the menace of insecurity of lives and property. This is done by preventing <b>unauthorised</b> entrance into <b>buildings</b> through entrance doors using conventional and electronic locks or discrete access code. Thus, the main idea in this project is to design a database security system that allows only authorised user to enter the premises. There are two entry point with each using different technologies; RFID & keypad. Once the user’s identification is verified, {{the door is unlocked}} by using EDL (electronic door lock) and all the information such as user ID, date and time are stored in central office.

5000|$|Since 13 February 2012, {{three major}} Hong Kong presses were {{reporting}} the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> works of Tang's two adjoined residences at York Road, Kowloon Tong. On 16 February 2012, an inspection by {{officials of the}} Buildings Department revealed a basement with an area of more than 2200 square feet (11 m by 19 m) that was not documented in the approved floor plan. Tang admitted {{at a press conference}} that he was aware of the construction of an illegal basement at his family house and said that it was his wife's idea. His wife agreed that the responsibility was hers [...] The admission follows several denials, and has provoked widespread criticism [...] "He has lost almost all his credibility, he lied every day," [...] said Ma Ngok, a political sciences professor at the University of Hong Kong to AFP.|$|E
50|$|The Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1903 (3 Edw. VII. c.33) {{amended the}} 1892 Act and {{included}} {{a number of}} provisions relating to building within a burgh. The burgh was to maintain a register of plans and petitions (in modern terms a register of planning permissions). Permitted developments were to be issued building warrants by the town council, and the burgh surveyor was empowered to enforce the warrants and rectify <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building.</b> New powers were given to town councils in relation to maintenance of footpaths and public rubbish bins, and the placing of advertisement hoardings and scaffolding. Minimum standards were set for the height and internal space of new buildings and on overcrowding, and for the width of streets. Powers {{were given to the}} burgh to make new streets and openings. Also included in the Act were various sundry powers and duties including: the compulsory lighting of vehicles, licensing for billiard halls and ice cream shops, prohibition on betting in the street, powers on controlling milk supply, and penalties for littering.|$|E
5000|$|After Henry Tang became {{embroiled in}} an <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> works scandal in February 2012, {{the field of}} {{potential}} pro-Beijing candidates once again opened up: New People's Party legislator Regina Ip re-announced her interest in running for the post on 20 February; at the same time, Legislative Council president Jasper Tsang of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong (DAB) also said he was [...] "seriously considering" [...] running for the post. In addition to Rita Fan, Financial Secretary John Tsang and Secretary for Development Carrie Lam, businessman Victor Fung and Joseph Yam were touted by pundits as possible candidates. Tsang's final decision not to stand, after ten days of deliberations, was influenced by concerns about the intrusion of party politics into the chief executive race, {{and the effect of}} his candidature (and potential success in getting elected) for the DAB in the forthcoming Legislative Council elections in September. Ip failed to receive enough nominations before the deadline and thus did not qualify to stand for the election.|$|E

5000|$|Up to 130,000 {{people have}} held rival marches on 1 January 2013 in Hong Kong both {{for and against}} the city's chief {{executive}} CY Leung. Those protesting against him say he should step down over allegations he lied about illegal renovations and extensions to his mansion. Leung secretly extended his $64 million home without getting government planning permission or paying real estate fees. He is accused of lying about it during last year's election campaign. In response, Leung immediately erected a false wall to block access to the unauthorised extension, before awaiting official investigation. Leung claimed he had solved the problem as the illegal extension [...] "did not exist anymore", but the action led to suspicion of destroying evidence. Leung has been widely accused of hypocrisy over the issue, as he won the election on 1 July last year by criticising his opponent, Henry Tang for the <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> of a huge basement for a villa held {{in the name of}} his wife. Other reasons include universal suffrage, greater democracy, the widening wealth gap and Beijing's meddling in Hong Kong affairs. Organisers of the march calling for Leung's impeachment estimated their numbers at 130,000, although police put the figure at a more modest 26,000 at its peak. Supporters of Leung who organised a follow up march argue that he is beginning to address deep-rooted social issues. They also suggest that democracy is a Western concept, which is not compatible with fast economic development or Chinese culture. Supporters rally organisers reported that over 60,000 turned out, although police again downsized the figure to about 8,000.|$|E
40|$|Unauthorized {{building}} is mostly {{concentrated in the}} southern regions of Italy and regards every social class. It often involves political interests at election times. Due to the distinctiveness of its distribution on the Italian territory, <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> raises complex issues of a sociological, anthropological, political and legal nature concerning public spirit, the relationship that the citizen has with institutions and with lawfulness, the means through which political consensus is aggregated, and {{the capacity of the}} state to ensure governance through laws. Agrigento is an emblematic case, {{not only because of the}} diffusion of the phenomenon over time and space, or for the relevance of the public heritage under threat, but also because it offers the opportunity to reveal the complex mesh of social, cultural and political factors that there is behind unauthorized building. All the indicators of public spirit are significantly associated with <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building.</b> A recent study has documented the distribution of social capital in the Italian provinces, confirming both the lack of homogeneity of the distribution of those resources which strengthen a collective and the permanent distinctiveness of the south of Italy, which suffers from a lack of these resources, as can be seen in the constructions present in the territory. <b>Unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> is substantially associated to that specific form of social capital which consists in loyalty towards institutions and a trust in them. However, this factor, which regards the cultural sphere, can not explain this social behaviour on its own. It is necessary to bring to light the obligations and opportunities offered to the social actor. Through our report we want to show the mesh of factors behind the phenomenon of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building,</b> with particular regard to the case of Agrigento, and how the distribution of social capital in the region is connected to the distribution of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building...</b>|$|E
40|$|The World Heritage List {{includes}} the Curonian Spit {{as a valuable}} cultural landscape – a unique harmony between the nature and human activities, a harmony that emerged through centuries. The Curonian Spit retains its cultural landscape, which is still evolving and keeps an active social part in the modern society through its traditions. it was ecological wisdom, enormous physical efforts and financial input of people that enabled, in the 19 th century, creation of a cultural landscape which later was managed and maintained with care. The problem of preservation and continuation of landscaping traditions, of their transfer to future generations, gained the momentum recently, after the notorious boom of unsanctioned building work in the National Park of the Curonian Spit and other territories marked as cultural landscape. {{in order to protect}} the public interest in the National Park of the Curonian Spit, Klaipėda County and the Prosecutor's office of Klaipėda brought over 30 civil lawsuits and claims on alleged infringements related to expanding constructions in the National Park of the Curonian Spit. The current situation in the area of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> is not satisfactory. <b>Unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> is quite frequent in Lithuania. Builders commence building work which violates laws for various reasons: the complex procedures related to issuing of building permits, assumptions leading to hopes that it will be possible to legalise their unauthorised buildings and/or constructions, as well as the national mentality—attempts to "drive through" laws instead of following them, etc. As illustrated by practical examples, the process of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> does not pose difficulties (control of this process is underdeveloped and includes numerous "compromises"). Generally, persons involved in <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> work encounter real problems only during the last stage, which is related to execution of their rights to the built object. The legislation which currently regulates procedures related to detection, stopping and relief of the effects of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> foresees demolition of any <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> and construction; but builders search for possibilities to legalise such buildings and constructions nevertheless.

40|$|Purpose - To {{explain the}} serious social problem of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> works (UBWs) in Hong Kong and why {{this problem is}} {{difficult}} to overcome. Design/methodology/approach - An institutional economics approach is adopted. This paper concentrates on the governance zone of the institutional arrangement. Findings - The current institutional arrangement in Hong Kong encourages owners to build UBWs, and makes the identification of UBWs very complicated. This paper concludes that the existing framework of governance fails {{to take into account}} the conflict of interests in collective goods. The no-retrospective-approval stipulation also renders a no-alternative solution. Research limitations/implications - It is a case study of Hong Kong, but it has research implications on institutional economics under the current arrangement of co-ownership. Practical implications - An important element in structural surveys is to ensure the structural safety of a building. An understanding on the governance of UBWs has serious implications for the structural survey approach. Originality/value - This paper is the first paper on exploring UBWs from an institutional economics framework. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical and {{empirical}} studies on how building performance is valued by the property market abound in the literature. Some of them investigate changes in property prices after building renovation, but {{little has been}} done on pricing the safety performance of buildings. This article presents a study that explores whether residential properties in safer buildings command higher market values in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is a good laboratory for this study because building failures can pose a serious threat in such a densely populated high-rise environment. The study measures the safety performance of a building by the weighted number of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> works (UBWs) on the external walls of the buildings. By their nature, UBWs are building works that are constructed without prior approval and consent from the government. A hedonic price model is developed to assess the market value of building safety. For the model estimation, apart from the property transaction data, the number of unauthorised appendages (i. e., UBWs attached to the building facades) in each building studied is obtained through a building survey. Based on the analysis results, several hypotheses built upon the theories of self-protection and self-insurance are tested...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - This {{paper was}} {{motivated}} {{by the absence of}} a government examination of and professional interest in planning conditions as a means of development control in Hong Kong. Proposes to examine this situation. Design/methodology/approach - The research objective is achieved by a field survey and legal analysis of its findings. The field survey of all the 60 residential development projects in Hong Kong under comprehensive development area zoning subject to conditional planning permissions from 1998 to 2000 involving 119 planning applications was conducted to assess factual compliance with planning conditions. Findings - The findings show that, while most physical planning obligations have been duly fulfilled in these projects, the non-depositing of master layout plans for development poses actual and potential public domain problems of planning enforcement, building permission, conveyancing and property management. The major problems of non-compliance are property purchasers being unable to fully appreciate the environment of a development when making a decision to buy; subsequent titles defects, <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> works and operations. Suggestions are made to close the loopholes in planning law and to introduce a formal channel for retrospective rectification {{in the light of the}} social consequences of non-compliance. Originality/value - This paper is the first serious attempt to evaluate the importance of compliance with planning conditions in Hong Kong and its analysis should be of interest not only to local policy makers and professional people in particular, but also to researchers in comparative development control in general. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Section 124 of the Localism Act 2011 (the “Localism Act”) is {{a direct}} {{response}} to two high profile cases, R (on the application of Fidler) v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2010] (“the Fidler case”) and Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government [2011] (‘the Beesley case”). Both cases involved the deliberate concealment of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>building</b> and both attempted to rely on section 171 B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the 1990 Act) claiming the Local Planning Authorities (“LPAs”) were time barred from taking action as {{more than four years}} had passed since the date of the breach. Section 124 gave LPAs the power to apply to the Magistrates Court to take planning enforcement action outside of the normal four and ten year time limits in situations where {{there may have been a}} breach of planning control involving concealment. LPAs may apply to the Magistrates Court for a planning enforcement order (“PEO”) within six months from the date of knowledge of evidence of the apparent breach providing they are able to satisfy the court, on the balance of probabilities, that the apparent breach has been deliberately concealed and that the making of an order is just to do so. Whilst the Government’s intentions may have been valid, was their response? Is section 124 really the answer in closing the loophole these cases exposed? Alternative solutions do exist, including better implementation of the 1990 Act, the use of other existing legislation and applying public policy arguments used in the Beesley case. All of which would safeguard the limitation period under the 1990 Act. This then raises the question did we really need section 124 in the first place...|$|E
