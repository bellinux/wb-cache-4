Voss later recounted Goebbels as saying: [...] "It {{is a great}} pity {{that such}} a man is not with us any longer. But {{there is nothing to}} be done. For <b>us,</b> <b>everything</b> is lost now and the only way out left for us is the one which Hitler chose. I shall follow his example." ...|$|E
500|$|Andre Dellamorte of Collider called Item 47 [...] "silly". William Bibbiani of Crave Online said, [...] "The short {{is largely}} a success: [...] Hernandez, [...] Bradford and [...] Caplan are all in fine form although, [...] Welliver seems saddled with a little awkward dialogue, {{particularly}} in regards to Coulson, which doesn’t entirely sell." [...] Spencer Terry of Superhero Hype! said, [...] " [...] is easily the best one they've done, and I think that {{can be attributed to}} its length seeing as it's three times longer than the other One-Shots. With a longer run time, the short film doesn't have to rush to show <b>us</b> <b>everything</b> that it wants to - we get a clear understanding of both the S.H.I.E.L.D. perspective of the events and the robbers' point of view." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Guide Matt Roush {{wrote that}} [...] "Audition" [...] was [...] "far from [...] {{favorite}} episode", disliking the [...] "cruelty and dirty tricks" [...] {{employed by the}} characters, though he commented that [...] "the moments that soar remind us why this is a genuine pop-culture phenom". James Poniewozik of Time called it a [...] "solid" [...] episode, one which was [...] "neither awful nor amazing", but set up promising storylines for the season ahead. He felt there were no stand out musical performances, but commented, [...] "it gave the season some emotional grounding [...] It showed us a Glee that's not working double-time to give <b>us</b> <b>everything</b> we want all at once, and that's pretty much what I want from it." [...] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail wrote that, with [...] "Audition", Glee had become formulaic, and asserted that [...] "Glee fanatics won't be disappointed. The rest of us are." ...|$|E

500|$|The intro, [...] "The Genesis", is {{composed}} as an aural montage {{that begins with}} the sound of an elevated train and an almost-inaudible voice rhyming beneath it. Over these sounds, a snatch of dialogue, two men arguing. It samples Grand Wizard Theodore's [...] "Subway Theme" [...] from the 1983 film Wild Style, the first major hip hop motion picture. Nas made another ode to Wild Style, while shooting the music video for his single, [...] "It Ain't Hard to Tell", on the same stage as the finale scene for the film. His verse on [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] is played in the background of [...] "The Genesis". According to music writer Mickey Hess, in the intro, [...] "Nas tells <b>us</b> <b>everything</b> he wants us to know about him. The train is shorthand for New York; the barely discernible rap is, in fact, his [...] "Live at the Barbeque" [...] verse; and the dialogue comes from Wild Style, one of the earliest movies to focus on hip hop culture. Each of these is a point of genesis. New York for Nas as a person, 'Live at the Barbeque' for Nas the rapper, and Wild Style, symbolically at least, for hip hop itself. These are my roots, Nas was saying, and he proceeded to demonstrate exactly what those roots had yielded." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received by fans and critics alike. Variety magazine criticized the episode for [...] "using reworked concepts", but praised {{the production and}} noted its potential. Of the acting, Variety stated, [...] "Duchovny's delineation of a serious scientist {{with a sense of}} humor should win him partisans, and Anderson's wavering doubter connects well. They're a solid team...". Variety also praised the writing and direction: [...] "Mandel's cool direction of Carter's ingenious script and the artful presentation itself give TV sci-fi a boost." [...] The magazine concluded, [...] "Carter's dialogue is fresh without being self-conscious, and the characters are involving. Series kicks off with drive and imagination, both innovative in recent TV." [...] Entertainment Weekly noted that Scully [...] "was set up as a scoffing skeptic" [...] in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season. After the airing of just four episodes, the magazine called The X-Files [...] "the most paranoid, subversive show on TV", noting the [...] "marvelous tension between Andersonwho is dubious about these eventsand Duchovny, who has the haunted, imploring look of a true believer". Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, praised the episode, rating it an A. He felt that the episode's premise worked well to [...] "set a template" [...] for future episodes, and noted that the chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson was [...] "already there" [...] from the outset. Matt Haigh, writing for Den of Geek, reviewed the episode positively, praising the chemistry between the lead roles and the quality of the script. In 2012, SFX named it the tenth best TV pilot in the science fiction and fantasy genre, saying that it [...] "brought <b>us</b> <b>everything</b> we came to expect from the show". The plot for [...] "Pilot" [...] was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1995 by Les Martin, under the title X Marks the Spot.|$|E

Godard quotes lengthy passages from Jacques Ellul's 1945 essay [...] "Victoire d'Hitler?" [...] In this essay Ellul wrote [...] "everything Hitler said, he accomplished" [...] and examined {{the dangers of the}} individual giving absolute power to the State. Ellul concluded that [...] "everything that the State conquers as a power, it never loses. And that's Hitler's second victory." [...] Eric Kohn of Indiewire wrote that showing Ellul's essay being read off of a smart phone [...] "portrays the information age as the dying breath of consciousness before intellectual thought becomes homogenized by digital advancements" [...] and that the film [...] "suggests humankind has grown limited by devices that tell <b>us</b> <b>everything</b> we think we need to know." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{graduating from}} NYU in 1968 Chase moved to California and married {{his high school}} {{sweetheart}} Denise Kelly. He is the father of actress Michele DeCesare who appeared in six Sopranos episodes as Hunter Scangarelo. While working in the industry, Chase stated he [...] "loathed and despised" [...] television shows, watching only The Sopranos and movies, such as Mildred Pierce, an example of films which he stated [...] "in two hours, two hours and a half, told <b>us</b> <b>everything</b> we needed to know about every character in it". However, in recent interviews, he has taken back this comment, saying he watches former Sopranos writers and producers Terence Winter and Matthew Weiner's respective series Boardwalk Empire and Mad Men. He said that he made those comments in part because he had been working within the confines of 1990s network television.|$|E
2500|$|However, his {{deepening}} direct political {{involvement with}} the Zionist cause and an incident where he spoke publicly in favour {{of the formation of}} a Jewish state during his leave in Britain, caused his superiors in Palestine to remove him from command. He was so deeply associated with political causes in Palestine that his superiors considered him compromised as an intelligence officer in the country. He was promoting his own agenda rather than that of the army or the government. [...] In May 1939 he was transferred to Britain.

[...] While some of his lyrics are reminiscent of political slogans, such as [...] "Rights for Gays", he comments that his intention was to follow some social idioms [...] "through to [...] absurd conclusions where interesting things are more likely to happen. That's when the politics of aesthetics it's not in the protest lyrics." [...] On the song [...] "Cop Killer", he explains, [...] "I'm not talking about shooting or killing a human being, I'm talking about ... the cops in our heads, the cops that are everything other than <b>us,</b> <b>everything</b> inhuman, that would put us to work towards an end other than each other." ...|$|E

Eventually, the album was re-issued with [...] "Cop Killer" [...] removed. Alongside the album's reissue, Warner Bros. issued [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as a free single. Ice-T left the label in 1993, following additional disputes over his solo album Home Invasion. [...] The performer stated of the controversy that [...] "When I started out, [...] never censored <b>us.</b> <b>Everything</b> we did, we had full control over. But what happened was when the cops moved on Body Count they issued pressure on the corporate division of Warner Bros., and that made the music division, they couldn't out-fight 'em in the battle, so even when you're in a business with somebody who might not wanna censor you, economically people can put restraints on 'em and cause 'em to be afraid. I learned that lesson in there, that you're never really safe as long as you're connected to any big corporation's money." [...] Warner Bros. Records chairman Mo Ostin said in a 1994 interview with the Los Angeles Times, [...] "(Time Warner) got so thin-skinned after the incident at the shareholders' meeting. In the end, Ice-T decided to leave because he could not allow tampering with his work. And I can't blame him--considering the climate."
