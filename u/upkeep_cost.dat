50|$|The {{origins of}} Formula Ford {{began in the}} early 1960s, where motor racing schools such as the Jim Russell school and Motor Racing Stables {{featured}} single seat Formula Junior and Formula Three-like machines from world class constructors like Cooper and Lotus. Many aspiring Formula One stars looked to these schools in the hope of learning the craft and also looking the part. However, although there was no shortage of aspiring drivers, these schools had much trouble avoiding bankruptcy. The 1-litre Formula Three engines, the 1.1-litre Coventry Climax FJ and later the Ford Anglia 105E, cost around £3,000 at the time in addition to the Dunlop racing tires which cost £80 a set. Furthermore, these engines were incredibly fragile and had a tendency to self-destruct. All these factors contributed to a steep maintenance and <b>upkeep</b> <b>cost</b> of the schools.|$|E

50|$|The {{campaign}} map {{extends from}} Bactria (Afghanistan) to Lusitania (Portugal) and from Caledonia (Scotland) to Garamantia (in the Sahara), and {{is divided into}} 173 regions. The 57 provinces are groupings of up to four regions, and each region can be conquered separately. However, control of an entire province allows a player to pass edicts at a provincial level, which provide bonuses such as increased public happiness or military production. Construction options for regions within a province are displayed on a single menu, while public happiness is also province based. This means that if public happiness drops too low, the most unhappy region will rebel instead of the entire province. Individual villages and resource buildings are absent from the campaign map, and are confined to the regional capital. Each regional capital generates an automatic garrison, the size defined by its population, which can be increased by constructing various buildings. Armies now have a raid stance, which automatically generates loot and reduces their <b>upkeep</b> <b>cost.</b> A player can raid in both friendly and hostile territory, although raiding one's own regions is detrimental to public happiness.|$|E
5000|$|... "Order" [...] (yellow) and [...] "Chaos" [...] (blue) {{alternate}} turns. On a turn, {{a player}} must either move a piece or use an Adept {{to cast a}} spell. Summoned pieces can move any distance in their element, or move one square out of their element. Adepts teleport anywhere. Pieces may not enter occupied squares except {{as an attempt to}} capture an opponent's piece. Capture attempts are resolved immediately and the defeated piece is removed from the board. The turn then ends. The game's sole resource is magical energy, used for spellcasting, paying a per-turn <b>upkeep</b> <b>cost</b> for each summoned piece, and the Adepts' teleportation. It's gained by having friendly pieces occupying squares with power points. Four power points are on the outer edges of one element at a time, moving inwards after every pair of turns. Two power points with lower income rates are on the Void squares. The starting side can be chosen or randomized. The side that goes second receives more magical energy. Spellcasting costs magic points in varying amounts, depending on the spell (e.g., summoning a demon requires more magic than summoning an elemental).|$|E
50|$|Each faction {{begins with}} a few (or a single) settlement(s), and must conquer others in order to {{continue}} growing. Unlike previous Total War titles, {{there are two kinds of}} settlements, each with different advantages and disadvantages: cities and castles. Castles have better defensive capabilities and have access to a larger selection of soldiers including cavalry, infantry, and missile troops most of which can only be obtained through castles, and for the most part are superior to city troops in terms of abilities, morale, and combat statistics. However, castles generate less income, cannot train as many agents as cities, and have no access to higher civilian technologies such as taverns, markets, and buildings related to law and health such as town halls, and the eastern Bimaristan. Cities generate much larger income and are technological centres of a faction, but are more difficult to defend and only have access to militia troops, which are generally inferior to those trained at castles except for a select few unique units. A small quantity of militia troops, stationed in the city where they have been trained, can have the benefit of no <b>upkeep</b> <b>cost,</b> that cost being a great burden on the economy of a faction throughout the game. Players may convert a settlement to a different type, although larger cities may not be converted into castles. The early castle upgrades don't have a need of population to be upgraded, all that is needed are florins (in-game currency).|$|E

Numerous studies have been conducted to introduce the best MPPT techniques suitable for different types of PV systems. However, they are mostly able to track the MPP from the PV system when the output signals (Voltage and Current) of individual array are available. In this study, a meta-heuristic method, based on particle swarm optimization theory, is used to determine the actual MPP of PV system, including several PV arrays, by only single current sensor at the output terminal. The results of the proposed PSO based technique, for tracking the global MPP in a multidimensional search space, have been presented {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|E

30|$|There {{is a need}} {{to explore}} more {{sustainable}} approaches to water management on the Canadian Prairies. Retention pond installation schemes designed to capture surface water may be a viable option that would reduce water stress during drought periods by providing water for irrigation. The retention systems would serve to capture excess spring runoff and extreme rainfall events, reducing flood potential downstream. Additionally, retention ponds may be used for biomass production and nutrient retention. The purpose of this research was to investigate the economic viability of adopting local farm surface water retention systems as a strategic water management strategy. A retention pond was analyzed using a dynamic simulation model to predict its storage capacity, installation and <b>upkeep</b> <b>cost,</b> and economic advantage to farmers when used for irrigation. While irrigation application increased crop revenue, the cost of irrigation and reservoir infrastructure and installation costs were too high for the farmer to experience a positive net revenue. Farmers who harvest cattails from retention systems for biomass and available carbon offset credits can gain $ 642.70 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. Cattail harvest also removes phosphorus and nitrogen, providing a monetized impact of $ 7014 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. The removal of phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and avoided flooding damages of the retention basin itself provide an additional $ 17, 730 –$ 18, 470 /hectare of retention system/year. The recommended use of retention systems is for avoided flood damages, nutrient retention, and biomass production. The revenue gained from these functions can support farmers wanting to invest in irrigation while providing economic and environmental benefits to the region.|$|E
40|$|Regions {{dependent}} on agricultural production {{are concerned about}} the uncertainty associated with climate change. Extreme drought and flooding events are predicted to occur with greater frequency, requiring mitigation strategies to reduce the associated negative impacts. Retention pond installation schemes designed to capture surface water may be a viable option to reduce water stress during drought periods by supporting irrigation. The retention systems would serve to capture excess spring runoff and extreme rainfall events, reducing flood potential downstream. Additionally, retention ponds may be used for biomass production and nutrient retention. The purpose of this research was to investigate the economic viability of adopting on-farm surface water retention systems as a strategic water management strategy. A retention pond was analysed using a dynamic simulation model to predict its storage capacity, installation and <b>upkeep</b> <b>cost,</b> and economic advantages. The average impact of irrigation application under present day conditions was an increase in crop revenue of $ 11. 38 /hectare. However, due to the cost of irrigation and reservoir installation this on average leaves the farmer to pay $ 148. 50 /hectare each year. Replacing existing low value crops within the study area with high value potato crops also resulted in a negative net revenue. Irrigated crops under future climate scenarios also experienced a net decrease in revenue due to the associated irrigation and reservoir infrastructure costs. However, gross crop revenue increases were more consistent throughout the future study time periods and required less irrigation water, making irrigation application more beneficial in the future. Farmers who harvest cattails from retention systems for biomass and available carbon offset credits can gain $ 642. 70 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. Cattail harvest also removes phosphorus and nitrogen, providing a monetized impact of $ 7, 014 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. The removal of phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and avoided flooding damages of the retention basin itself provide an additional $ 17, 850 to $ 18, 470 /hectare of retention system/year depending on the valuations of avoided flooding damages. The recommended use of retention systems is for avoiding flood damages, nutrient retention, and biomass production. This is due to the economic gains these three functions of retention systems provide. The revenue gained from these functions can support farmers wanting to invest in irrigation while providing economic and environmental benefits to the region...|$|E

40|$|The {{disposal}} of large Off-the-Road (OTR) tires is {{an increasingly important}} concern. These tires can weigh up to 8, 450 pounds with an overall diameter and width of approximately 140. 7 inches and 45. 1 inches respectively. OTR tires are used for mining vehicles such as haul trucks, wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, and trenchers. [1] These new tires cost between $ 38, 000 and $ 50, 000 each, depending on multiple factors including oil prices and the cyclical nature of the industry. Haul trucks contain six tires per vehicle, and mines replace these tires around every 9 - 12 months. [2] Statistics regarding discarded OTR tires are not provided by the industry as they are for other types of tires. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} approximate the number and location of waste OTR tires not only in individual states, but in the U. S. in general. [3] Currently, Minnesota and Arizona are the only states that place regulations and fees on OTR tires. However, Minnesota is the only state that actually tracks them. [3] The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) roughly estimates that OTR tires account for 1 % of scrap tires by number and 15 % by weight. When the tires are replaced, the old tires can be discarded with the waste rock in stockpiles at the mining site but more often are landfilled without documentation by an appropriate agency due to lack of federal regulations. Their low density and hollow centers cause them to float to the top of landfills, disrupting the compactness. [4] Also, tires have a heat content 20 - 40 % greater than that of coal which can be very dangerous on the rare occasions that tires catch fire in stockpiles. [5] Furthermore, burning tires release hazardous substances including pyrolytic oil, ash, and smoke, which contain carcinogens, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds. [6] Due to the large size of OTR tires, there are few facilities that can accommodate their recycling. [3] This leads to increased costs in transporting them to such sites. Transportation costs for a tire taken out of service can be up to $ 1000. In addition to the freight costs, recycling an OTR tire can cost up to $ 1500 because of their rugged construction compared to passenger tires which cost around $ 1 to recycle. [3] In response to the waste OTR tire problem, the Ball Hogs from the University of Arkansas have designed a solution that recycles OTR tires by using old tires as liners in ball mills for hard rock mines. Ball mills are large cylindrical vessels consisting of an outer shell, an inside liner and a load of metal balls. A motor turns the ball mill using a transmission system causing the metal balls to move in a cascading motion to grind the material fed into the ball mill. Ball mills require liners that are constructed from materials such as steel or rubber. For a 30 ft long ball mill with a Task # 2 5 University of Arkansas 20 ft diameter, a hard rubber liner reinforced with steel can cost $ 150, 000. These liners are replaced at least once a year, creating a substantial <b>upkeep</b> <b>cost</b> for these ball mills. Metal mines in Bolivia are already using tractor tires to line many ball mills. This technique has been effective for over twenty years. The high import costs of new liners and the low cost of labor has led many Bolivian metal processors to use truck and tractor tires as liners in their ball mills. This construction normally occurs on site using tools like handsaws, drills, torches and knives to cut up tires and manpower to mount these tire-made liners onto mills. However, this is not always the case in the U. S. where labor costs are much higher and the mills are generally larger. Many mines in the U. S. do not have the means to fabricate and install these liners on site; therefore, a third-party solution is proposed that will take a mine’s discarded tires and make ball mill liners out of them. The Ball Hogs’ solution provides an environmentally and economically feasible process of increasing the life of OTR tires beyond their typical use. This alternative would utilize the engineering and technology that makes these tires strong enough to hold a 400 ton truck. Mining companies would save yearly an average of $ 70, 000 per ball mill liner replacement, and over 780, 000 kg of CO 2 per liner. Furthermore, mining companies would earn positive PR, goodwill, and tax breaks. We recommend all mining companies use their OTR tire treads as ball mill liners...|$|E
