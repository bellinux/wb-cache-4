40|$|TGF-ß (transforming growth factor-ß) signals through serine/threonine kinase receptors and {{intracellular}} Smad transcription factors. An important regulatory step involves specific ubiquitination by Smurfs (Smad–ubiquitin regulatory factors), {{members of}} the HECT (homologous to E 6 -associated protein C-terminus) ubiquitin ligase family, which mediate the proteasomal degradation of Smads and/or receptors. Recently, we have defined a novel interaction between Smads and UCH 37 (ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 37), a DUB (de-ubiquitinating enzyme) that could potentially counteract Smurf-mediated ubiquitination. We have demonstrated specific interactions between UCH 37 and inhibitory Smad 7, as well as weaker associations with Smad 2 and Smad 3. Importantly, Smad 7 can act as an adaptor able to recruit UCH 37 to the type I TGF-ß receptor. Consequently, UCH 37 dramatically up-regulates TGF-ß-dependent gene expression by de-ubiquitinating and stabilizing the type I TGF-ß receptor. Our findings suggest that competing effects of ubiquitin ligases and DUBs in complex with Smad 7 can serve to fine-tune responses to TGF-ßs under various physiological and pathological conditions.

Each strategy has specific advantages and disadvantages.

However, making SNO-HSA preparations is a complicated and time-consuming process. We found that binding of caprylic acid (CA) and N-acetyl-L-tryptophan (N-AcTrp) to defatted mercaptalbumin increased S-nitrosation by S-nitrosoglutathione (GS-NO) by making Cys- 34 of HSA more accessible and by protecting it against oxidation, respectively. Fortunately, HSA solutions for clinical use contain high concentrations of CA and N-AcTrp as stabilizers. By making use of that fact {{it was possible to}} work-out a fast and simple procedure for producing SNO-HSA: Incubation of a commercial HSA formulation with GS-NO for only one minute results in S-nitrosation of HSA.

High precision data on atmospheric neutrinos show that the dominant mixings occur between active species.

The solution of the solar neutrino puzzle in terms of v, oscillations has been recently much enhanced by exciting new results from the SNO Collaboration.
