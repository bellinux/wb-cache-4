2500|$|I {{have also}} to {{acknowledge}} receipt of a letter from Mr. H.E. Holmes of Durban, enclosing the text of a pronouncement made by the South African Board of Control to the effect that, {{in the opinion of}} that body, the contest between the MCC team and The Reef at Vogelfontein on 22 and 23 December 1909, was not a first-class match. In the course of this encounter Hobbs scored 70 runs which are counted in his first-class aggregate. Seeing that the game was regarded, {{at the time it was}} played, as first-class and until a little while ago had been left in <b>undisputed</b> <b>possession</b> of that rank, the need for raising any question about the matter after more than twenty years is not at all obvious. In any circumstances, I should not advise the dragging up of what, with all due respect to the recent ruling of the South African Board, must remain a debatable matter. The Reef team included some Test match players and others who had appeared in Inter-State games so it certainly had considerable claims to be regarded as first-class and from that standing, I cannot, all things considered, agree after such a long lapse of time to reduce it. Outside the merits of the case, is there not something rather grotesque in the idea of a controlling body sitting in solemn conclave over so small a matter and deciding to upset what had been accepted for twenty years? ...|$|E

40|$|U radu se raspravlja o reljefu Herkula uklesanom u litici pred ulazom u kamenolomu Rasohe. Figure uklesane u stijeni su kultni reljefi božanstva koje se časti u prirodnom okruženju. Herkulov reljef je kultna slika na ulazu u kamenolom pred kojim su se prinosile žrtve na kamenom žrtveniku. Također se raspravlja o natpisu sa žrtvenika posvećenom Herkulu iz kamenoloma Stražišće i donosi ispravak pogrešnog čitanja natpisa. Donose se i drugi nalazi iz kamenoloma Dalmcije koji svjedoče o kultu Herkula kao zaštitnika kamenara. Recently, a path {{has been}} cleared, and a tourist-archaeological route {{has been marked}} on the boardwalk in Splitska, leading to the Rasoha quarry and the relief of Hercules. Hercules is {{depicted}} naked, with only the Nemean lion-skin draped over his left shoulder. The lion’s head {{had to be made}} {{at the bottom of the}} skin. Both his fists are rather large compared to his other body parts. That particular detail is accentuated on purpose in order to show Hercules’ strength, which is a well known phenomenon of Roman sculpture. The relief most likely dates back to the first half of the third century. The figures carved in the stone are cult reliefs of the deity feasting in his natural environment. The sanctuary in nature did not only exist in Rasohe, but also in the Stražišće quarry which is very close. An altar dedicated to Hercules has been discovered there, with the following inscription: H(erculi) A(ugusto) S(acrum) /Alnius Obul/tronius/Deter. The meaning behind the letters deter should be clarified deter(minavit). We should assume that Alnius Obultronius delimited the sacred area with special ritual magic spells, which the verb determinare actually means. That means that the Stražišće quarry had one more cult space dedicated to Hercules. Still, the question remains, who was Alnius Obultronius, what was his function and where did he come from. One more altar dedicated to Hercules was also discovered at the Plate quarry, also near Škrip. This inscription is important not only for the cult of Hercules, but also because the soldier Valerius Valerianus is mentioned in the inscription. He was the supervisor of the workshop of the capitals for the thermae of emperor Licinius in Sirmium. This altar does not prove that Valerius Valerianus made the sanctuary, but that the inscription was his vow in the sanctuary itself, most probably for his job, for such an important imperial order that had been entrusted to him, but had there not been a sanctuary, there would be no inscription. Most likely, there was no figure of Hercules carved in stone at the quarries of Stražišće and Plate, because despite insufficient research, it would have surfaced so far. However, most likely, there was a statue or a relief there, made according to ritual rules for setting sanctuaries. In both Hercules’ inscriptions the epithet Augustus is present, and it is related to the emperor and <b>undisputed</b> imperial <b>possession</b> of the quarry. Two reliefs with Hercules’ figures testify that Hercules’ cult was also very widespread in Škrip which was the center of the imperial management of the quarries. The first monument with a high lower part is designed in such a way so that the lower part of the monument could be dug into the ground, or reinforced within the sanctuary. The other relief depicts Hercules in another, but also very well known pose. Hercules is depicted en face and is completely naked. With his left hand he leans on his club, while in the right hand, he is holding a lion-skin and a plate. His hair and beard are long and curly. The findings from other important quarries in Dalmatia also testify about the cult of Hercules, which is further evidence that Hercules was, in the true sense of the word, the protector of stonecutters. However, there is no cult of Hercules Saxanus (Hercules Saxanus) in Dalmatia. Namely, Hercules Saxanus (one made of stone) indicates the heroes’ strength which is strong as a rock, while on the other side, that is also a qualification of Hercules as the protector of stonecutters. We find the same cult in Gaul and some Danube regions. In Dalmatia, Hercules is only called Augustus, which is, as we have already said, an attribute taken from the imperial cult. An abundance of statues and commemoration to Hercules is all there is on the island of Brač. There is no doubt that in the future, more such testimonies will be found, covered by thousand years of layered earth and post antique rubble...|$|R

This ill-timed intruder was Miss Tilney's maid, sent by her mistress to be of use to Miss Morland; and though Catherine immediately dismissed her, it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing, and forced her, in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery, to proceed in her dressing without further delay. Her progress was not quick, for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm; and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt, she could not remain many paces from the chest.

I had brought with me a cane chair, and a few light boards, which were soon rigged up into a table and shelves. A broad bamboo bench served as sofa and bedstead, my boxes were conveniently arranged, my mats spread on the floor, a window cut in the palm-leaf wall to light my table, and though the place was as miserable and gloomy a shed as could be imagined, I felt as contented as if I had obtained a well-furnished mansion, and looked forward to a month's residence in it with unmixed satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|But all {{writers of}} fiction who have desired to think well {{of their own}} work, will {{probably}} have had doubts on their minds before they have arrived at this conclusion. Thinking much of my own daily labour and of its nature, I felt myself at first to be much afflicted and then to be deeply grieved by the opinion expressed by wise and thinking men as to the work done by novelists. But when, by degrees, I dared to examine and sift the sayings of such men, I {{found them to be}} sometimes silly and often arrogant. I began to inquire what had been the nature of English novels since they first became common in our own language, and to be desirous of ascertaining whether they had done harm or good. I could well remember that, in my own young days, they had not taken that <b>undisputed</b> <b>possession</b> of drawing-rooms which they now hold. Fifty years ago, when George IV. was king, they were not indeed treated as Lydia had been forced to treat them in the preceding reign, when, on the approach of elders, Peregrine Pickle was hidden beneath the bolster, and Lord Ainsworth put away under the sofa. But the families in which an unrestricted permission was given for the reading of novels were very few, and from many they were altogether banished. The high poetic genius and correct morality of Walter Scott had not altogether succeeded in making men and women understand that lessons which were good in poetry could not be bad in prose. I remember that in those days an embargo was laid upon novel-reading as a pursuit, which was to the novelist a much heavier tax than that want of full appreciation of which I now complain.|$|E
60|$|Another {{subject is}} handled in Rameau's Nephew, which is {{interesting}} {{in connection with}} the mental activity of Paris in the eighteenth century. Music was the field of as much passionate controversy as theology and philosophy. The Bull Unigenitus itself did not lead to livelier disputes, or more violent cabals, than the conflict between the partisans of French music and the partisans of Italian music. The horror of a Jansenist for a Molinist did not surpass that of a Lullist for a Dunist, or afterwards of a Gluckist for a Piccinist.[298] Lulli and Rameau (the uncle of our parasite) had <b>undisputed</b> <b>possession</b> of Paris until the arrival, in 1752, of a company of Italian singers. The great quarrel at once broke out as to the true method and destination of musical composition. Is music an independent art, appealing directly to a special sense, or is it to be made an instrument for expressing affections of the mind in a certain deeper way? The Italians asked only for delicious harmonies and exquisite melodies. The French insisted that these should be subordinate to the work of the poet. The former were content with delight, the latter pressed for significance. The one declared that Italian music was no better than a silly tickling of the ears; the other that the overture to a French opera was like a prelude to a Miserere in plain-song. In 1772-73 the illustrious Gluck came to Paris. His art was believed to reconcile the two schools, to have more melody than the old French style, and more severity and meaning than the purely Italian style. French dignity was saved. But soon the old battle, which {{had been going on for}} twenty years, began to rage with greater violence than ever. Piccini was brought to Paris by the Neapolitan ambassador. The old cries were heard in a shriller key than before. Pamphlets, broadsheets, sarcasms flew over Paris from every side.|$|E
