The cap cuticle {{is made of}} {{partially}} gelatinized, filamentous interwoven hyphae, 2–6μm in diameter. The tissue of the gill is bilateral, meaning it diverges {{from the center of}} the gill to its outer edge. The subhymenium is ramose—composed of relatively thin branching, <b>unclamped</b> hyphae. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, thin-walled, without clamps, with dimensions of 34–45 by 4–11μm. They are typically two-spored, although rarely three- or four-spored forms have been found. Although the two-spored basidia are a defining characteristic of the species, there is evidence of a tendency to shift towards producing four-spored basidia as the fruiting season progresses. The volva is composed almost exclusively of densely interwoven filamentous hyphae, 2–10μm in diameter, that are sparsely to moderately branched. There are few small inflated cells, which are mostly spherical to broadly elliptic. The tissue of the stipe is made of abundant, sparsely branched, filamentous hyphae, without clamps, measuring 2–5μm in diameter. The inflated cells are club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, and up to 2–3 by 15.7μm. The annulus is made of abundant moderately branched filamentous hyphae, measuring 2–6μm in diameter.

An ejection fraction volu-metric pulmonary artery catheter was inserted through the right internal jugu-lar vein to assess cardiac output and RVF {{with the use of}} an REF- 1 computer. Anesthesia was maintained with a continuous infusion of sufentanil (0. 5 - 1 &mu;g/kg/hr), isoflurane (0. 5 - 1 %), and air/O 2 (FIO 2 = 0. 5). Fluid loading with Ring-er’s lactate and 5 % albumin was initiated ten to twenty minutes before aortic <b>unclamping.</b> Hemodynamic measurements and assessment of RVF were per-formed ten to twenty minutes before and after aortic <b>unclamping.</b> Aortic un-clamping after fluid loading decreased right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (RVEDV, RVESV) but increased right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (p < 0. 01). There were no significant changes in cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and cardic filling pressures: central venous pressure (CVP), and pulmonary capillary wedge pres-sure (PCWP). There was a poor correlation between RVEDV and PCWP.

30|$|An {{earthquake}} {{fault rupture}} permanently deforms the surrounding crust, changing {{the stress on}} nearby faults {{as a function of}} their location, geometry and sense of slip (rake). The Coulomb stress change is defined as ΔCFF = Δτ + μΔσ, where τ is the shear stress on the fault (positive in the inferred direction of slip), σ is the normal stress (positive for fault <b>unclamping),</b> and μ is the apparent friction coefficient.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The causative role of consumptive {{coagulopathy}} in {{the development}} of bleeding complications after supraceliac (SC) aortic cross-clamping (AXC) has been challenged by recent reports that ascribe this coagulopathy to primary fibrinolysis. This theory is {{made on the basis of}} evidence that tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen (Ag) levels increase after SC AXC. However, t-PA Ag levels reflect both active and inactive (bound to serum t-PA inhibitors) forms of serum t-PA, and elevations confirm the presence of fibrinolysis only in conjunction with an increase in t-PA activity. Methods: To investigate the etiology of this coagulopathy, we submitted eight pigs to SC AXC and six pigs to infrarenal (IR) AXC for 30 minutes. Blood was drawn from the portal vein, the hepatic vein, and the carotid artery before AXC, just before <b>unclamping,</b> and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen (FBG), platelets (PLT), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), t-PA Ag, t-PA activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), and α 2 -antiplasmin (AP) activities were measured. Statistical analysis was performed by using repeated measures analysis of variance and t tests Results: The PT did not differ between the two groups at any point. After <b>unclamping,</b> in the SC group there was a drop in PLT levels (P =. 005), a decrease in FBG levels (P <. 001), and a trend toward PTT prolongation (P =. 06) compared with baseline. In contrast, there were no changes in PTT, PLT levels, or FBG levels in the IR group. TAT, a serum marker of thrombin generation, increased with SC AXC (P =. 04), remained elevated 5 minutes after <b>unclamping</b> (P =. 08), and returned to normal 30 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> In contrast, TAT levels did not change in the IR control group. In the SC AXC group, the TAT levels did not differ between the three test sites at any time. SC AXC was associated with an increase in t-PA Ag just before <b>unclamping</b> (P <. 001) and 5 minutes after <b>unclamping</b> (P =. 002), but IR AXC was not. t-PA activity levels decreased in both experimental groups 30 and 60 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> Levels of α 2 -AP activity decreased to a similar degree in both groups after <b>unclamping</b> when compared with baseline Conclusion: Thirty minutes of SC AXC results in intravascular thrombosis that cannot be localized to the ischemic visceral circulation. This intravascular thrombosis is associated with consumption of clotting factors. Thirty minutes of SC AXC causes an activation of fibrinolytic pathways that does not result in a hyperfibrinolytic state. An increase in t-PA Ag without a rise in t-PA activity does not represent true fibrinolysis, but rather an increase in the bound, inactive forms of serum t-PA. Both IR and SC AXC result in decreased fibrinolytic activity (“fibrinolytic shutdown”) after release of the aortic clamp.  (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 100 - 8. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the {{cerebral blood flow}} parameters assessed by transcranial Doppler during aortic cross-clamping and <b>unclamping</b> in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. METHODS: Invasive intraoperative monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PaCO 2, and right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) monitoring of blood flow parameters (mean velocity "Vm" and pulsatility index "PI") by transcranial Doppler were performed as well as evaluation of the four parameters during these subsequent periods: pre-cross-clamping, pre-unclamping, <b>unclamping</b> and 1 - 5 - 10 - 20 minutes after abdominal aortic <b>unclamping.</b> RESULTS: No significative changes of MAP, PaCO 2, Vm and PI were noticed during the aortic cross-clamping period (77. 5 +/- 18. 5 SD minutes). During aortic <b>unclamping</b> Vm and MAP decreased (64 +/- 20 vs 52 +/- 20 cm/sec, p < 0. 05, and 101 +/- 8 vs 80 +/- 15 mmHg, p < 0. 01, respectively). At the 1 th post-unclamping minute {{there was an increase}} from pre-unclamping values of Vm (75 +/- 20 cm/sec, p < 0. 05) and PaCO 2 (42 +/- 1. 5 vs 36 +/- 2 mmHg, p < 0. 05), with persistent reduction of MAP (92 +/- mmHg, p < 0. 05), even more evident at the 5 th post-unclamping minute (Vm = 93 +/- 25 cm/sec; PaCO 2 = 46 +/- 1. 2 mmHg, p < 0. 001, and MAP returned to pre-unclamping value), in which there was also a decrease of PI (0. 65 +/- 0. 16 vs 0. 78 +/- 0. 2, p < 0. 05). At the 10 th minute Vm (83 +/- 24 cm/sec, p < 0. 02) and PaCO 2 (41 +/- 1. 5 mmHg, p < 0. 05) increments were present together with persistent reduction of PI (0. 69 +/- 0. 17, p < 0. 05), while at the 20 th post-unclamping minute also Vm, PaCO 2 and PI returned to their pre-unclamping values. CONCLUSIONS: The Vm decrease at aortic <b>unclamping</b> might correlate with the acute changes in MAP (blood steal hypovolemia) and is likely due to an inadequate cerebral autoregulatory response to abrupt MAP changes. The arterial CO 2 increase after aortic <b>unclamping</b> could lead to a dilation of cerebral arterioles and a rise of CBF (increase of Vm and decrease of PI).

40|$|We perform {{three-dimensional}} spontaneous dynamic rupture {{models of}} potential earthquakes on the geometrically complex North Anatolian fault zone (NAFZ) under the Marmara Sea, Turkey. The NAFZ {{south of the}} city of Istanbul consists of a large-scale extensional stepover, with right lateral strike-slip segments linked by an oblique normal segment. We find that earthquakes nucleating near the stepover do not propagate across the entire fault system due to the statically unfavorable stress field on the oblique fault,and lead to moderate-size events only. However, earthquakes initiating a significant distance from the stepover cause significant dynamic <b>unclamping</b> of the oblique fault, and thus generate large through-going ruptures. Dynamic <b>unclamping</b> also produces supershear rupture propagation in the vicinity of fault discontinuities. The results emphasize that estimations of earthquake size, rupture propagation, and slip distribution cannot be decoupled from the location of the hypocenter and the orientation of the geometrically complex fault system within the tectonic stress field...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{hypothesized}} that antithrombotic plasma-activated protein C plays a defensive antithrombotic role during coronary ischemia and postischemic reperfusion. Methods and results: We evaluated protein C activation during cardiopulmonary bypass and coronary reperfusion in 20 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. During cardiopulmonary bypass {{and during the}} 10 minutes after aortic <b>unclamping,</b> the plasma levels of protein C (mean ± standard error of the mean) decreased from 123 % ± 7 % to 74 % ± 5 % of normal mean. In contrast, the levels of activated protein C in plasma increased from 122 % ± 8 % to 159 % ± 21 %, and the activated protein C/protein C ratio increased from 1. 04 ± 0. 08 to 2. 29 ± 0. 31 (P =. 006, 2 -tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test). Patients were stratified {{on the basis of}} the increase in activated protein C in the coronary sinus plasma at 10 minutes after reperfusion by means of the arbitrary value of 1. 5 for the activated protein C/protein C ratio. Within 24 hours, the patients with low increases in activated protein C (ratio 1. 5). The rapid increase in activated protein C during the first 10 minutes after aortic <b>unclamping</b> indicated protein C activation in the reperfused vascular beds. Conclusions: The antithrombotic protein C pathway was significantly activated during cardiopulmonary bypass mainly during the minutes after aortic <b>unclamping</b> in the ischemic vascular beds. Suboptimal protein C activation during ischemia may impair the postischemic recovery of human heart and circulation. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1999; 118 : 422 - 31...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundGrowth {{differentiation}} factor- 15 (GDF- 15) {{has been}} identified as a strong marker for cardiovascular disease; however, no data are available concerning the role of GDF- 15 in the occurrence of organ dysfunction during cardiac surgery associated with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). MethodsThirty four patients, programmed to have non-urgent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), were included in our study. Arterial blood samples were taken sequentially from anesthesia induction (IND) until 24 h after arrival at the cardiovascular intensive care unit (ICU). Plasma levels of GDF- 15, follistatin-like 1 (FLST 1), myeloperoxidases (MPO), hydroperoxides and plasma antioxidant status (PAS) were measured at each time-point. Markers of cardiac (cardiac-troponin I, cTnI) and renal dysfunction (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, NGAL) and other classical biological factors and clinical data were measured. ResultsGDF- 15 plasma levels increased gradually during surgery and after, reaching nearly than three time IND levels in the ICU (2, 904 ± 282 ng/L vs. 1, 061 ± 90 ng/L, p< 0. 001). MPO plasma levels increased dramatically just after <b>unclamping</b> (<b>UNCLAMP,</b> 49 ± 11 ng/mL vs. 1, 116 ± 94 ng/mL, p< 0. 001) while PAS significantly decreased between IND and <b>UNCLAMP</b> (p< 0. 05), confirming the high oxidative status of this surgical procedure. Compared with IND levels, cTnI and NGAL increased significantly (p< 0. 001) after surgery. ICU levels of GDF- 15 and NGAL were positively associated (p= 0. 026). ConclusionsDuring cardiac surgery associated with CPB, GDF- 15 levels were notably increased and associated with markers of cardiac injury, renal dysfunction (urea, creatinin, GFR, NGAL) and glycaemia...|$|R
