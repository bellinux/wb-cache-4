50|$|Samuel Fox (17 June 1815 - 25 February 1887) was a British {{industrialist}} and businessman {{noted for}} developing the Paragon <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame,</b> {{and the founder of}} a steelworks in Stocksbridge.|$|E
50|$|From {{relatively}} early on, Brigg {{chose to}} go down the route of individualized umbrella production, buying in the frame components from Fox <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Frames</b> Ltd, but using its own shafts, handles, ferrules, sliders and rib tips, not to mention covers. The firm was quick to complement its umbrella range with high-quality walking sticks.|$|R

50|$|The {{business}} partners August Kortenbach and Carl Rauh founded their manufacturing plant in Solingen, then {{a part of}} Prussia. The company {{became one of the}} leading <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame</b> manufacturers in the country.|$|E
5000|$|In 1851 he and {{his company}} Fox Umbrella Frames Ltd {{developed}} the [...] "Paragon" [...] <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame,</b> a U section of string steel that was far superior to its competitors. Development of the product continued until at least 1935. A similar product was used to make Crinoline frames from 1855. Umbrellas with 'Fox Frames' were sold worldwide.|$|E
50|$|A {{development}} of around 200 homes was {{planned for the}} village, with the building work being split between Cala Homes and another developer. The site {{was selected as the}} old factory grounds for Hoyland Fox, an <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame</b> manufacturer and was renamed Springfields. The construction was placed on hiatus owing to the global financial crisis, but was finally completed in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Samuel Fox {{bought a}} disused corn mill {{close by the}} centre of the town in 1842 and made {{alterations}} so that he could produce wire for the manufacture of textile pins. Within 6 years the business began to manufacture wire for <b>umbrella</b> <b>frames</b> and he developed his own variant, the “Paragon” in 1851. Expansion continued and by the mid-1860s furnaces and rolling mills had been built and the production of railway lines and springs begun.|$|R
5000|$|Wüster {{became one}} of the leading {{producers}} in Austria for <b>umbrella</b> <b>frames.</b> In 1928, the student Slawa Horowitz from the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna developed a new practical, foldable type of umbrella, for which she received a patent in 1929. It was contracted by Basch & Braun who commissioned Brüder Wüster to produce this umbrella, called [...] "Flirt", in large numbers. The German associate to produce them was Kortenbach & Rauh.|$|R
50|$|In 1853, Horsfall had {{patented}} a {{heat treatment}} process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved piano wire (giving a near monopoly), wire for making needles in Redditch, fishhooks, and <b>umbrella</b> <b>frames.</b> The firm made the armoured wire for first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866, using 30,000 miles of wire (1,600 tons), made by 250 workers over 11 months. The strengthened wire also {{made possible the}} construction of aeroplanes and automobiles. The company today also makes springs.|$|R
50|$|Samual Fox {{became the}} largest <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame</b> {{manufacturer}} {{in the world}} around the turn of last century. The company went on {{to be one of the}} largest steel makers in UK before being nationalised by British Steel. In late 1987, Readicut International bought William Hoyland and Co. Ltd from local owners. One year later, Hoyland acquired Fox Umbrella Frames Ltd and established the present company Hoyland Fox Limited.|$|E
50|$|Samuel Fox {{acquired}} the old cotton mill in 1842, at first renting {{it from its}} then owner, Joshua Newton. Nine years later, in 1851, he purchased the mill outright from Joshua's son, Thomas Newton. Fox converted the place {{to use as a}} wire mill, and built much of the infrastructure of Stocksbridge, primarily to house his new workforce and to supply their needs. The wire was initially for textile pins, but around 1848 the business expanded to include wire for umbrella frames which led to Fox developing the “Paragon” <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame</b> in 1851.|$|E
50|$|An old {{tradition}} in Ban Mixay village, Phoukoud district, is {{the making of}} mulberry paper umbrellas, {{but only a few}} people still know how to make the ‘Khan nyu’. The umbrellas were originally made by monks or novices at Buddhist temples and served as gifts to those who came to visit them. Nowadays they are sold in many colors and sizes at the local markets. The spokes of the <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame</b> are made from ‘mai hok’ and the struts from ‘mai pong’ or ‘mai louang’ bamboo, For the center piece, which is of particular importance, ‘mai sombao’ is used. The paper is made from the mulberry tree, but not the type used for silk production. The outer pulp of the tree is pounded and mixed with water. Then the paste is poured into the frame and the fibers are separated until they are evenly distributed. The frame is set out to dry in the sun. The dried paper is cut and glued to the spokes. The glue is made from the fruit of the wild persimmon tree. The paper is dyed with natural dyes; sesame oil e.g. produces a white color and the roots of the ‘mak bao’ plant are used for red umbrellas.|$|E
2500|$|The Peugeot {{family of}} Valentigney, Montbéliard, Franche-Comté, France, {{began in the}} {{manufacturing}} business in the 19th century. In 1842, they added production of coffee, pepper, and salt grinders. The company's entry into the vehicle market was by means of crinoline dresses, which used steel rods, leading to <b>umbrella</b> <b>frames,</b> saw blades, chisels, wire wheels, and bicycles. Armand Peugeot introduced his [...] "Le Grand Bi" [...] penny-farthing in 1882, along {{with a range of}} other bicycles. The car company and bike company parted ways in 1926 but Peugeot bicycles continued to be built until very recently.|$|R
5000|$|Samuel Fox founded Fox <b>Umbrella</b> <b>Frames</b> Ltd in 1842 in Stocksbridge, Sheffield, UK. Fox Umbrella Company {{started with}} a rain {{umbrella}} product. Samuel Fox is the first inventor of the U-shape ribs (called [...] "Paragon"). William Hoyland, assistant of Samuel Fox, built his own company William Hoyland Ltd in 1875. Hoyland and Fox’s Chief engineer Joseph Hayward set up business to produce the patented [...] "Flexus" [...] frame {{as an alternative to}} Fox' [...] "Paragon" [...] frame. The [...] "Flexus" [...] frame is built up of solid ribs with flat spring stretchers coupled in pairs and in such a manner that all the stretchers were under tension when the frame was in any position except when fully closed.|$|R
25|$|James Horsfall was a {{wire drawer}} from Digbeth who invented {{high tensile steel}} wire. He moved to Hay Mill, a disused blade and sword factory at a water mill on the River Cole, {{rebuilding}} it as a steam-driven mill. The mill originally belonged to Hay Hall in Tyseley. In 1855 his company merged with Joseph Webster's of Penn Mill, Sutton Coldfield. He was a major manufacturer and exporter of the piano wire to Europe in 1824. In 1853 Horsfall had patented a heat treatment process which strengthened the wire. This led to improved piano wire (giving a near monopoly), wire for making needles in Redditch, fishhooks, and <b>umbrella</b> <b>frames.</b> The firm made the armoured wire for first successful transatlantic telegraph cable in 1866, using 30,000 miles of wire (1600 tons), made by 250 workers over 11 months.

40|$|We {{continue}} {{here the}} development of the Multifunction Impulse Radiating Antenna (MIRA), which was introduced in Sensor and Simulation Note 413, and later refined in Sensor and Simulation Note 434. We describe here the design, fabrication and testing of two 1. 22 m (48 in) diameter antennas that are collapsible, lightweight, and man-portable. Both antennas use conductive and resistive fabric on an <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame.</b> The first antenna is called a Collapsible IRA, or CIRA. The second antenna has a multifunction capability that was created with expansion seams in the reflector to allow the surface curvature (and beamwidth) to be adjustable. This antenna is called a Collapsible Multifunction IRA, or CMIRA. Both antennas were tested using standard time domain antenna range techniques, and the results were converted to IEEE standard gain in the frequency domain. We continue here our development of the Multifunction Impulse Radiating Antenna (MIRA) with a collapsible, compact, man-portable version. An earlier version of the MIRA was described in [1], and later refinements to the feed point were described in [2]. Reflector IRA...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} systematic design methodology for directed product evolution that uses both rigid body and compliant mechanisms to facilitate component combination {{in the domain}} of mechanical products. The methodology, known as effort flow analysis, is based on fundamental tenets from the Theory of Mechanics, and Graph Theory. Effort flow analysis uses a semantic network known as an effort flow diagram to model a product as a connected set of nodes and links. The nodes represent the components of the product and the links represent the interfaces between the components. The effort flow diagram is a quasi-static model of the flow of effort (force or torque in the mechanical domain) as it transits the body from input to output. In order to capture the effect of the relative motion that occurs at the interfaces, a basis set for relative motion is developed for effort flow analysis. The basis consists of 4 possible link type cases, (1) No relative motion at the interface or away from the interface, (2) Component relative motion that occurs away from the interface, (3) general Relative motion between components, and (4) Interface relative motion that occurs only at the interface. These are known as N- Links, C-Links, R-Links, and I-Links respectively. Rigid body combinations are sought for components connected by N-Links and compliant mechanism combinations are sought for components connected by the other link types. Component combination opportunities are sought based on the connection structure of the effort flow diagram. Guidance for component combination is captured in a set of 29 product-evolution guidelines that are derived from the results of an empirical study. In addition, an example solution is cataloged for each of the guidelines to foster design-by-analogy efforts by the designer. Finally, the work presents a novel design and prototype for a compliant one-piece <b>umbrella</b> <b>frame,</b> which serves as a proof of concept for the methodology. Possible future pursuits are presented in the areas of knowledge capture using guidelines and solution examples. In addition, the possibility of a function-to-component matrix for automated concept generation is considered...|$|E
50|$|In the 1920s and 1930s {{the firm}} greatly {{expanded}} its range of handcrafted <b>umbrellas.</b> These used <b>frames</b> made by Samuel Fox of Stocksbridge. A range of animal heads carved in wood was {{made available for}} both umbrellas and walking sticks. Many of the heads were made {{by members of the}} Czilinsky family over several generations.|$|R
5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the <b>umbrella</b> of <b>frame</b> transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|R
40|$|A {{screening}} of Shona Illingworth’s film Balnakiel, with its {{exploration of the}} complex forces of military and cultural memory and history in northwest Scotland provided the stimulus for this symposium on the Scottish landscape and its historical and contemporary aesthetic and political resonance. This event, organised by Film and Video Umbrella and CCA, {{and supported by the}} Wellcome Trust, was part of Film and Video <b>Umbrella’s</b> 25 <b>Frames</b> programme, which staged 25 key artists’ moving-image works chosen from over 200 works commissioned by this leading arts organisation over the past 25 years. The symposium included: presentations by Shona Illingworth with Professor Martin A.

50|$|Since then, the {{umbrella}} {{has come into}} general use, in consequence of numerous improvements. In China people learned how to waterproof their paper umbrellas with wax and lacquer. The transition to the present portable form is due, partly, to the substitution of silk and gingham for the heavy and troublesome oiled silk, which admitted of the ribs and frames being made much lighter, and also to many ingenious mechanical improvements in the framework. Victorian era <b>umbrellas</b> had <b>frames</b> of wood or baleen, but these devices were expensive and hard to fold when wet. Samuel Fox invented the steel-ribbed umbrella in 1852; however, the Encyclopédie Méthodique mentions metal ribs {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century, and they were also on sale in London during the 1780s. Modern designs usually employ a telescoping steel trunk; new materials such as cotton, plastic film and nylon often replace the original silk.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{interesting}} forms of opinion given in a newspaper is an editorial cartoon or political cartoon. It presents the opinion in a special way {{through the use of}} metaphorical texts and pictures in the cartoon. However, this specialty may also lead the newspaper readers to have many interpretations about the pictures, texts in the callouts, and their relations. Because of this possibility of having multi-interpretations, the writer can see that {{it is also possible that}} the message of the editorial cartoon fails to be delivered to the newspaper readers. Therefore, the writer is interested in finding whether the readers? perceived meaning of Clekit, Jawa Pos editorial cartoon, is similar to or different from the intended meaning of the caricaturist. Basically, the theory of frames is used as the main theory of this research, together with the theory of coherence and general socio-cultural knowledge as the bigger <b>umbrella</b> of <b>frames.</b> The theory of Contextual Configuration, denotative and connotative meaning and the theory of metaphors serve as the supporting theories. The writer uses descriptive-qualitative approach. She also uses the questionnaires to get Jawa Pos readers? perceived meanings on the cartoon. The result of the analysis shows that most respondents have similar meanings as what are intended. In other words, the respondents have achieved the intended meaning of the cartoon, and the caricaturist is successful in delivering his message to the newspaper readers...|$|R
40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s, Kenneth Frampton {{presented}} critical regionalism as an <b>umbrella</b> concept to <b>frame</b> some peripheral architectural practices that became instrumental to illustrate {{an alternative approach}} both to the modernist dogma and to post-modernist reactions. The architecture of Álvaro Siza {{was one of those}} marginal practices frequently used to illustrate that alternative position. In this paper I will bring together critical regionalism and its critique to explore the possibility of its role as a mediator between dogmatic applications of the modern canon and populism. Critical regionalism will be discussed within the broader frame of the redefinition of hegemonic relationships, especially postcolonial critique, and the relation centre-periphery. Using Siza’s project for the Malagueira neighbourhood in Évora (Portugal) as support, I will argue that the architect’s approach created a third way between populism and avant-garde, and represents a re-foundation of the avant-garde, where the gap between high culture and the everyday is shortened, {{through the use of a}} mediation strategy supported by the architectural project...|$|R
40|$|Legitimacy {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{as an important}} resource for an organisation, strategy, or individual to possess. However, the process of gaining legitimacy has received limited attention in the academic literature. This thesis examines the strategies and actions that individuals employ {{in the process of}} legitimising their sustainability strategy within an organisation. Based on semi-structured interviews with 51 Heads of Sustainability, the research extends the existing ‘conformance, selection, manipulation’ legitimising strategy model, becoming {{one of the first to}} demonstrate how these legitimising strategies are interrelated both concurrently and temporally. It finds that multiple legitimising strategies are used simultaneously by individuals. Moreover, a pattern emerges whereby individuals begin with conformance-only legitimising when sustainability has limited integration, but employ all three legitimising strategies where sustainability integration is extensive. In addition to this, the research articulates two specific categories of actions that are used by individuals in the process of deploying these <b>umbrella</b> legitimising strategies: <b>framing</b> and developing coalitions of support. Framing actions comprise micro-reframing, disassociation, contextualisation, analogy, and differentiation and personalisation. Developing coalitions of support actions comprise leveraging sponsorship, networking, enhancing employee engagement, and continually promoting. From this empirical research a generalised legitimising pathway is proposed which demonstrates the progression of legitimising from using conformance-only through to using all three legitimising strategies, and the actions employed by the individual in these different stages...|$|R
5000|$|The {{use of the}} {{umbrella}} or parasol (though not unknown) was uncommon in England during the earlier half of the eighteenth century, as {{is evident from the}} comment made by General (then Lieut.-Colonel) James Wolfe, when writing from Paris in 1752; he speaks of the use of umbrellas for protection from the sun and rain, and wonders why a similar practice did not occur in England. About the same time, umbrellas came into general use as people found their value, and got over the shyness natural to its introduction. Jonas Hanway, the founder of the Magdalen Hospital, has the credit of being the first man who ventured to dare public reproach and ridicule by carrying one habitually in London. As he died in 1786, and he is said to have carried an umbrella for thirty years, the date of its first use by him may be set down at about 1750. John Macdonald relates that in 1770, he used to be addressed as, [...] "Frenchman, Frenchman! why don't you call a coach?" [...] whenever he went out with his umbrella. [...] By 1788 however they seem to have been accepted: a London newspaper advertises the sale of 'improved and pocket <b>Umbrellas,</b> on steel <b>frames,</b> with every other kind of common Umbrella.' [...] But full acceptance is not complete even today with some considering umbrellas effete.|$|R
