40|$|The {{regional}} {{special purpose}} funds {{came into existence}} in the so called autonomous period of national councils, after <b>the</b> year <b>of</b> 1956. <b>The</b> existence <b>of</b> said funds seems to be advisable, {{despite the fact that}} they are incompatible with <b>the</b> principle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state's <b>budget,</b> as they make possible to finance some projects outside the rather rigorous scope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> economy. They also permit to economize <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> funds and to reduce <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central <b>budget's</b> dotations. A similar character has <b>the</b> special accumulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> funds, f. ex. in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> additional payments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population, the state's and cooperatives enterprises with a view <b>of</b> financing <b>the</b> communal facilities. <b>The</b> various elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> funds economy, in <b>the</b> system <b>of</b> regional <b>budgets</b> are further linked with a possibility <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> surpluses from past years. This ought to be an incentive for a better, namely more careful spending <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>budget</b> funds. However, there are some restrictions in <b>the</b> policies <b>of</b> spending <b>the</b> said surpluses, which run contrary to the above mentioned incentives. The entirely free way <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> surpluses which originate from not fully drawn upon investment funds — should, however, be limited. A new feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regional <b>budget</b> economy is <b>the</b> project to set up — from parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surpluses — the so called equation funds, destined to cover the deficits. <b>The</b> idea <b>of</b> those funds seems to be justified, there are, on the other hand, some doubts on how those funds ought to be administered.

40|$|La delega per attuare l'art. 119 della Costituzione - The Italian Parliament has {{approved}} a new arrangement in regional and local financing. Due to wide economic and social differences in the country a larger decentralization entails serious problems in equalization. To cope with expenditures responsibilities of Regions, Provincial Authorities and Communes are divided in more important or fundamental functions and less important or discretionary functions. The former are equalized more generously "according to needs" and the latter only partially "according to fiscal capacities". This distinction seems not totally consistent with the Constitution as well not totally justifiable in terms of autonomy of territorial authorities and <b>unity</b> <b>of</b> their <b>budgets.</b> <b>The</b> question <b>of</b> revenue assignment is substantially unsolved. Regional and local taxes are not large enough and too much weak to warrant a true subnational fiscal autonomy. Last year the central state has abolished the communal tax on owner-occupied residential property. As a result accountability and fairness of municipal governments has been damaged. The new law does not remedy this error. In future regional and local authorities will extensively rely on a system of revenue-sharing. ...|$|R
