5000|$|During construction, a {{total of}} six bridges will be built to support workers, {{vehicles}} and equipment in addition to various access roads. To divert the river, two tunnels, 1151 m and 1180 m in length will be constructed at the dam's left abutment. They will have discharge capacities of [...] and [...] respectively. To divert the water, two roller-compacted concrete cofferdams will be constructed. The <b>upstream</b> <b>cofferdam</b> will be 51 m high and the downstream 25 m. Material to construct the dam including aggregate will come from the actual excavation of the dam site along with three quarries in the area.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1973, Copel {{was awarded}} the {{concession}} contract to construct the dam and by May 1974, various studies had recommended a site near {{the confluence of the}} Inguazu and Da Areia Rivers. By August of that year, a design was chosen and in October 1976 after contracts were awarded, construction began. The river was diverted with two 12 m diameter and 600 m long diversion tunnels. To facilitate the river's diversion, two cofferdams were constructed, one upstream and one downstream of the site. The <b>upstream</b> <b>cofferdam</b> was 45 m high and allowed the diversion of up to [...] of water. The dam began to impound the reservoir in 1980 and by October it was filled and complete.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 {{plans were}} {{advanced}} to dam the Sweetwater River at a narrow point known as Devil's Gate. A more ambitious plan was proposed in 1903 by {{the newly established}} Bureau of Reclamation to dam a site below {{the confluence of the}} Sweetwater and the North Platte. The dam's design was carried out by George Y. Wisner of the Reclamation Service, with consulting engineer Edgar T. Wheeler. Exploratory drilling was started in 1903, and a contract for a 480 ft long diversion tunnel was let in 1905. Bidding for the dam construction contract was plagued with delays; the initial contractor withdrew, citing bidding errors. Eventually, the construction contract was awarded to the Geddis and Seerie Stone Company of Denver, for an initial sum of $482,000, later to rise to $626,523.52. Difficulties with the construction of an <b>upstream</b> <b>cofferdam,</b> created by the contractor's improper blasting of loose rock from the canyon walls, led to the first delays. Foundation work on the dam started in January 1906, with the foundation set only 10 ft deep.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of canals and locks {{that would make the}} St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water {{in order to create a}} navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a <b>cofferdam</b> <b>upstream,</b> creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|R
50|$|To {{solve the}} cement {{delivery}} problems, by March 1908, the Bureau of Reclamation built a levee on the California {{side on the}} dam that was topped by a rail-line. Beforehand, they had also gained {{the cooperation of the}} Southern Pacific Railroad who agreed to deliver cement directly at the dam site. The rock quality problem was solved when the Bureau raised the <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>cofferdams</b> with rock waste and topped them with rail lines that could deliver rock-fill much faster. By December 1908, the water bypass around the dam was complete and workers began to pour the rock-fill. Three large concrete walls supported by 6 in sheet-wood pilings were built across the river for the dam's foundation. Rock-fill was placed in between and on the outsides of these walls for support. The California sluiceway consisted of three iron gates while the Arizona had one. Mexican-Americans mostly worked on the dam while a few Native American Indians did as well. White-labor worked in the cooler months.|$|R
5000|$|In February 1986, nearly 500,000 people {{faced the}} {{possibility}} of flooding when engineers at Folsom Dam were forced to open the spillway gates after heavy rains. The flooding was made worse {{by the failure of}} the Auburn Dam <b>cofferdam</b> <b>upstream</b> which released an extra [...] into the American River. A peak flow of [...] entered Folsom Lake, forcing operators at Folsom Dam to open all the spillway gates, releasing [...] into the American River. This was [...] above the safe capacity of downstream levees. Although the dam and the Sacramento levee system held without major damages, the requisite winter flood control space was increased 50%, from 400,000 to 600,000 acre feet, to protect against future floods. In addition, about [...] of sediment carried down from the mountains was deposited in Folsom Lake, considerably reducing its capacity. The consequence was a reduced capacity to store winter rainfall for summer use. Folsom Dam may have prevented as much as $4.7 billion in damages in 1986 alone.|$|R
50|$|Crystal Dam was {{the last}} of the three dams in the Aspinall Unit of the Colorado River Storage Project to be completed. Crystal Dam's design and {{construction}} lagged behind Morrow Point and Blue Mesa dams. Construction started in 1964 on a materials borrow pit, with construction at the damsite beginning in 1965 for an access road and exploratory drilling. Work then stopped for five years. Initially planned as an earthfill dam, the design was changed to a double-curvature thin-shell concrete arch dam. After an initial bidding process in which all bid were rejected as too high, a contract for the diversion tunnel was awarded in 1972, which was holed through the same year. The construction contract for the dam itself was awarded to the J.F. Shea Company in June 1973. Cofferdam work continued into 1974, encountering problems with leakage though the <b>upstream</b> <b>cofferdam.</b> 24 in wells were drilled below the cofferdam to intercept water. In the meantime the dam foundation was excavated, with first concrete placement in June. Excavation and concrete work for the powerplant started the same year. Concrete work stopped in November, resuming in April 1975. Work was behind schedule; the dam was supposed to be completed by December 1975. Concrete work resumed in April 1976, with final completion of the dam structure on August 30, 1976. Filling operations in the reservoir began on March 14, 1977, permanently blocking the diversion tunnel on April 12. The powerplant was not completed until 1978, victim of a fire in the contractor's warehouse that destroyed many electrical components intended for the plant.|$|E
40|$|Tuirial Dam is a zoned {{earthfill dam}} of about 74 m height above the deepest river bed level. The <b>upstream</b> <b>cofferdam</b> whose crest {{is at an}} {{elevation}} of 53. 5 m above sea level is integrated with the main dam. The dam is curved in plan and the radius of the axis is 1000 m. The dam is partly founded on alternations of sand and siltstone, and alluvial deposits.

40|$|AbstractBased on hydrologic {{data and}} {{diversion}} structure arrangement of Gongguoqiao hydropower station during construction, the hydraulic model on diversion structures is built according to similarity principle. Then the hydraulic characteristic and its flow model were studied by hydraulic model test. Hydraulic characteristic and flow pattern for the diversion tunnel and dam gap combined discharge were studied subsequently in this paper. The study {{results show that}} half pressure flow state is formed in the diversion tunnel when quantity of flow is greater than 3500 m 3 /s. That submerged flow is formed exactly in the inlet of diversion tunnel when quantity of flow is 5000 m 3 /s. Three aeration segments are formed {{in the top of}} diversion tunnel when quantity of flow is greater than 6580 m 3 /s. The study results also show non-interpenetrated turbulence is formed intermittently in the right bank of inlet for diversion tunnel when quantity of flow is greater than 7710 m 3 /s, and the flow over the <b>upstream</b> <b>cofferdam</b> is near the submerged hydraulic jump...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to assess the {{hydraulic}} conditions of the River Nile during and after the construction of the New Naga Hammadi Barrage Cofferdams. These two cofferdams will be constructed upstream and downstream the construction pit of the New Barrage. For this purpose, a physical model for the River Nile at the location of the New Barrage was constructed with scale 1 : 30. The model test program included all constructions phases of the two cofferdams. The tests were carried out for the conditions before the construction, four intermediate construction phases and after completion of works. Each phase was tested under steady conditions for not less two hours The results proved that a respective design including stability calculations must be prepared to prove the stability of the material of the two cofferdams especially in the first and third phases of construction, which have high velocities. Also, the periods of executing these phases need to be limited, i. e. the diversion canal should be opened after a short period and the complete closure of the <b>upstream</b> <b>cofferdam</b> (the fourth phase) should be executed as soon as possible after the third phase...|$|E
