5|$|The Earth {{is passing}} through an ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial period. This period would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial period until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming period of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel <b>use</b> <b>will</b> cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial period for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief period of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E
5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue fuel efficiency (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased fuel efficiency usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased fuel efficiency may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel <b>use</b> <b>will</b> unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E

25|$|The ‘system gain’ is an {{important}} source of reactive power in the above power balance equation, which is generated by the capacitative nature of the transmission network itself. By making decisive switching actions in the early morning before the demand increases, the system gain can be maximized early on, helping to secure the system for the whole day. To balance the equation some pre-fault reactive generator <b>use</b> <b>will</b> be required. Other sources of reactive power that will also be used include shunt capacitors, shunt reactors, static VAR compensators and voltage control circuits.|$|E
25|$|The Juhu airport {{redevelopment}} plan, {{that received}} an in-principle nod from the State Government on 5 April 2013, involves closing down its secondary runway 16/34. Aviation experts {{have called the}} re-development blueprint most unsafe as closing of the secondary runway at Juhu would mean the airport would have to shut operations whenever CSIA uses its secondary runway 14/32. The use of Juhu's main runway while CSIA's secondary runway is in <b>use</b> <b>will</b> cause aircraft paths to intersect risking air safety. Airlines would be averse to operating from an airport which would either violate safety norms or be shut almost 40% of the time.|$|E
25|$|With {{long-term}} use and during withdrawal of benzodiazepines, treatment-emergent depression and emotional blunting may emerge and sometimes also suicidal ideation. There {{is evidence that}} the higher the dose used {{the more likely it is}} benzodiazepine <b>use</b> <b>will</b> induce these feelings. Reducing the dose or discontinuing benzodiazepines may be indicated in such cases. Withdrawal symptoms can persist for quite some time after discontinuing benzodiazepines. Some common protracted withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, depression, insomnia, and physical symptoms such as gastrointestinal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal effects. The protracted withdrawal state may still occur despite slow titration of dosage. It is believed that the protracted withdrawal effects are due to persisting neuroadaptations.|$|E

Rembrandt willingly injects himself with the virus and slides alone back to Earth Prime to fight the Kromaggs, ending the series in a cliffhanger.|$|E

It is expected that PwC will be ready with {{a plan for the}} merger by the end of 2017. But the merger is expected to take at least three years after that. Following the merger, the existing suburban trains that the MRTS <b>use</b> <b>will</b> be replaced by air-conditioned trains of Chennai Metro Rail. The fares of MRTS too will be increased to match that of Chennai Metro Rail and the ownership of existing assets of the MRTS will be transferred to CMRL. A terminal facility for MRTS will be constructed at the Chennai Fort Station on the state government land available at the station.|$|E
25|$|Western composers {{have noticed}} that the rhythm {{in a piece of}} qin music can change; once they seem to have got a beat, the beats change. This {{is due to the fact}} that qin players may use some free rhythm in their playing. Whatever beat they <b>use</b> <b>will</b> depend on the emotion or the feeling of the player, and how he interprets the piece. However, some melodies have {{sections}} of fixed rhythm which is played the same way generally. The main theme of Meihua Sannong, for example, uses this. Some sections of certain melodies require the player to play faster with force to express the emotion of the piece. Examples include the middle sections of Guangling San and Xiaoxiang Shuiyun. Other pieces, such as Jiu Kuang has a fixed rhythm throughout the entire piece.|$|E

25|$|Codeine and/or {{its major}} {{metabolites}} may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor therapy, confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning or assist in a medico-legal death investigation. Drug abuse screening programs generally test urine, hair, sweat or saliva. Many commercial opiate screening tests directed at morphine cross-react appreciably with codeine and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish codeine from other opiates and opioids. It {{is important to note}} that codeine usage results in significant amounts of morphine as an excretion product. Furthermore, heroin contains codeine (or acetyl codeine) as an impurity and its <b>use</b> <b>will</b> result in excretion of small amounts of codeine. Poppy seed foods represent yet another source of low levels of codeine in one's biofluids. Blood or plasma codeine concentrations are typically in the 50–300µg/L range in persons taking the drug therapeutically, 700–7000µg/L in chronic users and 1000–10,000µg/L in cases of acute fatal over dosage.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages, {{patients}} with ALD exhibits subtle and often no abnormal physical findings. It {{is usually not}} until development of advanced liver disease that stigmata of chronic liver disease become apparent. Early ALD is usually discovered during routine health examinations when liver enzyme levels {{are found to be}} elevated. These usually reflect alcoholic hepatic steatosis. Microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis with inflammation are seen in liver biopsy specimens. These histologic features of ALD are indistinguishable from those of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Steatosis usually resolves after discontinuation of alcohol use. Continuation of alcohol <b>use</b> <b>will</b> result in a higher risk of progression of liver disease and cirrhosis. In patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis, clinical manifestations include fever, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and possible hepatic decompensation with hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding, and ascites accumulation.Tender hepatomegaly may be present, but abdominal pain is unusual. Occasionally, the patient may be asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposed}} replacement {{train is}} being {{designed by the}} Stratford upon Avon-based rolling stock manufacturer Vivarail, which plans to market {{a new class of}} DMU called the D-Train. These units will be built out of upcycled London Underground D78 Stock, which had previously been in service on the District line. Conversion of the old Underground stock to heavy rail <b>use</b> <b>will</b> involve re-using the aluminium bodyshells, traction motors and bogies from the D78 units and fitting them out with new diesel engines and interiors. The D-Train units are undergoing acceptance testing in 2015 and Vivarail plans to pitch them to train operating companies (TOCs), especially those bidding for the Northern franchise, which was awarded in December 2015. However, the new operator, Arriva Rail North, has announced it will instead replace the Pacers with brand new Class 195 CAF Civitys. In October 2017, West Midlands Trains announced that it had ordered 3 D-Train units for the West Midlands franchise that it will take over in December 2017.|$|E
