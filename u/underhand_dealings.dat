6000|$|... "My master's next demand," [...] {{said the}} ambassador, [...] "is that your Majesty will cease your secret and <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings</b> with his towns of Ghent, Liege, and Malines. He {{requests}} that your Majesty will recall the secret agents by whose means the discontents {{of his good}} citizens of Flanders are inflamed; and dismiss from your Majesty's dominions, or rather deliver up to the condign punishment of their liege lord, those traitorous fugitives, who, having fled {{from the scene of}} their machinations, have found too ready a refuge in Paris, Orleans, Tours, and other French cities." ...|$|E
60|$|Queen Elizabeth, by her {{constant}} intrigues, her <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings</b> with France and Spain, her grasping {{policy in}} the Netherlands, her meanness and parsimony, {{and the fact that}} she was ready at any moment to sacrifice the Netherlands to her own policy, had wholly alienated the people of the Low Country; for while their own efforts for defence were paralysed by the constant interference of Elizabeth, no benefit was obtained from the English army, whose orders were to stand always on the defensive -- the queen's only anxiety appearing to be to keep her grasp upon the towns that had been handed over to her as the price of her alliance.|$|E
50|$|Arthur Travers Crawford (1835-1911) was {{the first}} Municipal Commissioner and {{collector}} of Bombay (now Mumbai), India. Crawford was famous as an able administrator {{as well as for}} his allegedly, <b>underhand</b> financial <b>dealings.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mahajan {{was seen}} as being close to various lobbyists and {{corporate}} houses and there were numerous allegations of financial irregularities during his tenure in the Ministry of Telecom. One of the foremost allegations is his blatant favoring of the Reliance Group in exchange for alleged <b>underhand</b> financial <b>dealings.</b> A relative of Sudanshu Mittal, a close associate of Pramod Mahajan and his own son-in-law {{were found to have}} been one of the beneficiaries benami shares of Reliance Industries being transferred into shell companies.|$|R
60|$|Laura was, of course, {{very much}} mortified,--almost beyond {{the power of}} concealment. She thought he would have come {{for the sake of}} seeing her, and she had {{reckoned}} so much on this meeting that it was double vexation. He did not know what he was missing by not coming; and she could not inform him, for writing to him was impossible, without the <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings</b> to which they would never, either of them, have recourse. So much for herself; and his perseverance in disapproval, in spite of renewed explanation, made her more anxious and sorry on Amy's account. Very mournful were poor Laura's sensations; but there was no remedy but to try to bewilder and drive them away in the bustle of preparation.|$|E
6000|$|... 156. (A) [...] "The {{challenge}} {{appears to}} have been delivered." [...] May I respectfully express my regret that your lordship should not have read the letter you have honored me by answering. The number of Fors referred to does not deliver--it only reiterates--the challenge given in the Fors for January 1st, 1875, with reference to the prayer [...] "Have mercy upon all Jews, Turks, infidels, and heretics, and so fetch them home, blessed Lord, to Thy flock, that they may be saved among the remnant of the true Israelites," [...] in these following terms: [...] "Who are the true Israelites, my Lord of Manchester, on your Exchange? Do they stretch their cloth, like other people?--have they any <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings</b> with the liable-to-be-damned false Israelites--Rothschilds and the like? or are they duly solicitous about those wanderers' souls? and how often, on the average, do your Manchester clergy preach from the delicious parable, savoriest of all Scripture to rogues (at least since the eleventh century, when I find it to have been specially headed with golden title in my best Greek MS.) of the Pharisee and Publican,--and how often, on the average, from those objectionable First and Fifteenth Psalms?" ...|$|E

50|$|The {{requirement}} for parties {{to register with}} an official body, if they wished to be named on ballot papers, {{was the result of}} a fairly wide acceptance that the finances of political groups should be regulated to reduce the perception of <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings.</b>|$|E

Honouring the programme in its 50th anniversary awards, the Political Studies Association, said: [...] "World in Action thrived on unveiling corruption and highlighting <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings.</b> World in Action {{came to be seen}} as hard-hitting investigative journalism at its best." ...|$|E

50|$|Known popularly in {{the media}} circles as RTI maverick, Afroz Alam Sahil is a RTI {{journalist}} and a social activist who has investigated and brought to light many facts related to high-profile cases. He has exposed many <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings</b> and funding irregularities of many organizations and personalities. His expose of Dow Chemicals, Bhopal Gas Tragedy and Batla House encounter has opened many a Pandora box that has revealed startling information that was hidden from the public.|$|E
50|$|After an {{endorsement}} by League president {{and chairman of}} Liverpool John McKenna on account of their longer membership of the League, Arsenal won the vote by eighteen votes to Spurs' eight (Barnsley got five, Wolves four, Nottingham Forest three, Birmingham two and Hull City one) and were thus elected to the First Division. It has been frequently alleged that Arsenal chairman Sir Henry Norris used <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings</b> {{in order to bring}} this about, although nothing has been proven. The decision infuriated Tottenham and their supporters, although eleven years previously, Tottenham themselves had been elected to join the Football League Second Division despite only finishing 7th in the 1907-08 Southern League, at the expense of Southern League champions Queen's Park Rangers, who had also applied and had resigned from the Southern League in expectation of promotion.|$|E
50|$|In the {{following}} two seasons they finished the league in fourth and fifth place, not quite managing {{to reach the top}} flight, and sat in fourth place when league football was suspended due to the First World War. When the league started again in 1919, the decision to extend the first division to twenty-two teams made it likely that Barnsley would be automatically promoted. However, a ballot was instead called and Arsenal went up in their place (the Arsenal chairman later admitted to some <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings).</b> In 1921-22, Barnsley missed promotion on goal difference, by a single goal. Stoke City needed to win their final game by 3-0 in order to go ahead of Barnsley in the table, which is exactly what they did. It was the closest any team could come to securing promotion to the top flight without actually managing it.|$|E
50|$|The {{preserved}} cadaver of her degenerate {{father was}} seated upon a throne under a green glass dome. On occasion, Wanda sought advice from him after establishing a psychic or spiritual {{link with the}} corpse. During his lifetime, Candyfloss, Wanda's paramour, {{was one of the}} many women whom Walter kept as a mistress. The source of his great fortune that Wanda later inherited was Grigori Rasputin, who in 1916 was attempting to lodge for safe keeping a large fortune in jewels in the Swiss bank that von Kreesus was working for. However Rasputin's untimely death left the large hoard in von Kreesus' possession. Needless to say, the bank heard no more from Herr von Kreesus. He then proceeded to increase his fortune still further through various <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings,</b> with amongst others, Lenin, who von Kreesus lent a train fare-to when the communist leader {{was on his way to}} a 3 April 1917 important meeting.|$|E
50|$|When {{the league}} {{restarted}} after World War I, the 1919-20 season brought some significant {{changes to the}} league. The principal difference was that the First Division would be increased from 20 teams to 22. The bottom team from the previous season was Tottenham Hotspur and they were duly relegated. The first extra place in the First Division went to Chelsea, who retained their place despite finishing 2nd bottom and therefore in the relegation places. Derby County and Preston North End were rightly promoted from the Second Division which left one place to be filled. Having finished the previous season's Second Division in 3rd place (1914-15), Barnsley expected to achieve First Division status for the first time, but The Football League instead chose to call a ballot of the clubs. Henry Norris, the then Arsenal chairman, had recently moved Woolwich Arsenal north of the River Thames to Highbury, and needed First Division football to attract fans to their new home. He was later to admit some <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings,</b> allegedly including the bribing of some member clubs to vote for Arsenal's inclusion. They duly won the vote and Barnsley were consigned to the second tier of English football for another 8 decades.|$|E
5000|$|The {{printing}} process {{is described by}} Stewart-Wilson: They are produced under the following conditions :-The surcharging is done in Calcutta at the Government of India Central Printing Press, under conditions of supervision etc., which make <b>underhand</b> <b>dealings</b> impossible. The stamps to be surcharged are supplied by the Superintendent of Stamps and Stationery under special precautions, and a like number have {{to be returned to}} him after receiving the surcharge. The employees cannot bring into the office, or introduce extraneous matter, such as unused stamps bought for the purpose, into the machines; and cannot manipulate the setting of the surcharge when once passed.All work done by human beings is liable to a want of accuracy. This is specially the case when the human beings are Orientals not sufficiently educated to have lost the queer belief that want of accuracy is absolutely essential to avert the dreaded [...] "Evil Eye." [...] Further, the chance of error which occurs in one setting of type is greatly increased when that type has to be set 240 times, as it has to be for every supply of surcharged star-watermarked stamps. And when we remember that these 240 settings have to be made not once, but often and at varying intervals of time, it is hardly wonderful that mistakes do occur. There are some mistakes which will occur, no matter what care is taken. Type will break while in use, and minute portions of a letter will now and then take up {{too much or too little}} ink.......but a genuine collector despises such deviations.|$|E
