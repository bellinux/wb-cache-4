40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{studies the}} NGI-ADP soil model, which can realistically {{simulate}} the anisotropic undrained stress strain responses and <b>undrained</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> of clays. The model requires direct input parameters of <b>undrained</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strengths</b> and failure <b>shear</b> strains, including triaxial compression test, triaxial extension test and direct simple shear. However, parametric studies {{in this paper}} clearly show that trial-and-error testing of some input parameters is {{necessary in order to}} determine the optimal set of input parameters. The paper proposes the equations of anisotropic stress strain curves of this soil model and the technique of soil parameter optimization so that the optimal set of input parameters can be determined automatically and efficiently. The technique of soil parameter optimization is based on the statistical approach of least squares where proposed stress strain curves are used to compute model predictions. Finally, the proposed technique of soil parameter optimization of the NGI-ADP model is employed to determine the optimal set of input parameters for Bangkok soft clay...|$|R

5000|$|Vegetation {{influences}} {{slope stability}} by removing water through transpiration. Transpiration is the vaporisation of liquid water contained in plant tissue and the vapour removal to the air. Water is drawn {{up from the}} roots and transported through the plant up to the leaves. [...] The major effect of transpiration is the reduction of soil pore water pressures which counteracts the loss of strength which occurs through wetting, this is most readily seen as a loss of moisture around trees. However {{it is not easy}} to rely on tree and shrub roots to remove water from slopes and consequently help ensure slope stability. The ability to transpire in wet conditions is severely reduced and therefore any increase in soil strength previously gained in evaporation and transpiration will be lost or significantly reduced, consequently the effects of transpiration cannot be taken into account at these times. However it can be assumed that the chance of slope failure following saturation by storm event or periods of extended rainfall will be lessened as a result of transpiration. Moreover, although changes in moisture content will affect the <b>undrained</b> <b>shear</b> <b>strength,</b> the effective shear stress parameters as commonly used in routine slope stability analysis are not directly influenced by changing moisture content, although the water pressures (suctions) used in the analysis will change.|$|E
