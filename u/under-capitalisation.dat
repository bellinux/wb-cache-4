Building a brand new car, the Hillman Imp, proved beyond Humber and Rootes Group resources and their businesses were bought by the Chrysler Corporation in 1967.|$|E
50|$|The Royal Commission's archive {{gave the}} {{organisation}} a renewed raison d'être. Years of <b>under-capitalisation</b> of the National Monuments Record had {{meant that it}} had no effective, modern finding aids. Computerisation of the records data now began to unlock its riches, including the collection of images, the largest of its kind in Wales and half as big again as that of the National Library. The National Monuments Record had become a nationwide resource of a nature different to that of the regional sites and monuments records. It expanded rapidly with significant donations from many public and private sources supplementing the detailed survey and photographic records of the Commission itself. Transfers from many other public organisations, including Cadw on behalf of the Welsh Assembly Government, take place from time to time. Important collections have been accepted from the private and commercial sectors, one of the most notable being the acquisition in 2008 of the Aerofilms collection of historic oblique air photographs. Today, the photographs in the National Monuments Record are Wales's largest national collection, with about 1.5 million images. A foretaste of the future was the Commission's participation in the Gathering the Jewels project, which provided an opportunity to make available online many notable images from the National Monuments Record and began a digitisation programme which remains one of the Commission's priorities in its service to the public.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} women entrepreneurs make important contributions to economic development, but are disadvantaged by initial <b>under-capitalisation.</b> Working with UK and devolved governments, leading banks and finance institutions, and regional enterprise support organisations, this research influenced policy debates; shaped women’s enterprise policy; improved understanding of factors underpinning {{access to finance}} for diverse enterprises; and influenced the work of business support organisations and commercial banks...|$|E
40|$|This article {{explores the}} use of market failure by the {{coalition}} government in the United Kingdom to redress the <b>under-capitalisation</b> of the third sector. Drawing on evidence gathered {{in the evaluation of}} Futurebuilders in England, an initiative of the previous New Labour government, the article considers five market failures used by the coalition government to justify its policies towards social investment. These are: imperfect information; imperfect competition; externalities; absence of public goods; and cultural and behavioural barriers. The evidence shows that policy makers should be cautious in {{the use of}} market failure, suggests alternative approaches that may be of use, and in relation to social investment outlines how the concept has taken on a discursive power to justify actions to expose the third sector to financial markets...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of an inflation targeting regime in 1998 the Czech National Bank has made a considerable progress in developing formal tools for supporting its Forecasting and Policy Analysis System. This paper documents the newest version of an open econ-omy DSGE model, which {{has been designed to}} capture {{some of the most important}} fea-tures of the Czech economy related to its convergence to economically developed European countries. The model in its current form is able to capture trends in relative prices, ensure convergence to perceived medium term expenditure shares, cope with significant <b>under-capitalisation</b> of the economy and take into account imperfect substitutability between old and new capital. Besides these features the model exhibits real and nominal rigidities that are fully in line with the recent advances of the New Open Economy Macroeconomics literature...|$|E
40|$|Starting in 1976, the Quebec provincial {{government}} has introduced several programs and organisations {{with the objective}} of raising equity capital for companies; the Societes de developpement de l'entreprise quebecoise (SODEQ) were followed by the availability of the 'developing company' category under the QSSP and then by the Fonds de Solidarite (FTQ). These programs were instigated in an attempt to diminish the 'small business <b>under-capitalisation</b> problem'. To attain this and encourage Quebec residents to invest more in equity securities, the government chose tax incentives. Nevertheless, unlike most tax incentive programs, these were not neutral; by changing the risk-return relationship of securities, the government provoked a redistribution of the savings of Quebec investors. In this study, we evaluate the effect of this redistribution on the wealth of investors and demonstrate that these investments had a very low return, even if the resulting deductions and credits are considered. In fact, the total cost of these programs for investors adds up to $ 200 millions. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a mid-term review Phase III of the Bunda College Capacity Building Programme (BCDP) in Malawi. The efforts during the previous phases are bearing fruit. Bunda College of Agriculture has matured as an institution and acquired a new degree of self-confidence. While institutional stability and functionality have improved concerns persist about sustainability in the absence of donor funding. Major strides have been made in improving the infrastructure. A new research and consultancy policy has been adopted. Through consultancies knowledge and technological skills are conveyed to a wider constituency. Consultancies are also a source of revenue for the College and provide supplementary income for academic staff, which serves as a retention mechanism. The ambition of Bunda College to transform itself from a constituent college of University of Malawi to a fully-fledged university through a merger of three existing institutions of higher learning in the Lilongwe area has not materialised. The College has also failed to establish an endowment fund which is worth revisiting. Bunda Farm was ‘commercialised’ in May 2005 as a limited liability company. It was previously a financial drain on the College and appeared to be on a recovery path. The Farm does not have title deed to the land, which is leased on a yearly basis from Unima as the formal custodian. Hence, land cannot be used as collateral and the government is unwilling to provide a guarantee, and credit institutions are, therefore, reluctant to extend loans. This predicament hampers the farm’s profitability and the prospects of Bunda College earning a sizable income. It is urgent that a solution be found to the <b>under-capitalisation</b> of Bunda Farm Ltd. Bunda has no systematic maintenance plan; repairs and maintenance measures are taken largely on an ad hoc basis as and when money is available. A comprehensive maintenance plan for all assets is urgently needed. Future priorities otherwise include library support; information and communication technology (especially improved Internet access for students); and collaboration with sister institutions in the region and beyond...|$|E
