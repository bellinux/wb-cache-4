5|$|Due {{to popular}} demand from citizens, Ben restarts the youth {{basketball}} league, although {{with only two}} teams. They are coached by Ron (Nick Offerman), who is extremely strict and disciplined with his players, and Andy (Chris Pratt), who is very laid back and lets his kids go out of control. Tom (Aziz Ansari), who referees the game, becomes jealous when his ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives to support Ron. Tom insists he is happy with his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) and does not mind that Wendy is dating Ron. However, Tom repeatedly calls false fouls against Ron's players <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them are benched. When Ron and Wendy get angry, Tom ejects them from the games and declares it a forfeit, which concerns Lucy.|$|E
5|$|Calling {{a correct}} letter earns the value before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E

25|$|Two {{events were}} of {{fundamental}} {{importance to the}} development of a unique, Byzantine art. First, the Edict of Milan, issued by the emperors Constantine I and Licinius in 313, allowed for public Christian worship, and led {{to the development of}} a monumental, Christian art. Second, the dedication of Constantinople in 330 created a great new artistic centre for the eastern half of the Empire, and a specifically Christian one. Other artistic traditions flourished in rival cities such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Rome, but it was not <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these cities had fallen - the first two to the Arabs and Rome to the Goths - that Constantinople established its supremacy.|$|E
25|$|The process uses a {{milling cutter}} with a {{cross-section}} that is slightly smaller than the final cross-section of the cut; {{it has the same}} diameter as the worm. The cutter is then angled to the gashing angle. The gashing angle is calculated from the lead and pitch diameter of the worm; often tables are available with the gashing angles for common diameters and leads. The cutter is centered over the blank and then plunged into it to the proper depth. The cutter is finally withdrawn and the blank indexed to the next tooth space and cut. This is repeated <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the tooth spaces have been cut.|$|E

25|$|Some common metals oxidize {{extremely}} {{rapidly in}} air. Titanium and aluminium oxidize instantaneously {{in contact with}} the oxygen in the air. These metals form an extremely thin layer of oxidized metal on the surface which bonds with the underlying metal. This thin layer of oxide protects the underlying layers of the metal from the air preventing the entire metal from oxidizing. These metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. Iron, in contrast, has an oxide that forms in air and water, called rust, that does not bond with the iron and therefore does not stop the further oxidation of the iron. Thus iron left exposed to air and water will continue to rust <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the iron is oxided.|$|E
25|$|Experimentally, {{the phase}} lines are {{relatively}} easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See Gibbs' phase rule. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging {{the right amount of}} water and applying heat, the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the water has condensed.|$|E

25|$|When {{a player}} owns {{all of the}} {{properties}} in a color group {{and none of them}} are mortgaged, they may develop them during their turn or in between other player's turns. Development involves buying miniature houses or hotels from the bank and placing them on the property spaces, and must be done uniformly across the group. That is, a second house cannot be built on any property within a group <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them have one house. Once the player owns an entire group, they can collect double rent for any undeveloped properties within it. Although houses and hotels cannot be built on railroads or utilities, the given rent also increases if a player owns more than one of either type. If there is more demand for houses to be built than what remains in the bank, then a housing auction is conducted to determine who will get to purchase each house.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners {{directed}} from Bleiburg to {{the town}} of Slovenj Gradec were joined by a large number of refugees that were stuck on the Dravograd-Slovenj Gradec road. Several transit camps were set in the town where prisoners were placed and sorted. Around 1,500 were killed in the nearby village of Žančani. The prisoners were only briefly held in Slovenj Gradec, mostly a day, before they continued their way to Celje. Anyone who stepped out of the column to take a rest or drink water was shot. Those that were too exhausted to continue the march were also shot. In Celje, most of the prisoners were placed in a football yard {{on the outskirts of the}} city. The command of the 11th Krajina Division of the 1st Army reported on 17 May that they received 30,000 prisoners. Anti-tank trenches near the Sava River and in the area of Bukovžlak were used for executions. Prisoners were killed in various ways; on one occasion around 100-200 were locked in an enclosed water reservoir. Water was then slowly released <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them drowned.|$|E
25|$|Bell Canada usage-based billing: On October 28, 2010, the CRTC {{handed down}} its final {{decision}} on how wholesale customers can be billed by large network owners. Under the plan which starts within 90 days, Bell {{will be able to}} charge wholesale service providers a flat monthly fee to connect to its network, and for a set monthly usage limit per each ISP customer the ISP has. Beyond that set limit, individual users will be charged per gigabyte, depending on the speed of their connections. Customers using the fastest connections of five megabits per second, for example, will have a monthly allotment of 60 GB, beyond which Bell will charge $1.12 per GB to a maximum of $22.50. If a customer uses more than 300 GB a month, Bell will also be able to implement an additional charge of 75 cents per gigabyte. In May 2010, the CRTC ruled that Bell could not implement its usage-based billing system <b>until</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its own retail customers had been moved off older, unlimited downloading plans. The requirement would have meant that Bell would have to move its oldest and most loyal customers. The CRTC also added that Bell would be required to offer to wholesale ISPs the same usage insurance plan it sells to retail customers. Bell appealed both requirements, citing that the rules do not apply to cable companies and that they constituted proactive rate regulation by the CRTC, which goes against government official policy direction that the regulator only intervene in markets after a competitive problem has been proven. In Thursday's decision, the CRTC rescinded both requirements, thereby giving Bell the go-ahead to implement usage-based billing. This ruling according to Teksavvy handcuffs the competitive market. This has been asked by Stephen Harper and Parliament to have the decision reviewed. According to a tweet by Industry Minister Tony Clement, unless the CRTC reverses this decision, the government will use its override power to reverse the decision.|$|E
