5|$|A {{total of}} 138pieces of {{equipment}} were used on Syro, including synthesisers, samplers, sequencers, processing units, MIDI interfaces, drum machines, vocoders, graphic equalisers and mixing desks.

50|$|Purpose and {{character}} of the use, including whether the <b>use</b> <b>is</b> of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes: Nonprofit educational and noncommercial <b>uses</b> <b>are</b> more likely to <b>be</b> fair <b>use.</b> This {{does not mean that}} all nonprofit education and noncommercial <b>uses</b> <b>are</b> fair <b>use</b> or that all commercial <b>uses</b> <b>are</b> not fair. Instead, courts will balance the purpose {{and character}} of the use against the other factors below. Additionally, “transformative” <b>uses</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be considered fair. Transformative <b>uses</b> <b>are</b> those that add something new, with a further purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.|$|R

5|$|A 2016 {{analysis}} of archaeological finds from Southwark in London, {{the site of}} the ancient Roman city Londinium in Roman Britain, suggests that two or three skeletons from a sample of twenty-two dating to the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD are of Asian ancestry, and possibly of Chinese descent. The assertion is based on forensics and the {{analysis of}} skeletal facial features. The discovery has been presented by Dr Rebecca Redfern, curator of human osteology at the Museum of London. No DNA analysis has yet been done, the skull and tooth samples available offer only fragmentary pieces of evidence, and the samples that were <b>used</b> <b>were</b> compared with the morphology of modern populations, not ancient ones.|$|E
5|$|As Lennon hated doing {{a second}} take to double his vocals, Ken Townsend, the studio's {{technical}} manager, developed an alternative form of double-tracking called artificial double tracking (ADT) system, taking the {{signal from the}} sync head of one tape machine and delaying it slightly through a second tape machine. The two tape machines <b>used</b> <b>were</b> not driven by mains electricity, but from a separate generator which put out a particular frequency, the same for both, thereby keeping them locked together. By altering the speed and frequencies, he could create various effects, which the Beatles used throughout the recording of Revolver. Lennon's vocal is double-tracked on the first three verses of the song: {{the effect of the}} Leslie cabinet can be heard after the (backwards) guitar solo.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the capture of Jenin, all the main direct {{northern}} routes across the Esdrealon Plain, which the retreating Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies could have <b>used,</b> <b>were</b> now held by the Desert Mounted Corps. The 4th Cavalry Division controlled the Beisan area on {{the eastern edge of the}} plain after they captured both Afulah and Beisan, while the 5th Cavalry Division garrisoned the Afulah and Nazareth areas in the center and to the north, with the Australian Mounted Division holding Jenin in the south and patrolling the surrounding area.|$|E

Similar to fair use, any such free <b>use</b> <b>was</b> only allowed if it didn't infringe upon the normal exploitation of the work or the legitimate interests of the author. Compulsory licenses were abolished altogether.|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, a {{primitive}} form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, Étienne Boileau's Livre des métiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments <b>used</b> <b>were</b> further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From {{the start of}} the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.|$|E
5|$|Digidesign {{was working}} on {{expanding}} ProTools from a single track to multitracking and {{it was hoped that}} as many as 48 digital tracks could be synced and used to record. The computers <b>used</b> <b>were</b> mostly Apple Quadra 400/500 models and with a great effort by all, it was soon evident that magnetic tape would have to be used.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{began on}} October 4, 2004 and {{continued}} until October 12. Despite the desert locations, all filming {{took place on}} soundstages. These represented a variety of places throughout the Vulcan desert-like Forge. The remaining sets <b>used</b> <b>were</b> either standing sets, or those which had been constructed for the previous two episodes. The exceptions to that were two sets to represent scenes on board Commander Shran's Andorian vessel. The Andorian bridge set, which had been used previously in the series, had a single wall brought out of storage in order to appear as a backdrop for Shran when he appears on the Enterprise viewscreen. The Andorian brig was built specifically for this episode for scenes with Shran and Soval.|$|E
5|$|One {{specific}} {{failure in}} the massive operation was the critical lack of transport aircraft for the operation, an unsolved flaw that had dogged every large-scale airborne operation the Allies had conducted. In the original planning for Varsity, an extra airborne division, the 13th, had been included; however, a lack of transport aircraft to drop this division led to it being excluded from the final plan. Thus, the unsolved problem of a shortage of transport aircraft meant {{that a third of}} the planned troops to be <b>used</b> <b>were</b> discarded, weakening the fighting power of the airborne formation. In the event, the airborne troops actually employed were sufficient to overwhelm the defenders.|$|E
5|$|The Opies {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} use of truce terms throughout England, Scotland and Wales in the 1950s and published their results in a book called The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren. They found truce terms varied according to geographical location, with the exception of pax. In some places, more than one term was current and often four or five were known, although usually only one term predominated. Schools bordering two linguistic regions honoured both. The words used in urban areas were often at odds with words used in the surrounding countryside. The Opies recorded around 45 truce terms plus variations. The most widely <b>used</b> <b>were</b> barley, fainites, kings, crosses, keys, skinch, cree and scribs.|$|E

Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Paul Giamatti, Lupita Nyong'o, Sarah Paulson, Brad Pitt, and Alfre Woodard are all featured in supporting roles. Principal photography took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, from June 27 to August 13, 2012.

5|$|The {{manuscript}} today comprises 340 folios and, since 1953, {{has been}} bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum, and the unprecedentedly elaborate ornamentation that covers them includes ten full-page illustrations and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures and mark the furthest {{extension of the}} anti-classical and energetic qualities of Insular art. The Insular majuscule script of the text itself {{appears to be the}} work of at least three different scribes.

5|$|The signals <b>used</b> <b>were</b> of {{the ancient}} disc and {{crossbar}} type, installed when the line opened and never modified. They remained in use up to the line's closure in 1898.

5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves <b>used</b> <b>were</b> of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
