Its thesis is that commonhold is not always superior to RMC Leasehold; that, in several respects, RMC Leasehold may be preferable; and that the two models of ownership should therefore continue to co-exist. It argues that the Aldridge Committee in 1987 ignored the existence of RMC Leasehold, and that therefore its commonhold proposals did not benefit from experience of it. It emphasised the 'wasting asset' deficiency of leasehold, and overlooked the 'mismatch' between the ground landlord's financial stake and its powers, an imbalance which may be advantageous when the leaseholders collectively constitute the landlord. Commonhold and RMC Leasehold are compared, focussing on themes such as the tenurial aspect: how far commonhold can deliver freehold ownership as it is generally understood, {{and the implications of}} its limitations on the control of dispositions; how negative and positive obligations may be enforced within commonhold and RMC Leasehold developments, both between the body corporate and flat-owners and between flat-owners inter se; the levying and status of service charge funds and their commonhold equivalents; how leases and the Commonhold Community Statement may be varied; and the position of the flat-owners if the body corporate becomes insolvent or a majority wishes to sell for redevelopment. The study concludes that, although the inapplicability of forfeiture can be seen as making the <b>unit-holder</b> more secure, the leaseholder has the advantage, both on insolvency, and where the majority wishes a sale; that it is less likely that an RMC Leasehold development will change its character; and that RMC Leasehold may, therefore, be more appropriate for flat-owners who prefer to accept the restrictions inherent in a more regulated community.

By using 39 openend unit trust funds, customer service and board structure variables are {{found to have a}} significant effect in explaining the variations of ISC. Financial performance variables do not seem to have any influence on the level of ISC charged to the <b>unit-holders.</b> Our results also showed that funds which charged higher ISC do not necessarily provide higher returns to investors. Furthermore, there are unit trust funds that are having an initial service charge beyond the maximum 10...|$|R

40|$|Income trusts {{are rapidly}} {{emerging}} as a key force in Canadian capital markets and their unit market capitalisation exceeded 300 billion Canadian dollars by early 2008. One of the peculiarities of income trusts is that GAAP-derived measures, such as earnings, are replaced by non-GAAP measures, such as distributable income, as performance benchmarks. Hence, the need to pay investors a stable distribution motivates income trust managers to engage in distribution-based earnings management. Two research questions are addressed. Firstly, do income trusts use discretionary accruals to smooth EBITDA and, presumably, cash distributions to <b>unit-holders?</b> Secondly, do investors see through EBITDA smoothing? Our findings document that the EBITDA target deviation influences an income trust's accruals behaviour. Consistent with prior studies in dividend-focused environments, our results also suggest that investors may value positively discretionary accruals if they allow income trusts to maintain their cash distributions. cash distributions; earnings management; income smoothing; income trusts; non-GAAP measures; performance measures; quality; value relevance; organisational structure; Canada; capital markets; discretionary accruals. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to systematizing of risk {{connected}} with investing in units of open-end and specialised open-end investment funds. There are two main categories of risk in investment funds: risk connected with fund's investment policy and risk resulting from holding units. The most important types of investment risk are: market risk, credit risk, interest rates risk, liquidity risk, macroeconomic risk, inflation risk, currency risk, event risk and political risk. <b>Unit-holders</b> are also taken to different types of risk resulting from participation in investment fund, for example risk of unattainable expected rate of return from units, risk connected with special situations (such as takeover of the management of an investment fund, mergers funds, transformation, dissolution and liquidation of an investment fund, changing of investment policy) and risk of unstable legislation.

40|$|National laws {{governing}} {{collective investment undertakings}} were updated {{as a result of}} European secondary law modernization with a view to approximating the conditions of competition between those undertakings at Community level, {{while at the same time}} ensuring more effective and more uniform protection for <b>unit-holders.</b> Such coordination intended to facilitate the removal of the restrictions on the free movement of units of UCITS in the internal market. For the purposes of internal regulation UCITS means an undertaking: (a) with the sole object of collective investment in transferable securities or in other liquid financial assets of capital raised from the public and which operate on the principle of risk-spreading; and (b) with units which are, at the request of holders, repurchased or redeemed, directly or indirectly, out of those undertakings’ assets. The UCITS may be constituted in accordance with contract law (as common funds managed by management companies), trust law (as unit trusts), or statute (as investment companies). Key investor information should be provided as a specific document to investors, before the subscription of the UCITS, in order to help them to reach informed investment decisions.
