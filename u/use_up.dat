5|$|Chariots {{existed in}} the Minoan civilization, as they were {{inventoried}} on storage lists from Knossos in Crete, dating to around 1450 BC. Chariots were also used in China {{as far back as}} the Shang Dynasty (c.16001050 BC), where they appear in burials. The high point of chariot use in China was in the Spring and Autumn period (770476 BC), although they continued in <b>use</b> <b>up</b> until the 2nd century BC.|$|E
5|$|The signals {{used were}} of the ancient disc and {{crossbar}} type, installed when the line opened and never modified. They remained in <b>use</b> <b>up</b> to the line's closure in 1898. Only one locomotive {{was used in the}} Syndicate period so signals were not required. By 1913 some had fallen down but others remained in working order.|$|E

5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor Artificial Intelligence (AI) that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, <b>use</b> <b>up</b> their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.|$|E
5|$|ConnDOT {{plans call}} for the Kawasaki M8 to replace {{most or all of}} the {{locomotives}} and coaches currently in service on Shore Line East in 2018. ConnDOT has proposed to <b>use</b> <b>up</b> to 32 M8's in SLE service as far as Old Saybrook; the step-fitted diesel equipment will then be used on the Hartford Line and for New London / Mystic / Westerly service. Limited direct service from Grand Central Terminal to Old Saybrook may be added once the M8s are in service. Testing of M8 cars on the Shore Line East route began in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|During matches, wrestlers have {{a health}} meter that drains as they perform special moves, and {{gradually}} refills {{when they are}} not attacking. Different moves <b>use</b> <b>up</b> different amounts of energy, and certain characters can win any match by repeatedly using a particularly damaging move that does not require much energy. Several different power-ups are also available in the game, including a donut that increases speed, bowling pins that can be used as clubs, and bubble gum that slows players down.|$|E

When a player has <b>used</b> <b>up</b> all of their thinking time periods, a final byōyomi time control of 30 seconds per move begins.

5|$|In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, {{vegetarian}} borscht {{served with}} sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as , is considered an essential dish during the Passover period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of Passover borscht used to {{provide an opportunity to}} <b>use</b> <b>up</b> the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended {{with sour cream}} is also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.|$|E
5|$|Post-war {{growth in}} {{newspaper}} readership prompted an even larger, $3.5 million expansion in 1964 to fit eight-unit presses {{and a new}} three-story press room {{to the west of}} the printing plant. Four years later, an even larger $6 million addition would <b>use</b> <b>up</b> the last of the surface parking lots on the property's block, building a two-story newsroom clad in reinforced concrete instead of the limestone used on the 1931 building; a skybridge was built across an alley to connect to the older office building. In 1979, the new newsroom was renovated and modernized and a nearby alley was filled and enclosed.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{script was}} in <b>use</b> <b>up</b> {{to the arrival}} of the Europeans, its use peaking during the Classic Period. In excess of 10,000 {{individual}} texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics. The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name amatl used to produce codices. The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest. The knowledge was subsequently lost, {{as a result of the}} impact of the conquest on Maya society.|$|E

5|$|The furnace {{continued}} in anemic health until the Panic of 1907. As {{a result of}} that crisis, it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909. It was operated in 1910 largely to <b>use</b> <b>up</b> its inventory of local ore, and went out of blast on January 23, 1911. Bellefonte Furnace had closed in December. The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary, but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate, and no buyer willing to operate them could be found. Leftover pig iron and furnace slag from Nittany Furnace were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912–1913. The furnace and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and the furnace demolished. The furnace site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to previous installments, focusing on combo-based combat with the player's main weapon—the Blades of Exile—and secondary weapons acquired during the game. It uses quick time events, where the player acts in a timed sequence to defeat strong enemies and bosses. The player can <b>use</b> <b>up</b> to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options, and the game features puzzles and platforming elements. Compared with previous installments, God of War III offers a revamped magic system, more onscreen enemies, new camera angles, and downloadable content.|$|E

It features quick time events that require the player to complete game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses. The player can <b>use</b> <b>up</b> to three magical attacks as alternative combat options. The game also features puzzles and platforming elements. The control setup was reconfigured for the PSP, as it has fewer buttons than the PlayStation 2's controller. Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls received praise from critics.|$|E

5|$|The race {{itself was}} much like its Greek counterpart, {{although}} there were usually 24 races every day that, during the fourth century, took place on 66 days each year. However, a race consisted of only 7 laps (and later 5 laps, so {{that there could be}} even more races per day), instead of the 12 laps of the Greek race. The Roman style was also more money-oriented; racers were professionals and there was widespread betting among spectators. There were four-horse chariots (quadrigae) and two-horse chariots (bigae), but the four-horse races were more important. In rare cases, if a driver wanted to show off his skill, he could <b>use</b> <b>up</b> to 10 horses, although this was extremely impractical.|$|E

5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop {{in order to have}} a chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards until late in the drive, forcing Virginia Tech to <b>use</b> <b>up</b> valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts χ is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} {{set in the}} universe of Kingdom Hearts which includes original characters and locations as well as ones from Disney and Final Fantasy media properties. Before beginning, players create their own character. Players can customize the gender, hair, and clothing, and choose accessories themed after both Square Enix and Disney universes present in the Kingdom Hearts series. Story missions are unlocked by the player. After {{a certain amount of}} the available content has been completed, new story missions become available. Players navigate their surroundings by dragging their cursor across the screen. Players navigate different worlds, defeating monsters known as the Heartless. The base game is free to play, with optional microtransactions. Actions <b>use</b> <b>up</b> AP, which can be replenished by either waiting or by using potions, which can be earned or bought. Rare items such as special cards can also be purchased. Alongside the single-player mode, there is a multiplayer mode where teams of players take on Raid Bosses, gigantic Heartless with high HP.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} a pair of blades {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. Called Athena's Blades (also known as the Blades of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's Blades and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at maximum power), the blade's power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to <b>use</b> <b>up</b> to four magical abilities, such as Typhon's Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The special ability Rage of the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by Rage of the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does not have to be full in order to use the ability, and can be switched on and off at will.|$|E
