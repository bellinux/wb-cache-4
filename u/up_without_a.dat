5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Ciaran Donnelly, who also directed the previous episode. Mike Bullen visited Sydney in March 2001 to scout for locations. He was followed in May by producer Spencer Campbell and production designer Chris Truelove, who made preliminary casting decisions and scouted more locations. They finalised the arrangements in July. Unusually, the production schedule was drawn <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> final script in place. This caused complications as Campbell allocated too much time for filming in Sydney and not enough in Manchester. As a result, some scenes set in Sydney were filmed in Manchester; the scene where the characters arrive at Sydney Airport was filmed in a hall at the University of Manchester. Campbell rationalised that viewers {{who had never been}} to Sydney {{would not be able to}} tell the difference.|$|E

25|$|Peter Munch was {{an illegitimate}} child, growing <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> {{father in a}} small provincial town. The family was quite poor, and {{from an early age}} he had to work to help out his mother.

To his untrained eye, it seemed tolerably massive and impregnable, but Spike had evidently known how to open it without much difficulty.

25|$|Between 1175 and 1181 Henry {{was charged}} with several accusations, such as violating the honour of the realm (honor imperii), breach of the peace, and treason. Because by {{following}} the summons to the Hoftag, Henry would've acknowledge the charges as rightful, he refused all of them. In 1181 he was ultimately stripped of his titles. Unwilling to give <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> fight, Henry already had dealt the first blow in 1180 against the city of Goslar, which he had coveted for several years already. During the following war, Henry's domestic policy and the treatment of his vassals proved fatal, and his power quickly crumbled.|$|E
25|$|Mary Miles Minter was {{a former}} child star and teen screen idol, whose career had been guided by Taylor. Minter, who had grown <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> father, was only three years older than the {{daughter}} Taylor had abandoned in New York. Love letters from Minter were found in Taylor’s bungalow. Based upon these, the reporters alleged that a sexual relationship between the 49-year-old Taylor and 19-year-old Minter had started when she was 17. Robert Giroux and King Vidor, however, disputed this allegation. Citing Minter's own statements, both believed that her love for Taylor was unrequited. Taylor had often declined to see Minter and had described himself as too old for her.|$|E
25|$|After this, Dias' career took a {{turn for}} the worse. He only passed 50 in Tests once again – in a drawn Test with India were 1096 runs were scored for the fall of only 17 wickets – and poor form saw him being dropped from the ODI side after the first match in the 1987 cricket World Cup, where he scored 1. He {{returned}} for the last match of the 1987 cricket World Cup, the team having played and lost four matches without him, and while his team-mates failed to pass 40 he recorded 80 in his last international innings. However, the target of 219 was all too small, and Sri Lanka ended <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> single victory in that World Cup.|$|E

25|$|Maria Pavlovana {{childhood}} {{was spent in}} splendor. Her early memories were of magnificent palaces and lazy country estates populated by armies of servants. Until she was six, Maria spoke Russian badly as all of her governesses and the immediate family spoke English. Later she had another governess, Mademoiselle Hélène who taught her French and stayed with her until her marriage. At {{the age of seven}} she traveled in her own personal railway car accompanied by her governess to visit Germany and France. On Sundays, she and her brother were allowed to play with children from aristocratic families. Growing <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> mother and with a frequently absent father, Grand Duchess Maria and her brother Dimitri became very close, relying on each other for affection and companionship.|$|E
25|$|On 22 August, the 14th (Light) Division {{captured}} Inverness Copse {{and then}} lost it to a German methodical counter-attack (Gegenangriff) on 24 August. A tank–infantry attack failed on 27 August, when the tanks bogged down and another attempt was cancelled on 31 August. The sodden ground hampered mobility made tank operations almost impossible and smothered shell explosions. Clouds and fog reduced {{communication between the}} front line and rear and impeded liaison by British artillery and aircraft. Despite considerable changes of tactics by the British infantry, the German defenders, who had to endure the same exhausting and morale-sapping conditions, held on at Inverness Copse and Glencorse Wood. Some British prisoners of war gave <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> fight and were openly bitter at their costly failures but the defensive success of the 4th Army was more costly in casualties than the Germans could bear.|$|E
25|$|Wimbledon House, {{which the}} Duchess had stood to inherit {{according}} to her grandmother's plan, passed instead to her brother John, the favourite grandson. In 1961, her brother John's descendant, Viscount Althorp, became {{the father of a}} daughter whose name was not chosen until a week after the birth. The infant was christened Diana, after the Duchess of Bedford. Unlike her ancestor, the 20th-century Lady Diana Spencer married her Prince of Wales, Charles, in 1981. She died in 1997, aged 36, a year after their divorce. Victoria Massey, biographer of the earlier Lady Diana Spencer, noted the similarities between the lives of the two namesakes: as children, they both lived at Althorp and socialised with royalty; both grew <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> mother from the age of six; both were proposed as a bride for a Prince of Wales; both had an accident during their first pregnancy; and both died unexpectedly at a young age.|$|E

Today St James's Street contains several of London's best-known gentlemen's clubs, such as Brooks's, the Carlton Club and White's, some exclusive shops and various offices. A {{series of small}} side streets on its western side lead to some extremely expensive properties overlooking Green Park, including Spencer House and the Royal Over-Seas League {{at the end of}} Park Place.|$|R
25|$|Because of poor planning, {{the coup}} leaders {{had failed to}} provide {{provisions}} for the troops on Lapangan Merdeka, who were becoming hot and thirsty. They were {{under the impression that}} they were guarding the president in the palace. Over the course of the afternoon, Suharto persuaded both battalions to give <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> fight, first the Brawijaya battalion, who came to Kostrad HQ, then the Diponegoro troops, which withdrew to Halim. His troops gave Untung's forces inside the radio station an ultimatum and they also withdrew. By 7pm Suharto was in control of all the installations previously held by 30 September Movement's forces. Now joined by Nasution, at 9pm he announced over the radio that he was now in command of the Army and that he would destroy the counter-revolutionary forces and save Sukarno. He then issued another ultimatum, this time to the troops at Halim. Later that evening, Sukarno left Halim and arrived in Bogor, where there was another presidential palace.|$|E
25|$|John Grahame Douglas Clark {{was born}} on 28 July 1907. He was the eldest son of Maude Ethel Grahame Clark (née Shaw) and Charles Douglas Clark, the latter being a {{stockbroker}} and a reserve officer in the British Army. The family were upper middle-class and moderately prosperous. They lived {{in the village of}} Shortlands, near to Bromley in West Kent. At the outbreak of the First World War, Charles Clark joined the West Kent Regiment and was sent to fight overseas. He survived the war, but during his return to Britain in 1919 succumbed to the influenza pandemic and died mid-journey. Grahame Clark grew <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> father, instead being raised by his mother and an uncle for whom he had great affection. According to the available evidence, Clark's childhood was a happy one. His family moved to Seaford, a coastal town {{on the edge of the}} Sussex Downs, with the young Clark developing a fascination with the prehistoric flint tools that he collected on the Downs.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Nero {{appointed}} general Vespasian, {{instead of}} Gallus {{to crush the}} rebellion. Vespasian, along with legions X Fretensis and V Macedonica, landed at Ptolemais in April 67. There he was joined by his son Titus, who arrived from Alexandria {{at the head of}} Legio XV Apollinaris, {{as well as by the}} armies of various local allies including that of king Agrippa II. Fielding more than 60,000 soldiers, Vespasian began operations by subjugating Galilee. Judean rebels in Galilee were divided into two camps, with forces loyal to the central government in Jerusalem commanded by Josephus and representing the wealthy and the priesthood classes, whereas local Zealot militias were largely packed with the poor fishermen, farmers and refugees from Roman Syria. Many towns associated with Jewish elite gave <b>up</b> <b>without</b> <b>a</b> fight - including Sepphoris and Tiberias, although others had to be taken by force. Of these, Josephus provides detailed accounts of the sieges of Yodfat and Gamla; Gischala, the stronghold of Zealots, was also taken by force, as Zealot leaders abandoned it in the midst of the siege, heading with the bulk of their force for Jerusalem.|$|E

[...] Though such statements reflected the fact that the Grand Fleet had not won the great battle its officers had sought, the peaceful surrender of the High Seas Fleet served as testimony to the strength the Grand Fleet had maintained continuously through four years of war.|$|E
