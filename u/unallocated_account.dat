40|$|INITIATIVE STATUTE. Establishes Habitat Conservation Fund. Transfers 30 {{million to}} Fund {{annually}} from existing environmental funds and General Fund. Monies from Fund appropriated to Wildlife Conservation Board; Coastal, Tahoe, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancies; {{state and local}} parks programs. Funds to be used principally for acquisition of deer and mountain lion habitat; rare and endangered species habitat. Remaining funding for wetlands; riparian and aquatic habitat: open space; other environmental purposes. Prohibits taking of mountain lions unless for protection of life, livestock or other property. Permit for taking required, but prohibits use of poison, leg-hold or metal-jawed traps and snares. Summary of Legislative Analyst 2 ̆ 7 s estimate of net {{state and local government}} fiscal impact: For 1990 - 91, approximately IR million from <b>Unallocated</b> <b>Account</b> in Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund and 12 million from General Fund will be transferred to the Habitat Conservation Fund, unless Legislature makes transfers from other funds. In subsequent years, General Fund transfers may increase if sales of cigarettes and tobacco products decline. Estimated annual costs of managing acquired properties could exceed 1 million, supported by sources other than Habitat Conservation Fund...|$|E
40|$|WILDLIFE PROTECTION. INITIATIVE STATUTE. Establishes Habitat Conservation Fund. Transfers 30 {{million to}} Fund {{annually}} from existing environmental funds and General Fund.

Funds to be used principally for acquisition of deer and mountain lion habitat; rare and endangered species habitat.

Permit for taking required, but prohibits use of poison, leg-hold or metal-jawed traps and snares. Summary of estimate by Legislative Analyst and Director of Finance of fiscal impact on state and local governments: For 1990 - 91, the measure will result in expenditures of approximately 15 million from the <b>Unallocated</b> <b>Account</b> in Cigarette and Tobacco Products Surtax Fund. This amount will likely decrease in subsequent years. The measure 2 ̆ 7 s General Fund costs for 1990 - 91 will be approximately 15 million. This sum {{is likely to increase}} in subsequent years. Extent of increase dependent on how much revenue is transferred to the Habitat Conservation Fund from various designated funds other than General Fund. Annual administrative costs estimated at up to 1. 35 million. Operation and management of habitat properties after acquisition will possibly cost 1 million or more annually...|$|E
25|$|Typically, bullion banks only deal in {{quantities}} of 1000 ounces {{or more in}} either allocated or <b>unallocated</b> <b>accounts.</b> For private investors, vaulted gold offers private individuals to obtain ownership in professionally vaulted gold starting from minimum investment requirements of several thousand U.S.-dollars or denominations as low as one gram.|$|R
50|$|The total {{quantity}} of unallocated gold {{is estimated to}} be 15,000 tonnes at the end of 2008 which supports the 2,134 tonnes on average of spot gold trade through London every day representing 14.2% of the pool. This compares to average daily turnover in UK equities of between 0.34% and 0.63% for the 12 months ending September 2009. While members of the LBMA provide no information on the backing for unallocated gold the improbably high turnover is suggestive they are operating a fractional reserve system where <b>unallocated</b> <b>accounts</b> are only partially backed by physical gold. Similarly to a bank run this makes LBMA <b>unallocated</b> gold <b>accounts</b> susceptible to loss if a sufficient number of market participants request delivery of physical bullion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Unallocated</b> <b>accounts</b> {{represent}} {{the most popular}} way of trading, settling and holding gold, silver, platinum and palladium. Transactions may be settled by credits or debits to the account while the balance represents the indebtedness between the two parties. Credit balances on the account do not entitle the creditor to specific bars of gold or silver or plates or ingots of platinum or palladium but are backed by the general stock of the precious metal dealer with whom the account is held. The client in this scenario is an unsecured creditor.|$|R
50|$|Starting back in 2007, silver analyst Ted Butler voiced {{concerns}} over <b>unallocated</b> <b>accounts,</b> including the Kitco Pool. In March, 2014 a blogger did some investigating {{and discovered that}} the Kitco Pool is no longer 100% backed by physical precious metals, not properly segregated from Kitco's own assets ($25 million of the Kitco Pool was seized by Revenue Quebec in June, 2011), and Kitco Pool customers are not considered creditors in the ongoing CCAA proceedings. Such changes would be acceptable if customers were made aware of them; however, the changes were made surreptitiously. Therefore, some people are investing based on past reassurances without knowing {{the truth about the}} Kitco Pool.|$|R
5000|$|Kitco offers <b>unallocated</b> {{precious}} metals <b>accounts,</b> called [...] "Kitco Pool." [...] Normally, <b>unallocated</b> {{precious metals}} <b>account</b> are like [...] "IOU"s and {{backed by the}} [...] "general stock" [...] of the dealer. In the event of bankruptcy a pool holder would become an unsecured creditor of the company. Kitco addressed these concerns by stating that the Kitco Pool is 100% backed by physical precious metals, segregated from Kitco's own assets and belonging entirely to Kitco Pool customers.|$|R
5000|$|Bullion banks offer {{so-called}} gold accounts. Allocated gold accounts provide {{investors with}} full ownership of vaulted gold, while <b>unallocated</b> gold <b>accounts</b> provide investors only with claims against the provider, {{rather than any}} outright ownership in gold. Typically, bullion banks do not deal in quantities of less than 1000 oz (about U.S $1.7 million [...] ) in either type of account, which means that gold accounts are mainly targeted at institutional or very wealthy private investors.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{types of}} gold [...] "{{accounts}}" [...] are available. Different accounts impose varying types of intermediation between {{the client and}} their gold. One {{of the most important}} differences between accounts is whether the gold is held on an allocated (fully reserved) or unallocated (pooled) basis. <b>Unallocated</b> gold <b>accounts</b> are a form of fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of a}} run on the issuer's gold on deposit. Another major difference is the strength of the account holder's claim on the gold, in the event that the account administrator faces gold-denominated liabilities (due to a short or naked short position in gold for example), asset forfeiture, or bankruptcy.|$|R
50|$|Foreign-exchange {{reserves}} are called reserve {{assets in the}} balance of payments and are located in the capital account. Hence, they are usually {{an important part of the}} international investment position of a country. The {{reserves are}} labeled as reserve assets under assets by functional category. In terms of financial assets classifications, the reserve assets can be classified as Gold bullion, <b>Unallocated</b> gold <b>accounts,</b> Special drawing rights, currency, Reserve position in the IMF, interbank position, other transferable deposits, other deposits, debt securities, loans, equity (listed and unlisted), investment fund shares and financial derivatives, such as forward contracts and options. There is no counterpart for reserve assets in liabilities of the International Investment Position. Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments. In the Central Bank’s Balance Sheet, foreign exchange reserves are assets, along with domestic credit.|$|R
