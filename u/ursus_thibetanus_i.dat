We hypothesized that the Japanese black bear (<b>Ursus</b> <b>thibetanus</b> japonicus) has a metabolic mechanism that efficiently converts carbohydrates into body fat by altering insulin sensitivity during the hyperphagic stage before hibernation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the changes in blood biochemical values and glucose and insulin responses to intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) during the active season (August, early and late November). Four, adult, female bears (5 - 17 years old) were anesthetized with 6 mg/kg TZ (tiletamine HCl and zolazepam HCl) in combination with 0. 1 mg/kg acepromazine maleate. The bears were injected intravenously with glucose (0. 5 g/kg of body mass), and blood samples were obtained before, at, and intermittently after glucose injection. Th...|$|R

It lives in the Himalayas, in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent, Korea, northeastern China, the Russian Far East, the Honshū and Shikoku islands of Japan, and Taiwan. It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), mostly because of deforestation and hunting for its body parts.|$|R

50|$|Although home to {{a smaller}} variety of {{wildlife}} than the surrounding rainforest these pine forests are relatively unspoilt and therefore still important habitat {{for a number of}} species adapted to the rocky heights. When the area was surveyed by the Wildlife Conservation Society in the 1950s mammals of the pine forest included Sumatran serow (Capricornis sumatrensis), sambar (rusa unicolor), Indian muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac), wild boar (Sus scrofa), and Asian black bear (<b>ursus</b> <b>thibetanus)</b> while smaller mammals include Oriental giant squirrels, Indian giant flying squirrel and civets.

50|$|Although {{there are}} only eight living species of bear, they are widespread, {{appearing}} {{in a wide variety}} of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Common characteristics of modern bears include a large body with stocky legs, a long snout, shaggy hair, paws with five nonretractile claws, and a short tail. The Department of National Parks reports that there are Asiatic black bears (<b>Ursus</b> <b>thibetanus)</b> living in the wild in Phitsanulok Province. This bear species has been classified as a vulnerable species, meaning likely to become endangered unless the circumstances threatening its survival and reproduction improve.|$|R
50|$|Asian black bears, {{also known}} as Himalayan bears (Lat.: <b>Ursus</b> <b>thibetanus),</b> in {{northern}} parts of their range, such as Russian province Primorye, China, and both Koreas, prefer spend winter periods in large tree hollows, where females also give birth to cubs. Threats include massive deforestation in these countries, combined with direct poaching of wintering bears—with selective destruction of the best hollow trees. In Russia, attempts (sometimes successful) are made to restore such broken trees. Unfortunately, {{only a small portion}} of all damaged trees can be restored in Primorye, where forests are basically logged without taking to account needs of large fauna.|$|R

The Ussuri brown bear (Ursus arctos) is found in Hokkaidō where it plays an {{important}} role in the culture of the Ainu people. The Asian black bear (<b>Ursus</b> <b>thibetanus)</b> inhabits mountainous areas in Honshū, Kyūshū and Shikoku. Smaller carnivores include the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and Japanese marten (Martes melampus).

The Free the Bears Fund supports animal welfare projects in Cambodia, India, Indonesia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam, working with rescued and confiscated Asian black bear (<b>Ursus</b> <b>thibetanus),</b> Sun bear (Helarctos malayanus), and Sloth bear (Ursus ursinus).

50|$|The Japanese {{black bear}} (<b>Ursus</b> <b>thibetanus</b> japonicus) is a {{subspecies}} of the Asian black bear that lives on three main islands of Japan: Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu. There {{are said to}} be 10,000 black bears on Japan. The population of black bears on Shikoku and Kyushu may be endangered or extinct. There is a high price on bear parts in the black market, which threatens all bear populations in Japan. This particular species of bear are typically smaller with males only reaching 60-120 Kg and females only weighing about 40-100 Kg. Their body length is about 120-140 cm long.|$|R

During {{the course of the}} study, feeding, moving, climbing, resting and playing activities were recorded in three consecutive time periods, representing three phases of acclimatization. The frequency of climbing and moving increased considerably towards the third phase, while feeding decreased. These changes can be attributed to a learning process during acclimatization. Time spent on moving and playing differed significantly among the bears, but not climbing or feeding...|$|R
25|$|Humans are {{the primary}} predators on markhor. Because markhor inhabit very steep and {{inaccessible}} mountainous habitat, several strongholds of markhor populations have been rarely approached by man. Golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) have been reported preying upon young markhor. Among wild carnivores, Himalayan lynx (Felis lynx), leopard cats (Felis bengalensis), snow leopards (Panthera uncia), wolves (Canis lupus), and black bears (<b>Ursus</b> <b>thibetanus)</b> are the main predators of markhor. Because of these threats, the markhor possess keen eyesight and {{a strong sense of}} smell to detect nearby predators. Markhor are very aware of their surroundings and are on high alert for predators. In exposed areas, they are quick to spot and flee from predators.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This study {{examines}} {{the conservation of}} bears in China and compares two distinct cultural attitudes [...] the traditional utilitarian view of animals as resources {{to be used in}} service to humans, and the emerging view that emphasizes welfare and conservation and uses media and citizen activism to highlight and discuss these issues. The main question addressed {{is whether or not the}} traditional utilitarian view of animals is starting to change into a view that incorporates ideas about animal welfare and wildlife conservation.

40|$|The assay of serum leptin {{concentrations}} in the Japanese black bear (<b>Ursus</b> <b>thibetanus</b> japonicus) was tested by canine-leptin-specific sandwich enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A dose-response curve of the bear serum was linear and parallel to the canine leptin standard curve. In mated and unmated bears, the serum leptin concentration was stable at low levels from May to August or September and a gradual increase from September or October, followed by a remarkable increase in late November. We conclude that this method may be useful for measuring bear serum leptin concentrations and that serum leptin concentrations change annually with a peak in late November. イヌレプチン特異的酵素抗体測定法により、ニホンツキノワグマ（以下クマと略）の血清レプチン濃度測定を試みた。交尾群および非交尾群の血清レプチン濃度は、 5 ～ 8 または 9 月に低レベルで推移し、 9 または 10 月から徐々に増加し 11 月下旬に顕著に上昇した。本測定法はクマ血清レプチン濃度測定に有効性が示唆され、レプチン濃度は 11 月下旬にピークを有する明瞭な周年変化を示すことが明らかとなった...|$|R
