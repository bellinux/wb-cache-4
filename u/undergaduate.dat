Unfortunately, the interest to study engineering among young generation does not increase as much as anticipated by the government. Most of the students were reluctant to choose engineering as their first choice and yet some were forced by their parents to choose the engineering programs. Having established as an engineering university, University Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia has identified some approaches to improve the situation and one ofwhich involves its undergraduates as coordinators. As a part of university's generic skills assessment program, a group of 70 engineering <b>Undergaduates</b> had organized alnotivational project called Student's Guided Motivational Program to 395 school students. A study was conducted on thc learning motivation and the interest of school students towards their future career. Pre-survey showed that only 8. 4 % of the students Were interested to become engineers whcreas the rest opted for other careers. However, post-survey conducted at the end of the program had surprisingly recorded the increasing percentage to 67. 8 % students opted for engineer as their future carecr. Thus, this proved the success ofthe program in enhancing the interest of school students towards enginccring education...|$|R

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} test behavioural differnces in the detection of deception arising from investigative interviews conducted in either a first or second language. A two (Cantonese or English) by two (deception or truthfulness) between-subject factorial design was used. Twenty-six postgraduate criminology student observers provide judgments of lying in 20 video-taped interviews of <b>undergaduate</b> subjects randomly assigned to either telling the truth or lying about their opinions on capital punishment. Obervers did less well in identifying liars in their first language but were more successful in identfying liars speaking in a second languate. However, observers made more mistakes with those telling the truth in a second language. The degree that deceivers deployed countermeasures also varied with second language users reporting less ability to control verbal and non-verbal behavioural cues. Deceivers, irrespective of language, found lying required more cognitive resources than {{telling the truth and}} lying in a second languate tends to alter one's facial expression or emotion. Behaviour associated with deception is discussed in the context of bilingual 'code switching' that appears to lessen cognitive load while lying and may be a potential marker of deception. Disbelieving-the-truth mistakes, or 'false positives' are as troublesome as false negatives and require attention in the context of cross-cultural interrogations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} of those activities {{which are based on}} all types of strategies for teaching conversational skills. These strategies are practiced in the form of 17 activities and their effectiveness on the oral language performane of Persian learners has been investigated. The second language learning strategies in this research are dependent on two Kuhn's paradigms and include "learning" and "using" second language. The former consists of recognition and acceptance of materials, distinction from other materials, categorizing them for a better learning, constant involvement with materials, using common memorization methods for rehearsal to improve natural conversation learning. The teacher's Linguistics and Iranology knowledge in choosing teaching materials, producing similarities and differences in two languages, lexical and syntactic categorizations of activities based on the first to the third strategies were implemented in the classroom. Informal gatherings, appropriate assignments of certain tasks like memorizing the dialogues or proverbs were practiced for the fourth and the fifth strategies. These strategies were applied on 19 <b>undergaduate</b> intermediate Persian language learners, with Slav mother tongue in 5 successive semesters from 2011 to 2013. In this research, it was affirmed that there is a positive correlation between using strategic activities with the improvement of converational skill of language learners. That is, the more learners are active in the activities related to strategies, the better they become in the conversational skill...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{algorithmic}} complexity (also sometimes called en-tropy") appeared in 1960 s inbetween {{the theory of}} computation, probability theory and information theory. The idea of A. N. Kolmogorov was to measure {{the amount of information}} in ˛nite objects (and not in random variables, as it is done in classical Shannon information theory). His famous paper [64], published in 1965, explains how this can be done (up to a bounded additive term) using the algorithmic approach. Similar ideas was suggested few years earlier by R. Solomono ¸ (see [163] and his other papers; the historical account and reference can be found in [86]). 1 The motivation of Solomono ¸ was quite di¸erent. He tried to de˛ne the notion of priori probability". Imagine there is some experiment (random process) and we know nothing about its internal structure. Can we say something about the probabilities of di¸erent outcomes in this situation? One can relate this to the complexity measures saying that simple objects have greater a priori probability than complex ones. (Unfortunately, Solomono¸’s work become popular only after Kolmogorov mentioned it in his paper.) In 1965 G. Chaitin (then an 18 -years-old <b>undergaduate</b> student) submitted two papers [19] and [20]; they were published in 1966 and 1969 respectively. In the second paper he proposed the same de˛nition of algorithmic complexity as Kolmogorov. The basic properties of Kolmogorov complexity were established in 1970 s...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{knowledge}} is calling for a new pedagogic discourse in tertiary eduation that draws {{on the importance of}} peer learning and collaborative assessment as a meaningful framework for interdisciplinary studies. The literature highlights the benefits to students of cooperation and collaboration in the classroom, and some research even describes team-based testing and other shared-learning assessment structures. The literature also describes collaborative assessment strategies for academics. However, what seems to be lacking is {{a better understanding of the}} students’ own perspectives on the idea of collaborative assessments, where students “share” grades. With that in mind, and with the growing emphasis on interprofessional practice at AUT, I wanted to know what students thought of the idea of shared-learning environments and collaborative assessments. In particular, my aim was to assess whether or not those attitudes were influenced by either the students’ worldviews (i. e. individualism or collectivism) or their perceptions of academic achievement (i. e. belief that they were obtaining D, C, B or A range grades). A group of 82 AUT <b>undergaduate</b> students taking Social Psychology (a paper without a pre-req that attracts a large number of multi-disciplinary and ethnically-diverse students from across two Faculties) completed a purpose-built 10 -question survey (with six additional demographic questions). (NOTE: AUTEC approval was obtained for the study.) Preliminary analyses indicate that a stronger sense of collectivism positively correlates with more positive attitudes toward collaborative assessments. On the other hand, perceiving themselves to be getting higher grades appears to be negatively correlating with positive attitudes toward collaborative assessments. A full discussion of the descriptive data will be offered at the presentation, in addition to the inferential analyses (still ongoing) and their implications for lecturers and interprofessional pedagogy...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is motivated by}} the development of the world of technology,especially mobile phones that result in intense competition among companies. IM 3 alwaysstrive to provide the best service to consumers through the services they have. So IM 3 managed to become the top brand for the category of Top of Mind simcard in 2014 to 2016. In addition, the total IM 3 users in each year also increased. The aims of {{research is}} to determine the effect of brand awareness, perceivedquality, and brand association towards the brand loyalty of IM 3 user, in partially orsimultaneously through customer satisfaction as an intervening variable. The population ofthis research is all <b>undergaduate</b> students in Diponegoro University who use IM 3. Samplingis done gradually with Multistage Sampling method. Samples obtained on this research were 96 respondents. The data for this research were obtained from questionnaires, literaturestudies, and interview to respondents. Analytical methods used validity test, reliability test,simple linear regression analysis and multiple linear regression analysis, coefficient ofdetermination, significance test (t test) and (f test) and path analysis with SPSS tool. The results of this research showed that the variable of brand awareness (X 1),perceived quality (X 2), brand association (X 3), and customer satisfaction (Z) have a strongeffect on brand loyalty (Y). It {{can be seen from the}} coefficient of multiple correlation that isequal to 0, 769, and F table test equal to 33, 023 bigger than F table. The result of pathanalysis concerning on the influence variable of brand awareness (X 1), perceived quality(X 2), and brand association (X 3) toward the brand loyalty (Y) of IM 3 users through customersatisfaction (Z) as intervening variable is evident. The effect of brand awareness (X 1),perceived quality (X 2), brand association (X 3) toward brand loyalty (Y) of IM 3 users will behigher if through customer satisfaction (Z).

40|$|Abstract only availableOkara is a {{by-product}} of tofu and soymilk manufactures. High in protein, vitamin B group and antioxidants, okara is very nutritious. Preliminary studies demonstrated okara to be a promising prebiotic, compounds that can benefit the host by selectively stimulating the growth of probiotics, which are health-beneficial bacteria. Despite its nutritional benefits, okara use in industry is very limited and mainly restricted to Asian countries due to a significant dificulty in processing because of its high fiber content. This project was conducted {{in order to determine}} if okara could be used as an ingredient in an acceptable fermented product that would promote the growth of probiotics. In order to successfully incorporate the insoluble okara into food products, homogenization is necessary to make it more soluble and dispersible in the food matrix. Three different homogenization methods were utilized: (1) milling using a lab-grade grinder, (2) blending using a lab-grade blender and (3) processing using a home-style KitchenAid® food processor. The growth of the probiotic bacterium, Bifidobacterium longum B 6, was initially determined in MRS broth supplemented with 0. 3 % okara homogenized by the above techniques. Based on the results of that experiment, it was determined that processing was not suitable for homogenizing the okara enough to make it available to the probiotic. Therefore, subsequently the growth of B. longum B 6 was analyzed in blended and milled okara in concentrations of 1 %, 3 %, 5 % and 10 %. After finding that the optimum okara concentration for the growth of B. longum B 6 was 3 %, the growth of other probiotics, including acidophilus ADH, L. acidophilus A, L. acidophilus E, L. acidophilus NCFM, L. acidophilus FARR, and L. acidophilus N 1 were analyzed in MRS broth containing 3 % milled or blended okara. Based on the data from that experiment, strawberry yogurt supplemented with 3 % milled or blended okara was manufactured under optimal conditions and followed by a sensory test. The yogurt, containing 3 % blended okara fermented by the two yogurt commercial starter cultures, bulgaricus and S. thermophilus, and the probiotic strain, L. acidophilus NCFM had the best texture and flavor. Further studies need to be carried out to determine the feasibility of using other probiotic cultures and more comprehensive chemical and sensory analyses to improve the taste and acceptability of probiotic yogurt supplemented with okara.
