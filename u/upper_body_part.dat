40|$|There {{is a long}} dispute among {{anthropologist}} {{over which}} factor is more important – skeletal maturation or energy accumulation – for menarche occurrence. Here we report results of longitudinal study conducted on the sample of 178 girls followed for the period from 2 years before to 2 years {{after the age of}} menarche. Each year during this period anthropometric measures of waist and hip circumference, pelvis breadth, subscapular, triceps and abdominal skinfold thickness were taken to document girls’ physical development. We found that changes in hip circumference and pelvis breadth were the most closely associated with menarche appearance. We also found that changes in anthropometric measures of lower body part preceded changes in anthropometric measures of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part</b> and tended to peak one year before menarche occurrence while changes in <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part</b> tended to peak one year after menarche occurrence. These results suggest that both skeletal maturation and energy accumulation in the form of fat are equally important for menarche to occur. Furthermore, we are proposing a new indicator describing allometric changes of pelvis around menarche: hip circumference to pelvis breadth ratio (HCPBR) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{estimating}} a person’s body height from a single uncalibrated image. The novelty of our work lies in that we handle two difficult cases not previously addressed in the literature: (i) the image contains no reference length in the background scene to indicate absolute scale, (ii) the image contains the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part</b> only. In a nutshell, our method combines well-known ideas from projective geometry and single-view metrology with prior probabilistic/statistical knowledge of human anthropometry, in a Bayesian-like framework.

40|$|Human pose {{recognition}} {{has become}} an active research topic lately {{in the field of}} human computer interface (HCI). However it presents technical challenges due to the complexity of human motion. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for human <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> pose recognition using labeled (i. e., recognized) human <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> in depth silhouettes. Our proposed method performs human <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> labeling using trained random forests (RFs) and utilizes support vector machines (SVMs) to recognize various <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> poses. To train RFs, we create a database of synthetic depth silhouettes of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> and their corresponding <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> labeled maps using a commercial computer graphics package. Once the <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> get labeled with the trained RFs, a skeletal <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> model is generated from the labeled <b>body</b> <b>parts.</b> Then, SVMs are trained with a set of joint angle features to recognize seven <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> poses. The experimental results show the mean recognition rate of 97. 62 %. Our proposed method should be useful as a near field HCI technique to be used in applications such as smart computer interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Obstructive Sleep Apnea is {{increasingly}} {{seen as a}} common and important condition, contributing to sleep disturbance and consequential daytime sleepiness. According to recent research findings, the best predictors of morbidity in individual patients, as assessed by improvements with CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure therapy), are nocturnal oxygen saturation and movements during sleep. Although pulse oximetry is a well-established technique to analyze oxygen saturation, video monitoring and interpretation is less well developed both from a processing and analysis viewpoint. This {{is due to the}} relative computational complexity of video processing analysis, as well as application-related technical challenges, involving night vision, the body being obscured by cover, variation on human size and behavior and massive video and audio data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to locate <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> of the covered human body. The locations of the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> allow further analysis of covered body postures and human activity recognition in sleep. The experimental results show that the proposed model is promising to estimate the head and torso locations of the covered human body with various postures, body activities and filming environmental settings.

The proposed system utilizes tracking for the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part</b> and combines the hidden Markov models (HMM) and dynamic time warping (DTW) to avoid gestures misclassification. By using the skeleton algorithm provided by the Kinect SDK, body is tracked and joints information are extracted. Each gesture is characterized by one of the angles which remains active when executing it. The variations of the angles throughout the gesture are used as inputs of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) in order to recognize the dynamic gestures. By feeding the output of (HMM) back to (DTW), we achieved good classification performances without any misallocation. Besides that, using depth information only makes our method robust against environmental conditions such as illumination changes and scene complexity...|$|E

The legs of a person can be extracted from laser range data while skin-colored faces are detectable in camera images showing the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part</b> of a person. As these algorithms provide different percepts originating from the same person, the perceptual results have to be combined. We link the percepts to their symbolic counterparts legs and face by anchoring processes as defined by Coradeschi and Saffiotti. To anchor the composite symbol person we extend the anchoring framework with a fusion module integrating the individual anchors. This allows to deal with perceptual algorithms having different spatio-temporal properties and provides a structured way for integrating anchors from multiple modalities.

In the first layer, activities are classified according to the dynamics of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts.</b> In the second layer, activities are further classified according to the appearance of local image patches at hands in key frames, where the interacting objects are likely to be attached. The novelties of this paper include: (i) characterizing the motion of <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> by a covariance matrix of distances between each pair of key points and the orientations of lines that connect them; (ii) describing human-object interaction by the appearance of local regions around hands in key frames that are selected based on the proximity of hands to other key points; (iii) formulating a pairwise geodesics-based kernel for activity classification on Riemannian manifolds under the log-Euclidean metric.

In order to perform a task using the arms during a walk, it is desirable that the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> i. e., the arms and the trunk, {{should not be used}} for the momentum compensation and should be dedicated to achieving a task. Moreover, a particular walk called a trunk-twistless walk is investigated by experientially observing the pelvic rotation of contact sport athletes. From these observations, an antiphase rotation of the pelvis against the swing leg is observed when compared to the normal walk of a human. This antiphase characteristic of the pelvic rotation is implemented to a humanoid. A method of determining the rotation of the humanoid’s waist is proposed in conjunction with the pitch angle of the swing legs. The proposed walk achieves a whole walking motion including momentum compensation only by the lower body. The stance foot torque around the perpendicular axis is reduced in the proposed walk compared to a standard humanoid walk without twisting the trunk or swinging the arms. Improvements to the straightness of the walking trajectory and the stability of the upper body during a fast dynamic walk are also confirmed...|$|E

Curvatures of the spine in the frontal plane are present {{in order to maintain the}} <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part</b> in proper balance. However, when there are lateral curvatures of the spine, scoliosis exists as well. People with a family history of spinal deformity are at greater risk for scoliosis development.

The risk factors for worsening of scoliosis curvatures, except for growth include: gender (scoliosis curvature in girls more often worsens during growth, as one compared to boys), age (when scoliosis appears in the younger child, the greater is the chance that the curvature will get worse), size of the curvature (with the higher degree of curvature, goes the greater probability that it will worsen over time), location (scoliosis curvature in the lower spine are with less opportunities of promotion than those in the upper spine). Unfortunately, scoliosis often becomes evident in the time when children become selfconscious about their bodies (10 to 15 years of age), so that parents and others have even less likelihood to see the problem.

30|$|Color features: Color {{information}} {{improves the}} performance of SS and PF in both MOTP and MOTA scores. First, there is an improvement when using color information for a given voxel size, specially for the SS algorithm. Moreover, the smaller the voxel size the most noticeable difference between the experiments using raw and color features. This effect {{is supported by the}} fact that color characteristics are better captured when using small voxel sizes. The performance improvement when using color in the SS algorithm is more noticeable since samples are placed in the regions with a high likelihood {{to be part of the}} target. For instance, this effect is more evident in cases where the subject is sitting and the particles concentrate in the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> disregarding the part of the chair. In the SS algorithm, MOTP score benefits from this efficient sample placement. PF algorithm is constrained to evaluate the color likelihood in the ellipsoid defined in Equation 9 thus not being able to differentiate between parts of the blob that do not belong to the tracked target. Color information used within the filtering loop leads to a better distinguishability among blobs, thus reducing the mismatch ratio and slightly improving the MOTA score. Merging of adjacent blobs or complex crossing among targets is also correctly resolved. An example of the impact of color information is shown in Figure 10 where the usage of color avoids the mismatch between two targets. This effect is more noticeable when targets in the scene are dressed in different colors.|$|E

Twenty female workers (28. 9 ± 10. 2 years) from a company in Florianópolis were studied. A photo camera, Wells bench, a questionnaire, and interview were used for data collection. The subjects were submitted to seven types of exercise wearing UNI and SEC: hip flexion, shoulder flexion, trunk flexion-hips and ankle angles, shoulder extension, modified trunk flexion-hips and ankle angles, horizontal shoulder adduction, and a sit-and-reach test. The results were analyzed using the paired t-test, chi-square test, and Fisher’s exact test (p≤ 0. 05). Seven women wearing UNI tended not to show the body, 17 removed some part of UNI, and 13 noted movement limitation. Discomfort was lower in the <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>part</b> during hip flexion and horizontal shoulder adduction and in the lower part during shoulder flexion, extension and horizontal shoulder adduction. Lower ROM values were observed for subjects wearing UNI compared to those wearing SEC during hip flexion (p= 0. 017), shoulder flexion (p= 0. 0075), trunk flexion (hips and ankle angles), modified trunk flexion (ankle angles), and the sit-and-reach test (linear and angular values) (p< 0. 001). Trunk flexion performance (ankle angles) was better in the UNI condition (p= 0. 001), probably because the subjects were wearing shoes.

In still images and video sequences, humans appear in different poses and views, fully visible and partly occluded, with varying distances to the camera, at different places, under different illumination conditions, etc. This diversity in appearance makes the task of human detection and identification to a particularly challenging problem. A possible solution of this problem is interesting {{for a wide range}} of applications such as video surveillance and content-based image and video processing. In order to detect humans in views ranging from full to close-up view and in the presence of clutter and occlusion, they are modeled by an assembly of several <b>upper</b> <b>body</b> <b>parts.</b> For each <b>body</b> <b>part,</b> a detector is trained based on a Support Vector Machine and on densely sampled, SIFT-like feature points in a detection window. For a more robust human detection, localized <b>body</b> <b>parts</b> are assembled using a learned model for geometric relations based on Gaussians. For a flexible human identification, the outward appearance of humans is captured and learned using the Bag-of-Features approach and non-linear Support Vector Machines. Probabilistic votes for each <b>body</b> <b>part</b> are combined to improve classification results. The combined votes yield an identification accuracy of about 80 % in our experiments on episodes of the TV series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".
