40|$|Current <b>Network</b> <b>User</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (NUIs) provide {{entrances to}} an {{enormous}} amount of Web-based services, bringing about new use problems such as laborious and unsuccessful navigation. Such problems are generally more severe for users with regression of cognitive functions (e. g. for some elderly). This paper identifies four fundamental cognitive determinants of navigation performance that may explain these problems: situation awareness, spatial ability, task-set switching and user control of support. Based on an analysis of these demands and current support functions for navigation, three "refined" support concepts were developed: categorising landmarks, history map and navigation assistant. Via the specification of humancomputer co-operative processes and scenarios, the concepts were implemented for two rather different web-based services. The present paper provides an example implementation of the navigation assistant. The results of the study will feed into a cognitive engineering method for the design of NUIs.

50|$|In SPBM, the Backbone MAC (B-MAC) {{addresses}} {{of the participating}} nodes and also the service membership information for interfaces to non-participating devices (<b>user</b> <b>network</b> <b>interface</b> (UNI) ports) is distributed. Topology data is then input to a calculation engine which computes symmetric shortest path trees based on minimum cost from each participating node to all other participating nodes. In SPBV these trees provide a shortest path tree where individual MAC address can be learned and Group Address membership can be distributed. In SPBM the shortest path trees are then used to populate forwarding tables for each participating node's individual B-MAC addresses and for Group addresses; Group multicast trees are sub trees of the default shortest path tree formed by (Source, Group) pairing. Depending on the topology several different equal cost multi path trees are possible and SPB supports multiple algorithms per IS-IS instance.|$|E

This implementation of the pbuf in TSMC 0. 18 µm CMOS technology displays an aggregate bi-directional throughput of 48. 08 Gbps, using low area (0. 56 mm 2) and power consumption (32. 30 mW). These characteristics, especially the low area and power, have made the current implementation an ideal choice for assimilation in DIVA PIM systems, since low area and power are critical design requirements in the PIM philosophy.

40|$|The Access Network (AN) {{part of the}} B-ISDN aims at concentrating {{the traffic}} {{of a number of}} {{different}} <b>User</b> <b>Network</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (UNIs) and routing this traffic to the appropriate Service Node (SN) through a broadband V interface (referred as VB). Naturally, the emphasis on AN design is to provide cost-efficient implementations without degrading the agreed Quality of Service (QoS). This is reflected in both the reduction of the AN physical equipment and in the limitations imposed on the AN functionality such as the inability to interpret signaling information. The lack of connection-related information forces the establishment of several AN internal mechanisms that compensate for the effects of traffic concentration. In our attempt to generalize and extend results and experiences obtained from our involvement in the specification, design and implementation of an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) -based AN, we introduce the concept of a real-time VB interface Control Protocol (V-CP). We demonstrate the V-CP ability to serve for a number of AN internal functions while preserving the highest possible degree of transparency to the SN. The V-CP services provide for the dynamic operation of the AN by conveying all those connection-related parameters required for dynamic resource allocation, traffic policing and routing in the AN, as well as information on the status of the AN before a new connection is accepted by the SN. The V-CP operates in real time on a connection by connection basis. This is reflected in its simple design making it considerably faster than usual management protocols...|$|R

Its hardware support for remote direct memory access enables efficient implementation of the global address space programming languages. Although the <b>user</b> Generic <b>Network</b> <b>Interface</b> (uGNI) provides a low-level interface for Gemini with support to the message-passing programming model (MPI), it remains challenging to port alternative programming models with scalable performance.

Several techniques are presented to exploit the uGNI capabilites by reducing memory copy and registration overhead, taking advantage of the persistent communication, and improving intra-node communication. Our microbenchmark results demonstrate that the uGNI-based runtime system outperforms the MPI-based implementation by up to 50 % in terms of message latency. For communication intensive applications such as N-Queens, this implementation scales up to 15, 360 cores of a Cray XE 6 machine and is 70 % faster than the MPI-based implementation.
