According to the two visual system hypothesis (TVSH) vision can be parsed into two systems: (1) the ventral ‘stream’ of the occipital and inferotemporal cortex which services visual perception and other cognitive functions and (2) the ‘dorsal stream’ of the occipital and posterior parietal cortex which services skilled, goal-directed actions such as prehension. A cornerstone of the TVSH is the ‘perception-action’ dissociation observed in patient DF who suffers from visual form agnosia following bilateral damage to her ventral stream. DF cannot discriminate amongst objects {{on the basis of their}} visual form. Remarkably, however, her hand preshapes in-flight to suit the sizes of the goal objects she fails to discriminate amongst when she reaches out to pick them up; That is, unless she is denied the opportunity to touch the object at the end of her reach. This latter finding has led some to question the TVSH, advancing an alternative account that is centered on visuo-haptic calibration. The current work examines this alternative view. First, the validity of the measurements that have <b>underlined</b> this <b>line</b> of investigation is tested, rejecting some measures while affirming others. Next, the visuo-haptic calibration account is tested and ultimately rejected on the basis of four key pieces of evidence: Haptics and vision need not correlate to show DF’s ‘perception-action’ dissociation; Haptic input does not potentiate DF’s deficit in visual form perception; DF’s grasp kinematics are normal as long as she is provided a target proxy; and denying tactile feedback induces a shift in grasp kinematics away from natural grasps and towards pantomimed (simulated) ones in normally-sighted populations...|$|R

The predicted visual optical depth from the model is compared with the thermal continuum radiation detected from NGC 4013 and NGC 5907 at 850 microns and from NGC 4565 at 1. 2 mm. The former is based on SCUBA images of NGC 4013 and NGC 5907, reduced and presented {{for the first time}} in this work. The comparison of visual optical depth and 850 microns (1. 2 mm) emission yields the emissivity of dust grains in the submillimeter (millimeter) waveband. We infer a value of 1. 2 x 10 ^{ 4 } for the emissivity at 850 microns which is a factor 4 higher than the benchmark, semi-empirical model of Draine & Lee (1984). At 1. 2 mm our values are a factor 1. 5 higher than this model. Our estimates are more closely aligned with recent measurements carried out in the laboratory on amorphous carbon and silicate particulates. A comparison between the distribution of 850 microns (1. 2 mm) surface brightness and the intensity levels in the ^{ 12 }CO(1 - 0) and 21 cm <b>lines</b> <b>underlines</b> the spatial association between dust detected in the submillimeter/millimeter waveband and molecular gas clouds.

40|$|The {{human cell}} line T 2 has been {{reported}} to be class I assembly deficient, and accordingly expresses reduced amounts of HLA-A 2 and no HLA-B 5 at the cell surface. By immunoblotting we observe the steady- state class I heavy chain levels of T 2 to be near normal when compared with the identical class I alleles of the wild-type cell line T 1. In pulse chase experiments, formation of heavy chain beta 2 -microglobulin complexes is observed for both HLA-A 2 and HLA-B 5. Culture at reduced temperatures (26 or 20 degrees C) does not increase the amount of class I molecules transported, unlike what {{has been reported}} for the class I assembly-deficient mouse mutant cell line RMA-S. The HLA-B 5 and the HLA- A 2 complexes formed by T 2 are thermolabile in cell lysates, albeit to different degrees. The thermolability of HLA-B 5 can be overcome by addition of HLA-B 5 -presentable peptides, obtained by trifluoroacetic acid extraction from an HLA-B 5 -positive cell <b>line,</b> <b>underlining</b> the necessity of peptide for class I stability and indicating that T 2 - derived class I complexes are devoid of peptide. Cytoplast fusion of T 2 cells with RMA-S cells shows the defect in class I assembly of RMA-S to be similar to that of T 2. Localization of class I molecules observed by immuno-electron microscopy reveals the accumulation in the T 2 cell line of both HLA-B 5 and HLA-A 2 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Class I molecules are present in all the cisternae of the Golgi complex of T 2, but the ratio of HLA-A and -B locus products in the Golgi area differs significantly from that at the cell surface.

40|$|High-resolution X-ray {{spectra of}} O-type stars {{revealed}} less wind absorption than expected from smooth winds with conventional mass-loss rates. Various solutions have been proposed, including porous winds, optically thick clumps or an overall {{reduction of the}} mass-loss rates. The latter has a strong impact {{on the evolution of}} the star. Our final goal is to analyse high resolution X-ray spectra of O-type stars with a multi temperature plasma model in order to determine crucial wind parameters such as the mass loss rate, the CNO abundances and the X-ray temperature plasma distribution in the wind. In this context we are developing a modelling tool to calculate synthetic X-ray spectra. We present, here, the main ingredients and physics necessary for a such work. Our code uses the AtomDB emissivities to compute the intrinsic emissivity of the hot plasma as well as the CMFGEN model atmosphere code to evaluate the opacity of the cool wind. Following the comparison between two formalisms of stellar wind fragmentation, we introduce, {{for the first time in}} X-rays, the effects of a tenuous inter-clump medium. We then explore the quantitative impact of different model parameters on the X-ray spectra such as the position in the wind of the X-ray emitting plasma. For the first time, we show that the two formalisms of stellar wind fragmentation yield different results, although the differences for individual lines are small and can probably not be tested with the current generation of X-ray telescopes. As an illustration of our method, we compare various synthetic line profiles to the observed O VIII λ 18. 97 Å line in the spectrum of ζ Puppis. We illustrate how different combinations of parameters can actually lead to the same morphology of a single <b>line,</b> <b>underlining</b> the need to analyse the whole spectrum in a consistent way when attempting to constrain the parameters of the wind.

Since 1945, Canada {{has been involved in}} all major United Nations peacekeeping missions including observation operations from 1945 - 1956, peacekeeping operations from 1956 to the present, and peace enforcement operations since 1991. The Canadian literature on peacekeeping missions has centred on foreign and defence policy questions and their influence on international affairs from a Canadian perspective. To fully appreciate the nature of peacekeeping operations in their foreign and defence policy contexts, we need to understand better how individual operations function, the principal problems encountered, and the way such operations have ended over time. This study of the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) is an analysis of a Canadian military operation and the evolution of peacekeeping from 1964 - 1975, with emphasis on the crucial 1974 period, which witnessed the Canadian Contingent's leading role in redefining the concept and practice of peacekeeping in Cyprus. Overnight it went from peacekeeper in an inter-communal situation to a peacemaker in a full scale war.
