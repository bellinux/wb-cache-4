5|$|Arbitration {{between the}} company and its {{employees}} by the Indiana Public Service Commission resulted in a decision mostly favoring the company. The employees were permitted to unionize, guaranteed wage increases, a minimum monthly salary, and certain days off work. The company, however, was permitted to continue hiring non-union employees and to bar <b>union</b> <b>membership</b> solicitation on the company's property.|$|E
5|$|On {{his first}} day in office, Daniels created Indiana's first Office of Management and Budget to look for inefficiencies and cost savings {{throughout}} state government. The same day, he decertified all government employee unions by executive order, removing the requirement that state employees pay union dues by rescinding a mandate created by Governor Evan Bayh in a 1989 executive order. Dues-paying <b>union</b> <b>membership</b> subsequently dropped 90% among state employees.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{heightened}} public fear {{of labor}} unrest {{and the possible}} radicalism that lay behind it. It contributed to the public anxiety of the period known as the Red Scare of 1919–1920. The failure of this and other strikes {{in the years following}} World War I contributed to declining <b>union</b> <b>membership</b> in subsequent years. The American Federation of Labor responded to political pressure experienced during the strike and revoked the charters it had granted to police unions. That ended police unionism in the U.S. for two decades, as police would not try to organize until World War II.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} three referendums in modern Croatia: Croatian {{independence}} referendum, Croatian European <b>Union</b> <b>membership</b> referendum and Marriage definition referendum, and in all three majority voted in favor.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{stoppages}} across the UK peaked at 4,583 in 1979, {{when more than}} 29million working days had been lost. In 1984, {{the year of the}} miners' strike, there were 1,221, resulting in the loss of more than 27million working days. Stoppages then fell steadily throughout the rest of Thatcher's premiership; in 1990 there were 630 and fewer than 2million working days lost, and they continued to fall thereafter. Thatcher's tenure also witnessed a sharp decline in trade union density, with the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union falling from 57.3% in 1979 to 49.5% in 1985. In 1979 up until Thatcher's final year in office, trade <b>union</b> <b>membership</b> also fell, from 13.5million in 1979 to fewer than 10million.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after being sworn in, Cooper co-sponsored his first piece of legislation, a bill to provide federal aid for education. The bill passed the Senate, but not the House. Cooper was made {{chairman}} of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Roads, and helped draft a bill authorizing $900million in federal funds to states for highway construction. In 1948, he sponsored a bill to provide price support for burley tobacco at 90 percent of parity. He insisted on {{an amendment to the}} War Claims Act of 1948 that benefits to veterans injured as prisoners of war of the Germans and Japanese during World War II be paid immediately using enemy assets. He also co-sponsored legislation allowing {{hundreds of thousands of people}} displaced by the Nazis to enter the United States legally. He opposed bans on industrywide collective bargaining for organized labor and on the establishment of closed shops. He voted against putting union welfare funds under government control, but helped to pass an amendment forbidding compulsory <b>union</b> <b>membership</b> for workers.|$|E

5|$|The first Trades Union Congress {{was held}} in Manchester in 1868, and as of 2015 trade <b>union</b> <b>membership</b> in Northern England {{remained}} higher than in Southern England, although it is lower than in the other Home Nations. Since the Thatcher era, the Conservative Party have since struggled to gain support in the area. Today, Northern England is generally described as a stronghold of the Labour Party – although the Conservatives hold some rural seats, they have almost no urban seats and as of the 2016 local elections there are no Conservative councillors on Liverpool City Council, Manchester City Council, Newcastle City Council or Sheffield City Council. Historically the region was also a heartland for the Liberals, and between the 1980s and the 2010s their successors in the Liberal Democrats benefitted from Conservative unpopularity by positioning themselves as the centrist alternative to Labour in the North.|$|E
