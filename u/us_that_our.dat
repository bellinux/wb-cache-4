5|$|Counsel for the {{petitioner}} {{discussed at}} great length from a sociological point of view, of the age-old problem of the gambling instinct in the human being. According to his analysis, gambling pervades our entire economic system; thus insurance contracts are a gamble, stock and grain exchange transactions are gambles, and the farmer's dependence on weather is a gamble. Counsel's attempt to apply this analysis to the present case left us cold and unimpressed. He even reminded <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> great idol, Mr. Chief Justice John Marshall, in his day attended the horse races and wagered with his clergyman. In fact, they ran a book. As indicating how times have changed and how even our coarse nature has yielded to the protecting care of governmental policy, we confess we do not even know a bookmaker, clerical or otherwise, and our passes to the beautiful race tracks around Chicago lie in our desk unused.|$|E

500|$|Marquette University {{changed their}} team {{name from the}} Warriors to the Golden Eagles in 1994. The school's {{president}} stated:"We live in a different era than when the Warriors nickname was selected in 1954. The perspective of time has shown <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> actions, intended or not, can offend others. We must not knowingly act {{in a way that}} others will believe, based on their experience, to be an attack on their dignity as fellow human beings." [...] Also in 1994, St. John's University (New York) changed the name of its athletic teams from the Redmen to the Red Storm after the university was pressured by American Indian groups who considered Redmen a slur.|$|E

500|$|Pop Shock {{praised the}} song, {{saying that they}} didn't expect Stan to choose such a genre for a track. Pop Shock went on saying that the track [...] "reinvents the cutesy, innuendo-loving Europop star into an exotic vixen of global proportions". Everything Express noticed {{similarities}} to Rihanna's works, confessing that [...] "the single reminds <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> Romanian pop-poppet can actually sing." [...] Adictivoz compared [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] to Shakira. Pure Charts labelled the song as [...] "tribal" [...] and [...] "urban", pointing out the sexual lyrics [...] "I'm doing limbo / Your body is my temple." [...] Digital Journal praised the song, confessing that Stan [...] "displays a different style to her artistry." [...] The song's Middle Eastern melodic flair [...] "enhances [...] sonically". They went on saying that Stan's vocals are [...] "hypnotic" [...] and [...] "crystalline." [...] Digital Journal noted that Stan [...] "is not afraid to take risks and try new things." [...] Direct Lyrics compared [...] "Give Me Your Everything" [...] to the material featured on Rihanna's [...] A Girl like Me (2006).|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
500|$|Based on 55 reviews {{collected}} from notable publications by popular review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an 84% [...] "fresh" [...] approval rating, with the consensus, [...] "As history, Oliver Stone's JFK is dubious, but as filmmaking it's electric, cramming {{a ton of}} information and excitement into its three-hour runtime and making great use of its outstanding cast." [...] However, the film's production and release were subject to intense scrutiny and criticism. A few weeks after shooting had begun, on May 14, 1991, [...] Jon Margolis wrote in the Chicago Tribune that JFK was [...] "an insult to the intelligence." [...] Five days later, The Washington Post ran a scathing article by national security correspondent George Lardner titled, [...] "On the Set: Dallas in Wonderland" [...] that used {{the first draft of}} the JFK screenplay to blast it for [...] "the absurdities and palpable untruths in Garrison's book and Stone's rendition of it." [...] The article pointed out that Garrison lost his case against Clay Shaw and that he inflated his case by trying to use Shaw's homosexual relationships to prove guilt by association. Stone responded to Lardner's article by hiring a public relations firm that specialized in political issues. Other critical articles soon followed. Anthony Lewis in The New York Times stated that the film [...] "tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> government cannot be trusted to give an honest account of a Presidential assassination." [...] Washington Post columnist George Will called Stone [...] "a man of technical skill, scant education and negligible conscience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{entering}} {{the house the}} man approaches the fireplace, called ognjište (...) —the hearth of an ognjište {{is similar to a}} campfire, in that it has no vertical surround. He lays the badnjak down on the fire and moves it a little forward, to summon prosperity for the household. Any other logs are brought in by other males and laid on the fire parallel or perpendicular to the first. The head of the household takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or similar. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. When the log has burnt through, some families let the fire go out, while in others the men keep watch in shifts during the night to keep the badnjak burning.|$|E
2500|$|In January and February 1908, Clarence Bloomfield Moore [...] {{received}} {{permission from}} the then owner Judge William Andrew Henry of Yazoo City to excavate the sites along the Yazoo River and its tributary the Sunflower River in his steamboat, The Gopher. On his excavation Moore recorded eleven sites and partially excavated eight, including Holly Bluff: “with a large force to dig, including May {{who had been in}} our service before, we go directly to work on such mounds”. Moore commented on the physical appearance of the site: “Strewn over the enclosed area, among the mounds and on them…are chert pebbles; fragments of chert; bits of mussel shell; and small parts of earthenware vessels" [...] Most of the earthenware was undecorated, he recorded, and mostly shell tempered with some stone tempering which is common in the Yazoo-Sunflower region. C. B. Moore’s excavations produced various small artifacts including projectile points, a pebble ax of fossilized wood, a chert hammerstone, and a zoomorphic effigy pipe of shell-tempered pottery. [...] He was disappointed, however, in finding nothing of great importance other than two disturbed burials in a mound on the lake front. [...] Moore’s disappointment was evident in his failing to map the site and his statement, “it having become evident to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> search was inadequately rewarded”.|$|E
