25|$|In the letter, Gates {{expressed}} {{frustration with}} most computer hobbyists who were using his company's Altair BASIC software without having paid for it. He asserted that such widespread <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying</b> in effect discourages developers from investing {{time and money}} in creating high-quality software. He cited the unfairness of gaining the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them.|$|E
25|$|The driving factor {{behind this}} {{is related to}} how many {{restrictions}} DRM imposes on a legal buyer. An ideal DRM would be one which imposes zero restrictions on legal buyers but makes imposing restrictions on infringers. Even if an ideal DRM can be created and used, in certain cases, it can be shown that removing the DRM will result in less <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying.</b> For the ideal DRM, the reason why profits can increase {{is because of the}} demand is elastic. When there are more people legally buying and few people sharing the product, more profits are going to be made.|$|E
40|$|Digital watermarks have {{recently}} been proposed {{for the purposes of}} copy protec-tion and copy deterrence for multimedia content. In copy deterrence, a content owner (seller) inserts a unique watermark into a copy of the content before it is sold to a buyer. If the buyer sells <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copies</b> of the watermarked content, then these copies {{can be traced to the}} unlawful reseller (original buyer) using a watermark detec-tion algorithm. One problem with such an approach is that the original buyer whose watermark has been found on <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copies</b> can claim that the <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copy</b> was created or caused (for example, by a security breach) by the original seller. In this paper we propose an interactive buyer-seller protocol for invisible watermarking in which the seller does not get to know the exact watermarked copy that the buyer receives. Hence the seller cannot create copies of the original content containing the buyer’s watermark. In cases where the seller finds an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copy,</b> the seller can identify the buyer from a watermark in the <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copy,</b> and furthermore the seller can prove this fact to a third party using a dispute resolution protocol. This prevents the buyer from claiming that an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copy</b> may have originated from the seller...|$|R

25|$|When {{a feature}} has both artistic (copyrightable) and {{functional}} (patentable) merits, {{when the question}} has appeared in US court, the courts have often held the feature is not copyrightable unless it can {{be separated from the}} functional aspects of the item. In other countries the law and the courts may apply a different approach allowing, for example, the design of a useful device to be registered (as a whole) as an industrial design on the understanding that, in case of <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying,</b> only the non-functional features may be claimed under design law whereas any technical features could only be claimed if covered by a valid patent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unauthorized</b> <b>copying</b> {{has been}} an ongoing {{phenomenon}} that started when high quality, commercially produced software was released for sale. Whether the medium was cassette tape or floppy disk, cracking enthusiasts {{found a way to}} duplicate the software and spread it without the permission of the maker. Thriving bootlegging communities were built around the Apple II, Commodore 64, the Atari 400 and Atari 800 line, the ZX Spectrum, the Amiga, and the Atari ST, among other personal computers. Entire networks of BBSes sprang up to traffic illegal software from one user to the next. Machines like the Amiga and the Commodore 64 had an international network, through which software not available on one continent would eventually make its way to every region via bulletin board systems.|$|E

2500|$|The first [...] "American" [...] encyclopedia, Dobson's Encyclopædia, {{was based}} {{almost entirely on}} the 3rd edition of the Britannica and {{published}} at nearly the same time (1788–1798), together with an analogous supplement (1803), by the Scottish-born printer, Thomas Dobson. The first United States copyright law was passed on 30 May 1790—although anticipated by Section 8 of Article I of the United States Constitution (ratified 4 March 1789)—but did not protect foreign publications such as the Britannica. <b>Unauthorized</b> <b>copying</b> of the Britannica in America was also {{a problem with the}} 9th edition (1889). Unlicensed copies were also sold in Dublin by James Moore under the title, Moore's Dublin Edition, Encyclopædia Britannica; this was an exact reproduction of the Britannicas 3rd edition. By contrast, Dobson's work had various corrections and amendments for American readers.|$|E
2500|$|For {{its first}} video player, {{which was based}} on the GNU Public Licensed (GPL) source code of XBMC Media Center, Voddler also {{developed}} its own encryption module, to protect the movies streamed via the player from <b>unauthorized</b> <b>copying</b> or downloading. [...] On 24 February 2010, the company closed down the service, having been hacked by anonymous programmers who had recreated these missing code parts that Voddler had added to its media player. [...] The missing code made it possible for other media player to attach to Voddler's own, so that the user could save the streamed films to their harddrive. [...] This use case violated the licensing deals that Voddler had signed with the content owners. [...] As motivation for their attack, the anonymous programmers said that Voddler, according to GPL, should have published the code for the encryption module back to the open source project. Voddler claimed they had met the requirements of GPL, which the anonymous group argued was wrong, insisting that Voddler had to distribute all of the Voddler source code needed to compile the Voddler player executable. When Voddler re-opened its service on 8 March 2010, it was with a new media player, no longer based on XBMC. [...] Since encryption protection was essential for Voddler, in order to keep its content license agreements, and that giving the code module back to the open source project was tantamount to removing the encryption, Voddler chose to completely replace the player with a commercially available framework.|$|E
