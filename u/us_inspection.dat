50|$|INS Jalashwa has {{undergone}} two refits. A short one, limited by financial constraints, helped the ship attain higher speeds. The second refit in 2012 was longer, and her radars and sensors were replaced with indigenous equipment. This reduced the navy's dependence on US-origin components, {{as it was}} uncomfortable with the <b>US</b> <b>inspection</b> regime.|$|E

5000|$|Homeland {{security}} Lautenberg was {{a proponent}} of the Container Security Initiative which would screen cargo containers bound for the United States for radiological contents. This policy is intended to identify threats before they arrive at U.S. ports. The Bush administration argued that the policy would be too expensive to implement, as <b>U.S.</b> <b>inspection</b> teams, with equipment, {{would need to be}} installed in 700 foreign ports.|$|E
50|$|Vehicle {{inspection}} is {{a procedure}} mandated by national or subnational governments in many countries, {{in which a}} vehicle is inspected {{to ensure that it}} conforms to regulations governing safety, emissions, or both. Inspection can be required at various times, e.g., periodically or on transfer of title to a vehicle. If required periodically, it is often termed periodic motor vehicle inspection; typical intervals are every two years and every year. When a vehicle passes inspection, often a sticker (inspection decal or inspection sticker) is placed on the vehicle's windshield or registration plate to simplify later controls, but in some countries such a Netherlands since 2008 is not necessary anymore. Inspection stations are places to drive inside to see if a vehicle passes inspection once a vehicle is due for inspection. Most <b>US</b> <b>inspection</b> decals/stickers display the month's number and the year.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} contribution, the {{residual}} strength behaviour of stiffened CFRP shells under axial compression loading is discussed. In this context, two stiffened CFRP panels are pre-damaged by impact and tested under axial compression until collapse. The panels without damage were tested before {{in order to}} obtain a reference result. Two different impact scenarios are investigated on a T- and a J-stringer stiffened panel, respectively. The damaged area is assessed by ultra-sonic (<b>US)</b> <b>inspection.</b> Load shortening data, strains as well as full field displacements are recorded during the test. Additionally to the experiments, the structural behaviour is simulated for the undamaged and damaged structures using the commercial FE-code Abaqus. The <b>US</b> <b>inspection</b> results of the impacted areas are transferred into the FE-models, and the stiffness and strength of affected elements are degraded accordingly. The numerical results are compared to the experimental findings. Through this approach, the influence of both impact scenarios on the structural behaviour of stiffened CFRP shells is assessed by test and simulation...|$|E

40|$|The local defect {{inspection}} in longitudinal {{structures such as}} plates or pipelines implies high economical {{costs and}} it is time consuming mainly in underground infrastructures, energy or water, and aerospace sectors. Moreover, if these structures are non-accessible, their local inspection is not possible. Ultrasonic (<b>US)</b> <b>inspection</b> technique based on guided waves is one of the potential alternatives to address this issue. The <b>US</b> <b>inspection</b> based on these type of waves could be applied in many scenarios to monitor the damage state of structures; i. e., in water underground pipelines to identify the wall thickness losses or impact damage detection on Carbon Fiber Reinforced Composites (CFRC). A SHM system based on guided waves requires a special signal processing in order to identify possible damage in the structure. The signal emitted and received is a combination of different propagation modes which are difficult to identify and analyse. However, if the signals are compared to each other (signal related to non-damaged components compared to damaged signal) it is possible to measure their difference as a distance {{that can be used to}} estimate the damage level. In this work, signals corresponding to non-damaged samples have been captured and then different types of damage have been applied for different cases. After the data acquisition phase, the comparison between signals has been carried out by applying different mathematical methods and distance metrics (SDC, DTW, Euclidean, Manhattan and Chebyshev), with the aim of detecting defects in different structures and materials. For this purpose, two cases have been analysed: 1) In CFRC plates subjected to impact damage and deformations and 2) In a pipe coated by cement-mortar in order to quantify the wall thickness losses. In both cases ultrasonic PZT sensors, an ultrasonic multichannel pulser/receiver and a software developed ad-hoc have been used. Although the SHM system components were similar, it must be noted that the type of ultrasonic guided waves used were different; in the case of CFRC plates, Lamb waves were excited whereas in the case of the pipeline, Love waves have been used. A comparison between the above mentioned methods is provided. The results show the validity of the approach for damage characterization.
