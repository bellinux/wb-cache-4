500|$|The {{immature}} fruiting body of Crucibulum laeve (technically, the peridium), {{is roughly}} spherical in shape, but in maturity {{the base is}} narrowed slightly relative to the top, so that it appears like a cup, or crucible. The fruiting bodies are usually 5–8mm tall and almost as wide at the mouth. When young, the mouth is enclosed by a thin membrane called an epiphragm, which is covered with surface hairs. As the fruiting body matures and the fruiting body expands, the epiphragm ruptures, exposing the internal contents. The wall of the fruiting body is made of a single <b>uniform</b> <b>layer</b> of closely interwoven hyphae (the threadlike filaments that form the mycelium) roughly 0.25–0.5mm thick; this wall structure {{is in contrast to}} species from the bird's nest fungus genus Cyathus, which have a distinctly three-layered wall. Young species have a yellowish velvety cover of fine hairs, but this external surface becomes sloughed off and becomes smooth as the fruiting body matures; the color changes to brown, although some old weathered specimens may be bleached grey or dirty white. The inner surface of the fruiting body is smooth and shiny. The cups contain tiny pale ochraceous or white [...] "eggs," [...] technically termed peridioles, usually 1–2mm in diameter. In each peridiole is a spore-producing layer of tissue, the hymenium. This layer is largely composed of basidia (spore-producing cells) mixed with paraphyses (non-spore producing elements interspersed between basidia). Peridioles are covered by a thin membrane of loosely woven hyphae known as a tunica; separated from the light-colored tunica, the peridioles are black. The peridioles are attached to the inner wall of the peridium by a thin, elastic cord of mycelium, a funiculus, which can be extended at length when moist.|$|E

Similar folds tend to display thinning of the limbs and thickening of the hinge zone. Concentric folds are caused by warping from active buckling of the layers, whereas similar folds usually form by some form of shear flow where the layers are not mechanically active. Ramsay has proposed a classification scheme for folds that often is used to describe folds in profile based upon curvature of {{the inner and outer}} lines of a fold, and the behavior of dip isogons. that is, lines connecting points of equal dip: ...|$|E

60|$|In heavy gales, the {{neighbourhood}} of {{a solitary}} tree {{is a positive}} nuisance. It creates a violent eddy of wind, that leaves palpable evidence of its existence. Thus, in corn-fields, {{it is a common}} result of a storm to batter the corn quite flat in circles round each tree that stands in the field, while elsewhere no injury takes place. This very morning that I am writing these remarks, November 158, I was forcibly struck by the appearance of Kensington Gardens, after last night's gale, which had covered the ground with an extraordinary amount of dead leaves. They lay in a remarkably <b>uniform</b> <b>layer,</b> of from three to five inches in depth, except that round each and every tree the ground was absolutely bare of leaves for a radius of about a yard. The effect was as though circular discs had been cut out, leaving the edges of the layer of leaves perfectly sharp and vertical. It would have been a dangerous mistake to have slept that night at the foot of any one of those trees.|$|E
60|$|The leaves {{which are}} {{dragged into the}} burrows as food, after being torn into the finest shreds, {{partially}} digested, and saturated with the intestinal and urinary secretions, are commingled with much earth. This earth forms the dark coloured, rich humus which almost everywhere covers {{the surface of the}} land with a fairly well- defined layer or mantle. Hensen {83} placed two worms in a vessel 18 inches in diameter, which was filled with sand, on which fallen leaves were strewed; and these were soon dragged into their burrows to a depth of 3 inches. After about 6 weeks an almost <b>uniform</b> <b>layer</b> of sand, a centimeter (0.4 inch) in thickness, was converted into humus by having passed through the alimentary canals of these two worms. It is believed by some persons that worm-burrows, which often penetrate the ground almost perpendicularly to a depth of 5 or 6 feet, materially aid in its drainage; notwithstanding that the viscid castings piled over the mouths of the burrows prevent or check the rain-water directly entering them. They allow the air to penetrate deeply into the ground. They also greatly facilitate the downward passage of roots of moderate size; and these will be nourished by the humus with which the burrows are lined. Many seeds owe their germination to having been covered by castings; and others buried to a considerable depth beneath accumulated castings lie dormant, until at some future time they are accidentally uncovered and germinate.|$|E
6000|$|MALDONADO is {{situated}} on the northern bank of the Plata, and not very far {{from the mouth of}} the estuary. It is a most quiet, forlorn, little town; built, as is universally the case in these countries, with the streets running at right angles to each other, and having in the middle a large plaza or square, which, from its size, renders the scantiness of the population more evident. It possesses scarcely any trade; the exports being confined to a few hides and living cattle. The inhabitants are chiefly landowners, together with a few shopkeepers and the necessary tradesmen, such as blacksmiths and carpenters, who do nearly all the business for a circuit of fifty miles round. The town is separated from the river by a band of sand-hillocks, about a mile broad: it is surrounded on all other sides by an open slightly-undulating country, covered by one <b>uniform</b> <b>layer</b> of fine green turf, on which countless herds of cattle, sheep, and horses graze. There is very little land cultivated even close to the town. A few hedges made of cacti and agave mark out where some wheat or Indian corn has been planted. The features of the country are very similar along the whole northern bank of the Plata. The only difference is, that here the granitic hills are a little bolder. The scenery is very uninteresting; there is scarcely a house, an enclosed piece of ground, or even a tree, to give it an air of cheerfulness. Yet, after being imprisoned for some time in a ship, there is a charm in the unconfined feeling of walking over boundless plains of turf. Moreover, if your view is limited to a small space, many objects possess beauty. Some of the smaller birds are brilliantly coloured; and the bright green sward, browsed short by the cattle, is ornamented by dwarf flowers, among which a plant, looking like the daisy, claimed the place of an old friend. What would a florist say to whole tracts, so thickly covered by the Verbena melindres, as, even at a distance, to appear of the most gaudy scarlet? ...|$|E

The reflectivities are compared at 0. 63 micron, where cloud droplets are nonabsorbing, and at 3. 7 micron, where the cloud droplets absorb and the single-scattering albedo is about 0. 9. It was found that, at visible wavelengths, the reflectivities of broken clouds were only 80 - 85 percent of those of the same clouds where they formed regions of extensive <b>uniform</b> <b>layers.</b> The radiation not reflected was transmitted to the surface.

40|$|Transfer {{cells are}} {{characterized}} by wall labyrinths with either a flange or reticulate architecture. A literature survey established that reticulate wall ingrowth papillae ubiquitously arise from a modified component of their wall labyrinth, termed the uniform wall layer; a structure absent from flange transfer cells. This finding sparked {{an investigation of the}} deposition characteristics and role of the <b>uniform</b> wall <b>layer</b> using a Vicia faba cotyledon culture system. On transfer of cotyledons to culture, their adaxial epidermal cells spontaneously trans-differentiate to a reticulate architecture comparable to their abaxial epidermal transfer cell counterparts formed in planta. <b>Uniform</b> wall <b>layer</b> construction commenced once adaxial epidermal cell expansion had ceased to overlay the original outer periclinal wall on its inner surface. In contrast to the dense ring-like lattice of cellulose microfibrils in the original primary wall, the <b>uniform</b> wall <b>layer</b> was characterized by a sparsely dispersed array of linear cellulose microfibrils. A re-modeled cortical microtubule array exerted no influence on <b>uniform</b> wall <b>layer</b> formation or on its cellulose microfibril organization. Surprisingly, formation of the <b>uniform</b> wall <b>layer</b> was not dependent upon depositing a cellulose scaffold. In contrast, uniform wall cellulose microfibrils were essential precursors for constructing wall ingrowth papillae. On converging to form wall ingrowth papillae, the cellulose microfibril diameters increased 3 -fold. This event correlated with up-regulated differential, and transfer-cell specific, expression of VfCesA 3 B while transcript levels of other cellulose biosynthetic-related genes linked with primary wall construction were substantially down-regulated...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} how that the {{combination}} of atomic deposition and nonlinear diffusion may lead, below a critical temperature, to the growth of nonuniform layers on a substrate. The dynamics of such a system is of the Cahn-Hilliard type, supplemented by reaction terms representing adsorption-desorption processes. The instability of growing <b>uniform</b> <b>layers</b> leads to the formation of nanostructures which correspond to regular spatial variations of substrate coverage. Patterns wavelengths and symmetries are selected by the dynamics and not by variational arguments. For temperatures below critical, one should observe hexagonal arrays of high coverage dots on the surface of otherwise <b>uniform</b> growing <b>layers.</b> On decreasing further the temperature, these structures should transform into hexagonal arrays of low coverage domains, within the growing layer. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.
