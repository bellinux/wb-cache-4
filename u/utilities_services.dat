50|$|An example {{application}} involves local utility user taxes. Utility user {{taxes are}} levied {{on the use}} of <b>utility</b> <b>services,</b> whether provided by a public or private entity, with the tax proceeds nearly always spent by local governments on purposes completely unrelated to the particular <b>utility</b> <b>service</b> being taxed. Local utility taxes are generally levied as a percentage of <b>utility</b> <b>service</b> cost, and are imposed in addition to local utility fees and charges. Utility user taxes typically appear as a separate charge on the local utility bill. Utility user taxes are imposed on one or more <b>utility</b> <b>services,</b> including water, electricity, sewer, gas, telephone, cable television, and refuse collection. When local utility rates are increased, the cost of <b>utility</b> <b>service</b> increases which generally also results in an increase in the amount of utility users tax that is paid by the consumer.|$|R
