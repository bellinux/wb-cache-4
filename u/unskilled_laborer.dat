25|$|It is {{difficult}} to give even rough comparative values for money from before the 20th century, as the range of products and services available for purchase was different. Classical historians often {{say that in the}} late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire (~27BC) the daily wage for an <b>unskilled</b> <b>laborer</b> and common soldier was 1 denarius (with no tax deductions) or about US$2.8 in bread. During the republic (509–27 BC), legionary pay was 112.5 denarii per year (0.3/day), later doubled by Julius Caesar to 225 denarii (0.6/day), with soldiers having to pay for their own food and arms. Centurions received considerably higher pay; under Augustus, the lowest rank of centurion was paid 3,750 denarii and the highest rank, 15,000 denarii.|$|E

Between 1970 and 1971 he drew four adaptation-comics (scripted by Cs. Horváth). He described these works as a by-pass in his career, discovering that comics production requires much more work and pays less than animation – as he stated in an interview. Although comics historians and critics praise his works for their art and stylistic diversity, they also agree on {{that the fact that}} he did not continue his career in this field, is a great loss to Hungarian comics.|$|E
