40|$|In this study, Photoshop {{software}} {{was used to}} do image analysis on the photos of spun yarns. The result showed that yarn could {{be divided into two}} parts: the surface hairs and the stem. Based on this finding, a mathematical model of yarn unevenness was built to analyze the relationship between yarn unevenness and surface hairiness. The relationships among the coefficients of mass variance of the yarn, the stem and the surface hairs, expressed as CVt, CVs and CVh, respectively, were investigated in detail. Results indicate that the CVs of an <b>uneven</b> <b>yarn</b> always coincides with the irregularity of the yarn hairiness. More specifically, the CVt of a yarn cannot be better than those of both yarn hairiness and stem (CVh and CVs), even if one of them is excessive. It is rare for CVt to be higher than CVs after removal of yarn hairs. In particular, it is irrational for the CVt value to be higher than both CVs and CVh, which prompts a rethinking of the exact distribution of yarn hairs on the yarn bod...|$|E
50|$|Novelty yarns are {{sometimes}} referred to as complex yarns. A yarn which makes a fabric is not always smooth and uniform. Complex <b>yarns</b> are the <b>uneven</b> <b>yarns</b> which may be thick and thin or have curls, loops, twists and even differently coloured areas along their length. This look of the yarns are used to add interesting effects in fabrics. In complex ply two or more complex yarns are twisted around each other to form loops, curls and knots to create fancy effects. Many knitting yarns are complex ply yarns which give interesting textures in finished products.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the shock attenuation properties of long pile synthetic turf. To investigate these properties using a modeling and simulation method, an appropriate model based on reliable data and a precise identification method is required. In previous studies, unstable data were often observed because <b>uneven</b> top <b>yarns</b> had sprouted from the infill material. Therefore, the properties of the infill part, buried yarns and infill materials should be considered first, because sprouted yarn causes unstable shock attenuation. For this reason, special construction specimens with different hardness levels and which had almost no sprouted yarn were prepared, and multi-intensity multi-area impact tests and parameter identification were performed for each specimen. The results show that stable data could be acquired for parameter identification, and the findings indicate the applicability of the modeling and simulation method for evaluating the shock attenuation properties of long pile synthetic turf...|$|R
