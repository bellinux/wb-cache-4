5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth ₤400,000 (c.£1,057,000). In her will June left ₤230,000 (c.£608,000 in 2016), and Nevill left ₤380,000 (c.£1,004,000); Bamber was a major beneficiary of both wills. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which <b>upset</b> <b>him</b> and the boys.|$|E
5|$|Fender's form {{dipped in}} 1924 {{after a good}} start with bat and ball; thereafter, despite {{occasional}} successes, he lacked consistency. Surrey {{finished third in the}} Championship, and Fender contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all first-class matches. Once again, Fender was a candidate for the England captaincy—South Africa played a Test series that season, and the MCC were to tour Australia in 1924–25. The eventual appointment of Arthur Gilligan was criticised in the press, which again speculated why Fender was not chosen. Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell of wet weather. Fender pointed out in a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the Scarborough Festival, despite their claims to the contrary. When Fender next played at Lord's, the furious Lord Harris summoned Fender to admonish him. Fender always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any chance he had of the England captaincy. Fender played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped; he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select Fender. When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, Fender was not selected, a decision which <b>upset</b> <b>him</b> deeply. Fender was married {{at the end of the}} 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the Daily Express.|$|E

25|$|Williams {{released}} a statement on social media branding the comments about her unborn child as racist, noting that it saddened her {{that we live in}} a society where these comments can be made. Năstase then apologised on social media regarding the comments he made about Williams, but made comments about Konta speaking to the umpire which <b>upset</b> <b>him.</b> In a further interview with the BBC, Năstase justified his comments to Konta stating that he only abused her after being ejected from the court and did so as a fan rather than a captain. Năstase additionally added that he regretted his behaviour in the incident. Nastase was not invited to the French Open and Wimbledon following his suspension. The Madrid Open however invited Nastase to be part of the prize giving ceremony, which ironically was won by Halep (another Romanian player). This was a move that was deemed irresponsible by the WTA who had revoked Nastase's privileges while the ITF carried out its investigation.|$|E

The prince bids an emotional farewell to the narrator and states that if {{it looks as though}} he has died, it is only because his body was too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will <b>upset</b> <b>him.</b> The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince consoles the narrator by saying that he only need look at the stars to think of the prince's lovable laughter, and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away from the narrator and allows the snake to bite him, soundlessly falling down.|$|E
25|$|Miller's second novel, , {{was written}} in 1927–28, {{initially}} {{under the guise of}} a novel written by June. A rich older admirer of June, Roland Freedman, paid her to write the novel; she would show him pages of Miller's work each week, pretending it was hers. The book went unpublished until 1992, 65 years after it was written and 12 years after Miller’s death. Moloch is based on Miller’s first marriage, to Beatrice, and his years working as a personnel manager at the Western Union office in Lower Manhattan. A third novel written around this time, Crazy Cock, also went unpublished until after Miller's death. Initially titled Lovely Lesbians, Crazy Cock (along with his later novel Nexus) told the story of June's close relationship with the artist Marion, whom June had renamed Jean Kronski. Kronski lived with Miller and June from 1926 until 1927, when June and Kronski went to Paris together, leaving Miller behind, which <b>upset</b> <b>him</b> greatly. Miller suspected the pair of having a lesbian relationship. While in Paris, June and Kronski did not get along, and June returned to Miller several months later. Kronski committed suicide around 1930.|$|E

The pop singer stated that television footage of the war <b>upset</b> <b>him</b> and that he wanted to go to Yugoslavia to hug every one of the suffering children.

He explained that the aspect of the storyline which <b>upset</b> <b>him</b> most was Wellard being run over [...] "so the scriptwriters could engineer the inevitable last-minute dash to the airport", questioning: [...] "What's Wellard ever done to deserve that?" [...] The storyline which saw Wellard threatened with euthanasia after biting Ian Beale received negative reviews from critics, deemed [...] "bizarre" [...] by James Desborough of The People, and the [...] "longest, most tedious ever soap storyline" [...] by Jim Shelley of The Mirror. Bushell simply wrote: [...] "Wellard bit Ian Beale. Which one needs the Tetanus jab?" [...] Tim Teeman of The Times called it the [...] "daftest" [...] storyline of the year, comparing it to a similarly ill-received and long-running storyline given to the unpopular Ferreira family.|$|E
500|$|But most of all, McGovern {{was known}} for his {{continued}} opposition to the Vietnam War. In March 1969, he became the first senator to explicitly criticize the new president's policy there, an action that was seen as a breach of customary protocol by other Senate doves. The diversion during these years of much of Food for Peace's aid to South Vietnam, instead of other badly stricken countries around the world, greatly <b>upset</b> <b>him.</b> By the end of 1969, McGovern was calling for an immediate cease-fire and a total withdrawal of all American troops within a year. In October 1969, McGovern was a featured speaker before 100,000demonstrators in Boston at the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, and in November he spoke before 350,000 at Moratorium/Mobilization's anti-war march to the Washington Monument. Afterward, he decided that radicalized peace demonstrations were counterproductive and criticized anti-war figures such as Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Huey Newton, Abbie Hoffman, and Jerry Rubin as [...] "reckless" [...] and [...] "irresponsible".|$|E
500|$|Tenebrae had a wide {{theatrical}} release throughout Italy and mainland Europe, {{something the}} director very much needed after having suffered major distribution {{problems with his}} previous film, Inferno. Released on 28 October 1982, Tenebrae saw modest success {{at the box office}} in Italy and Europe, but it did not perform {{as well as some of}} Argento's previous films. In Italy, Tenebrae had been released with a VM18 rating, meaning it could not be seen legally by persons under the age of eighteen. Argento had desired a VM14 rating, both to attract a younger audience and to increase the film's chances of commercial success. Tenebrae features scenes of female homosexuality; attitudes towards homosexuality in Italy were fairly conservative at the time, and Argento said he wanted to [...] "recount this subject freely and in an open manner, without interference or being ashamed". The VM18 rating <b>upset</b> <b>him,</b> as he believed it was a result of the sexual diversity on display rather than the film's violence.|$|E

500|$|After {{about two}} weeks the band had around 65 pieces of music. With {{engineer}} Andy Jackson back on the team, and Bob Ezrin as co-producer, production moved to Gilmour's houseboat and recording studio, Astoria. The band listened to and voted on each track, and whittled the material down to about 27 pieces of music. Eliminating some tracks, and merging others, they arrived at about eleven songs. Song selection was based upon a system of points, whereby all three members would award marks out of ten to each candidate song, a system skewed somewhat by Wright's decision to award his songs ten points each, and the other songs no points. Wright was not contractually a full member of the band, a situation which <b>upset</b> <b>him.</b> Wright reflected: [...] "It {{came very close to}} a point where I wasn't going to do the album, because I didn't feel that what we'd agreed was fair." [...] Wright received his first songwriting credits on any Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here.|$|E
500|$|In January 1965, McGovern {{made his}} first major address on Vietnam, saying that [...] "We are not winning in South Vietnam... I am very much opposed to the policy, now gaining support in Washington, of {{extending}} the war to the north." [...] McGovern instead proposed a five-point plan advocating a negotiated settlement involving a federated Vietnam with local autonomy and a UNpresence to guarantee security and fair treatment. The speech gave McGovern national visibility {{as one of the}} [...] "doves" [...] in the debate over Vietnam. However, McGovern made moderate-to-hawkish statements at times too, flatly rejecting unconditional withdrawal of U.S.forces and criticizing anti-war draft-card burnings as [...] "immature, impractical, and illegal". He eschewed personal criticism of Johnson. In November 1965, McGovern traveled to South Vietnam for three weeks. The human carnage he saw in hospital wards deeply <b>upset</b> <b>him,</b> and he became increasingly outspoken about the war upon his return, more convinced than ever that Vietnam was a political, not military, problem. Now he was ready, as he later said, [...] "not merely to dissent, but to crusade" [...] against the war.|$|E

In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." [...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often <b>upset</b> <b>him</b> because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My mother kept telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants {{to play the piano}} when he could be out playing football?" ...|$|E

Nefer recalled: [...] "I heard Jimi talk to Devon... she was mad... she went into fits... Jimi said 'Devon, get off my back'". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him that she would have to go back to work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor George Lazenby, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and shouted over the phone to Nefer: [...] "You're nothing but a fucking groupie", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange <b>upset</b> <b>him,</b> and he told Nefer: [...] "Don't you ever go out to that guy again". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not want to quit her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning.|$|E
500|$|Steiger {{was married}} five times: he married actress Sally Gracie (1952–1958), actress Claire Bloom (1959–1969), {{secretary}} Sherry Nelson (1973–1979), singer Paula Ellis (1986–1997) and actress Joan Benedict Steiger (married 2000 until his death). He had a daughter, opera singer Anna Steiger (born in 1960) by Bloom, and a son, Michael Steiger (born in 1993), from {{his marriage to}} Ellis. In an interview with journalist Kenneth Passingham, Steiger stated that Bloom was [...] "all I ever wanted in a woman", and that [...] "maybe our marriage was better than most because we were both established when we met". The couple bought a home in Malibu, California, a community that appealed to Steiger but which Bloom found boring. They also purchased an apartment in Manhattan and a cottage in County Galway, {{in close proximity to}} John Huston's home. Financial considerations led Steiger to sell their New York apartment in the mid-1970s. It <b>upset</b> <b>him</b> greatly when his marriage with Bloom ended in 1969 and that she quickly remarried Broadway producer Hillard Elkins the same year, a man whom Steiger had entrusted to care for her while he was away shooting Waterloo. Steiger was also close friends with actress Elizabeth Taylor.|$|E
500|$|In September 1944 Smith went on {{a second}} magical retirement, during which he {{performed}} pranayama and the lesser banishing ritual of the pentagram, invoked Thoth, and recited the Holy Books of Thelema from memory. During the retreat he learned that Kahl, his former lover, had died, which greatly <b>upset</b> <b>him.</b> Returning to his Pasadena home, he was welcomed by Parsons, but Crowley insisted that Smith be shunned by the lodge members, and so he moved back to Hollywood. Increasingly alienated by Crowley's attitude, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. in August 1946. Now renting a house, Smith sought out various handyman jobs, {{when he learned that}} Crowley had died and been succeeded as OHO of the O.T.O. by Germer. He became good friends with the art dealer Baron Ernst von Harringa, who commissioned Smith to construct Asian-style furniture for his gallery. Smith's own health was deteriorating, and in 1948 he suffered from a number of mild heart attacks. He nevertheless continued to believe in Thelema, and hoped to revive the Church of Thelema through performing the Gnostic Mass once more. Following Parsons' death in an explosion [...] which Smith suspected was a case of suicide [...] Smith was invited to perform the Gnostic Mass in his memory.|$|E
