500|$|Whitehead was unimpressed by this objection. [...] In {{the notes}} {{of one of}} his {{students}} for a 1927 class, Whitehead was quoted as saying: [...] "Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics. [...] What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized." [...] In Whitehead's view, scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the <b>universe</b> <b>works</b> all the time, but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned. [...] While Whitehead acknowledged that [...] "philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles," [...] he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the <b>universe</b> <b>works</b> if philosophy and science are to make any real progress, even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic. [...] For this reason Whitehead regarded metaphysical investigations as essential to both good science and good philosophy.|$|E

500|$|Le Guin {{identifies}} {{herself with}} feminism, and {{is interested in}} non-violence and ecological awareness. She has participated in demonstrations against the Vietnam War and nuclear weapons. These sympathies {{can be seen in}} several of her works of fiction, including the Hainish <b>universe</b> <b>works.</b> The novels of the Hainish universe frequently explore the effects of differing social and political systems, although she displays a preference for a [...] "society that governs by consensus, a communal cooperation without external government." [...] Her fiction also frequently challenges accepted depictions of race and gender.|$|E
500|$|Wieman's words proved prophetic. [...] Though Process and Reality {{has been}} called [...] "arguably the most {{impressive}} single metaphysical text of the twentieth century," [...] it has been little-read and little-understood, partly because it demands – as Isabelle Stengers puts it – [...] "that its readers accept the adventure {{of the questions that}} will separate them from every consensus." [...] Whitehead questioned western philosophy's most dearly held assumptions about how the <b>universe</b> <b>works,</b> but in doing so he managed to anticipate a number of 21st century scientific and philosophical problems and provide novel solutions.|$|E
500|$|In ancient Taoist texts, wu-wei is {{associated}} with water through its yielding nature. Taoist philosophy, {{in accordance with the}} I Ching, proposes that the <b>universe</b> <b>works</b> harmoniously according to its own ways. When someone exerts their will against the world {{in a manner that is}} out of rhythm with the cycles of change, they may disrupt that harmony and unintended consequences may more likely result rather than the willed outcome. Taoism does not identify one's will as the root problem. Rather, it asserts that one must place their will in harmony with the natural universe. Thus, a potentially harmful interference may be avoided, and in this way, goals can be achieved effortlessly. [...] "By wu-wei, the sage seeks to come into harmony with the great Tao, which itself accomplishes by nonaction." ...|$|E
