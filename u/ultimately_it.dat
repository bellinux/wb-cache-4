5|$|In {{the scene}} where the Simpsons' house {{transforms}} into numerous objects, {{one of the original}} designs included the house made entirely of squirrels. The layout artist who designed it worked on the drawings for more than two days, but <b>ultimately</b> <b>it</b> was cut. To ensure their work did not go to waste, some staff members have used the drawings on Christmas cards and other studio-related notices.|$|E
5|$|The low ratings doomed {{the show}} to a single season and, {{although}} admired, it has never developed a significant following among science fiction aficionados. Boucher has stated that, in retrospect, he feels that the series was too outlandish for crime drama fans and not outlandish enough for science fiction fans and that <b>ultimately</b> <b>it</b> appealed to neither.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ultimately,</b> <b>it</b> seemed {{unlikely}} that any media company, particularly the major studios and television network making Inferno and 12 Monkeys, would risk the negative publicity that would come from using the images in the spectrograms and a suggested threat against a U.S. president.|$|E

5|$|Although al-Jamri's {{death was}} {{announced}} in the morning, the mourning processions only began after the sunset Maghrib prayer. The funeral course was changed several times. <b>Ultimately,</b> <b>it</b> began at 6:00 in Muqsha village before moving along {{the west side of}} Budaiya highway to Bani Jamra, where al-Jamri was buried at 10:00. The weather was extremely cold for Bahrain, yet thousands showed up wearing black mourning clothes and carrying black flags. According to a number of Al-Wasat writers, the funeral was the largest in the modern history of Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|An early {{design was}} for a version with a {{secondary}} hull, but {{it appeared to be}} too similar to the ship seen in The Original Series. That throwback styling had been partially inspired by Berman viewing the throwback concept in the 2002 Ford Thunderbird, itself a modern update of the original Thunderbird. Following that concept, the designers took the styling of the USS Enterprise from The Original Series and updated it, but <b>ultimately</b> <b>it</b> looked too much like a simple update to the same vessel.|$|E
5|$|Later, Doggett confronts Kersh, {{who was not}} {{implicated in}} the conspiracy. Kersh {{explains}} to Doggett that he left the evidence that helped Doggett, {{and that he had}} told Mulder to flee, but <b>ultimately</b> <b>it</b> was Scully who actually convinced Mulder to do so. Meanwhile, Scully dreams of McMahon's and Rohrer's lifeless bodies below the harbor. Suddenly, she sees McMahon's eyes snap open. Scully wakes up and the episode cuts to William's mobile; it begins to move on its own accord.|$|E

5000|$|The UN Secretary General's {{described}} the incident as [...] "disputes between individual states".

5|$|Sulla, who had {{observed}} the violent results of radical populare reforms (in particular those under Marius and Cinna), was naturally conservative, {{and so his}} conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary. As such, he sought to strengthen the aristocracy, and thus the senate. After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC, he enacted a series of constitutional reforms. He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC, retired in 79 BC, and died a year later. While he {{thought that he had}} firmly established aristocratic rule, his own career had illustrated the fatal weaknesses in the constitution. <b>Ultimately,</b> <b>it</b> was the army, and not the senate, which dictated the fortunes of the state.|$|E
5|$|The Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds {{is based}} on the {{enactment}} Reichsgesetzblatt I S. 613 of 28 September 1941 to reward those servicemen who had already been awarded the Oak Leaves with Swords to the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. <b>Ultimately,</b> <b>it</b> would be awarded to twenty-seven German soldiers, sailors and airmen, ranging from young fighter pilots to field marshals. Two recipients were members of the U-boat arm.|$|E

One of them was offered for auction through Sotheby's in late 2007 and was expected to sell for £50,000 (US$77,000, €69,000); <b>ultimately</b> <b>it</b> was bought for £1.95million ($3million, €2.7million) by Amazon, making the selling price the highest achieved at auction for a modern literary manuscript. The money earned at the auction of the book was donated to The Children's Voice charity campaign.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} I-590 between Winton Road and the Can of Worms was {{originally}} {{constructed in the}} 1960s and designated as part of NY47 from Elmwood Avenue northward. In the late 1970s, I-590 was proposed as a designation for the entire southern half of the Outer Loop. <b>Ultimately,</b> <b>it</b> was cut back to its current western terminus at the then-proposed I-390. I-590 was officially assigned in 1980 following the elimination of NY47, and the last segment of the freeway between Winton Road and I-390 was completed by the following year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ultimately,</b> <b>it</b> was the German {{forces on}} {{who took the}} {{initiative}} by launching Operation Citadel on 5 July {{in the area around}} Kursk. German losses were initially heavy due to Soviet defensive preparations. Taking advantage of this, on 12 July, Bagramyan's forces commenced their offensive, codenamed Operation Kutuzov, and quickly breached the German defenses, advancing a distance of 45 miles (72km) by 18 July. By 28 July, the operation concluded successfully and he was promoted to the rank of Colonel-General. In the following month, his forces took part in the large-scale tank offensives which routed the German assaults and forced Germany to remain on the defensive {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|With {{new players}} and using Chapman's system, Huddersfield were transformed. They {{finished}} third in 1922–23 {{and went on to}} win their first League title in 1923–24. This success was by the narrowest of margins – equal on points with Cardiff City, Huddersfield won by a difference of 0.024 (1.818 to 1.794) in goal average. The final goal by Brown in a 3–0 win over Nottingham Forest {{on the final day of}} the season proved crucial, although <b>ultimately</b> <b>it</b> was Huddersfield's superior defensive record which had given them the advantage.|$|E

5|$|A Company—now under Lieutenant Lawrence Clark {{following}} Chitts' wounding that afternoon—had {{only just}} succeeded in breaking contact from the Chinese, suffering a number killed and wounded during a confused withdrawal. Meanwhile, B Company {{had also been}} forced to fight its way down the hill. Both companies were now well clear of their former positions and {{would have had a}} hard time fighting their way back. <b>Ultimately</b> <b>it</b> was too late for the Australians to regain the feature in darkness, and the weight of the Chinese attack continued to mount. Only D Company on the southern right flank—which had been left unmolested—was able to regain its previous position on Hill 63. Meanwhile, the positions previously occupied by A and B Companies were occupied by the Chinese in superior numbers, and the remainder of 3 RAR concentrated at the railway crossing instead. At 22:00 Coad arranged to shell and mortar the relinquished ridge, while a standing patrol from the Middlesex was posted on the south-western side of the Maenjung-dong pass in anticipation of a renewed Chinese attack. However, following heavy fighting the pressure on the Australians unexpectedly ceased after midnight, and parties of Chinese were observed beginning to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1942, the Meriden {{authorities}} {{indicated that}} {{they could no longer}} house the PLC boarders, so Lauriston (now the primary school of Santa Sabina College) and Welbeck, on The Boulevarde at Strathfield, were rented for them. The PLC Council nearly kept the school at Strathfield permanently, but <b>ultimately</b> <b>it</b> was decided that PLC would reopen once again at Croydon in first term 1946. The military agreed to pay for the extensive renovations that were required, Lauriston and Welbeck were disposed of in 1946, and the Lingwood property was retained as a preparatory school. Evidence of PLC's wartime occupation remain, with tunnels and bomb shelters accessible from below the stage of College Hall. A plaque presented to the school by the RAAF, in commemoration of PLC's wartime involvement, {{can be found on the}} school verandah at the entrance to the Main School.|$|E
5|$|Being {{frozen in}} an iceberg {{for a hundred}} years while in the Avatar State drained much of Aang's life energy. While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered middle age in his 50s, the strain of this {{exertion}} increasingly weighed upon his body. <b>Ultimately,</b> <b>it</b> resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would be powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into the Southern Water Tribe female Korra. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist Zaheer) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.|$|E

5000|$|Watch My Mouth is {{the second}} album by rapper Cazwell. Watch My Mouth is his first {{full-length}} album, with eight bonus tracks. Cazwell described {{the music of the}} album as [...] "dance more than anything else. There are some hip hop elements, but I wouldn’t call it a hip hop album. All the songs are different because I worked with different producers. <b>Ultimately</b> <b>it’s</b> a lighthearted dance rap album." ...|$|R

5|$|Brumfield {{demanded the}} right to return to Hill 82 in order to destroy the bunker system and to recover the bodies of Parker and Gillson, and he and Major John Essex-Clark—the {{operations}} officer—began planning a battalion attack. However, with American casualties rising and all available helicopters required for casualty evacuation, the planned operation was cancelled. The thick jungle canopy compounded the issue, and Williamson decided to stage the casualties through an area secured by the Australians at LZ Princess. Operation Hump concluded on 9 November, with the US 1/503rd Battalion and 1 RAR being extracted by helicopter and returning to Bien Hoa in the late afternoon. Following 1 RAR's return to Bien Hoa, Brumfield continued to petition for permission to conduct the operation. A battalion attack was subsequently planned for 14 November, but Williamson later deferred it dependent {{on the availability of}} air and helicopter support, and the start date of the upcoming Operation New Life. <b>Ultimately</b> <b>it</b> was never conducted.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of the 20th century it was clear that Gibraltar could be bombarded with {{relative}} impunity from the Spanish mainland. Proposals were put forward to build a new harbour {{on the east side of}} the Rock, where ships would be less vulnerable to direct artillery fire from the mainland, but were abandoned due to the vast expense and only marginal gains in security. A new round of tunnelling was carried out to provide more bombproof accommodation for the garrison, along with deep shelters and casemates capable of accommodating 2,000 men. <b>Ultimately</b> <b>it</b> was decided in 1906 that Gibraltar faced no credible threat from land and that the defences would be organised to deal with a threat from the sea.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{problems}} with the opposition did not end with the Falkirk campaign. Over the following years he would be held up to the promises he had made, in particular that of upholding the Charter of the Forest. In the parliament of 1301, the King was forced to order {{an assessment of the}} royal forests, but in 1305 he obtained a papal bull that freed him from this concession. <b>Ultimately,</b> <b>it</b> was a failure in personnel that spelt the end of the opposition against EdwardI. Bohun died late in 1298, after returning from the Falkirk campaign. As for Bigod, in 1302 he arrived at an agreement with the King that was beneficial for both: Bigod, who had no children, made Edward his heir, in return for a generous annual grant. Edward finally got his revenge on Winchelsey in 1305, when Clement V was elected pope. Clement was a Gascon sympathetic to the King, and on Edward's instigation had Winchelsey suspended from office.|$|E
