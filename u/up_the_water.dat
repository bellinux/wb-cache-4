5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> runs off rapidly, the water courses can dry up in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E

25|$|For {{more than}} 1,000 years, the {{inhabitants}} of Oxyrhynchus dumped garbage at a series of sites {{out in the desert}} sands beyond the town limits. The fact that the town was built on a canal rather than on the Nile itself was important, because this meant that the area did not flood every year with the rising of the river, as did the districts along the riverbank. When the canals dried <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> table fell and never rose again. The area west of the Nile has virtually no rain, so the garbage dumps of Oxyrhynchus were gradually covered with sand and were forgotten for another 1,000 years.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of March 12, 1595, Nevado del Ruiz erupted. The episode {{consisted}} of three Plinian eruptions, which were heard up to [...] from {{the summit of the}} volcano. A large amount of ash was ejected, which completely darkened the surrounding area. The volcano also erupted lapilli (a form of tephra) and pumice bombs. In total, the eruption produced 0.16km3 of tephra. The eruption was preceded by a large precursor earthquake three days before. The eruption caused lahars, which traveled down the valleys of the nearby Gualí and Lagunillas rivers, clogging <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> killing fish and destroying vegetation.

[...] "As the kernel begins to heat <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> vapor inside of the kernel will also become very hot, increasing the pressure inside of the hull. Around 212°F (100°C) the internal water will expand into steam and create an outward force on the hull because of the increasing kinetic energy as the molecules begin to move faster and faster. The pressure is increasing as the temperature increases. Finally, the kernel will fracture once the pressure inside reaches 135 lbs/in^2. (Pressure is equal to average force / unit area)."

2500|$|If water {{enters the}} airways of a {{conscious}} person, the person {{will try to}} cough <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> or swallow it, often inhaling more water involuntarily. [...] When water enters the larynx or trachea, both conscious and unconscious persons experience laryngospasm, in which the vocal cords constrict, sealing the airway. [...] This prevents water from entering the lungs. Because of this laryngospasm, in the initial phase of drowning, water generally enters the stomach and very little water enters the lungs. Though laryngospasm prevents water from entering the lungs, it also interferes with breathing. In most persons, the laryngospasm relaxes some time after unconsciousness and water can then enter the lungs causing a [...] "wet drowning". [...] However, about 7–10% of people maintain this seal until cardiac arrest. This has been called [...] "dry drowning", as no water enters the lungs. [...] In forensic pathology, water in the lungs indicates that the person was still alive {{at the point of}} submersion. Absence of water in the lungs may be either a dry drowning or indicates a death before submersion.|$|E

On 1 August 1900, the British cruiser [...] narrowly avoided colliding with Iowa in the straits near Victoria (British Columbia) during a dense fog. At another point during these years, a manhole plate of a boiler blew open and the determined actions of five crewmen (see below) spared the ship from further disaster. Iowa left the Pacific in 1902 to become the flagship of the South Atlantic Squadron. She went to New York arriving February 1903 and was again decommissioned in June.|$|E
