5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living in the material squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– <b>underscores</b> the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or not these range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range <b>underscores</b> the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E
5|$|In {{standard}} {{models of}} international trade a fall {{in the price of}} a country's export good – a deterioration in its terms of trade – generally decreases the home country's welfare. In the Brander–Spencer model however the opposite is true. This is because in this model the markets are not perfectly competitive and the revenue from the expanded quantity sold compensates the firm for the revenue lost from the lower export price. If the good produced by the firm is also consumed domestically however the result is a bit more complicated. In the case where the firm is able to separate the home and export market (charge different prices in each with no possibility of third party arbitrage) then the level of the optimal subsidies will depend on whether marginal costs of production are constant, increasing or decreasing. The optimal subsidy level is either the same, higher or lower, respectively, compared to the level with no domestic consumption. This <b>underscores</b> the need {{on the part of the}} government for very precise information on industry structure and firm's cost functions.|$|E

5|$|Purified MAM from {{subcellular}} fractionation {{has been}} shown to be enriched in enzymes involved in phospholipid exchange, in addition to channels associated with Ca2+ signaling. These hints of a prominent role for the MAM in the regulation of cellular lipid stores and signal transduction have been borne out, with significant implications for mitochondrial-associated cellular phenomena, as discussed below. Not only has the MAM provided insight into the mechanistic basis underlying such physiological processes as intrinsic apoptosis and the propagation of calcium signaling, but it also favors a more refined view of the mitochondria. Though often seen as static, isolated 'powerhouses' hijacked for cellular metabolism through an ancient endosymbiotic event, the evolution of the MAM <b>underscores</b> the extent to which mitochondria have been integrated into overall cellular physiology, with intimate physical and functional coupling to the endomembrane system.|$|E

40|$|<b>Underscore</b> Alchemy is a {{research}} project designed to investigate how artists from disciplines outside the performing arts might engage with Nancy Stark Smith’s collaborative improvisation model, the <b>Underscore,</b> {{in order to enhance}} their creative practices. Creative artists with limited prior experience of somatic practices were invited to participate in a series of research workshops based on Smith’s <b>Underscore.</b> These participants were offered somatic exercises based on everyday movements by facilitators trained in contact and improvisation, within an egalitarian workshop culture. This phenomenological study captured data generated through practice as well as qualitative data, analysis of which suggests that the <b>Underscore</b> can be successfully adapted for artists working in non-dance disciplines. This article looks at the role Smith’s <b>Underscore</b> played in <b>Underscore</b> Alchemy, entailing an investigation of how contact manifested through rhythmic and visual patterns, as well as how these creative artists from a variety of disciplines engaged with improvisation through attention to the experiential body...|$|R

50|$|These names may be {{interpreted}} by the compiler and have some effect, though this is generally done at the semantic analysis phase, not the tokenization phase.

5000|$|As early {{output devices}} (both CRT's and printers) could not produce {{more than one}} {{character}} at a location, {{it was not possible}} to <b>underscore</b> text, so common character sets of the 1950s had no <b>underscore.</b> IBM's EBCDIC character-coding system, introduced in 1964, added the <b>underscore,</b> which IBM referred to as the [...] "break character." [...] IBM's report on NPL (the early name of what is now called PL/I) leaves the character set undefined, but specifically mentions the break character, and gives RATE_OF_PAY as an example identifier. By 1967 the <b>underscore</b> had spread to ASCII, replacing the similarly-shaped left-arrow character (←) previously residing at code point 95 (5F hex) in ASCII-1963 (see also: PIP). C, developed at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, allowed the <b>underscore</b> as an alphabetic character.|$|R

40|$|Background: The work {{presents}} the results {{at the time of}} publication of my ongoing enquiry <b>Underscore</b> Alchemy that explores how Nancy Stark Smith’s model for practicing and researching improvised dance (the <b>Underscore)</b> can be used by other creative artists. The <b>Underscore</b> has been extensively practiced by dancers and other artists in the performing arts but it remains under-theorised. I recruited artists for a series of practice-led research experiments presented as workshops. My research questions were: can the <b>Underscore</b> be adapted for artists working in non-performance disciplines? How will they benefit from this collaborative creative model? Contribution: Data indicate that the <b>Underscore</b> can be successfully adapted for artists working in other disciplines. The artists used my adaptation of the <b>Underscore</b> to work in their own medium to produce individual and collaborative works of art whilst practicing a transferable model for creative work. Artists worked in an inter- and multidisciplinary way regardless of their usual practice. Participants indicated they experienced something they can apply in their future professional lives. They drew attention to the physical preparation as an important part of their preparedness to improvise, create and collaborate. Significance: The work expresses research findings for the key audience of non-academic practitioners who are familiar with the <b>Underscore.</b> Contact Quarterly is the peak platform for practitioners and researchers of movement improvisation. The CQ Contact Improvisation Newsletter invites international contributions twice annually in print and online. Edited by Smith (creator of the <b>Underscore)</b> it was significant for me to publish my work in the magazine. Whilst Contact Quarterly publishes work about the intersections between improvised dance and other art forms it hadn’t before published work about this {{in the context of the}} <b>Underscore...</b>|$|R
