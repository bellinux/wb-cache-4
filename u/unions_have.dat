25|$|<b>Unions</b> <b>have</b> {{recently}} {{been engaged in}} a developing field of transnational labor regulation embodied in corporate codes of conduct. However, O'Brien cautions that <b>unions</b> <b>have</b> been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects. They worry that these codes could have legitimizing effects on companies that do not actually live up to good practices, and that companies could use codes to excuse or distract attention from the repression of unions.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, when Solidarity's current general secretary, Flip Buys, was appointed, {{the union}} was in dire {{financial}} straits. The extreme right-wing views {{associated with the}} <b>union</b> <b>had</b> led to a dramatic decline in popularity and membership: the <b>union</b> <b>had</b> only about 30 000 members left at that stage.

25|$|In contrast, {{in several}} European {{countries}} (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland), religious <b>unions</b> <b>have</b> existed for decades. These unions typically distanced themselves {{from some of}} the doctrines of orthodox Marxism, such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees' interests always are in conflict with those of employers. Some of these Christian <b>unions</b> <b>have</b> had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements and some do not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees' goals. In Poland, the biggest trade union Solidarity emerged as an anti-communist movement with religious nationalist overtones and today it supports the right-wing Law and Justice party.|$|E

Credit <b>unions</b> <b>have</b> historically claimed to provide superior member service and to be committed to helping members improve their financial situation. In the context of financial inclusion credit unions claim to provide a broader range of loan and savings products at a much cheaper cost to their members than do most microfinance institutions.|$|E
