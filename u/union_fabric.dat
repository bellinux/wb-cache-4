5000|$|The {{house was}} {{originally}} {{built as a}} farm house in 1840 in the Greek revival style. Little {{is known about the}} first occupants. In 1867, Wilbur Osborne, who owned and ran several industries in Derby, Ansonia and Bridgeport, and his wife, Ellen Lucy Davis, moved to the house. The couple ran a dairy farm in the surrounding land. Their sole surviving daughter, Frances, took over after her father's death and became a prominent businesswoman [...] - [...] president of the <b>Union</b> <b>Fabric</b> Co., vice president of Connecticut Clasp, treasurer of the F. Kelly Company, and a founding partner of Steels and Busks, Ltd. Of Leicester, England. She married Waldo Stewart Kellogg in 1919, and he took charge of the dairy, using selective breeding to make the herd [...] "famous throughout New England for quality milk production." [...] Waldo Kellogg enlarged and remodeled the house to its current form between 1919 and 1925.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{study was}} {{performed}} on the jute-cotton <b>union</b> <b>fabric</b> to show the effect of sizing on the properties of <b>union</b> <b>fabric.</b> Here, the cotton yarn was used in the warp direction and jute yarn was used in the weft direction. The size material was used only for warp yarn that is for cotton yarn. From the experimental results, it was seen that the strength of the sized <b>union</b> <b>fabric</b> was better than the unsized <b>union</b> <b>fabric</b> although the other properties were similar to each other. Comparing the properties of <b>union</b> <b>fabric</b> with 100 % cotton fabric, <b>union</b> <b>fabric</b> (jute-cotton) may be the replacement of 100 % same category of cotton fabric...|$|E
40|$|Jute-cotton and jute-wool <b>union</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{have been}} printed with {{colorant}} extracted from Rheum emodi with guar gum and albumin as thickening agents and aluminium sulphate, copper sulphate, and ferrous sulphate as mordants. Printing with Rheum emodi colorant with different mordants resulted in different shades ranging from yellowish brown, deep brown, reddish brown, and gray shades to olive black. The K/S value showed that mordants, namely, CuSO 4 and FeSO 4, exhibited high colour absorption {{regardless of the}} nature of material used. All the printed samples have good to excellent wash, rubbing and light fastness properties regardless {{of the nature of}} materials, mordants, and thickeners used. Guar gum is closely at par with albumin as a thickening agent and considering the cost and availability of raw material, guar gum is the better choice for the textile industry...|$|R
30|$|Dyeing {{of fabric}} blends such as Cotton/Nylon (C/N) is {{presently}} dyed by two-bath or one-bath two-step dyeing. Good solidity of hue and depth is more critical in 50 : 50 blends and in <b>union</b> <b>fabrics,</b> such as nylon warp stretch fabrics, containing cotton or nylon/cotton wefts for swim wear and narrow fabrics, crimped nylon warp/viscose filament dress wear, or cotton warp/nylon weft constructions for uniforms, rain wear or work wear. Cotton/nylon {{is also used}} in socks. Nylon being a polyamide contains many amide groups in its structure. It also contains free amine groups {{at the ends of}} its polymeric chains, although the number of these free amine groups is less than the number of carboxylic groups, and the fiber possesses a negative charge unless in the appropriate pH region (Haji et al. 2014). These amine groups provide excellent electrostatic and hydrogen bonding sites and are the main factors contributing to the substantively of the dye molecules. Acid dyes have very little affinity for cotton, but cationic cotton can be dyed readily with acid dyes. The ammonium groups act as dye sites (Run-ling 2010).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{dimensional}} stability of silk and model <b>union</b> knitted <b>fabric</b> as also the effect of loop length on the knitting of silk and modal yarn in plaited structure. Silk material has exceptional lustre and good tenacity among the natural fibres. Silk knitted fabric {{is regarded as a}} special product that can hold its own and survive in the competitive and diversified global textile market. With regard to silk-filament yarn knitting, it has been observed that the number of plies in the yarn and the yarn twist are interrelated and their effect on fabric properties is significant...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} is performed on jute-cotton <b>union</b> <b>fabric</b> produced from twill structures. The main object {{of this study}} is to find out how physical properties of the produced fabric is affected by the weave structures in order to increase the uses of biodegradable jute diversified products and to replace the synthetic polymers and costlier cotton. Two fabric samples; 2 / 2 twill noted by “A ” and 3 / 1 twill noted by “B ” are produced from same EPI and PPI in value. Here, the jute yarn of 413 tex (6 lbs/spy- 2 ply) is used in weft direction and cotton yarn of 177 tex (10 s- 3 ply) is used in warp direction. From the experiment, the comparative results of both the samples on average tensile strength, abrasion resistance, drape co-efficient, bending length, flexural rigidity are analyzed to exhibit the effect of twill structures to perform the task for diversified use and apparel purposes in the near future...|$|E
40|$|The dye {{ability of}} the Jute/Cotton <b>union</b> <b>fabric</b> with cotton yarn in the warp and Jute: Cotton yarns in the weft {{direction}} were studied with different percentage of Jute/Cotton blend in weft direction. The K/S and colour tristimulus values of (reactive dye) the different formulations (Jute/cotton: 30 : 70, 40 : 60, 50 : 50 and 70 : 30) after and before the softening finish were studied. The experiment focuses {{on the effect of}} jute content on the colour strength and fastness properties of finished fabric. The result reveals that, the colour strength value (K/S) was higher in the case of fabric proportion with more jute (70 : 30 jute/cotton). The finishing process has significant influence on the colour strength value (p< 0. 05). The fastness properties including light, washing, rubbing and perspiration of dyed fabrics were also satisfactory. To analyse the effect of jute proportion on colour strength and the effect of finishing on colour value, ANOVA was performed...|$|E
50|$|The CMP wore {{a simpler}} cotton <b>fabric</b> <b>union</b> suit called the Constant Wear Garment (CWG) {{underneath}} the TSLA {{instead of the}} water cooled Liquid Cooling Garment. His cooling came directly from the flow of oxygen into his suit via an umbilical from the spacecraft environmental control system. When not performing lunar EVA's, the LMP and CDR also wore a CWG instead of the LCG.|$|R
