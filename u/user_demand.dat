5|$|Telecommunication and {{broadcast}} networks {{can be affected}} by volcanic ash in the following ways: attenuation and reduction of signal strength; damage to equipment; and overloading of network through <b>user</b> <b>demand.</b> Signal attenuation due to volcanic ash is not well documented; however, {{there have been reports}} of disrupted communications following the 1969 Surtsey eruption and 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption. Research by the New Zealand-based Auckland Engineering Lifelines Group determined theoretically that impacts on telecommunications signals from ash would be limited to low frequency services such as satellite communication. Signal interference may also be caused by lightning, as this is frequently generated within volcanic eruption plumes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Server {{selection}} {{is an important}} problem of cloud computing in which cloud service providers direct <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> to servers {{in one of the}} multiple data centers located in different geographical locations. The existing solutions usually assume homogeneity of cloud services (i. e., all users request the same type of service) and handle <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> in an individual basis which incurs high computational overhead. In this study, we propose a new and effective server selection scheme in which diversities of cloud services are taken into account. We focus on a specific cloud service, i. e., online video service, and assume that different videos have different bandwidth requirements. We group users into clusters and handle <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> on a cluster basis for faster and more efficient process. Given <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> and bandwidth capacities of servers in the data centers, our problem is to assign the <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> to the servers under the bandwidth constraint, such that the overall latency (measured by the network distance) between the user clusters and the selected servers is minimized. We design a server selection system and formulate this problem as a linear programming formulation which can be solved by existing techniques. The system periodically executes our scheme and computes an optimal solution for server selection. <b>User</b> <b>demands</b> are assigned to the servers according to the optimal solution and the minimum overall latency can be achieved. The simulation results show that our scheme is significantly better than the random algorithm and the YouTube server selection strategy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Cloud {{computing}} nowadays becomes quite {{popular among}} {{a community of}} cloud users by offering a variety of resources. However, burstiness in <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> often dramatically degrades the application performance. In order to satisfy peak <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> and meet Service Level Agreement (SLA), efficient resource allocation schemes are highly demanded in the cloud. However, we find that conventional load balancers unfortunately neglect cases of bursty arrivals and thus experience significant performance degradation. Motivated by this problem, we propose new burstiness-aware algorithms to balance bursty workloads across all computing sites, and thus to improve overall system performance. We present a smart load balancer, which leverages the knowledge of burstiness to predict the changes in <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> and on-the-fly shifts between the schemes that are “greedy ” (i. e., always select the best site) and “random ” (i. e., randomly select one) based on the predicted information. Both simulation and real experimental results show that this new load balancer can adapt quickly to the changes in <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> and thus improve performance by making a smart site selection for cloud users under both bursty and non-bursty workloads.

25|$|Nonetheless, as of 2002 most {{manufacturers}} still provided {{floppy disk}} drives as standard equipment to meet <b>user</b> <b>demand</b> for file-transfer and an emergency boot device, {{as well as}} for the general secure feeling of having the familiar device. By this time, the retail cost of a floppy drive had fallen to around $20, so there was little financial incentive to omit the device from a system. Subsequently, enabled by the widespread support for USB flash drives and BIOS boot, manufacturers and retailers progressively reduced the availability of floppy disk drives as standard equipment. In February 2003, Dell announced that floppy drives would no longer be pre-installed on Dell Dimension home computers, although they were still available as a selectable option and purchasable as an aftermarket OEM add-on. As of January 2007 only 2% of computers sold in stores contained built-in floppy disk drives.|$|E

40|$|Multi-service {{communications}} {{networks are}} generally designed, provisioned and configured, based on source-destination <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> expected to occur over a recurring time period. However due to network users' actions being non-deterministic, actual <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> will vary from those expected, potentially causing some network resources to be under- provisioned, with others possibly over-provisioned. As actual <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> vary over the recurring time period from those expected, so {{the status of}} the various shared network resources may also vary. This high degree of uncertainty necessitates using adaptive resource allocation mechanisms to share the finite network resources more efficiently so that more of actual <b>user</b> <b>demands</b> may be accommodated onto the network. The overhead for these adaptive resource allocation mechanisms must be low in order to scale for use in large networks carrying many source-destination <b>user</b> <b>demands.</b> This thesis examines the use of stochastic learning automata for the adaptive routing problem (these being adaptive, distributed and simple in implementation and operation) and seeks to improve their weakness of slow convergence whilst maintaining their strength of subsequent near optimal performance. Firstly, current reinforcement algorithms (the part causing the automaton to learn) are examined for applicability, and contrary to the literature the discretised schemes are found in general to be unsuitable. Two algorithms are chosen (one with fast convergence, the other with good subsequent performance) and are improved through automatically adapting the learning rates and automatically switching between the two algorithms. Both novel methods use local entropy of action probabilities for determining convergence state. However when the convergence speed and blocking probability is compared to a bandwidth-based dynamic link-state shortest-path algorithm, the latter is found to be superior. A novel re-application of learning automata to the routing problem is therefore proposed: using link utilisation levels instead of call acceptance or packet delay. Learning automata now return a lower blocking probability than the dynamic shortest-path based scheme under realistic loading levels, but still suffer from a significant number of convergence iterations. Therefore the final improvement is to combine both learning automata and shortest-path concepts to form a hybrid algorithm. The resulting blocking probability of this novel routing algorithm is superior to either algorithm, even when using trend <b>user</b> <b>demands...</b>|$|R
