5|$|The Mk. IV was {{a complex}} lash-up of systems, known collectively in the RAF as the Airborne Radio Installation 5003 (ARI 5003). Individual parts {{included}} the R3066 or R3102 receiver, T3065 transmitter, Modulator Type 20, Transmitter Aerial Type 19, Elevation Aerial Type 25, Azimuth Aerial Type 21 and 25, Impedance Matching <b>Unit</b> <b>Type</b> 35, Voltage Control Panel Type 3, and Indicator <b>Unit</b> <b>Type</b> 20 or 48.|$|E
5|$|The republic's {{administrative}} divisions {{remained largely}} unchanged from the structure {{used during the}} Soviet era, with the notable exception of selsoviets—a low-level administrative <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> abolished after the new law on the administrative-territorial divisions had been adopted in May 2000. As of 2014, the republic's administrative-territorial divisions include seven administrative districts (raions) and two republican urban okrugs. The districts have administrative jurisdiction over the inhabited localities located on their territory. Territories of the republican urban okrugs are separate from the districts and include a city/town of the republican significance, {{as well as one}} or several inhabited localities in their vicinity which had historically been administratively subordinated to that city/town.|$|E
5|$|The {{nomenclature}} of {{the great}} majority of regiments followed a standard configuration: <b>unit</b> <b>type,</b> followed by serial number, followed by name of the peregrini tribe (or nation) from whom the regiment was originally raised, in the genitive plural case e.g. cohors III Batavorum ("3rd Cohort of Batavi"); cohors I Brittonum ("1st Cohort of Britons"). Some regiments combine the names of two peregrini tribes, most likely after the merger of two previously separate regiments e.g. ala I Pannoniorum et Gallorum ("1st Wing of Pannonii and Gauls"). A minority of regiments are named after an individual, mostly after the first prefect of the regiment e.g. ala Sulpicia (presumably named after a prefect whose middle (gens) name was Sulpicius). The latter is also an example of regiments that did not have a serial number.|$|E
40|$|Cross-stratified {{deposits}} {{can give}} rise to a hierarchy of permeability modes, across scales, corresponding to a hierarchy of sedimentary <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> The shape of the sample semivariogram for permeability can be largely controlled by the shape of the cross-transition probabilities of <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> having the greatest contrast in permeability. The shape of those cross-transition probabilities can be, in turn, largely determined by the variance of the lengths of those <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> A sufficient condition for an exponential-like semivariogram is the repeated occurrence of <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> having both a contrast in permeability and a large length variance. These relationships are shown through writing the identities for spatial correlation of permeability in a hierarchical and multimodal form and {{as a function of the}} transition probabilities for the sedimentary <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> These relationships are also illustrated through analyzing data representing cross-stratified sediments within a point bar deposit...|$|R

25|$|In {{its most}} typical form, a hex-and-counter wargame has a map with a {{hexagonal}} grid imposed over it, units are represented with cardboard counters that commonly have a <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> and designation {{as well as}} numerical combat and movement factors. Players take turns moving and conducting attacks. Combat is typically resolved with an odds-based combat results table (CRT) using a six sided die.|$|E
25|$|Every BSA unit is {{entitled}} to a flag, with a specific design {{for each type of}} unit. Flags are split with a top half in one color and the bottom in another and the program emblem in the center. The upper half has lettering for the <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> and number and the chartering organization; the bottom has lettering for the community and council. Cub Scouting pack flags have a gold top half with blue lettering and blue bottom half with gold lettering. Boy Scouting troop flags are red with white lettering over white with red lettering; Varsity Scouting team flags are orange over white with yellow lettering on both halves. Venturing crew flags are white over gold with green lettering; Sea Scouting ship flags are red over blue with white lettering.|$|E

500|$|Military {{units are}} used for combat against other players. Infantry are the {{cheapest}} <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> and all are land based, using weapons ranging from crossbows to early muskets to more advanced rifles. The heavier artillery classes also make use of ranged weapons, primarily cannon and mortars; however, there is also artillery armed with grenades. Mounted troops are also present, and are armed with either hand weapons, such as swords, or ranged weapons, such as pistols. These units also have significant features, such as skirmishers which do bonus damage against infantry, and ranged cavalry does bonus damage against other cavalry. A new unit introduced in Age of Empires III is the explorer, which is chiefly responsible for scouting and gathering treasure but is also capable of building Trading Posts and has a special attack, used at the player's command. This unit cannot be killed, but can be rendered unconscious, to be revived when friendly units are in range; also, a ransom can be paid to have it reappear at the player's town center. [...] This ransom is credited to the player that disabled him, when applicable. [...] Some shipment cards increase the explorer's effectiveness in gameplay; for example, providing it with [...] "war dogs" [...] can aid scouting and combat. In Age of Empires III, ships are available on most maps. Military ships makes use of cannon or flaming arrows, while some ships can collect resources or transport land units.|$|E

The allagion, commanded by an allagatōr, [...] was probably divided into subunits of 100, 50 and 10 men. On campaign the allagia could be grouped together (usually in threes) into larger bodies called taxeis, syntaxeis, lochoi or tagmata. The infantry unit was the taxiarchia, a <b>unit</b> <b>type</b> first recorded under Nikephoros II Phokas; it was theoretically 1000 men strong, and was commanded by a taxiarchēs.|$|E

The three countries did have experience in past joint military operations, most notably, through the Lithuanian-Polish Peace Force Battalion and the Polish–Ukrainian Peace Force Battalion. Lithuania and Poland are NATO members, Ukraine is currently not but requested to join the NATO Membership Action Plan in January 2008.

40|$|Abstract. The Strategy Game Description Game Language (SGDL) is {{intended}} to become a complete description of all aspects of strategy games, including rules, parameters, scenarios, maps, and <b>unit</b> <b>types.</b> One of the main envisioned uses of SGDL, in combination with an evolutionary algorithm and appropriate fitness functions, is to allow the generation of complete new strategy games or variations of old ones. This paper presents a first version of SGDL, capable of describing <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> and their properties, together with plans for {{how it will be}} extended to other sub-domains of strategy games. As a proof of the viability of the idea and implementation, an experiment is presented where <b>unit</b> <b>types</b> are evolved so as to generate complementary properties. A fitness function based on Monte Carlo simulation of gameplay is devised to test complementarity. ...|$|R
