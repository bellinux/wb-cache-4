40|$|In the {{evolution}} of modern medicine epidemiology has from the beginning {{played an important role}} in exploring the causes of disease. To give just a few historical examples, 1 epidemiological methods have shown that lime juice prevents scurvy; that washing one’s hands (especially after performing an autopsy) prevents puerperal sepsis; that water contaminated with sewage causes cholera; that thiamine deficiency causes beriberi; and that injections with <b>unsterile</b> <b>needles</b> cause serum hepatitis. Sometimes epidemiology has identified ‘causes ’ long before the mechanisms were understood. Epidemiology has also interacted with related disciplines such as clinical medicine, pathology, toxicology or microbiology in the elucidation of the aetiology of diseases as diverse as leukaemia 2 or malaria. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 62, 811 {{cases of the}} {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) {{have been reported to}} the World Health Organization from throughout the world. Extensive epidemiologic studies have shown that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections are transmitted by three routes: sexual, parenteral and perinatal. Three geographic patterns of transmission have been defined. In pattern I, transmission occurs predominantly among homosexual and bisexual men and urban intravenous drug abusers; transmission via blood products has been controlled; the male:female sex ratio is 10 : 1 or more; population HIV seroprevalence is low, and perinatal transmission is uncommon (for instance, United States, western Europe). In pattern II, transmission is predominantly heterosexual and perinatal; transmission via blood products exists but is being reduced; <b>unsterile</b> <b>needles</b> and other skin-piercing instruments cause some parenteral transmission (magnitude not known); the male:female sex ratio is 1 : 1, and population seroprevalence often exceeds 1 % (central Africa, Haiti). In pattern III, AIDS cases are just being documented and are generally due to sexual exposure abroad or imported blood products (Middle East, Asia) ...|$|E
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 50 million chronic carriers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Africa, with a 25 % mortality risk. In sub-Saharan Africa, carrier rates range from 9 - 20 %. Many {{studies have suggested}} that HBV transmission in Africa occurs predominantly in childhood, by the horizontal rather than the perinatal route. The exact mode of transmission is uncertain but probably involves percutaneous infection through saliva or traces of blood, as well through <b>unsterile</b> <b>needles,</b> tribal scarification, and other possible vehicles. Compared with adult HBsAg carriers in the Far East, those in Africa have a low rate of HBeAg positivity, which may account for the relatively low rates of perinatal infection. It is also possible that African infants are less susceptible to perinatal HBV infection compared with their Asian counterparts. Alternatively, it may be that African infants are indeed infected with HBV at birth but, for genetically determined reasons, have persistently negative tests {{for a number of years}} until the virus is reactivated. In view of the high HBV carrier rates in the general population, universal immunisation of all infants is recommended. Ways of incorporating the hepatitis B vaccine into the Expanded Programme on Immunisation in each country are being evaluated...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) and hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses {{have emerged as}} major bloodborne infections. Several cases of infections {{through the use of}} <b>unsterile</b> injection <b>needles</b> also are on record. Kala-azar, or visceral leishmaniasis, is a hemoparasitic disease caused by Leishmania donovani. All the anti-kala-azar medications require multiple intramuscular injections of the anti-leishmanial drugs. To find whether these patients were at higher risk of contracting blood-borne infection, than those who were not on medication, a community-based study was conducted in the kala-azarendemic state of Bihar, India. Methods: Five villages (4050 families) of three highly endemic districts of Bihar were included in this study. The sociodemographic data of the affected families and their annual income were determined as per Government of India guidelines. The diagnosis of kala-azar and its sequelae, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), was made, and their therapeutic details were noted. All the leishman!a-infected patients, their spouses, family members, and villagemates were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibodies, and anti-HIV (1 + 2) antibodies, using commercially available kits. Results: Of the 4050 families, 61 (1. 5 %) were found affected with kala-azar or PKDL. These 61 families had 77 cases of leishmaniasis, of which 64 (83 %) had kala-azar and 13 (17 %) PKDL. The most affected (4. 5 %) age group was 11 to 40 years. Of the 61 families, 57 (93. 4 %) families belonged to so-called untouchable castes, and 9 of them could not afford to have any anti-kala-azar treatment. Only 64 patients received treatment in the form of injectables. The number of injections received by these patients ranged from 3 to 120. Hepatitis B and C viral infections were found to be significantly more prevalent in those who received multiple injections. Compared to their male counterparts infected with L. donovani, females who received injectable medicines were at higher risk of contracting hepatitis B infections (20 % vs. 11. 3 %) and hepatitis C virus infection (26. 7 % vs. 18. 9 %). Overall, hepatitis C virus infections were more common (20. 6 %) than hepatitis B virus infection (13. 2 %) in this group of patients. Villagemates with a history of injections for other ailments also were found to have a high rate of infection with hepatitis viruses. One patient with kala-azar was found to be co-infected with HIV, although probably not related to injections. Conclusions: The treatment of Indian kala-azar and post-kalaazar dermal leishmaniasis consists of multiple intramuscular injections of sodium stibogluconate, pentamidine, or amphotericin B. Though the original disease gets cured, all these therapeutic regimens were found to carry a significantly high risk of transmitting yet more dangerous blood-borne infections, such as HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses, through the shared use of <b>unsterile</b> injection <b>needles.</b> All needles should be appropriately sterilized, {{if they are to be}} re-used...|$|R
40|$|Soon {{after its}} {{introduction}} in 1910, intravenous arsphenamine treatment for syphilis {{was found to}} be complicated by jaundice. The underlying cause, <b>unsterile</b> syringes and <b>needles,</b> was eventually recognised in the early 1940 s, mainly through the efforts of British Army investigators. The infection most often transmitted was probably hepatitis B virus (HBV), but the high mortality in a few of the outbreaks of arsphenamine jaundice suggests that variants of HBV, or other hepatitis viruses, were sometimes involved. Fifty years later, {{at a time when there}} are estimated to be over three hundred million carriers of HBV in the world and probably at least as many hepatitis C virus carriers, and when the World Health Organisation estimates that there have been 17 million infections with human immunodeficiency virus, the lessons learnt around 1945 about the need to use sterile instruments and needles for all injections and venepunctures remain highly pertinent...|$|R
40|$|<b>Unsterile</b> <b>needles</b> and {{syringes}} may transmit blood-borne infectious agents such as HIV and hepatitis B virus. The {{emergence of}} these diseases as major public health concerns {{and the risk}} of nosocomial transmission has heightened interest in the development of single-use injection devices. WHO and UNICEF embarked on a programme to develop and introduce these devices in 1987. We report on a field trial in Karachi, Pakistan, of the SoloShot (SS) plastic disposable syringe, which has a metal clip in the syringe barrel to prevent second-time withdrawal of the plunger. A conventional disposable syringe (CS) was used as a comparison. We observed 48 vaccinators giving 2400 injections with the SS and 1440 with the CS; 98. 7 % of SS performed as designed. The average volume required per delivered dose was comparable for the two syringes and was delivered more quickly with SS. Training and experience had a small but statistically significant effect on several aspects of SS use. Vaccinators who indicated a syringe preference preferred SS on 7 out of 9 indicators. SS is safe and effective in preventing reuse and is easier and quicker to use than the CS. Vaccinators require little, if any, special training. It could directly replace disposable syringes in expanded programmes on immunization (EPI) in countries where use of unsterile disposable devices occurs or when sterilization is not practical...|$|E
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} ninety-three randomly-selected {{members of the}} staff of ICDDR,B: Centre for Health and Population Research were {{surveyed}} anonymously in June 1998, using a pre-tested and self-administered questionnaire, to assess their knowledge on, and attitude toward, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) /acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). All except 4 (1. 4 %) heard of AIDS. Main sources of information were radio and television (93 %), newspapers and magazines (84. 8 %), posters and leaflets (70. 2 %), and friends (59. 2 %). About 94 % of the respondents believed that HIV might spread in Bangladesh. Only 61. 6 % knew about the causative agent for AIDS. More than 96 % had knowledge that HIV could be detected through blood test. The respondents were aware that unprotected sexual intercourse (92 %), transfusion of blood and blood components (93. 8 %), sharing <b>unsterile</b> <b>needles</b> for injections (94. 1 %), and delivery of babies by infected mothers (82. 7 %) could transmit HIV. Similarly, the respondents had the knowledge that HIV infection could be prevented by using condom during sexual intercourse (85. 5 %), having sex only with an HIV-negative faithful partner (87. 2 %), avoiding transfusion of blood not screened for HIV (88. 9 %), and taking injections with sterile needles (86. 5 %).

40|$|SummaryUnsafe {{injection}} practices, {{including the}} re-use of <b>unsterile</b> <b>needles</b> and syringes, are commonplace in developing country health settings, and contribute substantially {{to the global}} burden of blood-borne viral disease. Unsafe injection practices place at risk not only patients, but also healthcare workers, who practice universal precautions inconsistently and are commonly exposed to blood {{in the course of}} their work. Global awareness of the link between unsafe injection practices and the burden of blood-borne viral disease was slow to emerge but has grown in the recent years. In 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) established the Safe Injection Global Network (SIGN), which advocates a range of interventions for the promotion of injection safety. As well as exhorting healthcare workers to use a new needle and syringe for every injection, they should also be encouraged and supported to protect themselves from exposure to blood. It is argued here that promoting the occupational safety of healthcare workers in developing countries is an essential and currently under-valued component of the response to the problem of unsafe injection practices. Protecting healthcare workers from occupational infection with blood-borne viruses has a range of potential benefits, including safer injection practices for patients and less discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS. There is an urgent need for organisational commitment to the occupational safety of healthcare workers in developing countries, along with the provision of training in injection safety and universal precautions, adequate supplies of personal protective equipment, and hepatitis B vaccination...|$|E
40|$|Master thesis, Programme in Medicine. TITLE: Injecting {{drug use}} related {{bacterial}} infections requiring hospital care in Gothenburg 2008 - 2011. AUTHOR: Olle Andersson. Background 14 million people world-wide {{is estimated to}} be active injecting drug users. In Gothenburg, this number is at least 922. Injecting drug users (IDUs) have higher incidence of infectious endocarditis (IE) (particulary right-sided) and skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) compared to the general population. Many of the risk factors for acquiring these diseases are hygienic, such as the usage of <b>unsterile</b> <b>needles</b> and syringes and needle sharing. Aim To estimate the incidence and describe the clinical features of IDUs requiring hospital care in Gothenburg, Sweden for bacterial infections, and to document the injection habits of IDUs in Gothenburg. Materials and methods A retrospective study of the Swedish quality register for infectious diseases and hospital records from several departments at the Sahlgrenska university hospital. 171 hospital stays treated for IE and 3468 hospital stays treated for 15 different SSTIs between 2008 - 2011 were reviewed. When IDUs were found in these groups, additional data from their hospital stays were recorded and analysed for differences between groups. IDU patients at the department of infectious diseases in Gothenburg were interviewed between February and April of 2014 on their injection habits. Results IE incidence was 3. 45 for IDUs vs. 0. 08 / 1000 person-years for the general population and SSTI incidence requiring hospital care was 19. 25 for IDUs vs 1. 67 / 1000 person-years for the general population. IDUs were younger than controls and males dominated in the SSTI IDU group compared to the non-IDU group (p< 0. 05), but not in the IE groups. S. aureus was the most frequent cause of infection. Discussion / conclusions IDUss had high incidence of hospital care for bacterial infections, most commonly caused by S. aureus, and were dominated by men in their thirties. Contrary to previous studies, our IDU IE patients predominantly had a left-sided IE. None of the interviewees took hygienically precautions before injectional drug injections, all reused needles and all had been sharing needles...|$|E
