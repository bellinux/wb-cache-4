40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis studies {{two aspects of}} Army manpower: (1) quality issues in the Army manpower, and (2) the influence of economic variables (military compensation, advertising, and unemployment rate) on enlistment decision of the youth population, particularly high quality Army recruits. The level of education and scores on applicants' aptitude tests are the basic determinants of soldier quality. However, military training and environmental factors help {{to improve the quality}} of soldiers. With regards to the impact of economic variables, basic military pay, and education incentives, the is "money for college education", have major influences on enlistment decision of potential high quality recruits. Advertising and unemployment rates also have considerable impact on the enlistment decision. Following a discussion on quality and influence of economic variables, a model is formulated to minimize the Army's total cost subject to a given level of readiness. the model helps to determine the effect of changes in the Army readiness level, education level, <b>unit</b> <b>advertising</b> costs, unit training costs, unemployment rate, and unit equipment costs on the decision variables (manpower level, equipment level, advertising expense/costs, and training expenses.)

40|$|Preliminary draft, {{please do}} not quote. This paper {{provides}} a model of knowledge sharing and networking among the single <b>unit</b> <b>advertising</b> agencies and investigates {{the implications of this}} model in the presence of heterogeneity among the agencies. In a stylized model, we show that under the modest set of assumptions the separation outcome is supported as undominated Nash equilibrium. We reject the possibilities of pooling equilibrium even in the presence of general economy of scale from networking. This results in the concentration of the high quality agencies in the locations with higher wages and rents. We derive the maximum profit of an agency and show that the conditions that guarantee the prevalence of separation equilibrium have strong implications in the specification of the agency’s profit function. We estimate the parameter of the profit function, using the Census confidential establishment level data, and show that the networking effect and separation are the predominant factors in the profit function of agencies, and consequently, in their location decisions. ∗ I am very grateful to Vernon Henderson and Rajiv Vohra for all of their advice and supports. I also thank Andrew Foster, David Weil, and others at Brown for their many insights and suggestions. All remaining errors are my own...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a model of}} knowledge sharing and networking among single <b>unit</b> <b>advertising</b> agencies and investigates {{the implications of this}} model in the presence of heterogeneity in agencies’ quality. In a stylized screening model, we show that, under a modest set of assumptions, the separation outcome is a Pareto-undominated Nash equilibrium. That is, high quality agencies locate themselves in a high wage and rent area to sift out low quality agencies and guarantee their network quality. We identify a necessary condition for the separating equilibrium to exist and to reject the pooling equilibrium even in the presence of agglomeration economies from networking. We derive the maximum profit of an agency and show the condition has a directly testable implication in the empirical specification of the agency’s profit function. We use a sample of movers—existing agencies that relocate among urban areas—in order to extract a predetermined measure of their quality prior to relocation. We estimate the parameters of the profit function, using the Census confidential establishment-level data, and show that the necessary condition for separation is met and that there is strong separation and sorting on quality among agencies in their location decisions.

Based on the both, theoretical and empirical studies, the hypothesis, that house prices will decrease with higher distance to CBD, was defined. Dynamically developing suburban fringe of the city of Prague was chosen as the study area. The relationship was investigated within the hedonic price model based on the data sample of 697 house <b>units</b> <b>advertised</b> on the web portal sreality. cz during the June and July 2014. The main findings of this thesis are that price of the house will decrease by 1. 24 percent with every additional kilometer from the city center. The distance was alternatively measured by time spent in a car in the normal traffic, during the rush hours and also by the time spent in a public transport.

Analyses of symmetric and asymmetric oligopolies with the model show that <b>unit</b> contribution and <b>advertising</b> effectiveness have positive effects on a competitor's own advertising and steady-state sales, while discount rate and decay rate have negative effects. An asymmetric analysis further shows that <b>unit</b> contribution and <b>advertising</b> effectiveness affect positively, and discount rate and decay rate negatively, a competitor's rivals' advertising, but have effects in opposite directions regarding rivals' steady-state sales. The symmetric and asymmetric analyses also show that steady-state sales per competitor decline {{with the number of}} competitors in the oligopoly, while total oligopoly steady-state sales increase.
