In this paper, we investigate the introduction of differentiated server selection during the phase of server selection and at independent brokerage entities and not at the server level. This has the advantage that service differentiation can be realized using a broker and a set of generic servers, thus enhancing the portability of servers. Development of servers remains generic while brokers implement sophisticated policy requirements. ...|$|R
40|$|In an {{autonomic}} computing system, an autonomic manager makes tuning, load balancing, or provisioning {{decisions based on}} a predictive model of the system. This paper investigates performance analysis techniques {{to be used by}} the autonomic manager. It looks at the complexity of the workloads, and presents algorithms for computing the bounds of performance metrics for distributed systems under asymptotic and non-asymptotic conditions, i. e. with saturated and non-saturated resources respectively. The techniques used are hybrid in nature, making use of performance evaluation and linear and nonlinear programming models. The workloads are characterized by the workload intensity, which represents the total number of users in the system, and by the workload mixes, which depict the number <b>of</b> <b>users</b> in each <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> The results presented in this paper can be applied to distributed transactional systems.

50|$|Policy {{conflicts}} are broadly classified into domain-independent and application-specific, where the former, as the names suggest, {{are independent of}} the policy application, and the latter are bound by {{the constraints of the}} application domain. Example application domains that have been considered in the literature include quality <b>of</b> <b>service</b> (QoS) in IP networks, distributed systems, firewall security, and call control in telecommunication networks. Policy conflicts can also be classified according to the time-frame at which they can be detected: static conflicts can be detected through off-line analysis at policy specification time, whereas dynamic conflicts can only be detected when policies are enforced as they depend on {{the current state of the}} managed system. For example, conflicts can occur between policies for dynamically allocating resources and those setting quotas for <b>users</b> or <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> As such, automation should be a key aspect of dynamic analysis mechanisms so that the operational impact of a conflict can be kept to a minimum.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Policy-based dynamic {{resource}} management may involve interaction between independent decision-making components {{which can lead}} to conflicts. For example, conflicts can occur between the policies for allocating resources and those setting quotas for <b>users</b> or <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service.</b> These policy conflicts cannot be detected by static analysis of the policies at specification-time as the conflicts arise from {{the current state of the}} resources within the system and so can only be detected at run-time. In this paper we use policies related to Quality <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> (QoS) provisioning for configuring Differentiated Services (DiffServ) networks to illustrate techniques for the dynamic detection and resolution of conflicts. Configuration includes implementing network provisioning decisions, performing admission control, and adapting bandwidth allocation dynamically according to emerging traffic demands. We identify possible conflicts between policies that manage the allocation of resources, and we also investigate conflicts that may arise between these policies and higher-level directives refined at the dynamic {{resource management}} level, acting as constraints. The paper shows how Event Calculus can be used to detect conflicts, focusing on the ones that emerge at run-time, and provides an approach for specifying policies to automate conflict resolution. The latter is demonstrated through our initial implementation of a dynamic conflict analysis tool. Keywords: Conflict detection; Conflict resolution; Policy-based resource managemen...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the Internet have inspired {{a wide range of}} business and consumer applications. The deployment <b>of</b> multimedia-based <b>services</b> has driven the demand for increased and guaranteed bandwidth requirements over the network. The diverse requirements of the wide range <b>of</b> <b>users</b> demand differentiated <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> and quality assurance. The new technology of Multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) has emerged as a high performance and reliable option to address these challenges apart from the additional features that were not addressed before. This problem in lieu of thesis describes how the new paradigm of MPLS is advantageous over the conventional architecture. The motivation for this paradigm is discussed in the first part, followed by a detailed description of this new architecture. The information flow, the underlying protocols and the MPLS extensions to some of the traditional protocols are then discussed followed by the description of the simulation.

Although much excitement has surrounded {{the idea of}} virtual worlds, a gap exists between those who register and those who engage in virtual worlds. Our analysis of the gap between those who merely register to join a virtual world and those who ultimately engage the community {{on a regular basis}} derives from a lack of assimilation. We present the 3 C approach, a high-level theoretical framework delineating the relationship between three <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> factors (namely the technology <b>class</b> <b>of</b> factors; the community <b>class</b> <b>of</b> factors; and the <b>user</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> factors) that we posit explain virtual world assimilation and employ theories to represent these <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> factors and the interaction between them. After discussing and integrating these three <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> factors, we test our model through a study of 223 new users of Second Life. The results provide empirical support for the 3 C framework; specifically, our analysis indicates that the technology and community <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> factors in exert a direct influence upon a user's attitude towards the virtual world, and this relationship is moderated by the <b>user</b> <b>class</b> <b>of</b> factors. close...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. WSOL (Web Service Offerings Language) is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) {{notation}} {{compatible with}} the WSDL (Web Services De-scription Language) standard. While WSDL is used for describing operations provided by Web Services, WSOL enables formal specification <b>of</b> multiple <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for one Web Service. A service offering is a formal represen-tation <b>of</b> one <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for a Web <b>Service.</b> As <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for Web Services are determined by combinations of various constraints, WSOL enables formal specification of functional constraints, some QoS (a. k. a., non-functional) constraints, simple access rights (for differentiation <b>of</b> <b>service),</b> price, and rela-tionships with other <b>service</b> offerings <b>of</b> the same Web Service. Describing a Web Service in WSOL, in addition to WSDL, enables selection of a more ap-propriate Web Service and service offering for particular circumstances.
