40|$|Human {{bone marrow}} (BM) mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells are {{potentially}} attractive targets for ex vivo gene therapy. The potential of lentiviral vectors for transducing BM mesenchymal cells was examined using a self-inactivating vector that expressed the {{green fluorescent protein}} (GFP) from an internal cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. This vector was compared with oncoretroviral vectors expressing GFP from the CMV promoter or a modified long-terminal repeat that had been optimized for long-term expression in stem cells. The percentage of GFP-positive cells was consistently higher following lentiviral versus oncoretroviral transduction, consistent with increased GFP mRNA levels and increased gene transfer efficiency measured by polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis. In vitro GFP and FVIII expression lasted for several months post-transduction, although expression slowly declined. The transduced cells retained their stem/progenitor cell properties since they were still capable of differentiating along adipogenic and osteogenic lineages in vitro while maintaining high GFP and FVIII expression levels. Implantation of lentivirally transduced human BM mesenchymal cells using collagen scaffolds into immunodeficient mice resulted in efficient engraftment of gene-engineered cells and long-term transgene expression in vivo. These biocompatible BM mesenchymal implants represent a reversible, safe, and versatile protein delivery approach {{because they can be}} retrieved {{in the event of an}} <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> or when expression of the protein of interest is no longer required. In conclusion, efficient gene delivery with lentiviral vectors in conjunction with the use of bioengineered reversible scaffolds improves the therapeutic prospects of this novel approach for gene therapy, protein delivery, or tissue engineering. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{adverse reactions}} of the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) Statens Serum Institut (SSI) (Danish strain 1331) used as intervention in a randomized clinical trial. DesignA randomized clinical multicenter trial, The Danish Calmette Study, randomizing newborns to BCG or no intervention. Follow-up until 13 months of age. SettingPediatric and maternity wards at three Danish university hospitals. ParticipantsAll women planning to give birth at the three study sites (n= 16, 521) during the recruitment period {{were invited to participate}} in the study. Four thousand one hundred and eighty four families consented to participate and 4262 children, gestational age 32 weeks and above, were randomized: 2129 to BCG vaccine and 2133 to no vaccine. None of the participants withdrew because of adverse reactions. Main outcome and measureTrial-registered adverse reactions after BCG vaccination at birth. Follow-up at 3 and 13 months by telephone interviews and clinical examinations. ResultsAmong the 2118 BCG-vaccinated children we registered no cases of severe <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> related to BCG vaccination and no cases of disseminated BCG disease. Two cases of regional lymphadenitis were hospitalized and thus classified as serious adverse reactions related to BCG. The most severe adverse reactions were 10 cases of suppurative lymphadenitis. This was nearly a fivefold increase compared to what was expected based on the summary of product characteristics of the vaccine. All cases were treated conservatively and recovered. Six of 10 (60 %) families of children experiencing suppurative lymphadenitis compared to 117 / 2071 (6 %) of those with no lymphadenitis indicated that the vaccine had more adverse effects than expected (p-value < 0. 001). Conclusions and relevanceBCG vaccination was associated with only mild morbidity and no mortality. A higher incidence of suppurative lymphadenitis than expected was observed.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the occurrence of adverse reactions (ADRs) related to herbal products (HPs), which are purchased over-the-counter for self-treatment, reported by 100 users. Samples of the HPs related to those ADRs were purchased for their pharmacobotanical identification. the ADRs reported were evaluated based on specialized literature and were analyzed according to causality into probable (PR), possible (PO), unrelated (UR) or unclassifiable (UC); according to expectance into <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> (UNEX) and expected adverse reaction (EX); seriousness into serious adverse event or reaction (S) and non-serious (NS); and severity into mild (MI), moderate (MO) and severe (SE). Among 100 interviews, five complaints of ADRs were reported in relation to HPs: Senna alexandrina, with a report of cramps (PR; MI; EX; NS); Camellia sinensis, associated with tachycardia (PO; MI; EX; NS); Bauhinia sp., a strong allergic reaction that led to hospitalization (UC; MO; UNEX; S); Picrasma crenata, with several symptoms and hospitalization (UR; MO; UNEX; S); and 21 -herb tea, related to an allergic reaction (UC; MI; EX; NS). the strategies {{used in this study}} allowed us to carry out an analysis of ADRs attributed to HPs.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{report and}} discuss {{a case of}} {{rhabdomyolysis}} in an elderly patient with neuropathic pain who was treated with gabapentin. CASE SUMMARY: An 85 -year-old diabetic woman was hospitalized for severe pain in her lower limbs and difficulty in walking, compromising her daily activities. On admission, the woman's laboratory parameters, including creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin, were in the normal range. Neurologic evaluation suggested a diagnosis of diabetic neuropathic pain, and therapy with gabapentin 150 mg 3 times daily was started. On the same day, the patient developed psychomotor agitation and gastric pain, which were treated with haloperidol 10 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg, respectively. In the following hours, the severity of muscular pain increased and the patient developed myopathy with acute renal failure (CK 459 U/L, myoglobin 11 437 ng/mL, creatinine 4. 59 mg/dL), which worsened progressively during the next 2 days (CK 3095 U/L, myoglobin 17, 000 mg/dL, creatinine 4. 77 mg/dL) despite discontinuation of haloperidol and lansoprazole. No signs of trauma or edema, suggesting possible compartmental or crush syndrome, were detected. Gabapentin was then withdrawn and the patient's condition rapidly improved. Complete recovery followed in about 10 days. DISCUSSION: Severe myopathy is an <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> to gabapentin therapy. In this patient, a possible contribution of haloperidol or lansoprazole to the adverse event cannot be excluded. However, worsening of the clinical picture despite discontinuation of these drugs, together with rapid improvement observed after withdrawal of gabapentin, strongly suggest a causative role of gabapentin. According to the Naranjo probability scale, gabapentin was the probable cause of myopathy in this patient. The mechanism by which gabapentin may induce myopathy is unknown. The early onset of the syndrome after initiation of treatment with gabapentin in therapeutic doses {{is compatible with the}} picture of an idiosyncratic adverse response. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogenetic and clinical investigations are required to explore what mechanisms account for gabapentin-related muscular alterations at the time of onset, including electromyographic recordings as well as muscle and nerve histopathologic examinations. Until more information is available, clinicians should consider the possibility of discontinuing gabapentin treatment in patients showing muscular pain and signs of myopath...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of this thesis {{concentrates on the}} cellular energy supplier and an important instrument in mediating cell death, mitochondrion. First, an overview is given to explain the biochemical properties of this organelle. Then, the role of mitochondria in cell death is discussed, followed by {{an article about the}} mitochondrial toxicity of drugs. As an example of the mitochondrial toxicity of a drug, an article about statins and their effects on L 6 myocytes and rat muscle mitochondria conclude the introduction part of this thesis. The aim of the first project was to compare hepatocellular toxicity and pharmacological activity of amiodarone (B 2 -O-Et-N-diethyl) and eight amiodarone derivatives, including three amiodarone metabolites (B 2 -O-Et-NH-ethyl, B 2 -O-Et-NH 2 and B 2 -O-Et-OH). In addition, five amiodarone analogues were investigated (B 2 -O-Et-N-dimethyl, B 2 -O-Et-N-dipropyl, B 2 -OAcetate, B 2 -O-Et-propionamide and B 2 -O-Et). The studies were accomplished using frehly isolated rat liver mitochondria, primary rat hepatocytes and the hepatoma cell line HepG 2. The hepatocellular toxicity of amiodarone and most of the derivatives was confirmed. Amiodarone and most analogues showed a dose-dependent toxicity on the respiratory chain and on β- oxidation of the mitochondria. The ROS concentration in hepatocytes increased timedependently and apoptotic/necrotic cell populations were identified using flow cytometry and annexinV/propidiumiodide staining. The effect of the three least toxic amiodarone analogues on the hERG channel was compared to amiodarone. In conclusion, three amiodarone analogues (B 2 -O-Et-N-dipropyl, B 2 -O-Acetate and B 2 -O-Et) showed a lower hepatocellular toxicity profile than amiodarone and two of these analogues (B 2 -O-Et-N-dipropyl and B 2 -O-Acetate) retained hERG channel interaction capacity, suggesting that amiodarone analogues with class III antiarrhythmic activity and lower hepatic toxicity could be developed. For the second project in this thesis, we synthesized three more amiodarone analogues (B 2 -O-Ethylacetate, B 2 -O-Et-N-pyrrolidine and B 2 -O-Et-N-piperidine) and, together with amiodarone and its metabolites (B 2 -O-Et-NH-ethyl and B 2 -O-Et-NH 2) and some derivatives from the first study (B 2 -O-Et-N-dipropyl, B 2 -O-Et-propionamide, B 2 -O-Acetate, B 2 -O-Et-OH), characterized their hepatic toxicity together with the pulmonary toxicity. The interaction with the hERG channel was determined for all the derivatives. Compared to amiodarone, which showed only a weak cytotoxicity, the desethylated metabolites, B 2 -O-Acetate, B 2 -O-Et-OH and B 2 -O-Et- N-pyrrolidine showed a similar or higher cytotoxicity. On the other hand, B 2 -O-Et-N-dipropyl, B 2 -O-Ethylacetate, B 2 -O-Et, B 2 -O-Et-propionamide and B 2 -O-Et-N-piperidine were less toxic. Cytotoxicity was associated with a drop in the mitochondrial membrane potential and therefore most probably mitochondrial in origin. Substances carrying a nitrogen in the side chain (amiodarone, B 2 -O-Et-NH-ethyl, B 2 -O-Et-NH 2, B 2 -O-Et-N-dipropyl, B 2 -O-Et-propionamide, B 2 -O-Et-N-pyrrolidine, B 2 -O-Et-N-piperidine) showed a much higher affinity to the hERG channel (range 0. 22 - 12. 2 µmol/L) than those without a nitrogen in this position (B 2 -O-Acetate, B 2 -OEthylacetate, B 2 -O-Et-OH) (range 74 - 216 µmol/L). Neither cytotoxicity, nor the interaction with the hERG channel, was associated with the lipophilicity of the compounds. It was concluded, that the physicochemical properties of amiodarone and its analogues were not as important for the potassium channel interaction and cytotoxicity as the chemical structure of the compounds. In the third project of this thesis, the relationship between an unexpected toxicity of a drug and an underlying mitochondrial defect was studied using human dermal fibroblasts. These cells were derived from patients suffering from a mitochondrial defect. Simvastatin and benzbromarone are known to cause an <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> (myotoxicity or hepatotoxicity, respectively). Both dermal fibroblasts with a mitochondrial defect and fibroblasts from healthy patients were treated with different concentrations of benzbromarone and simvastatin, and the overall toxicity was evaluated after different time points. There were no differences in the toxicity pattern between the cell lines, and the toxicity assayed was relatively scarce in all experiments. It was concluded that the the test system was not suitable for these studies and that they should be repeated with other cell lines of hepatic or muscle origin...|$|E

40|$|In the Netherlands 1 of 1. 000 inhibitants undergo {{cardiac surgery}} annually.

Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that leukodepletion of RBCs reduces the costs after cardiac valve surgery. Additional analyses revealed that plasma transfusions were associated with mortality and platelet transfusions with postoperative infections and longer ICU-stay. Patients who received more than 3 red blood cell units had significantly higher cytokine IL- 6 concentrations after leukocyte-containing, buffy-coat depleted red blood cells (RBC) as compared to patients who had received similar numbers of leukocyte-depleted RBC units. Patients who developed postoperative infections and multiple-organ-dysfunction-syndrome showed, respectively, increased concentrations of cytokines IL- 6 and IL- 12 in the group that received leukocyte-containing RBCs. This laboratory analysis suggests that buffy-coat depleted erythrocytes may affect the development of postoperative complications by modulation of the postoperative proinflammatory response after cardiac surgery.

40|$|Some drugs {{result in}} severe side effects. Here we explore two {{different}} routes to attack this problem: one from structural chemistry and human proteome and another from the improved {{statistical analysis of}} patient reports. 1. Therapeutic molecules interact with multiple protein targets: some modulation events due to this poly- pharmacology are desirable for therapeutic effects and some cause serious <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> The identification of drug poly-pharmacological targets in advance {{remains one of the}} major challenges in drug development. Here, we developed a drug target profiling system using a hybrid chemoinformatic and pharmacophoric approach. The two approaches complement each other since the first one is strongly dependent on the known chemical structures of the compounds while the approach based on three dimensional pharmacophoric field matching depends on the previous knowledge to a lesser degree. The profiling system not only proved to be efficient for retrospective prediction but also enables the discovery of previously unknown drug targets that may lead to side effects. 2. Independently, <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> are revealed in clinical trials and, in some unfortunate cases, only in post- marketing surveillance by the FDA many years later. The FDA post-marketing data, however, have not been properly analyzed and used for quantitative characterization of the risks of severe side effects. Here we develop a profiling system [...] the Early Drug Alerts, EDA [...] in which we separated the drug-dependent rates of adverse effects from the disease-dependent rates. The EDA also improved signal- to-noise ratio by aggregating related <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> in order to overcome the issues of data fragmentation and data scarcity. Many of the established risk signals were confirmed by clinical studies while some safety alerts revealed by the EDA analysis need immediate attention. 3. Finally, by integrating off-target profile, <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> profile, and gene-phenotype relationship, we discovered a reason why raloxifene, an estrogen receptor modulator, may cause thromboembolism and confirmed its binding to thrombin. This emerging profiling pipeline could be applied to raise alerts about <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> in new drug candidates, discover novel anti-targets explaining side effects, repurpose drugs for new indications, and expedite the rational design of more effective, but less toxic dru...|$|R

However, {{although there is no}} proven therapeutic procedure following the termination of sorafenib, hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may be a treatment option in advanced HCC. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate feasibility and efficacy of HAIC for patients with advanced HCC as subsequent therapy. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 27 consecutive patients with advanced HCC who were treated with HAIC following sorafenib between June 2009 and December 2012 at our hospital. Cisplatin (20 mg/m 2 per day) was administered via the hepatic artery for 10 min, prior to the continuous administration of 5 -fluorouracil (330 mg/m 2 per day) over 24 h from days 1 - 5 and 8 - 12 and the s. c. administration of pegylated interferon α- 2 b (1 μg/kg) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. A treatment cycle consisted of 28 days of drug administration followed by 14 days of rest. Results: The toxicity profile showed that hematological toxicities were common, and grade 3 / 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed (51. 9 % and 48. 1 %, respectively).

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{describe}} {{different approaches}} to promote <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> reporting among health care professionals, determining their cost-effectiveness. METHODS We analyzed and compared several approaches taken by the Northern Pharmacovigilance Centre (Portugal) to promote <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> reporting. Approaches were compared regarding the number and relevance of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> reports obtained and costs involved. Costs by report were estimated by adding the initial costs and the running costs of each intervention. These costs were divided {{by the number of}} reports obtained with each intervention, to assess its cost-effectiveness. RESULTS All the approaches seem to have increased the number of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> reports. We noted the biggest increase with protocols (321 reports, costing 1. 96 € each), followed by first educational approach (265 reports, 20. 31 €/report) and by the hyperlink approach (136 reports, 15. 59 €/report). Regarding the severity of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions,</b> protocols were the most efficient approach, costing 2. 29 €/report, followed by hyperlinks (30. 28 €/report, having no running costs). Concerning <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions,</b> the best result was obtained with protocols (5. 12 €/report), followed by first educational approach (38. 79 €/report).

They seem to be the most efficient intervention, allowing receiving <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> reports at lower costs. The increase applied not only to the total number of reports, but also to the severity, unexpectedness and high degree of causality attributed to the <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions.</b> Still, hyperlinks have the advantage of not involving running costs, showing the second best performance in cost per <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> report...|$|R

40|$|Background: Dihydropyrimidine {{dehydrogenase}} (DPD) is {{the initial}} and rate-limiting enzyme of the metabolic pathway of 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and other fluoropyrimidines to inactive compounds. For this reason, severe, life-threatening toxicities may occur {{in patients with}} deficient DPD activity when administered standard doses of 5 -FU and its prodrugs. Materials and methods: We selected three patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who displayed <b>unexpected</b> severe <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> after treatment with 5 -FU and capecitabine. To investigate the possible involvement of deficient variants of the DPD gene (DPYD), a denaturing HPLC (dHPLC) approach followed by target exon sequencing of DPYD was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Results: Three novel non-synonymous mutations of DPYD, c. 2509 - 2510 insC, c. 1801 G>C, and c. 680 G>A, were detected in these subjects. Due {{to the absence of}} other deficient variants of DPYD and the compatibility of <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> with fluoropyrimidine treatment, the novel variants were associated with a poor-metabolizer phenotype. Conclusions: Stratification of patients {{on the basis of their}} genotype may help prevent toxicity, and the large body of evidence about the pathogenesis of fluoropyrimidine-induced <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> strongly encourages the adoption of best practice recommendations to appropriately address this important clinical issue.

40|$|Abstract Introduction A {{combination}} therapy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers {{has been used}} to control proteinuria, following initial demonstration of its efficacy. However, recently concerns about the safety of this therapy have emerged, prompting several authors to urge for caution in its use. In the following case report, we describe the occurrence of a serious and <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> after administration of a combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers to a patient with nephrotic syndrome and liver cirrhosis with severe portal hypertension. Case presentation We administered this {{combination therapy}} to a 40 -year-old Caucasian man with liver cirrhosis in our Hepatology Clinic, given the concomitant presence of glomerulopathy associated with severe proteinuria. While the administration of one single drug appeared to be well-tolerated, our patient developed severe acute encephalopathy after the addition of the second one. Discontinuation of the therapy led to the disappearance of the side-effect. A tentative rechallenge with the same drug combination led to a second episode of acute severe encephalopathy. Conclusion We speculate that this <b>adverse</b> <b>reaction</b> may be directly related to the effect of angiotensin II on the excretion of blood ammonia. Therefore, we suggest that patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension are at risk of developing clinically relevant encephalopathy when angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and angiotensin II receptor blocker combination therapy is administered, thus indicating the need for a careful clinical follow-up. In addition, the incidence of this serious side-effect should be rigorously evaluated in all patients with liver cirrhosis administered with this common treatment combination. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{nucleotide}} analogue brincidofovir {{was developed}} to prevent and treat infections caused by double-stranded DNA viruses. Based on in vitro data suggesting an antiviral effect against Ebola virus, brincidofovir {{was included in the}} World Health Organisation list of agents that should be prioritised for clinical evaluation in patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) during the West African epidemic. Methods and Findings In this single-arm phase 2 trial conducted in Liberia, patients with laboratory-confirmed EVD (two months of age or older, enrolment bodyweight ≥ 50 kg) received oral brincidofovir 200 mg as a loading dose on day 0, followed by 100 mg brincidofovir on days 3, 7, 10, and 14. Bodyweight-adjusted dosing was used for patients weighing < 50 kg at enrolment. The primary outcome was survival at Day 14 after the first dose of brincidofovir. Four patients were enrolled between 01 January 2015 and 31 January 2015. The trial was stopped following the decision by the manufacturer to terminate their program of development of brincidofovir for EVD. No Serious <b>Adverse</b> <b>Reactions</b> or Suspected <b>Unexpected</b> Serious <b>Adverse</b> <b>Reactions</b> were identified. All enrolled subjects died of an illness consistent with EVD. Conclusions Due to the small sample size {{it was not possible to}} determine the efficacy of brincidofovir for the treatment of EVD. The premature termination of the trial highlights the need to establish better practices for preclinical in-vitro and animal screening of therapeutics for potentially emerging epidemic infectious diseases prior to their use in patients...|$|R

There were 314 ADR cases among 118, 208 patients receiving enhanced CT or MRI examinations. The frequency of moderate/severe ADRs defined by Chinese Society of Radiology (ie, severe vomiting, systematic urticaria, facial swelling, dyspnea, vasovagal reaction, laryngeal edema, seizure, trembling, convulsions, unconsciousness, shock, death, and other <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions)</b> was rare (0. 0431 %), whereas the mild ADRs were uncommon (0. 2225 %) and accounted for 83. 76 % of ADRs. Frequency of ADRs induced by iodinated contrast agents was related with examination site, sex, and type of patient settings (P< 0. 01) and was higher compared with gadolinium contrast agents (0. 3676 % vs 0. 0504 %, P< 0. 01). From 2014 to 2015, frequencies of total and moderate/severe ADRs induced by iodinated contrast agents decreased significantly (0. 4410 % vs 0. 2947 %, P< 0. 01; 0. 0960 % vs 0. 0282 %, P< 0. 01, respectively). Frequency of ADRs differed among different iodinated contrast and gadolinium contrast (P< 0. 05) agents. Iopromide’s ADR frequency in 2014 was significantly higher compared with iopamidol, ioversol, or iohexol (P< 0. 01). Frequency of moderate/severe ADRs induced by iodixanol was 4. 1 – 5. 4 times that of iohexol, iopromide, or iopamidol. Rash was the predominant ADR subtype (84. 39 %) and occurred more frequently with iodixanol compared with iohexol, iopamidol, or ioversol (P< 0. 01). Overall, 21. 97 % of ADR cases had allergy history or atopy traits, and these cases experienced ADRs earlier than the negative ones (17. 19 min vs 85. 34 min, P< 0. 01). The mean time to onset of ADRs was increased in patients receiving iodixanol compared with other iodinated contrast agents (323. 77 min vs 42. 36 min, P< 0. 01). Overall, 37. 26 % of ADRs occurred within 5 min and 84. 08 % of ADRs occurred within 30 min. Efficient quality improvement in decreasing ADRs induced by radiocontrast agents has been achieved by multidisciplinary collaboration.

40|$|Background: F 16 -IL 2 is a tumor-targeting immunocytokine {{composed}} of the antibody fragment F 16 (specific to the tumor marker A 1 domain of tenascin) and of human interleukin- 2 (IL 2). Thorough preclinical work showed that F 16 -IL 2 localizes selectively at tumor tissues and enhances the activity of certain anticancer drugs. In these phase Ib studies, we investigated F 16 -IL 2 in combination with doxorubicin or paclitaxel, defining the recommended dose (RD) and assessing safety, tolerability, and early signs of activity. Methods: Cohorts of pretreated patients with progressive solid tumors received weekly administrations of 6 escalating doses of doxorubicin (up to 25 mg/m 2) or 8 escalating doses of paclitaxel (up to 90 mg/m 2), combined with F 16 -IL 2 (up to 25 MioIU of IL 2 equivalent) for a maximum of 6 months. Safety and efficacy were evaluated using CTC v 3. 0 and RECIST criteria. Results: 18 and 28 patients, with a median age of 63 years (37 - 75) and 64 years (42 - 79), were treated in the doxorubicin and paclitaxel combination trials, respectively. Toxicity was manageable with only few reversible G 4 events, no serious <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions,</b> and no treatment related deaths. The RD was defined as 25 MioIU of F 16 -IL 2 given in combination with 25 mg/m 2 doxorubicin or 90 mg/m 2 paclitaxel weekly. Objective responses and long-lasting disease stabilizations were observed, including 4 partial responses, 2 of which in heavily pretreated NSCLC patients and 1 still ongoing after 17 months from beginning of treatment. Among the evaluable patients treated with the paclitaxel or doxorubicin combination respectively, PFS rate at 3 months is 50 % and 44 % (n= 24 and n= 16) and 1 -year survival rate is 41 % and 38 % (n= 17 and n= 13). Conclusions: 25 Mio IU of F 16 -IL 2 combined with full-dose doxorubicin or paclitaxel can be safely and repeatedly administered weekly to patients with solid tumors, and showed early signs of clinical activity. Based on preclinical evidence, these combination regimens are being administered to breast cancer patients in phase II trials. Moreover, starting from the observed promising signs of activity, a study of F 16 -IL 2 in lung cancer patients is being planned...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} a highly efficacious vaccine against Plasmodium falciparum remains pressing. In this {{controlled}} human malaria infection (CHMI) study, we assessed the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of a schedule combining 2 distinct vaccine types in a staggered immunization regimen: one inducing high-titer antibodies to circumsporozoite protein (RTS,S/AS 01 B) and the other inducing potent T-cell responses to thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (TRAP) by using a viral vector. Thirty-seven healthy malaria-naive adults were vaccinated with either a chimpanzee adenovirus 63 and modified vaccinia virus Ankara-vectored vaccine expressing a multiepitope string fused to TRAP and 3 doses of RTS,S/AS 01 B (group 1; n = 20) or 3 doses of RTS,S/AS 01 B alone (group 2; n = 17). CHMI was delivered by mosquito bites to 33 vaccinated subjects at week 12 after the first vaccination and to 6 unvaccinated controls. No suspected <b>unexpected</b> serious <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> or severe <b>adverse</b> events related to vaccination were reported. Protective vaccine efficacy was observed in 14 of 17 subjects (82. 4 %) in group 1 and 12 of 16 subjects (75 %) in group 2. All control subjects received a diagnosis of blood-stage malaria parasite infection. Both vaccination regimens were immunogenic. Fourteen protected subjects underwent repeat CHMI 6 months after initial CHMI; 7 of 8 (87. 5 %) in group 1 and 5 of 6 (83. 3 %) in group 2 remained protected. The high level of sterile efficacy observed in this trial is encouraging for further evaluation of combination approaches using these vaccine types. NCT 01883609...|$|R

This postmarketing surveillance study investigated expected and <b>unexpected</b> <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> (ADRs) of TAS- 102 in clinical {{practice in the}} first 6 months after market launch. Patients and MethodsAll metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients (pts) received TAS- 102 35 mg/m 2 as a starting dose orally twice daily for 5 consecutive days, with 2 days of rest per week for 2 weeks, followed by a 14 -day rest period. ADRs during treatment courses were reported spontaneously by attending physicians. ResultsFrom May 26 to November 25, 2014, 3420 mCRC pts were treated with TAS- 102 at 1134 institutes in Japan. In total, 370 ADRs (185 ADRs of myelosuppression and related infection in 125 pts, of which 58 ADRs in 31 pts were serious ADRs [SADRs] and 127 ADRs in 98 pts were non-SADRs) were observed in 219 pts and included 89 SADRs in 51 pts and 281 non-SADRs in 183 pts (a pt was counted twice if SADR and non-SADR were experienced). The most frequent ADRs were: myelosuppression comprising neutropenia (n = 77), leukopenia (n = 28), thrombocytopenia (n = 23), anemia (n = 20), and febrile neutropenia (FN; n = 19). Serious neutropenia and FN tended to occur from days 15 to 21 in the first cycle in 12 (75 %) of 16 pts. ConclusionThe ADRs and safety profile of TAS- 102 {{in this study was}} similar to that in recent TAS- 102 clinical trials, without unexpected safety signals. Careful monitoring should be undertaken in pts with serious neutropenia around day 15 in the first cycle of treatment to prevent FN...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevention}} of {{central venous catheter}} (CVC) associated bloodstream infections (CABSIs) in paediatric oncology patients is essential. Ethanol locks can eliminate pathogens colonising CVCs and microbial resistance is rare. Aim {{of this study was}} to determine whether two hour 70 % ethanol locks can reduce CABSI in paediatric oncology patients. We conducted a randomised, double blind, multi-centre trial in paediatric oncology patients (1 - 18 years) with newly inserted CVCs. Patients were randomly assigned to receive two hour ethanol locks (1. 5 or 3 ml 70 %) or heparin locks (1. 5 or 3 ml 100 IU/ml), whenever it was needed to use the CVC, maximum frequency once weekly. Primary outcomes were time to CABSI or death due to CABSI. We recruited 307 patients (ethanol, n= 153; heparin, n= 154). In the ethanol group, 16 / 153 (10 %) patients developed a CABSI versus 29 / 154 (19 %) in the heparin group. The incidence of CABSI was 0. 77 / 1000 and 1. 46 / 1000 catheter days respectively (p= 0. 039). The number-needed-to-treat was 13. No patients died of CABSI. In particular, Gram-positive CABSIs were reduced (ethanol, n= 8; heparin, n= 21; p= 0. 012). Fewer CVCs were removed because of CABSI in the ethanol group (p= 0. 077).

40|$|Abstract Background Randomised {{controlled}} clinical (drug) trials supply {{high quality}} evidence for therapeutic strategies in primary care. Until now, experience with drug trials in German general practice has been sparse. In 2007 / 2008, the authors conducted an investigator-initiated, non-commercial, double-blind, randomised controlled pilot trial (HWI- 01) {{to assess the}} clinical equivalence of ibuprofen and ciprofloxacin {{in the treatment of}} uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI). Here, we report the feasibility of this trial in German general practices and the implementation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) standards as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) in mainly inexperienced general practices. Methods This report is based on the experience of the HWI- 01 study conducted in 29 German general practices. Feasibility was defined by 1) successful practice recruitment, 2) sufficient patient recruitment, 3) complete and accurate data collection and 4) appropriate protection of patient safety. Results The final practice recruitment rate was 18 %. In these practices, 79 of 195 screened UTI patients were enrolled. Recruitment differed strongly between practices (range 0 - 12, mean 2. 8 patients per practice) and was below the recruitment goal of approximately 100 patients. As anticipated, practice nurses became the key figures in the screening und recruitment of patients. Clinical trial demands, in particular for completing symptom questionnaires, documentation of source data and reporting of adverse events, did not agree well with GPs' documentation habits and required support from study nurses. In many cases, GPs and practice staff seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of information and regulations. No sudden <b>unexpected</b> serious <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> (SUSARs) were observed during the trial. Conclusions To enable drug trials in general practice, it is necessary to adapt the setup of clinical research infrastructure to the needs of GPs and their practice staff. Risk adaption of clinical trial regulations is necessary to facilitate non-commercial comparative effectiveness trials in primary health care.
