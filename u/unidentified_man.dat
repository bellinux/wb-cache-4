5|$|After {{the credits}} roll, Ocelot is heard {{talking to the}} KGB Chief Director over the telephone. After {{suggesting}} that the KGB use the knowledge of both the Virtuous Mission and Operation Snake Eater to blackmail the United States during future negotiations, he then calls another, <b>unidentified</b> <b>man.</b> Ocelot informs him that the microfilm stolen by EVA was a fake and {{that half of the}} Philosopher's Legacy is now in America's hands, with the other half held by the KGB. It transpires that Ocelot has been triple-crossing everyone from the very beginning. He then reveals that he is in fact ADAM, that he is talking to the director of the CIA, and that he has been working for the said agency all this time.|$|E
5|$|Confederate Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, from Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's Third Corps, {{advanced}} towards Gettysburg. Heth deployed no cavalry and led, unconventionally, {{with the}} artillery battalion of Major William J. Pegram. Two infantry brigades followed, commanded by Brig. Gens. James J. Archer and Joseph R. Davis, proceeding easterly in columns along the Chambersburg Pike. Three miles (5km) west of town, about 7:30 a.m., Heth's two brigades met light resistance from cavalry vedettes and deployed into line. Eventually, they reached dismounted troopers from Col. William Gamble's cavalry brigade. The first {{shot of the}} battle was claimed to be fired by Lieutenant Marcellus E. Jones of the 8th Illinois Cavalry, fired at an <b>unidentified</b> <b>man</b> on a gray horse over a half-mile away; the act was merely symbolic. Buford's 2,748 troopers would soon be faced with 7,600 Confederate infantrymen, deploying from columns into line of battle.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 2015, police {{released}} a video {{from the night}} before the theft, that is believed to show a dry run of the robbery. Two men appear on the tape; one of them remains unidentified, while the other has been confirmed as Richard Abath, a security guard on duty the night of the heist. The video appears to show Abath buzzing the <b>unidentified</b> <b>man</b> into the museum twice within a few minutes. The man stayed for about three minutes in the lobby, then returned to a car and drove off. Police say the video opens new lines of investigation, and The New York Times points out that it draws new attention to Abath as a potential collaborator. However, the guards have previously been interviewed and deemed too unimaginative to have pulled off the heist.|$|E

5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he felt like the dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an <b>unidentified</b> <b>man</b> floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E
5|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot {{for the single}} by Luis Hernandez and Satoru Yokoyama, respectively. Hernandez's version opens with busy streets and the dawn of Los Angeles, California. Hamasaki begins singing the song {{on top of a}} skyscraper, whilst several intercut scenes of people walking around Los Angeles during a time lapse are shown. She is then seen {{painting}} a picture of an <b>unidentified</b> <b>man,</b> who raps Verbal's part. It then shows intercut scenes of traffic, a carosuel and couple standing near a bridge. Several parts of these scenes are revised throughout the entire video, which ends with Hamasaki again on top of the skyscraper. For Yokoyama's video, only shots featuring Verbal were only filmed, alongside scenes of him walking through a city in Japan, and residing in a neon-lit club. Parts of Hernandez's version, with the scenes of Hamasaki painting a man and scenes of Los Angeles city and public, were removed in order to merge the first video and Verbal's appearance together. This version premiered one week before the album's release on July 2, and was included on the DVD and Blu-Ray versions of Colours.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an <b>unidentified</b> <b>man.</b> The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been {{watching}} the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E

40|$|Background—We {{examined}} mortality among working-age Russian {{men whose}} identity {{could not be}} determined, focusing on where and how they died. Methods—Employing micro-data from deaths that occurred in Izhevsk (Ural region) between June 2004 and September 2005, we analysed the characteristics of decedent men aged 25 – 54 (n = 2158). Differences between completely identified (n = 1699) and unidentified deaths (n = 282) were compared via logistic regression. Data on all deaths in Russia in 2002 were used for supplemental comparisons. Results—We found that relative to identified <b>men,</b> <b>unidentified</b> <b>men</b> were at {{a higher risk of}} death from exposure to natural cold, violence, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, acute respiratory infections and poisonings. Our results also revealed that alcohol {{played an important role in}} the mortality of <b>unidentified</b> <b>men.</b> The places and causes of death among these <b>unidentified</b> <b>men</b> provide substantial evidence of their homelessness and social isolation. Conclusion—The increase in deaths among <b>unidentified</b> <b>men</b> of working-age indicates the emergence of a health threat associated with homelessness and social marginalization. This vulnerable group is exposed to different levels and causes of mortality compared with the larger population and represent a new challenge that requires serious and immediate scholarly attention and policy responses...|$|R

25|$|Van Orman survived other, less inspiring incidents: {{once he was}} {{assaulted}} by an <b>unidentified</b> <b>man,</b> allegedly hired by one of Van Orman's competitors; on another occasion during prohibition period he landed a balloon {{in the middle of}} an illegal distillery operation, and was confronted by bootleggers wielding shotguns who mistook him for a federal agent. During the 1933 National Race Van Orman's balloon flew deep into Canadian forests. He and his partners wandered through the wilderness, starving; back at home they were already considered dead. Finally, they reached a telephone line running through the forest; they chopped down a pole, severing the line, expecting that a repair crew will eventually locate them.

25|$|The {{documentary}} was {{notable for}} showing {{a wide range}} of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Suprunyuk and Sayenko are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their Daewoo Lanos taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing {{what they are going to}} do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through binoculars for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director Jorge Olguín, who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an <b>unidentified</b> <b>man.</b> At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.|$|E
