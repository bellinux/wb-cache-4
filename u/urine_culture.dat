5|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse, diabetes, obesity, and family history. Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor, UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment fails, a <b>urine</b> <b>culture</b> may be useful.|$|E
500|$|It is {{reasonable}} to obtain a <b>urine</b> <b>culture</b> in those with signs of systemic infection that {{may be unable to}} report urinary symptoms, such as when advanced dementia is present.

500|$|In {{straightforward}} cases, {{a diagnosis}} {{may be made}} and treatment given based on symptoms alone without further laboratory confirmation. In complicated or questionable cases, {{it may be useful}} to confirm the diagnosis via urinalysis, looking for the presence of urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase. [...] Another test, urine microscopy, looks for the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. <b>Urine</b> <b>culture</b> is deemed positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of {{greater than or equal to}} 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical urinary tract organism. Antibiotic sensitivity can also be tested with these cultures, making them useful in the selection of antibiotic treatment.

As symptoms can be vague and without reliable tests for urinary tract infections, diagnosis can be difficult in the elderly.|$|E

40|$|Background Urinary tract {{infection}}s (UTIs) are {{the second}} {{leading cause of}} infection in children, following respiratory tract infections. Repeat <b>urine</b> <b>cultures</b> after antibiotic treatment are routinely obtained in clinical practice to verify proof of bacteriologic cure. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommended repeat cultures, due to increased cost and discomfort to patients. Objective To determine the frequency of positive repeat <b>urine</b> <b>cultures</b> after 3 days of antibiotics in children 'With UTIs. Methods We conducted a retrospective study on children with UTIs who visited the Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Department of Child Health at Dr. Soetomo Hospital, Surabaya from January 2006 to December 2011.

Of the 264 patients who comprised our study, there were similar numbers of girls and boys (50. 4 % vs. 49. 6 %, respectively). The mean age of patients was 43. 9 (SD 1. 59) months and 35. 5 % of subjects were aged under 1 year.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundUrinary tract {{infection}} {{is common in}} pediatrics. Its initial treatment {{is based on the}} administration of an antibiotic; thus, it is necessary to have information about the most common microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance patterns. ObjectivesTo determine the frequency of microorganisms reported in <b>urine</b> <b>cultures</b> in patients under the age of 15 years with diagnosis of urinary tract infection at Hospital Universitario Fundación Santafé in Bogotá. MethodsPeriod prevalence study based on the computerized register of the clinical microbiology laboratory (WHONET 5. 4). All positive <b>urine</b> <b>cultures</b> (more than 105 CFU) in children under age 16 in the period January 2006 to December 2007 were evaluated. ResultsThere were 421 positive <b>urine</b> <b>cultures</b> in the study period. The most common germs were Escherichia coli (62 %), Proteus mirabilis (17 %), and Enterococcus faecalis (6 %). Fifty per cent, 41 % and 17 % of the E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin-sulbactam, respectively. Resistance to first, second and third generation cephalosporin was very low in this sample of <b>urine</b> <b>cultures.</b> Proteus mirabilis had high resistance (96 %) to nitrofurantoin only, while its resistance to other antibiotics was of less than 8 %. Enterococcus faecallis resistance to clindamycin was 76 %, and it was 100 % sensitive to ampicillin, nitrofurantoin, linezolid and vancomycin. ConclusionsOur results support the use of first generation cephalosporins as the antibiotic of choice for the initial management of urinary tract infection.

50|$|The {{cause of}} IC/BPS is unknown. While it can, {{it does not}} {{typically}} run in a family. The diagnosis is usually based on the symptoms after ruling out other conditions.

25|$|<b>Urine</b> <b>cultures</b> are {{performed}} 3 monthly to exclude breakthrough infection. Annual radiological investigations are likewise indicated.

40|$|Background: Up to {{half the}} {{residents}} of nursing homes for the elderly have asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU), which should not be treated with antibiotics. A complementary test to discriminate between symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTI) and ABU is needed, as diagnostic uncertainty is likely to generate significant antibiotic overtreatment. Previous studies indicate that Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in the urine might be suitable as such a test. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association between laboratory findings of bacteriuria, IL- 6 in the urine, dipstick urinalysis and newly onset symptoms among residents of nursing homes. Methods: In this cross sectional study, voided <b>urine</b> specimens for <b>culture,</b> <b>urine</b> dipstick and IL- 6 analyses were collected from all residents capable of providing a voided urine sample, regardless of the presence of symptoms. Urine specimens and symptom forms were provided from 421 residents of 22 nursing homes. The following new or increased nonspecific symptoms occurring during the previous month were registered; fatigue, restlessness, confusion, aggressiveness, loss of appetite, frequent falls and not being herself/himself, as well as symptoms from the urinary tract; dysuria, urinary urgency and frequency. Results: Recent onset of nonspecific symptoms was common among elderly residents of nursing homes (85 / 421). <b>Urine</b> <b>cultures</b> were positive in 32 % (135 / 421), Escherichia coli was by far the most common bacterial finding. Residents without nonspecific symptoms had positive <b>urine</b> <b>cultures</b> as often as those with nonspecific symptoms with a duration of up to one month. Residents with positive <b>urine</b> <b>cultures</b> had higher concentrations of IL- 6 in the urine (p < 0. 001). However, among residents with positive <b>urine</b> <b>cultures</b> there were no differences in IL- 6 concentrations or dipstick findings between those with or without nonspecific symptoms. Conclusions: Nonspecific symptoms among elderly residents of nursing homes are unlikely to be caused by bacteria in the urine. This study could not establish any clinical value of using dipstick urinalysis or IL- 6 in the urine to verify if bacteriuria was linked to nonspecific symptoms...|$|R

50|$|In {{patients}} {{suspected of}} having pyelonephritis, a <b>urine</b> <b>culture</b> and antibiotic sensitivity test is performed, and initial therapy is tailored {{on the basis of}} the infecting organism.

50|$|Diagnosis of OAB is made {{primarily}} on the person's signs and symptoms and by ruling out other possible causes such as an infection.
