50|$|A <b>unicameral</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cyst,</b> {{also known}} as a simple bone cyst, is a cavity filled with a yellow-colored fluid. It is {{considered}} to be benign since it does not spread beyond the bone. Unicameral bone cysts can be classified into two categories: active and latent. An active cyst is adjacent to the epiphyseal plate and tends to grow until it fills the entire diaphysis, the shaft, of the bone; depending on the invasiveness of the cyst, it can cause a pathological fracture or even destroy the epiphyseal plate leading to the permanent shortening of the bone. A latent cyst is located away from the epiphyseal plate and is more likely to heal with treatment. It is typically diagnosed in children from the aged 5 to 15. Although unicameral bone cysts can form in any bone structure, it is predominantly found in the proximal humerus and proximal femur; additionally, it affects males twice as often as females.|$|E

Outcomes included treatment failure (defined clinically as subsequent pathologic fracture or need for retreatment to prevent pathologic fracture) and complications.

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Unicameral</b> <b>Bone</b> <b>Cyst</b> (UBC) is {{described}} as a central metaphyseal cystic lesion of the bone with serum fluid content. Diagnosis is typically based on x-ray imaging features, age, localisation at proximal humerus and femur and the absence of symptoms until pathological fracture development. MATERIALS AND METHODS Eighteen patients with unicameral bone cysts were reviewed in Nalanda Medical College Hospital. Nine patients received serial steroid injections and the other nine patients were treated conservatively following fractures. In the steroid injection group, six cases were in the proximal femur and three in the proximal humerus. RESULTS The nine steroid injection patients showed radiological evidence of cyst healing within four months of treatment. Subsequently, all 9 patients showed a satisfactory radiological outcome after a year and complete resolution after 2 years. In the conservative group, all 9 cases were in the proximal humerus. Persistent cystic lesions were observed in all 9 patients and 2 was complicated by another fracture within 6 months. CONCLUSION Fractures through UBC in the upper extremity can be treated nonoperatively.

40|$|Abstract: Management of <b>unicameral</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> (UBC) remain controversial. These cysts seldom heal spontaneously or {{even after}} {{pathological}} fracture. Sometimes these cysts {{can be very}} large and incredibly troublesome to the patient. Various treatments exist with variable success rates. We present our experience of treating these lesions by continuous drainage. Over a seven year period, six patients with <b>unicameral</b> <b>bone</b> <b>cysts</b> were treated by inserting a modified drain into {{the wall of the}} cyst. The aim of surgery was to place the drain in a dependent area of the cyst, through the cortex allowing for continuous drainage. This was achieved through a small incision under radiographic control. A cement restrictor (usually used for femoral canal plugging during total hip replacements) was modified and inserted to prevent closure of the drain site. A redivac drain was passed through the plug into the cyst. The drain was left in place for a week to establish an epithelialized pathway which hopefully would remain patent, into the subcutaneous tissues, after the drain had been removed. There were four males and two females in the group and the age range was 6 - 12 years. Four of the lesions were in the upper humerus, one in the proximal femur and the other one in the proximal tibia. Healing was rated according to the modified Neer classification. Grade 1 (healed) and Grade 2 (healed with defect) was defined as excellent outcome. Persistent /Recurrent cysts (Grade 3 and 4) were noted as unsatisfactory. Five cases were completely healed. Only one had a further fracture and there were no recurrent fractures. All the patients reported complete comfort and they all were able to re-engage in recreational activities without restriction.
