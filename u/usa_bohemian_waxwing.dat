5|$|The <b>Bohemian</b> <b>waxwing</b> has a {{circumpolar}} distribution, breeding {{in northern}} regions of Eurasia and North America. In Eurasia, its northern nesting limit is {{just short of}} the treeline, roughly at the 10°C July isotherm, and it breeds south locally to about 51°N. Most birds breed between 60–67°N, reaching 70°N in Scandinavia. The North American subspecies breeds in the northwestern and north central areas of the continent, its range extending southwards beyond the US border in the Rocky Mountains.|$|R
5|$|The bird life is {{dominated}} by species from the Siberian taiga, which are otherwise not common in Norway. Species inhabiting the park include Siberian jay, pine grosbeak, <b>Bohemian</b> <b>waxwing,</b> common crane and whooper swan. Several species of sparrow and charadriiformes are also common. There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged buzzard, merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn. The great grey owl and northern hawk-owl are common in years with good access to rodents.|$|R
50|$|It {{winters in}} Japan, Korea and eastern China; the exact {{distribution}} is irregular as flocks move {{in search of}} berries and birds may be common in an area one year and scarce the next. In Japan it is present from November to April; few birds winter on Hokkaidō but in south-western Japan, it outnumbers the <b>Bohemian</b> <b>waxwing.</b> The winter habitat is open woodland or farmland in the lowlands or low mountains and birds frequently visit berry-laden trees in parks and gardens.|$|R
50|$|The {{waxwings}} are passerine birds classified in {{the genus}} Bombycilla. They are brown and pale grey with silky plumage, {{a black and white}} eyestripe, a crest, a square-cut tail and pointed wings. Some of the wing feathers have red tips, the resemblance of which to sealing wax gives these birds their common name. According to most authorities, this is the only genus placed in the family Bombycillidae, although Phainoptila is sometimes included. There are three species, the <b>Bohemian</b> <b>waxwing</b> (B. garrulus), the Japanese waxwing (B. japonica) and the cedar waxwing (B. cedrorum).|$|R
5000|$|Cedar {{waxwings}} are {{a medium-sized}} bird approximately 6 - 7 in long and weigh roughly 30 g. They are {{smaller and more}} brown than their close relative, the <b>Bohemian</b> <b>waxwing</b> (which breeds farther {{to the north and}} west). It is a [...] "silky, shiny collection of brown, gray, and lemon-yellow, accented with a subdued crest, rakish black mask, and brilliant-red wax droplets on the wing feathers." [...] These droplets may be the same color as the madrone berries they are known to eat. These birds' most prominent feature is this small cluster of red wax-like droplets on tips of secondary flight feathers on the wings, a feature they share with the <b>Bohemian</b> <b>waxwing</b> (but not the Japanese waxwing). The wings are [...] "broad and pointed, like a starling's." [...] The tail is typically yellow or orange depending on diet. Birds that have fed on berries of introduced Eurasian honeysuckles while growing tail feathers will have darker orange-tipped tail-feathers. The tail is somewhat short, and square-tipped. Adults have a pale yellow belly. The waxwing's crest often [...] "lies flat and droops {{over the back of the}} head." [...] It has a short and wide bill. The waxwing's black mask has a thin white border. Immature birds are streaked on the throat and flanks, and often do not have the black mask of the adults. Males and females look alike.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Bohemian</b> <b>waxwing</b> (Bombycilla garrulus) is a starling-sized {{passerine}} {{bird that}} breeds {{in the northern}} forests of Eurasia and North America.

40|$|This {{data set}} {{consists}} of a Rapid Biodiversity Sampling from a non-intrusive citizen science GRID (5 * 5 geo-referenced sampling + 5 random plots = 30 plots overall). It includes raw count data for 305 bird observations of 14 identified bird species, and plants from the 25 + 5 survey sampling plots (3 m radius), as well as insects from four trapping webs (3 m radius, 25 traps each, 3 repeats; mostly spiders were detected). The survey was done between 25 th of June and 27 th of June in 2013 at the White Mountains (north to the NorthForkBirch and Twelvemile Creeks - near the Steese Hgw 6) in Alaska USA (decimal degrees latitude 65. 39590, longitude - 145. 72890, geographic datum of WGS 84). Plots are located near the public road in the rolling hills, subartic tundra on some slope, and some are located. All plot locations were photographed (sky, ground and habitat shots) and for a visual assessment. All bird detections (visual and oral) carry a radial distance 360 degrees from the observer, and were collected according to DISTANCE Sampling point transect protocols. Respectively, a DISTANCE Sampling trapping web protocol, with a 3 m radius and allowing for detectability correction in abundance estimates, was applied for ground-living insects. Generally, these data do not cover high detailed taxonomic information (and usually just follow basic but accurate descriptions). Each plot was visited three times according to the PRESENCE software requirements to obtain occupancy estimates. All of these data can be data-mined using for instance freely available RandomForest, Distance Sampling and PRESENCE software packages. Comparable Biodiversity GRID data so far is available for over 11 other regions (e. g.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the movement patterns of {{two groups of}} birds which are generally regarded as irruptive migrants, namely (a) boreal finches and others that depend on fluctuating tree-fruit crops, and (b) owls and others that depend on cyclically fluctuating rodent populations. Both groups specialise on food supplies which, in particular regions, fluctuate more than 100 -fold from year to year. However, seed-crops in widely separated regions may fluctuate independently of one another, as may rodent populations, so that poor food supplies in one region may coincide with good supplies in another. If individuals are {{to have access to}} rich food supplies every year, they must often move hundreds or thousands of kilometres from one breeding area to another. In years of widespread food shortage (or high numbers relative to food supplies) extending many thousands or millions of square kilometres, large numbers of individuals migrate to lower latitudes, as an ‘irruptive migration’. For these reasons, the distribution of the population, in both summer and winter, varies greatly from year to year. In particular breeding areas, many species of irruptive migrants fluctuate in density according to food supplies at the time. The facts that the response to food change is rapid, and that increases in numbers from one year to the next are often greater than can be explained by high survival and reproduction from the previous year, imply that such year to year density changes are due mainly to movements. Ring recoveries and other data lend support to this view. In irruptive migrants, in contrast to regular migrants, site fidelity is poor, and few individuals return to the same breeding areas in successive years (apart from owls in the increase phase of a rodent cycle). Moreover, ring recoveries and radio-tracking confirm that the same individuals can breed in different years in areas separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometres. Extreme examples are provided by Common Crossbills Loxia curvirostra, in which individual adults were found in localities up to 3200 km apart in different breeding seasons, and Snowy Owls Nyctea scandiaca found in localities up to nearly 2000 km apart. The implication from irruptive migrations, that individuals can winter in widely separated localities in different years, is also supported by ring recoveries, at least in seed-eaters, in which individuals have been found in one winter hundreds or thousands of kilometres from where they were ringed in a previous winter. Most such shifts could be regarded as lying at different points on the same migration axis, but some were apparently on different axes, as the birds were recovered in winter far to the east or west of where they were ringed in a previous winter. Extreme examples include a <b>Bohemian</b> <b>Waxwing</b> Bombycilla garrulus (6000 km, Ukraine to Siberia), a Siskin Carduelis spinus (3000 km, Sweden to Iran), a Pine Siskin Carduelis pinus (3950 km, Quebec to California), and a Common Redpoll Carduelis flammea (8350 km, Belgium to China). Compared to regular (obligate) migrants, irruptive (facultative) migrants show much greater year to year variations in the proportions of individuals that migrate, and greater individual and year to year variations in the timing, directions and distances of movements. The control systems are flexible in irruptive migrants, enabling individuals to respond to feeding conditions at the time. However, regular and irruptive migrants are probably best regarded, not as distinct categories, but as representing opposite extremes of a continuum of migratory behaviour found among birds, from narrow and consistent at one end to broad and flexible at the other. Both systems are adaptive, the one to conditions in which resource levels are predictable in space and time, and the other to conditions in which resource levels are unpredictable. Depending on the predictability and stability of its food supply, the same species may behave as a resident or regular migrant in one part of its range, and as an irruptive migrant in another, as exemplified by particular species of both seed-eaters and rodent-eaters...|$|R
