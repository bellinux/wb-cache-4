It is mainly based on melting metallic powder layer by layer and turning it into direct end <b>user</b> <b>parts.</b> The creation of complex part forms and lightweight structures have become easier with Additive Manufacturing through large usage of lattice structures. However, current design methods and Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) tools are not tailored {{for this type of}} shapes and are not yet optimized to achieve the great potential offered by this new technology. The breakthrough in manufacturing technology is not yet followed by a breakthrough in design and CAD tools. The current study aims at evaluating current CAD software's performances and proposes requirements for CAD tools to be efficient in design for additive manufacturing. The results show that current CAD tools and CAD file formats have insufficient performance in the context of design for Additive Manufacturing and a new file format together with new CAD human interaction needs to be created to overcome these problems...|$|E
40|$|Fused Deposition Modeling is a {{worldwide}} diffused Additive Manufacturing technology able to fabricate prototypes, tooling and end <b>user</b> <b>parts</b> {{directly from a}} virtual model. The layer by layer fabrication allows having no limitation of part shape complexity but some weaknesses exist about the obtainable accuracy. The dimensional deviations observed on a physical prototype are {{of the order of}} some tenths of millimeter depending upon the local slope of the surface. In order to enhance the accuracy, the idea is to compensate for the deviations by means of a virtual model offset. For the purpose a novel methodology has been developed to offset the triangular mesh: it operates an offset with a variable radius of the vertices without changing their interconnections. In this way the new virtual model is generated in a stable and robust way without modifying the Fused Deposition Modeling process chain. The experimentation carried out both on simple and complex geometries points out a marked improvement of the dimensional accuracy. The assessment has been performed by dimensional measurements and by a preliminary analysis of the errors introduced by the offset method...|$|E

40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} (AM) {{started over}} thirty years ago and with it a manufacturing revolution that moves industrial production into the personal home. With recent interest shifting into multi-functional parts fabricated through AM technologies, unified systems are being developed. Merging different manufacturing technologies into one single machine is a challenge but undergoing research has shown promise {{in the development of}} multi-functional systems. Concurrent work is being done in the software, automation, and hardware aspect of multi-functional systems. An effort to use industry compatible Computer Aided Design (CAD) software to design multi-functional parts including circuits, micro-machining, and foil embedding then exporting and processing automatically to create a hybrid g-code file is being done. The multi-functional g-code files include all the necessary information to create AM multi-functional parts without human intervention in the unified systems. ^ One advantage of AM is the ability to quickly prototype, extending this advantage to multi-functional parts means that quick multi-functional prototypes can be produce. Modern AM process are also capable of producing end use parts that are ready for commercial use, this leads to the possibility of creating end <b>user</b> <b>parts</b> with multi-functionality. This thesis explores the challenges and approaches to developing software that interfaces and processes multi-functional CADs and creates files for direct use in multi-functional AM machines. ...|$|E

AM in particular Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) used (ABS) thermoplastic have shown the most popular among the industry as its technology can print complex geometrical part without human intervention and tools. However, FDM fierce enemy whereas the common problem of stair-stepping, which means that seam lines appear between layers and excess material if often left as a residue, cause to lead rough surface and poor quality finish. It is often desirable for an AM model to have aesthetic or functional importance. Hence, reducing layer thickness will generally improve surface roughness but will add to the build time for the model. As an interest investigate the use of ultrasonic for FDM, this experiment {{will focus on the}} effect of applying multiple piezoelectric transducer for FDM printer. This paper aims to explore the effect use of multiple piezoelectric with different frequency applied (27, 40, 50 kHz) to improve surface finish quality part printed by FDM whereby an ultrasonic transducer firmly attached onto the platform.

40|$|Additive Manufacturing (AM) has {{increased}} in popularity and attracted much attention from many fields such as automotive, aviation, aerospace, and even the fashion industry. Since the early 2000 s, Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technologies {{have been the most}} popular in the AM world (“Wohlers Talk” Popularity of FDM). These technologies have been mainly used for building parts for prototype and structural type of applications such as a fixture for components or a housing for mechanisms. ^ With {{the current state of the}} FDM technologies, the functionality of the parts that are printed are limited to the applications listed before or simply just as visual aids. Adding more functionality to these structural parts allows the creation of end <b>user</b> <b>parts</b> which cannot be manufactured with traditional means of fabrication. Discussed in this work is the design and development of the thermal wire embedding (TWE) apparatus, describing three generations of the tool, each contains improvements to facilitate both wire embedding and maintenance. ^ The TWE tool is designed to embed wires into the interlayers or surface of a FDM-built part. Adding conductive wires to an FDM-built part provides an electronic functionality to the design and due to the wires acting as a reinforcement, they inherently increase the mechanical properties of the part. The TWE tool is fully automated to drive wire at various speeds with the use of a DC motor and cut wire with the aid of a cutting mechanism. The TWE tool is capable of embedding wire of different gauges as well as different materials. The TWE can place wires a close as 0. 5 mm apart without seeing any shorting between the wires. With the ability to adapt to different motion control systems, the TWE tool can embed 28 AWG copper wires in different orientations with a measured accuracy as close as +/- 29 μm of its intended position. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to incorporate the TWE tool with multiple technologies to create a multi-functional AM printed part. ...|$|E

I focus on the user {{and the use of}} the technology and, in particular, on what makes robotic aids worth using - useworthiness as distinguished from usability. User experience of the wheelchair-mounted Manus manipulator shows that robotic arms must meet technical requirements in terms of acceleration, speed, and pattern of movement. Easy horizontal and vertical adjustment of the end-effector is another requirement which must be met to enable a user to carry out the most common movements faster with less concentration. Experience of the useworthiness of robots was first obtained through the development of page-turning end-effectors for the RAID workstation. The principles of separating pages and the page-turning movements are analyzed and described in this thesis. End-effectors are essential to the functionality and useworthiness of robots. The performance requirements for the automatic grasping function for simplified robot use have been brought out through user trials. The thesis demonstrates that user trials with robots as assistive devices can result in new knowledge about both the use of the technology itself and the personal characteristics - needs, abilities, wishes, and dreams - of the <b>user.</b> <b>Parts</b> of the thesis have already been published or will be published in the form of articles and conference papers: - Robotics in rehabilitation.

40|$|In business, {{the time}} {{required}} to shepherd a new product through the phases of concept, design, prototypes, through manufacture and finally making the product available for sale (together known as: Time to Market) is critical to the success and profitability of the next generation of products. The use of relatively new technologies, known as 3 D Printing, which allow the fabrication of complex tridimensional shapes within hours of a completed CAD design without the need for tooling or molds, has significantly reduced {{the time required}} for a designer to physically hold a part designed only hours before and to perform form and fit checks. However, as the complexity of these products increases, with the inclusion of sophisticated electronics encased in 3 D structures with complex geometries and intricate detail Time to Market is compromised, resulting in lost opportunity. The use of advanced 3 D Printing technology enhanced with component placement capabilities and Direct Write micro-dispensing to achieve electrical interconnect deposition has recently been pursued as a means to provide prototypes for functional electronic devices in similar time frame as traditional 2 D bread board prototypes; however these 3 D prototypes include the advantage of being embedded in more appropriate shapes in order to accurately represent finished products earlier in the development cycle. ^ The fabrication freedom offered by 3 D Printing techniques such as Stereolithography (SL) and Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) have recently been explored in the context of 3 D electronics integration—referred to as Structural Electronics. Enhanced 3 D Printing may eventually be used to produce end <b>user</b> <b>parts,</b> allowing for unit-level customization and local manufacturing; but until limitations on the types of materials that can be used and accuracies improved (an eventuality), these enhanced 3 D printing technologies can be employed to reduce development times by providing advanced, geometrically accurate, functional structural electronic prototypes. ^ This application was demonstrated at the W. M. Keck Center by utilizing this technology to hasten the development process used to design a novelty six side gaming die. The die includes a micro-controller and accelerometer, which together detect motion and upon resting, identify its orientation through gravity to illuminate LEDs in the top surface for a fanciful effect. By applying this enhanced 3 D printing, the prototype stage was expedited. For comparison, the device was ultimately fabricated through the use of traditional manufacturing techniques, utilizing a flexible printed circuit board and a plastic injection molded case. ...|$|E
