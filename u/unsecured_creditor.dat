25|$|Secured and {{unsecured}} creditors {{constitute the}} creditor body. Both secured and unsecured creditors {{are ahead of}} shareholders as noted earlier. A secured creditor is a creditor, who has a priority claim on an asset or assets of a company. A lien on the specific asset or assets places the secured creditor's claim ahead of the <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor.</b> Once a secured creditor is satisfied, the <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor</b> is then the next priority. This is again the normal order of priority in a bankruptcy.|$|E
500|$|The {{general rule}} was that anyone with an {{interest}} in the safety of the thing stolen may sue. It could be that the owner did not have a sufficient interest to bring an action. If one person had a positive right in a thing, such as a pledgee, usufructory, or good faith possessor, both he and the owner could sue. The <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor</b> could not. Those obliged by contract to return the thing, and other forms of [...] "negative interest", had an action available at the expense of owner. This was only true so long as the person obliged was solvent [...] that is, under a real risk of losing out by a theft. If the person obliged was insolvent, the owner would have an action instead. The plaintiff with a negative interest was precluded from an action if it was by his own fault (dolus), or other dishonest. The lower standard of care required of a depositee meant he could not be sued by a depositor, and so had no action available for furtum. A vendor, who had agreed a price but not delivered his thing, retained legal ownership of the thing. Thus if the thing was stolen, the vendor had the action on the theft because he was liable to the purchaser.|$|E
2500|$|The {{liquidator}} has {{powers to}} disclaim any onerous property or unprofitable contracts. [...] Any person suffering loss by such disclaimer may claim against the insolvent estate as an <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} classes: <b>unsecured</b> priority <b>creditors</b> and general <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors.</b> <b>Unsecured</b> priority <b>creditors</b> are further subdivided into classes {{as described in the}} law. In some cases the assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all priority <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> in full; in such cases the general <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> receive nothing.|$|R

2500|$|Another [...] "more contentious" [...] form of {{constructive}} trust is {{in a situation}} where the claimant has [...] "done everything necessary". Where the owner of property intends to transfer property to another, completes their side of the transfer and the transfer then fails, this property will be held on {{constructive trust}} as in Re Rose. In relation to personal property, a constructive trust will be created over a fund created to protect pre-payments to a company in the event of that company going into insolvency. In several situations, companies, knowing they are in dire financial straits, have put money paid to them by customers for products not yet delivered in a separate bank account to protect it in the event of insolvency. This causes theoretical problems; it is [...] "difficult to square the conscionability of holding the money on trust for the customers with the pari passu principle in insolvency law that no <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor</b> should be given an advantage over any other unsecured creditor".|$|E
2500|$|While {{all records}} of all a company's {{debentures}} {{need to be}} kept by the company, debentures secured by a [...] "charge" [...] must additionally be registered under the Companies Act 2006 section 860 with Companies House, along with any charge on land, negotiable instruments, uncalled shares, book debts and floating charges, among other things. The purpose of registration is chiefly to publicise which creditors take priority, so that creditors can assess a company's risk profile when making lending decisions. The sanction for failure to register is that the charge becomes void, and unenforceable. This does not extinguish the debt itself, but any advantage from priority is lost and the lender will be an <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor.</b> In National Provincial Bank v Charnley {{there had been a}} dispute about which creditor should have priority after Mr Charnley's assets had been seized, with the Bank claiming its charge was first and properly registered. Giving judgment for the bank Atkin LJ held that a charge, which will confer priority, simply arises through a contract, [...] "where in a transaction for value both parties evince an intention that property, existing or future, shall be made available as security for the payment of a debt, and that the creditor shall have a present right to have it made available, there is a charge". This means a charge simply arises by virtue of contractual freedom. Legal and equitable charges are two of four kinds of security created through consent recognised in English law. A legal charge, more usually called a mortgage, is a transfer of legal title to property on condition that when a debt is repaid title will be reconveyed. An equitable charge used to be distinct in {{that it would not be}} protected against bona fide purchasers without notice of the interest, but now registration has removed this distinction. In addition the law recognises a pledge, where a person hands over some property in return for a loan, and a possessory lien, where a lender retains property already in their possession for some other reason until a debt is discharged, but these do not require registration.|$|E

5000|$|An {{informal}} {{agreement with}} <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> - {{an alternative to}} a CVA moratorium which can be easier {{to put in place}} is an informal agreement with <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors.</b> It also puts a stop to legal action by the company’s creditors before agreement of the CVA. Most insolvency practices will contact <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> immediately after appointment to inform them of the company’s situation. They will also try to keep a working relationship between the company and their creditors so trading can continue and profit can be made in order to repay creditors.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} of the {{bankruptcy}} of the borrower, the <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> will have a general claim on {{the assets of the}} borrower after the specific pledged assets have been assigned to the secured <b>creditors.</b> The <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> will usually realize a smaller proportion of their claims than the secured creditors.|$|R
50|$|The law treats {{differently}} those creditors who are secured (i.e. have an authenticated, perfected security interest) {{from those}} creditors who are unsecured. An <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor</b> {{is simply a}} person who is owed money and has not received payment according to the terms of the agreed upon transaction. Upon default of a debtor who has multiple creditors, the distinction between being a secured creditor and an <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor</b> is legally significant. The secured creditor will generally always have priority to getting his money before the unsecured creditors do. In other words, the <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditor</b> is {{at the back of the}} line of priority - his only remedy is to obtain a judgment from the court for the amount of the defaulted loan.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2010, Midway filed its {{proposed}} plan of liquidation {{with the}} bankruptcy court. [...] Under the plan, intercompany claims would be extinguished and a partial recovery {{would be allowed}} to the <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> of Midway Games (who held $155 million of claims) to the extent of about 16.5%, and to the <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> of Midway's subsidiaries (who held $36.7 million of claims) of about 25%. [...] Any settlement amount under the lawsuit against National Amusements was to be paid to the two groups of <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> in the same ratio. [...] Holders of secured and priority claims were to be paid in full, National Amusements would not receive any payment under its Subordinated Loan Agreement, and the equity holders would not receive any payment. [...] On May 21, 2010, the bankruptcy court approved the plan of liquidation. <b>Unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> of Midway shared approximately $25.5 million, and <b>unsecured</b> <b>creditors</b> of the company's subsidiaries shared about $9.2 million. [...] A liquidating trust, administered by Buchwald Capital Advisors LLC as the Trustee, was created to pursue any remaining rights of Midway's bankruptcy estate and distribute any proceeds to Midway's remaining creditors.|$|R
