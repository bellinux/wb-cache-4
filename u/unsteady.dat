5|$|A {{creation}} date {{at the beginning}} of the second millennium BCE places the relief into a region and time in which the political situation was <b>unsteady,</b> marked by the waxing and waning influence of the city states of Isin and Larsa, an invasion by the Elamites, and finally the conquest by Hammurabi in the unification in the Babylonian empire in 1762BCE.|$|E
5|$|Royal Oak had a low {{centre of}} gravity which meant that she rolled a lot and was an <b>unsteady</b> gun platform. She was, however, very handy and sailed well in all weathers under sail or steam. Her crew {{consisted}} of 585 officers and enlisted men.|$|E
5|$|Vortex {{streets are}} zigzagging {{patterns}} of whirling vortices {{created by the}} <b>unsteady</b> separation of flow of a fluid, most often air or water, over obstructing objects. Smooth (laminar) flow starts to break up when {{the size of the}} obstruction or the velocity of the flow become large enough compared to the viscosity of the fluid.|$|E
5|$|Harry confronts monsters in {{each area}} with both melee weapons and firearms. An {{ordinary}} man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting. His inexperience in handling firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often <b>unsteady.</b> A portable radio collected {{early in the game}} alerts Harry to the presence of nearby creatures with bursts of static.|$|E
5|$|In January 1556, Mary's {{father-in-law}} abdicated. Mary and Philip {{were still}} apart; he was declared King of Spain in Brussels, but {{she stayed in}} England. Philip negotiated an <b>unsteady</b> truce with the French in February 1556. The following month, the French ambassador in England, Antoine de Noailles, was implicated in a plot against Mary when Sir Henry Dudley, a second cousin of the executed Duke of Northumberland, attempted to assemble an invasion force in France. The plot, known as the Dudley conspiracy, was betrayed, and the conspirators in England were rounded up. Dudley remained in exile in France, and Noailles prudently left Britain.|$|E
5|$|Lambert's {{essay about}} metaphysics, Traité de la Volonté ("Treatise on the Will"), is another autobiographical reference. Balzac wrote the essay {{himself as a}} boy, and – as in the novel – it was confiscated by an angry teacher. Lambert's genius and {{philosophical}} erudition are reflections of Balzac's self-conception. Similarly, some critics and biographers have suggested that Lambert's madness reflects (consciously or not) Balzac's own <b>unsteady</b> mental state. His plans to run for parliament and other non-literary ambitions led observers {{at the time to}} suspect his sanity.|$|E
5|$|Redheffer {{moved to}} New York City {{and set up}} a similar scam after {{rebuilding}} his machine. However, an engineer detected that it was a fake by listening to its <b>unsteady</b> motions at an exhibition. He discovered that the machine was operated by a man using a crank in a room on the floor above. Redheffer returned to Philadelphia. He later claimed to have created another machine, but refused to demonstrate it to anyone. He managed to get a patent for his machine in 1820, but after this his fate is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Sandown Castle did {{not play}} a {{prominent}} role during the first English Civil War that broke out between the supporters of King Charles I and Parliament; it was taken by Parliamentary forces {{at the start of}} the conflict in 1642. Following the few years of <b>unsteady</b> peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Sandown and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent.|$|E
5|$|Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (most are 1mm long or less), slender insects with fringed {{wings and}} unique {{asymmetrical}} mouthparts. Different thrips species feed mostly on plants by puncturing and sucking up the contents, {{although a few}} are predators. Approximately 6,000 species have been described. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an <b>unsteady</b> circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few years}} of <b>unsteady</b> peace, in 1648 the Second English Civil War broke out, this time with Charles' Royalist {{supporters}} joined by Scottish forces. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by the nearby Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was underway across Kent. Sandown Castle declared for the King, and the soldier and former naval captain Major Keme then convinced the garrisons at Deal and Walmer to surrender. Sandgate Castle probably joined the Royalists as well. With both the coastal fortresses and the navy now under Royalist control, Parliament feared that foreign forces might be landed along the coast, or military aid sent to the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle {{was seized}} by Parliamentary forces {{at the start of}} the first English Civil War between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament, resulting in the dismissal of Byng as a suspected Royalist, and his replacement by Colonel Rainsborough, a vice-admiral. The castle did not play a significant role in the remainder of the initial conflict. After the few years of <b>unsteady</b> peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by their Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Walmer and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across Kent.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is <b>unsteady</b> on its feet, and needs the support of its mother. It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its {{eyesight}} is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on its mother and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{prior to the}} {{construction}} of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, the Fairbanks economy was <b>unsteady.</b> The News-Miner planned to expand its printing plant, but many in the company were unsure if the economy could support the added capacity. Over the objections of the News-Miner newsroom, Snedden decided to expand the Aurora Building by adding a second floor at a cost of $2 million. In 1974, as construction of the pipeline got under way, demand for office space in Fairbanks was so great that Alyeska Pipeline Company rented several News-Miner offices in the newly expanded building. About this time, the News-Miner replaced its Associated Press teletypes with a satellite connection.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after its}} peak, Hurricane Hilary's motion became <b>unsteady.</b> After nearly stalling, the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} west on August22, only to become nearly stationary again the next day. Slowly executing a small counter-clockwise loop, Hilary underwent a Fujiwhara interaction with Tropical Storm Irwin which was several hundred miles southeast. Meanwhile, Hilary began to weaken, by early on August22, the eye became poorly defined and convection diminished. The eye dissipated within 12 hours, and the winds quickly diminished to 85mph (130km/h). Later that day, the thunderstorm activity became partially exposed from the center, and on August23, Hilary was downgraded to a tropical storm {{due to lack of}} organization.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} moved westward {{due to a}} {{high pressure}} ridge while undergoing two eyewall replacement cycles: the first was around peak intensity and was completed when the hurricane moved over cooler waters, and the second was a brief cycle shortly after the hurricane began to weaken. The last advisory was issued while the hurricane was west of Mexico, {{but it was not}} until the remnants were west of Los Angeles, California that they finally dissipated. Elida's rapid intensification and <b>unsteady</b> weakening after reaching its peak intensity caused large errors in the intensity forecasting of the hurricane. Although the intensity forecasts were off, the track forecasts were better than usual compared to the ten-year period prior to that year.|$|E
25|$|A flow {{that is not}} a {{function}} of time is called steady flow. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as <b>unsteady</b> (also called transient). Whether a particular flow is steady or <b>unsteady,</b> can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is <b>unsteady.</b>|$|E

25|$|Difference {{between the}} ideal and actual curve arises due to stage loss. Stages losses in {{compressor}} are mainly due to blade friction, flow separation, <b>unsteady</b> flow and vane-blade spacing.|$|E
25|$|The Bernoulli {{equation}} for <b>unsteady</b> {{potential flow}} {{also appears to}} {{play a central role}} in Luke's variational principle, a variational description of free-surface flows using the Lagrangian (not to be confused with Lagrangian coordinates).|$|E
25|$|This is the Bernoulli {{equation}} for <b>unsteady</b> potential flow, {{applied at}} the free surface, {{and with the}} pressure above the free surface being a constant — which constant pressure is taken equal to zero for simplicity.|$|E
25|$|Racing was {{scheduled}} to start on February 8, 2010, but <b>unsteady</b> wind conditions caused the first start attempt to be postponed, and the second attempt on February 10, 2010 was aborted due to rough sea conditions.|$|E
25|$|Steady flows {{are often}} more {{tractable}} than otherwise similar <b>unsteady</b> flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without {{taking advantage of the}} steadiness of the flow field.|$|E
25|$|In May 2013, Ontario’s only kosher chicken {{processor}} ceased operation. A Montreal supplier has met substantial demand throughout Ontario and Manitoba. However, decreased and <b>unsteady</b> quality issues, {{variety of}} product and supply, and increased delivery distances {{have led to}} an escalation in the costs borne by consumers.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, Stokes problem {{also known}} as Stokes second problem {{is a problem of}} {{determining}} the flow created by an oscillating plate, named after Sir George Stokes. This is considered as one of the simplest <b>unsteady</b> problem that have exact solution for the Navier-Stokes equations.|$|E
25|$|SVD {{has also}} been applied to reduced order {{modelling}}. The aim of reduced order modelling {{is to reduce the}} number of degrees of freedom in a complex system which is to be modelled. SVD was coupled with radial basis functions to interpolate solutions to three-dimensional <b>unsteady</b> flow problems.|$|E
25|$|In fluid dynamics, Rayleigh problem {{also known}} as Stokes first problem {{is a problem of}} {{determining}} the flow created by a sudden movement of a plane from rest, named after Lord Rayleigh and Sir George Stokes. This is considered as one of the simplest <b>unsteady</b> problem that have exact solution for the Navier-Stokes equations.|$|E
25|$|Sorrels {{did not go}} {{to college}} as planned, but {{returned}} to Boise after the birth of her child. She acted in local theater and partied with her friends. She enjoyed the love and support of her family during this <b>unsteady</b> time in her life. She recounted that her parents loved her and did not judge her.|$|E
25|$|As he wrestles, Randy {{begins to}} feel chest pain and becomes <b>unsteady.</b> The Ayatollah notices this and urges him to {{initiate}} the pin. Randy refuses, however, and climbs the top rope for his signature finishing move, a diving headbutt called the Ram Jam. He looks over and sees Cassidy has left. In tears, he salutes the crowd and leaps from the ropes.|$|E
25|$|The first {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} <b>unsteady</b> {{inertial}} forces to steady inertial forces. The number was {{named in honor of}} Vincenz Strouhal who first deduced the relationship between the vortex shedding frequency around a cylinder and the flow speed. The characteristic variables were the cylinder diameter L1, and the speed of the flow over it U. He found the number to be reasonably constant over given a Reynolds number range.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} between the 1942 American naval force and the 21st-century {{multinational}} task force, an <b>unsteady</b> peace starts after they both reach Pearl Harbor. However, murders, rapes, and riots happen as the 21st-century people try to mix with the locals. Kolhammer is flown to California to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Albert Einstein. As time goes by with no sight of the JRV Nagoya, more and more 21st-century personnel start to realize they are stuck in 1942.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, the {{observed}} pressure differences between {{front and back}} of the plate, and resulting drag forces, are much larger than predicted: for a flat plate perpendicular to the flow the predicted drag coefficient is CD=0.88, while in experiments CD=2.0 is found. This is mainly due to suction at the wake side of the plate, induced by the <b>unsteady</b> flow in the real wake (as opposed to the theory which assumes a constant flow velocity equal to the plate's velocity).|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{the problem}} of foam shed had not been fully cured; on STS-114, {{additional}} cameras mounted on the tank recorded a piece of foam separated from one of its Protuberance Air Load (PAL) ramps, which are designed to prevent <b>unsteady</b> air flow underneath the tank’s cable trays and pressurization lines during ascent. The PAL ramps consist of manually sprayed layers of foam, {{and are more likely}} to become a source of debris. That piece of foam did not impact the orbiter.|$|E
25|$|In late 1999, Wallace began feeling {{intermittently}} ill. Family members variously {{remember him}} as acting <b>unsteady,</b> coughing and seeming swollen. As his inexplicable sickness persisted over the holiday season, his family {{encouraged him to}} seek medical care, but he died in early 2000 before he could do so. Their daughter Ashley was 11 {{at the time and}} had been alone with him. She blamed herself for his death. She had noticed his ill appearance that day, but thought nothing of it.|$|E
25|$|A balance {{disorder}} is a disturbance that causes {{an individual to}} feel <b>unsteady,</b> for example when standing or walking. It may be accompanied by feelings of giddiness, or wooziness, or having a sensation of movement, spinning, or floating. Balance {{is the result of}} several body systems working together: the visual system (eyes), vestibular system (ears) and proprioception (the body's sense of where it is in space). Degeneration or loss of function in any of these systems can lead to balance deficits.|$|E
