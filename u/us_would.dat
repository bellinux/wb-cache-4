5|$|From 1965 through 1968, {{the war in}} the {{northeast}} followed the monsoon cycle, with dry season communist offensives followed by wet season Hmong (and later Thai) counteroffensives. Each year the conflict slowly escalated. PAVN would introduce more (and better equipped) units and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> counter by the application of more airpower, producing a strategic stalemate.|$|E

50|$|As {{part of the}} {{reconstruction}} of US 50 as a six-lane freeway from US 301 in Queenstown to MD 404 in Wye Mills, the Maryland State Highway Administration plans to construct an overpass of MD 18 over US 50 in Queenstown. MD 18 and <b>US</b> 50 <b>would</b> become connected {{by a pair of}} right-in/right-out interchanges. Access to eastbound <b>US</b> 50 <b>would</b> be via a new service road south of US 50 and connections with westbound <b>US</b> 50 <b>would</b> be made through Outlet Center Drive.

During the following discussions, {{it was agreed that}} the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> produce AI, while Canada would produce ASV. Western Electric arranged a production license for the Mk. IV in the US, where it was known as the SCR-540. Deliveries began for the P-70 (A-20 Havoc) and PV-1 aircraft in 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys. Bethe {{was one of the}} primary voices in the scientific community behind the signing of the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibiting further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|On October 25, 2017, Vice President Mike Pence {{announced}} at a In Defense of Christians annual dinner meeting in Washington that the United States would stop funding United Nations relief efforts, cases tackling {{the persecution of}} Christians in the Middle East, but insisted that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> instead help and aid Christians directly through the U.S. Agency for International Development. Pence said {{that he will be}} visiting the Middle East in December and will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss peace agreements.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{developed}} as an Alberta clipper-type {{low pressure area}} that moved southeastward across the Great Plains and Midwest. Throughout North Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa, moderate snowfall accompanied the system. After weakening over the Ohio Valley, the storm redeveloped {{off the coast of}} North Carolina. In the days preceding the event, a cyclone over eastern Canada circulated cold air southward. Computer models indicated the potential for a major storm up to seven days in advance; however, initially, certain forecasts suggested that a separate storm over the southern <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> merge with the clipper. Instead, this feature moved out to sea.|$|E
5|$|When World War I broke out, the United States {{maintained}} {{a policy of}} isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to negotiate peace between the warring nations. However, when a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law.|$|E
5|$|When the {{war started}} Seward turned his {{attention}} to making sure that foreign powers did not interfere in the conflict. When in April 1861, the Confederacy announced that it would authorize privateers, Seward sent word to the American representatives abroad that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> become party to the Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law of 1856, outlawing such vessels, but Britain required that, if the U.S. were to become a party, the ratification would not require action to be taken against Confederate vessels.|$|E

5|$|Alfhems {{success in}} evading the {{quarantine}} led to Washington escalating its intimidation of Guatemala through its navy. On 24 May, the U.S. launched Operation HARDROCK BAKER, a naval blockade of Guatemala. Ships and submarines patrolled the Guatemalan coasts, and all approaching ships were stopped and searched; these included ships from Britain and France, violating international law. However Britain and France did not protest very strongly, hoping that in return the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> {{not interfere with}} their efforts to subdue rebellious colonies in the Middle East. The intimidation was not solely naval; on 26 May one of Castillo Armas' planes flew over the capital, dropping leaflets that exhorted people to struggle against communism and support Castillo Armas.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Nixon Doctrine {{that the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> avoid direct combat {{assistance}} to allies where possible, instead giving them assistance to defend themselves, the U.S. greatly increased arms sales to the Middle East—particularly Israel, Iran and Saudi Arabia—during the Nixon administration. The Nixon administration strongly supported Israel, an American ally in the Middle East, but the support was not unconditional. Nixon believed that Israel should make peace with its Arab neighbors and that the United States should encourage it. The president believed that—except during the Suez Crisis—the U.S. had failed to intervene with Israel, and should use the leverage of the large U.S. military aid to Israel to urge {{the parties to the}} negotiating table. The Arab-Israeli conflict was not a major focus of Nixon's attention during his first term—for one thing, he felt that no matter what he did, American Jews would oppose his reelection.|$|E
5|$|Dreaming of You {{was among}} the top ten best-selling debuts for a musician, best-selling debut by a female act, and the fastest-selling U.S. album of 1995. It has since been ranked among {{the best and most}} {{important}} recordings produced during the rock and roll era. Media outlets have since ranked the recording among the best posthumous releases. When Dreaming of You peaked at number one, Tejano music entered the mainstream market. Music critics said the general population of the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> not have known about Tejano or Latin music {{had it not been for}} Dreaming of You. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 35×platinum (Latin field), for shipping 3.5 million units in the U.S. The album was eventually certified gold by Music Canada and by Asociación Mexicana de Productores de Fonogramas y Videogramas (AMPROFON). As of January 2015, the album has sold five million copies worldwide, and remains the best-selling Latin album of all-time in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Castillo Armas {{had begun}} to intensify his aerial attacks, with the extra planes that Eisenhower had approved. They had limited {{material}} success; many of their bombs were surplus material from World War II, and failed to explode. Nonetheless, they had a significant psychological impact. On 25 June, {{the same day that}} he received the army's ultimatum, Árbenz learned that Castillo Armas had scored what later proved to be his only military victory, defeating the Guatemalan garrison at Chiquimula. Historian Piero Gleijeses has stated that {{if it were not for}} U.S. support for the rebellion, the officer corps of the Guatemalan army would have remained loyal to Árbenz because, although they were not uniformly his supporters, they were more wary of Castillo Armas, and also had strong nationalist views. As it was, they believed that the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> intervene militarily, leading to a battle they could not win.|$|E
5|$|Harding made {{it clear}} when he {{appointed}} Hughes as Secretary of State that the former justice would run foreign policy, a change from Wilson's close management of international affairs. Hughes had to work within some broad outlines; after taking office, Harding hardened his stance on the League of Nations, deciding the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> not join even a scaled-down version of the League. With the Treaty of Versailles unratified by the Senate, the U.S. remained technically at war with Germany, Austria, and Hungary. Peacemaking began with the Knox–Porter Resolution, declaring the U.S. at peace and reserving any rights granted under Versailles. Treaties with Germany, Austria and Hungary, each containing many of the non-League provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, were ratified in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the <b>U.S</b> <b>would</b> {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent rearmament. Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made it through the Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of the treaties.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, when Germany {{attacked}} Great Britain, the United States {{feared that}} if Germany controlled Great Britain, Mexico and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>would</b> be next. In the same year, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ordered {{the construction of}} a naval base in the Atlantic similar to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The site was meant to provide anchorage, docking, repair facilities, fuel, and supplies for 60% of the Atlantic Fleet. The naval base, which was named U.S. Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, became the largest naval installation in the world in landmass and was meant to be the Pearl Harbor of the Atlantic. However, with the defeat of Germany in 1945, the United States concentrated all of their efforts to the war in the Pacific. In May 2003, after six decades of existence, the base was officially shut down by the U.S. Navy.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 40 Marines {{from the}} 9th MAB on the USS Hancock were flown in by Air America {{helicopters}} {{in civilian clothes}} to the DAO compound to augment the 18 Marine Security Guards assigned to defend the Embassy; an additional six Marines were assigned to protect Ambassador Martin. Martin had remained optimistic that a negotiated settlement could be reached whereby the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> not have {{to pull out of}} South Vietnam and, in an effort to avert defeatism and panic he instructed Major James Kean, Commanding Officer of the Marine Security Guard Battalion and Ground Support Force Commander United States Embassy Compound, that he could begin to remove the tamarind tree and other trees and shrubbery which prevented the use of the Embassy parking lot as a helicopter landing zone.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Communique was not {{implemented}} {{and the situation}} continued to deteriorate, particularly after the Ngô family ordered South Vietnam's Special Forces to attack Buddhist pagodas across the country on 21 August. The U.S. condemned the raids, and began to cut aid to the Special Forces, which was effectively a private Ngô family army, {{in addition to other}} government programs that were closely identified with the ruling clan. Regarding such gestures as a green light, and safe in the knowledge that the <b>US</b> <b>would</b> not intervene in Diệm's defense, the army staged a successful coup in November, resulting in the assassination of the president. The removal of Diệm resulted in a period of political instability, as a series of military juntas deposed one another. This led to a deterioration in the military situation as the communist Viet Cong made substantial gains against the ARVN, prompting the US to deploy hundreds of thousands of combat troops in 1965, escalating the Vietnam War.|$|E
