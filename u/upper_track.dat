2500|$|The 60hp Schneider {{gasoline}} engine and its radiator {{are located in}} the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2km/h, the second of 3.95km/h, the third of 6.75km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. [...] The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. [...] The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75kg/cm².|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} of heart rate {{is the most}} significant factor of cardiac output during exercise conditions. The influence of the <b>upper</b> <b>tracking</b> rate on cardiac performance was investigated at a sample of twenty patients having a dual chamber pacemaker implanted for high degree AV block. At randomly programmed <b>upper</b> <b>tracking</b> rates (UPR) of 110, 120 or 130 bpm oxygen uptake was determined at the anaerobic threshold and at peak exercise using the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Eleven patients (60 ± 6 years) without severe heart failure (Weber A/B) showed a significant benefit of an UPR of 130 bpm in contrast to 110 bpm (VO 2 -AT 17, 3 ± 3, 9 ml/min/kg vs 13, 7 ± 4, 0 ml/min/kg, p< 0, 001). For nine patients (71 ± 12 years) with severe heart failure the cardiac performance was higher at an UPR of 110 bpm vs 130 bpm (VO 2 -AT 11, 1 ± 4, 0 ml/min/kg vs 9, 2 ± 2, 6 ml/min/kg, p= 0, 052). Two-dimensional echocardiography at rest did not reveal any differences of ejection fraction between patients with or without heart failure at various UPR. Cardiac performance at different UPR could not exactly be evaluated using the heart failure classification by the NYHA. For patients with dual chamber acemakers the <b>upper</b> <b>tracking</b> rate can be optimised by the cardiopulmonary exercise test. Higher UPR should be set for patients without heart failure, whereas the UPR should be limited to lower values for patients with heart failure...|$|R
6000|$|As I {{ascended the}} <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> two {{bandages}} men were {{coming down on}} led mules. It was mid-August, and they were suffering from frostbite. Across the great gap between the summits a minute traveller with some provisions was going up by wire to some post upon the crest. For everywhere upon the icy pinnacles are observation posts directing the fire of the big guns on the slopes below, or machine-gun stations, or little garrisons that sit and wait through the bleak days. Often they have no link with the world below but a precipitous climb or a [...] "teleferic" [...] wire. Snow and frost may cut them off absolutely for weeks {{from the rest of}} mankind.

50|$|At {{the time}} of {{construction}} of the citadel, the southern face of Verne Hill went through remodeling, and this was when an existing fresh water spring head was housed in the cistern's stone retaining wall, cut into the outer wall of the Verne Ditch bank, midway along and adjacent to the <b>upper</b> <b>track.</b> Before the supply of piped water to Portland in the early 20th century, this storage cistern and its works {{would have been an}} important installation.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model for <b>upper</b> body <b>tracking.</b> We first {{construct}} a Bayesian Network (BN) {{to represent the}} human upper body structure and then incorporate into the BN various generic physical and anatomical constraints on {{the parts of the}} upper body. Unlike the existing upper body models, ours aims at handling physically feasible body motion rather than only some typical motion patterns. We also explicitly model part self-occlusion in the DBN model, which allows to automatically detect the occurrence of self-occlusion and to minimize the effect of measurement errors on the tracking accuracy due to occlusion. Moreover, our method can handle both 2 D and 3 D <b>upper</b> body <b>tracking</b> within the same framework. Using the DBN model, <b>upper</b> body <b>tracking</b> can be achieved through probabilistic inference over time. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{beginning}} of the Cold War led {{to the construction of}} a deep section of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line.

In the further development of the Metro the term [...] "stages" [...] was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957-1959 are referred to as the [...] "fifth stage".|$|R
25|$|In the {{original}} configuration, the station had eight tracks and four tracks per each level. Originally, the IRT used {{both sides of}} the current platforms, and the BMT used now-demolished platforms north of the current platforms, also double-decked. The south side of the IRT platforms was used by the Flushing Line, as today; the north side was used by Astoria trains, but instead of going through the 60th Street Tunnel, they went over the Queensboro Bridge to the elevated IRT Second Avenue Line. Double crossovers south (lower <b>tracks)</b> and north (<b>upper</b> <b>tracks)</b> of the platforms allowed trains from either side to switch to the other line after leaving the station.|$|R
50|$|The {{route of}} the railway led from Priory Corner, around Verne Hill to the Freeman's Incline. From this point the stone would be sent {{downwards}} to the Castletown to be shipped. In 1866, due to increasing demand, a second, <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> was cut into Verne Hill. Yeates Incline was built as an addition to the main line to serve Withies Croft, Independent, and Inmosthay Quarries. For this incline four bridges were constructed, {{all of which are}} now Grade II Listed.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the {{recording}} head, the playback head {{has a single}} core. The playback head gap covers both of the tracks created by the record head. The magnetic field changes across {{the width of the}} gap are effectively added in the playback head, so the playback head reproduces the audio signal, which is the same in both tracks. But the pilot tone cancels itself in the playback head: at a point on the tape where it has a certain intensity on the <b>upper</b> <b>track,</b> it has the opposite intensity on the lower track, and so always sums to zero.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{feature of}} Christie's designs was the [...] "convertible" [...] drive: {{the ability to}} remove the tracks for road travel, {{allowing}} for higher speeds and better range, and reducing wear on the fragile caterpillar track systems of the 1930s. In one public test 1931 in Linden, NJ, Army officials clocked a Christie M1931 tank attaining 104 mph, making it the fastest tank in the world: a record many believe it still holds. There were no return rollers for the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> run; the tracks were supported by the road wheels. As with many track designs with center guide teeth, dual wheels were used, allowing the guide teeth to run between them.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the first}} batch was {{delivered}} the next three batches were the Leopard 1A1 model, which included a new gun stabilization system from Cadillac-Gage, allowing the tank to fire effectively on the move.

A less important change was to use rectangular rubber blocks fastened to the treads with a single pin instead of the earlier two-pin [...] "shaped" [...] versions.

50|$|The way {{upon which}} the train ran {{consisted}} of a single iron girder 4 feet in depth for each span, placed over the center line of the posts. The girder carried an <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> beam and a lower track beam, upon the sides of each of which the rails, four in number, were placed. The two bearing rails, which carried the load of the train, consisted of angle irons placed upon the outer upper edge of wooden stringers upon the lower track beam. These stringers {{were placed in the}} exterior recesses formed by two channel bars properly secured to the sides of the posts. These rails were fastened to each other, to the stringers, and to the track beam by bolts passing clear through. Two vertically placed rails for the balancing or friction wheels were carried by the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> beam. The distance from out to out between the lower rails was 22½ inches, this being sufficient to insure the necessary transverse stiffness. This was the gauge of the road. The distance between the upper rails was 17½ inches. It was expected to adopt the common form of rail, beveling the edges of the lower stringers and placing the rail at an angle of about 45 degrees. The rails were {{in the form of a}} right angle, and the treads of the wheels were made with a corresponding right angle groove. The usual length of post, 24 feet, would give a clear headway of 14 feet, 4 feet being taken up by the truss and 6 feet forming the foundation.|$|E
50|$|The SRB, {{also using}} leaf springs, was a {{somewhat}} larger vehicle, six metres long, 228 centimetres high and 2.5 metres wide. It was nevertheless lighter at 18.5 tonnes, {{a result of}} having a smaller 47 mm gun—it thus was the antitank version. Using the same engine, its speed was accordingly slightly higher at 18 km/h. More limited fuel reservoirs holding 370 litres decreased the range to 125 kilometres. It used an advanced hydraulic suspension system and the hydraulic Naeder-transmission from the Chaize company combined with a Fieux clutch and Schneider gear box. It used modified FT 17 tracks. The <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> run was much higher, creating enough room for a side door on the left.|$|E

50|$|The {{station was}} renamed Potsdam Hauptbahnhof on 2 October 1960. The old Potsdam station, which {{was closer to}} the city centre, was named Potsdam Stadt (city) and, from the {{establishment}} of the Berlin Wall until 1990, it was served by local diesel trains only. All long-distance trains and Interzonal trains (on the Aachen/Cologne-Görlitz and Rostock-Munich routes) passing through Potsdam stopped here. The local express trains between East Berlin and Potsdam, operated with double-deck carriages (initially painted dark green, later red-beige) were known unofficially as Sputnik trains. The <b>upper</b> <b>tracks</b> were often overloaded, so trains often had to wait outside the station. Commuter trains ran from the lower platform to Babelsberg via Potsdam Stadt and towards Wildpark or Beelitz and Jüterbog.|$|R
50|$|Given the vehicle's low weight, the {{suspension}} is quite robust and exceptionally reliable {{in comparison with}} other systems used on French armour of the time, that were either too complicated or too flimsy. Six large road wheels in three pairs of bogies gave a low ground pressure and good weight distribution. Each bogie is allowed a vertical movement in its entirety, sprung by an inverted leaf spring assembly located just below the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> run, the three assemblies being placed between the four top rollers. The tracks are 22 cm wide. The drive sprockets are {{in the front and}} driven by a transmission in the nose of the vehicle. The two crew members, the driver on the left, sat in the forward compartment, the drive shaft between them. Entrance to the compartment is by two wide horizontal hatches, the upper hinging upwards, allowing the driver an unobstructed view if opened, the lower hinging downwards.|$|E
50|$|The FCM 36 {{is a small}} vehicle, 4.46 m long, 2.20 m {{high and}} 2.14 m wide, with a crew of two. It has a weight of 12.35 metric tons. The most {{conspicuous}} feature of the tank is the futuristic pyramidal shape of its armour, consisting of many panels, electro-welded together to avoid shot-traps and fully implement the principle of sloped armour. Only the engine deck is bolted on to provide easier access. Even the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> run and the suspension units are protected by zig-zag armour plates. As the armour is of good quality, the 40 mm thickness angled at 30 to 45 degrees from the vertical, renders an equivalence of about 45-55 mm, enough to regularly defeat the standard anti-tank guns of its day, even when the gun was ideally positioned. The reclining armour implied that more raking shots would quickly start to deflect. The other modern feature, the diesel engine, gives the vehicle a range of 225 kilometres from a fuel tank of 217 litres.|$|E
5000|$|Another unusual {{feature is}} the slanted {{overhang}} of the frontal part of the chassis which has {{the form of a}} pointed nose, ending in a high obliquely protruding steel spur. It had been designed for cutting through and crushing down German barbed wire, thus opening passages for following French infantry, originally seen as the primary function of the system. This long overhang could cause the tank to ditch itself readily. The major dimensions of the tank are a length of 6.32 m, a width of 2.05 m and a height of 2.3 m. The design is of the early so-called [...] "box tank" [...] type, in which the crew, propulsion system and all manner of equipment are not clearly separated. As a result, there is no real fighting compartment. The room available to the crew, illuminated by three small electric lights, is entered through a double door {{in the back of the}} tank and is extremely cramped. The crew consisted of a commanding officer who was also the driver; an NCO who was the gunner, two machine gunners, a loader who assisted both the cannon and the machine guns and a mechanic who doubled as a machine gun loader. Four of these six men had, at their assigned position, to crouch inside a 1.5 m high space between the roof and the tank's floor. They then had to stand within two narrow troughs, one, behind the driver's seat, used by the gunner and a second square one more to the back, between the suspension elements, used by the cannon loader and the two machine gunners. Most of the space however, had a height of just three feet between the roof and the covering of transmission and suspension: if the mechanic wanted to assist the right machine gun, he had to lie on his belly to load it. Part of each Schneider tank team were also three embedded riflemen who functioned as a sort of outside crew, during battle directly accompanying the vehicle. All-around protection was provided by 11.4 mm steel plate, later improved by a spaced armour of 5.4/5.5 mm, raising the weight from 12.5 to 13.5 tonnes. The roof had 5.5 mm armour. The plates are partly riveted; the superstructure is largely bolted.The 60 hp Schneider gasoline engine and its radiator are located in the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9753 cc, engine is of a type specially constructed for the Schneider CA. It attains its maximum output of sixty horsepower at a thousand rpm. The three forward speeds gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. The tank's official top speed is only 8.1 km/h. Practical terrain speed was even lower at two to four km/h. The first gear at 1000 rpm equals a speed of 2 km/h, the second of 3.95 km/h, the third of 6.75 km/h. At two kilometres per hour the vehicle can climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75 kg/cm².As the traverse of the main gun was limited, it had first to be pointed in the general direction of the target by the driver-commander swivelling the entire vehicle. To facilitate this, a small rectangular frame is fitted on the right side of the nose of the tank. Looking through it, the driver had a sightline parallel to that of the cannon in a neutral position. In practice, the commander had a too limited view of his surroundings through the small hatches to his left, front and right and had to resort to lifting his head out of his rectangular top hatch to observe the enemy. Small rectangular hatches, fitted with a vision slit, are further present to the front of each machine-gun. The main ventilation is provided by a large skylight slit running along the midline of the hull. It is doubly roofed with the lower roof having a second slit in its top, while the higher roof has open lower sides, creating oblique oblong ventilation channels through which fresh air can be sucked in from the outside. The top roof is the highest element of the vehicle. With later production vehicles, polluted air is removed through a broad ventilation grid in the nose, having a recessed armour plate below it. To the left and the right of the skylight roof rectangular escape hatches are present in the hull top.The vehicles were delivered by the factory painted in the standard grey colour used by the Artillery Arm and other branches of the army and that was often called [...] "artillery grey". It was a rather light pearl grey shade. At first, by the Section Camouflage in the field a specially designed complex striped flame pattern was added consisting of narrow vertical red brown, dark green and yellow ochre patches, delineated in black. This was intended to break the contours of the vehicles. To some observers, it made them seem strikingly colourful. The original grey paint was perhaps only partly covered, including it in the ensemble; an alternative interpretation of the lightest patches seen in black-and-white photographs is that it represents a light green hue. Later, when the appliqué armour was added a much simpler scheme was used where the same hues were shown in large irregular areas, again demarcated in black. In the first combat actions, it became clear that German machine gunners concentrated their fire on the vision slits. To confuse them, in the summer of 1917 a cross-hatched scheme of narrow vertical and horizontal dark grey stripes was applied on top of the original patches. The stripes continued over the side machine gun ball mounts but a round area remained untouched to suggest a false position. The individual Schneider CA tanks had serial numbers ranging from 61001 to 61399. The first tactical markings consisted of simple numbers, to distinguish the individual tanks within a training unit. Early 1917 the combat units used small inconspicuous playing-card symbols, each symbol indicating one of four batteries within a groupe. These were sprayed in white on the tank side, often combined with an individual tank number, depending on the style each groupe preferred. The tank number could also be indicated on the tank spur, by horizontal stripes.|$|E

40|$|The radio/X‐ray {{correlation}} {{for hard}} and quiescent state black hole X‐ray binaries is critically investigated in this paper. New observations of known sources, along with newly discovered ones (since 2003), {{have resulted in}} an increasingly large number of outliers lying well outside the scatter about the quoted best‐fitting relation. Most of these outliers tend to cluster below the best‐fitting line, possibly indicative of two distinct tracks which might reflect different accretion regimes within the hard state. Here, we employ and compare {{state of the art}} data clustering techniques in order to identify and characterize different data groupings within the radio/X‐ray luminosity plane for 18 hard and quiescent state black hole X‐ray binaries with nearly simultaneous multiwavelength coverage. Linear regression is then carried out on the clustered data to infer the parameters of a relationship of the form ℓ r =α+βℓ x through a Bayesian approach (where ℓ denotes logarithmic luminosities). We conclude that the two‐cluster model, with independent linear fits, is a significant improvement over fitting all points as a single cluster. While the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> slope (0. 63 ± 0. 03) is consistent, within the errors, with the fitted slope for the 2003 relation (0. 7 ± 0. 1), the lower track slope (0. 98 ± 0. 08) is not consistent with the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> or with the widely adopted value of ≃ 1. 4 for the neutron stars. The two luminosity tracks do not reflect systematic differences in black hole spins as estimated either from reflection‐ or continuum‐fitting method. Additionally, there is evidence for at least two sources (H 1743 − 322 and GRO J 1655 − 500) jumping from the lower to the <b>upper</b> <b>track</b> as they fade towards quiescence, further indicating that black hole spin does not play any major role in defining the radio loudness of compact jets from hard black hole X‐ray binaries. The results of the clustering and regression analysis are fairly insensitive to the selection of subsamples, accuracy in the distances and the treatment of upper limits. Besides introducing a further level of complexity in understanding the interplay between synchrotron and Comptonized emission from black hole X‐ray binaries, the existence of two tracks in the radio/X‐ray domain underscores that a high level of caution must be exercised when employing black hole luminosity–luminosity relations for the purpose of estimating a third parameter, such as distance or mass...|$|E

In a model where individuals have differential skills prior to beginning formal education due {{to differences in}} early childhood development (e. g. linguistic, cultural, or nutritional disadvantages), we show that color-blind tracking systematically underplaces minorities. As a result, minorities have, in expectation, higher abilities than non-minorities assigned to the same track regardless of track. A counterintuitive empirical implication of the model is that, conditional on tracking score and track, minorities will outperform non-minorities in subsequent testing following tracking.
