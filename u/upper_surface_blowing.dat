50|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> {{remains a}} fairly rare concept in use, {{and has been}} seen only on a few other aircraft, such as the Antonov An-72.|$|E
50|$|A type of Boundary Layer Control System, blown flaps pass engine-generated air or exhaust {{over the}} flaps to {{increase}} lift beyond that attainable with mechanical flaps. Types include the original (internally blown flap) which blows compressed {{air from the}} engine {{over the top of}} the flap, the externally blown flap, which blows engine exhaust over the upper and lower surfaces of the flap, and <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> which blows engine exhaust {{over the top of the}} wing and flap. While testing was done in Britain and Germany before the Second World War, and flight trials started, the first production aircraft with blown flaps wasn't until the 1957 Lockheed T2V SeaStar. <b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing</b> was used on the Boeing YC-14 in 1976.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} experimental {{program was}} conducted to develop a data base for the noise and related flow characteristics of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> configurations. The effect of various geometric and flow parameters was investigated experimentally. The dominant noise was identified from the measured flow and noise characteristics to be generated downstream of the trailing edge. The possibilities of noise reduction techniques were explored. An <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> (USB) noise prediction program was developed to calculate noise levels at any point and noise contours (footprints). Using this noise prediction program and a cruise performance data base, aircraft design studies were conducted to integrate low noise and good performance characteristics. A theory was developed for the noise from the highly sheared layer of a trailing edge wake. Theoretical results compare favorably with the measured noise of the USB model...|$|R
50|$|In general, blown flaps {{can improve}} the lift of a wing by two to three times. Whereas a complex triple-slotted flap system on a Boeing 747 {{produces}} a coefficient of lift of about 2.45, external blowing (<b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> on a YC-14) improves this to about 7, and internal blowing (jet flap on Hunting H.126) to 9.|$|E
50|$|The term {{may be used}} {{to refer}} {{specifically}} to those systems that use internal ductwork within the wing to direct the airflow, or more broadly to systems like <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> or nozzle systems on conventional underwing engine which that direct air through the flaps. Blown flaps are one solution among a broader category known as powered lift, which also includes various boundary layer control systems, systems using directed prop wash, and circulation control wings.|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} a second {{generation}} supersonic aircraft of an advanced conception, resulted from prolonged study of existing combat aircraft {{to see how they}} would complete their mission with major components missing. The Addax 1 was schemed as a STOL aircraft with 2 vectored turbofans and with an SSA (Self Stabilized Aerofoil) forming the fuselage between the tail booms. USB (<b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing)</b> was to be used on the flaps on the wing of the SSA. The Addax S was a different design intended as an air superiority fighter.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} design method {{for the application}} of <b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing</b> to combat aircraft has been developed. Although, specifically addressed to combat aircraft or aircraft with low aspect ratios, aerodynamics of the method may be applied to other aircraft using <b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing.</b> Even though the method is readily useable in its present form, there are areas where improvements can be made.

40|$|Screening {{tests of}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> on {{externally}} blown flaps configurations were conducted. Noise and turning effectiveness {{data were obtained}} with small-scale, engine-over-the-wing models. One large model was tested to determine scale effects. Nozzle types included circular, slot, D-shaped, and multilobed. Tests were made with and without flow attachment devices. For STOL applications the particular multilobed mixer and the D-shaped nozzles tested were found to offer little or no noise advantage over the round convergent nozzle. High aspect ratio slot nozzles provided the quietest configurations. In general, <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> was quieter than lower surface blowing for equivalent EBF models...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} forward {{speed on the}} noise of under-the-wing (externally blown flaps, EBF) and over-the-wing (<b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown,</b> USB) blown flap {{configurations}} were measured in wind tunnel model tests with cold jets. The results are presented without correction for the effects (e. g., signal convection, shear layer refraction) associated with flight simulation in a wind tunnel or free jet facility. Noise decreases were generally observed at microphones forward of the wing. The reductions were larger at the low frequencies (below peak SPL) than at the high (above peak SPL).

40|$|The {{results and}} {{analyses}} of aerodynamic and acoustic studies {{conducted on the}} small scale noise and wind tunnel tests of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> nozzle flap concepts are presented. Various types of nozzle flap concepts were tested. These are an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> concept with a multiple slot arrangement with seven slots (seven slotted nozzle), an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> type with a large nozzle exit at approximately mid-chord location {{in conjunction with a}} powered trailing edge flap with multiple slots (split flow or partially slotted nozzle). In addition, aerodynamic tests were continued on a similar multi-slotted nozzle flap, but with 14 slots. All three types of nozzle flap concepts tested appear to be about equal in overall aerodynamic performance but with the split flow nozzle somewhat better than the other two nozzle flaps in the landing approach mode. All nozzle flaps can be deflected to a large angle to increase drag without significant loss in lift. The nozzle flap concepts appear to be viable aerodynamic drag modulation devices for landing...|$|E
40|$|The hybrid <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> concept {{consists}} of wing-mounted turbofan engines {{with a major}} portion of the fan exhaust directed over the wing upper surface to provide high levels of propulsive lift, but with a portion of the fan airflow directed over selected portions of the airframe to provide boundary layer control. NASA-sponsored preliminary design studies identified the hybrid <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> concept as the best propulsive lift concept to be applied to the Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft (QSRA) that is planned as a flight facility to conduct flight research at low noise levels, high approach lift coefficients, and steep approaches.

40|$|In the past, {{research}} into Short Takeoff and Landing aircraft {{has led to}} the investigation of the coupling of a Circulation Control Wing and <b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing</b> engine. The Circulation Control Wing entrains the flow of the engine to be deflected downward such that a component of the thrust is now in the vertical direction. The unfortunate consequence of the <b>Upper</b> <b>Surface</b> <b>Blowing</b> engine is the poor cruise performance due to scrub drag. Cal Poly 2 Ì† 7 s {{research into}} a Cruise Efficient Short Takeoff and Landing Aircraft offers a solution by pylon mounting over the wing engines. Analysis shows that the engine thrust is still deflected downward resulting in very high lift coefficients above 6. 6. In the culmination of this project Cal Poly would like to find a correlation between the location of the engine and the deflection angle of the thrust. The results of this study show some engine deflection for an over the wing engine. The configurations explored were able to provide 3 Â°- 8. 5 Â° of deflection. The deflection falls short of the results by previous static and wind tunnel tests of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> engines. The results show that the closer to the wing and further forward the engine is located the more engine deflection will be seen. This paper explores the trends of coupling an over the wing engine with a circulation control wing as well as compare the results to the idealized claims of previous experiments...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{and flow}} results of <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> {{configurations}} were analyzed. The dominant noise source mechanisms were identified from experimental data. From far-field noise data for various geometric and operational parameters, an empirical noise prediction program {{was developed and}} evaluated by comparing predicted results with experimental data from other tests.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{study of}} a generic wing with a half span flap shows the mean flow effects of several blown flap configurations. The effort compares and contrasts the thin-layer, Reynolds averaged, Navier-Stokes solutions of a baseline wing-flap configuration with configurations that have blowing normal to the flap surface through small slits near the flap side edge. Vorticity contours reveal a dual vortex structure at the flap side edge for all cases. The dual vortex merges into a single vortex at approximately the mid-flap chord location. <b>Upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> reduces {{the strength of the}} merged vortex and moves the vortex away from the upper edge. Lower surface blowing thickens the lower shear layer and weakens the merged vortex, {{but not as much as}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing.</b> Side surface blowing forces the lower surface vortex farther outboard of the flap edge by effectively increasing the aerodynamic span of the flap. It is seen that there is no global aerodynamic penalty or benefit from the particular blowing configurations examined...|$|E
40|$|Technology {{developed}} for the Circulation Control Wing high-lift system has been extended to augment lift by entraining and redirecting engine thrust. Ejecting a thin jet sheet tangentially over a small curved deflecting surface adjacent to the slipstream of a turbofan engine causes the slipstream to flow around that deflecting surface. The angle of deflection is controlled pneumatically by varying {{the momentum of the}} thin jet sheet. The downward momentum of the slipstream enhances wing lift. This concept of pneumatically deflecting the slipstream has been applied to an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> high-lift system and to a thrust deflecting system. The capability of the pneumatic <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blowing</b> system was demonstrated in a series of investigations using a wind tunnel model and the NASA Quiet Short-haul Research Aircraft (QSRA). Full-scale thrust deflections greater than 90 deg were achieved. This mechanically simple system can provide increased maneuverability, heavy lift or overload capability, or short takeoff and landing performance...|$|E
40|$|Far-field {{noise data}} {{indicated}} that for practical <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> flap configurations, the noise radiated below the flap {{is dominated by the}} noise generated {{in the vicinity of the}} trailing edge. Sound field by turbulent mixing in the trailing edge wake is investigated experimentally and theoretically. Hot-wire measurements were made downstream of the trailing edge to determine the gross turbulence mixing characteristics of the flow. This information is used as input to a theoretical analysis of the sound field. Favorable agreement is found between predicted and measured far-field noise directivities at various frequencies and noise power spectra at various directions...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the blown flap/jet flap analogy has been undertaken. Analytical {{predictions}} were made using both improved lifting line and optimized vortex lattice models for the jet flap. Results were compared with experimental data for three propulsive lift systems; the jet augmented flap, the externally blown flap, and the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> flap. Force increments due to changes in geometry and jet parameters were well approximated in most cases, although the absolute values of the aerodynamic forces were usually underestimated. The relatively simple jet-flap models gave performance predictions of accuracy comparable to more complex analyses...|$|R
40|$|Results {{from recent}} {{investigations}} in the Langley V/STOL tunnel of an externally blown flap and an <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> <b>blown</b> flap configuration in ground proximity are presented. Comparisons of longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics indicate that in ground proximity, drag is reduced for both configurations, but changes in lift are configuration dependent. Steady state {{analyses of the}} landing approach indicate an increase in flight path angle for both configurations in ground proximity because of the drag reduction. Dynamic analyses with a fixed-base simulator indicate that the resultant flight path during landing approach {{is dependent on the}} initial flight path angle and the control technique used...|$|R
