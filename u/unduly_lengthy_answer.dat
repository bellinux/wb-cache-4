This semi-quantitative tool allows for the measurement of hazards and does not require <b>unduly</b> <b>lengthy</b> training to begin to use it accurately. Uses of the strain index include analysis of a current job to assess whether it is safe or hazardous, quantification of the risks, and assistance in the initial design of a job or in the redesign of a job. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess and analyze risk of developing DUE disorders in different jobs as well as hazard classification in an assembling electronic industry through SI method. Also, DUE disorders prevalence, work-related absenteeism and turnover extracted from SI results were compared and assessed by those obtained by Nordic musculoskeletal questionnaire (NMQ). The findings of this study showed that more than 50 % of investigated jobs are categorized as "hazardous " and there is a significant difference between SI mean in hazardous and safe jobs (P < 0. 0001). In addition, significant difference was found between prevalence of DUE disorders in "safe " and "hazardous " jobs (P < 0. 049). But, no significant difference (P = 0. 3) was obtained between mean absenteeism in "safe " and hazardous jobs.

[...] The chapter begins with the interlocutor asking about duangu [...] "cutting off grains" [...] and changsheng 長生 [...] "longevity" [...] (meaning [...] "eternal life" [...] in Daoist terminology). [...] "I should like to inquire whether a man can attain Fullness of Life by merely dispensing with starches. How many methods for this are there altogether, and which is the best?" [...] Ge Hong gives a <b>lengthy</b> <b>answer,</b> citing both personal observations and textual records. Practitioners medicinally used huangqing 黃精 [...] "yellow essence" [...] ("polygonatum; Solomon's Seal") and yuyu 禹餘糧 [...] "Yu's leftover grain" [...] ("limonite").By dispensing with starches a man can only stop spending money on grains, but by that alone he cannot attain Fullness of Life. When I inquired {{of people who had}} been doing without starches for a long time, they replied that they were in better health than when they were eating starches. When they took thistle and nibbled mercury and when they also took pills of brown hematite twice a day, this triple medication produced an increase in breaths, so that they gained the strength to carry loads on long trips, for their bodies became extremely light in weight. One such full treatment protected the patients' inner organs for five to ten years, but when they swallowed their breaths, took amulets, or drank brine, only loss of appetite resulted, and they did not have the strength for hard work. The Taoist writings may say that if one wishes Fullness of Life the intestines must be clean, and if immortality is desired the intestines must be without feces; but they also say that those eating greens will be good walkers, {{but at the same time}} stupid; that those eating meat will be very strong, and also brave. Those eating starches will be wise, but they will not live to an old age, while those eating breath will have gods and spirits within them that never die. This last, however, is only a biased claim advanced by the school that teaches the circulation of breaths. One has no right to claim to use this method exclusively. If you wish to take the great medicines of gold or cinnabar, they will act more quickly if you fast for the preceding hundred days or so. If you cannot fast that long, take them straightway; this will do no great harm, but it will take more time to acquire geniehood. (15, tr. Ware 1966:243-4) ...|$|R

50|$|Wood had an {{interest}} in scoring tests automatically, instead of using many clerks or teacher's time to tabulate the test results by hand. One argument was that in the old way of doing exams was for the teacher or professor to ask a question and the student to complete a <b>lengthy</b> written <b>answer.</b> This limited the amount of questions in a timed examination and therefore was {{a small portion of the}} course given. The instructor then had to read over and grade the student's paper, a very time consuming labor-intensive process. An experiment was done in 1919 where a standardization method of testing was tried. Instead of handwritten essay answers by the student, a new method of testing was devised at Columbia University which consisted of printed up pamphlets. The first part had a set of true or false statements and a mark next to it indicated by the student, which answer they chose. The second part was a multiple choice and the student could choose from a possible 3 or 4 answers. Since the answers to either part were exact, then all the clerk had to do was score the test compared to a correct master template. This required no skill on the part of the clerk on the knowledge of the subject. Wood contended that in a 1921-22 session this new method saved the staff many man-hours of labor and had more accurate results.|$|R
40|$|What is identity? Most {{disciplines}} {{that concern}} themselves {{with this question}} give a similar answer: a construct. From a cultural, political, historical and psychological perspective, identity is a construct. But why and how are identities constructed? Depending on the discipline, {{the answers to these}} questions may differ. For instance, from a political perspective, identity may be seen as strategic essentialism, a tool to push through a political agenda. From a cultural perspective, identity may be perceived as narration that weaves loose ends of cultural discontinuity, contradictions, and complexity into a smooth, meaningful fabric of cultural continuity. From a psychological perspective, certain kinds of identity can be understood as satisfying specific needs that ensure psychic wellbeing. Thus, the questions of why and how identity is constructed require more <b>lengthy</b> <b>answers,</b> particularly when looking at expressions of identity where political goals, societal issues, and psychological aspects are inextricably entwined. This book looks at two such cases: constructs of national identity in literature from both Guyana and Suriname shortly before and after their independence. The novelty of this study is its new multidisciplinary approach that combines the culturally- and politically-oriented perspectives of postcolonial studies with contemporary psychological theories on identity in an integrative way. Taking a new theoretical standpoint, this study combined postcolonial and psychological perspectives on national identity. The analyses focused on literary representations of discourses of national identity in Guyanese and Surinamese short stories, essays, and poems written between 1945 and 1985. The texts were analysed with critical discourse analysis and narratological methods. The study addressed several shortcomings of previous postcolonial research on national identity in the Caribbean. Notably, primordialist definitions of identity have been deemed unsuitable for the analysis and description of identity in the Caribbean. In these texts, however, identity was often construed as if identity was, in fact, essential or as if there was a natural connection between national soil and the identity of the people occupying the land. Although nativism and essentialism were appropriated to fit the socio-historical context of the Caribbean, identity constructions often engaged with nativism and essentialism as modes of construing. Together with the ethnocentric, chauvinistic politics of the time, these essentialist, nativist notions of identity created a national discourse which focused on the social and psychic realities of the Afro-Caribbean population marginalising the Indo-Caribbean population. Cognitive theories, such as the theory of personal constructs, were used to scrutinise the specific cognitive mechanisms related to these modes of construing. In the context of the ongoing ethno-political tensions, the discursive representations of identity were associated with social identity theory and in-group projection. Other recurring patterns in these narratives seemed to fulfil functions related to the basic psychological needs of affiliation, competence, and autonomy, as well as to needs related to self-comprehension, self-esteem, and self-enhancement. In turn, in many of the texts, hybrid characters grappled with the psychologically unsettling repercussions of their hybridity. In sum, the combination of psychological and postcolonial theories offered a new analytical perspective which provided new insights in discourses of national identity in Caribbean contexts and the psychological functions and mechanisms that these narratives may serve...|$|R

Next, I describe an historic occasion where a mismatched content/medium pairing was, to some extent, responsible for reshaping geo-political relations: Modern concepts of democracy rest within the genre of a political communication that originated from the writing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.

The dissertation concludes with modern-day examples where mismatched content/medium pairings are being used in strategies to increase public awareness of messages that were originally introduced through traditional pairings.   Ph.

5000|$|During {{the course}} of composition, the work passed through {{different}} forms. In 1854 {{it began as a}} sonata for two pianos. By July 27 of that year it was being transformed into a four-movement symphony. Brahms sought advice from his close friend Julius Otto Grimm. [...] "Brahms was in the habit of showing his orchestrations to Grimm, who, with his conservatory training, was better schooled in orchestration." [...] After incorporating some of Grimm's suggestions Brahms then sent the orchestrated first movement to Joachim. Evidently Joachim liked it. Brahms wrote to him 12 September 1854 [...] "As usual, you've viewed my symphony movement through rose-coloured spectacles - I definitely want to change and improve it; there's still a great deal lacking in the composition, and I don't even understand as much of the orchestration as appears in the movement, since the best of it I owe to Grimm." [...] By January 1855 Brahms had composed second and third movements, for piano. He ultimately decided to make the work a concerto for piano, his favored instrument, in 1855-56, still consulting friends about the orchestration. Avins writes that [...] "In all the many volumes of correspondence to and from Brahms, nothing quite approaches the letters he and Joachim exchanged over his First Piano Concerto (there are more than twenty of them) ... Joachim's <b>answers,</b> <b>lengthy,</b> detailed, thoughtful, and skilled, are extraordinary testimonials to his own talent, and to the awe and admiration he felt for his friend." [...] Brahms only retained the original material from the work's first movement; the remaining movements were discarded and two new ones were composed, a second movement adagio, which Gál called [...] "calm and dreamlike", and a third movement rondo, in which Gál heard [...] "healthy, exuberant creativity". [...] The result was a work in the more usual three-movement concerto structure. As late as early February 1858, Joachim sent the manuscript back to Brahms [...] "completely revised", hoping that he liked the reorchestrated sections. Brahms did not complete his First Symphony until 1876.|$|R
