500|$|During filming, Cameron {{made use}} of his virtual camera system, {{a new way of}} {{directing}} motion-capture filmmaking. The system shows the actors' virtual counterparts in their digital surroundings in real time, allowing the director to adjust and direct scenes just as if shooting live action. According to Cameron, [...] "It's like a big, powerful game engine. If I want to fly through space, or change my perspective, I can. I can turn the whole scene into a living miniature and go through it on a 50 to 1 scale." [...] <b>Using</b> <b>conventional</b> <b>techniques,</b> the complete virtual world cannot be seen until the motion-capture of the actors is complete. Cameron said this process does not diminish the value or importance of acting. On the contrary, because {{there is no need for}} repeated camera and lighting setups, costume fittings and make-up touch-ups, scenes do not need to be interrupted repeatedly. Cameron described the system as a [...] "form of pure creation where if you want to move a tree or a mountain or the sky or change the time of day, you have complete control over the elements".|$|E

The population of this study was 11 classes consisted of 300 students who took writing IV course. From all populations, 60 students were used as sample which were divided into two groups, i. e. experimental group and control group and recruited by using Cluster Random Sampling Technique. The experimental group was semester VC (30 students) and were treated by using Theme and Rheme technique and the control group was semester VD (30 students) and were treated by <b>using</b> <b>Conventional</b> <b>technique.</b> The research design was Posttest Only Control Group Design by using 2 x 2 factorial design. There were three variables in this study, namely: independent, moderator, and dependent variables. The independent variable was Theme and Rheme technique and moderator variable was students 2 ̆ 7 achievement motivation level (high and low), and the dependent variable was students 2 ̆ 7 writing competency in writing paragraph (short story, personal letter, and business letter). The research used two data-collection instruments, i. e. the writing competency test and the scale of achievement motivation in studying English as foreign language. The data were analyzed by using descriptive statistic and inferential statistic i. e. two-way ANOVA and then continued by using Tukey test. The results of the finding were: (1) there was a significant difference in writing competency between the students who are taught by using Theme and Rheme technique and those who are taught by <b>using</b> <b>Conventional</b> <b>technique.</b> The mean score of the students who are taught by using Theme and Rheme technique was higher than the mean score of the students who are taught by <b>using</b> <b>Conventional</b> <b>technique,</b> (2) there was a significant interactional effect of the techniques of teaching writing (Theme and Rheme <b>technique</b> and <b>Conventional</b> <b>technique)</b> and the students 2 ̆ 7 achievement motivation in learning English on the students 2 ̆ 7 writing competency, (3) there was a significant difference in writing competency between the students with high achievement motivation who are taught by using the Theme and Rheme technique and those taught by <b>using</b> the <b>Conventional</b> <b>technique,</b> (4) there was a significant difference in writing achievement between the students with low achievement motivation who are taught by using the Theme and Rheme technique and those taught by <b>using</b> the <b>Conventional</b> <b>technique,</b> (5) there was a significant difference in writing competency between the students with high achievement motivation and those with low achievement motivation taught by using the Theme and Rheme technique, (6) there was a significant difference in writing achievement between the students with high achievement motivation and those with low achievement motivation taught by <b>using</b> the <b>Conventional</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|R
