50|$|Certain {{types of}} {{cleaning}} can damage some jewelry. For example, some class rings are {{coated with a}} dark pigment, called antiquing, to darken their appearance. A lot of artisan sterling silver jewelry is oxidized to give it an intentionally rustic or industrial look and improper cleaning may remove that oxidation. Some gemstones, such as white topaz, have an overlay to produce certain colors. Ultrasonic cleaning can remove this coating, {{if it is not}} a quality piece. Ultrasonic cleaning is also contraindicated for opals, pearls and amber, and any other gemstone that is porous. Gemstones that are glued in (a common practice with semiprecious stones in non-precious methods and in class rings) should not be placed into an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaner.</b> An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaner</b> can cause stones that are loose in their settings to come out. Jewelry should always be examined for overlays and loose stones prior to cleaning with an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaner</b> or a steam cleaner.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonic cleaners, {{sometimes}} mistakenly called supersonic cleaners, {{are used}} at frequencies from 20 to 40 kHz for jewellery, lenses and other optical parts, watches, dental instruments, surgical instruments, diving regulators and industrial parts. An <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaner</b> works mostly by energy {{released from the}} collapse of millions of microscopic cavitations near the dirty surface. The bubbles made by cavitation collapse forming tiny jets directed at the surface.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to maintaining a clean storage environment for specimens, {{it is sometimes}} necessary to clean the specimens themselves. Cleaning incredibly delicate and brittle dry insect specimens is done carefully and methodically. The conservator chooses the appropriate method based {{on the kind of}} insect that needs cleaning and how robust it is. Cleaning tools vary widely, but generally clean watercolor brushes are used to gently dust the specimens, sometimes with a stereo microscope for very small specimens, warm water and/or alcohol baths used with or without an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaner,</b> and lens blowers to gently blow away dust, or dry the specimen after a cleansing bath.|$|E

50|$|In an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaner,</b> {{the object}} {{to be cleaned}} is placed in a chamber {{containing}} a suitable solution (in an aqueous or organic solvent, depending on the application). In aqueous cleaners, surfactants (e.g., laundry detergent) are often added to permit dissolution of nonpolar compounds such as oils and greases. An ultrasound generating transducer built into the chamber, or lowered into the fluid, produces ultrasonic waves in the fluid by changing size in concert with an electrical signal oscillating at ultrasonic frequency. This creates compression waves in the liquid of the tank which ‘tear’ the liquid apart, leaving behind many millions of microscopic ‘voids’ or ‘partial vacuum bubbles’ (cavitation). These bubbles collapse with enormous energy; temperatures and pressures {{on the order of}} 5,000 K and 20,000 lbs per square inch are achieved; however, they are so small that they do no more than clean and remove surface dirt and contaminants. The higher the frequency, the smaller the nodes between the cavitation points, which allows for cleaning of more intricate detail.|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Traditionally the dyeing {{of natural}} dyes from plant {{materials}} {{was done by}} boiling using roaches method which requires longer time, higher temperature and metallic mordant to get good color fastness. Metallic mordants usually used in dyeing posed some serious bad effect to ecological. Thus this study explored a suitable technique for more efficient natural dyeing using suitable bio mordant to improve the color fastness of natural dyes on silk fabric. Approach: This study demonstrated <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaner</b> as a technique of dyeing the colorant from a selected plant, i. e Xylocarpus moluccensis to a selected fabric, i. e silk. Colorant from combination of heartwood and bark (as a biomordant) of Xylocarpus moluccensis was dyed at different ultrasonic volume and time. Result: Results show {{the highest percentage of}} dye absorbed to silk fabric using <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaner</b> was produced at optimum condition of medium sonic volume in 80 minutes time. Bark of Xylocarpus moluccensis was used as the biomordant to produce good color fastness properties to washing and perspiration.

5000|$|Maintaining a clean diamond can be {{difficult}} sometimes, as jewelry settings can obstruct cleaning efforts, and oils, grease, and other hydrophobic materials adhere well to a diamond's surface. Some jewelers provide their customers with sudsy ammonia cleaning kits. Many jewelers use steam cleaners. Some other jewelers sell small <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Home-based cleaning methods include immersing the diamond in ammonia-based or ethyl alcohol-based solutions, or even a solution of mild grease dissolving detergent and warm water. Silver jewelry can be cleaned using aluminium foil, baking soda, and hot water. However, this practice is not recommended by most jewelers.|$|R

When leather is mechanically cleaned with a soft steam of water, soft brushed and sponges can also be used. In the case of consistent impurities, leather can be cleaned by chemical means, with the use of small amounts of non-ionic detergents. The chemical cleaning must be followed with a rinse under a stream of water.|$|R

Inhaling or coming in contact with beryllium can cause an immune response that can result in an individual becoming sensitized to beryllium, which can then lead to a disease of the lungs called chronic beryllium disease, and possibly lung cancer. Thirty aluminum and thirty stainless steel parts were fabricated on a lathe in the beryllium facility, as well as thirty-two beryllium parts, for the purpose of testing a parts cleaning method that involved the use of <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaners.</b> A cleaning method was created, documented, validated, and approved, to reduce beryllium contamination...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} demands of economical, reliable and durable hydraulic and pneumatic systems, {{it is necessary}} to minimize the material damage from cavitation erosion (CE) when systems are handling cavitating and corrosive fluids. Cavitation erosion is a nausea for many engineering components, such as ship propellers & rudders, turbine, diesel engine, cylinder liner, pump impeller vanes, control valves, hydraulic turbines, bearings, pipes, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>cleaners</b> and mechanical heart valves, which are exposed to the high-speed flowing or vibratory fluids. This paper reviews the rationale behind the application of laser surface modification for achieving CE resistant surfaces of fluid handling components. The problem of CE may be tackled by enhancing the surface properties of the base materials (ferrous and non-ferrous alloys) with various laser surface modification techniques including laser transformation hardening (LTH), laser surface melting (LSM), laser surface alloying (LSA), laser cladding (LC), laser dispersion (LD) and laser plasma hybrid spraying (LPHS). The CE performance of a variety of laser-surface modified layers/coatings is discussed in this review. In particular, coatings of hard-facing alloys, shape memory alloys, surface metal or intermetallic matrix composites and cermets on ferrous and non-ferrous alloys are included. The mechanisms of the enhancement in cavitation erosion resistance (Re) are discussed. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
