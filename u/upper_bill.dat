5|$|Visual {{differentiation}} {{from the}} fish crow (C. ossifragus) {{is extremely difficult}} and often inaccurate. Nonetheless, differences apart from size do exist. Fish crows {{tend to have more}} slender bills and feet. There may also be a small sharp hook {{at the end of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>bill.</b> Fish crows also appear as if they have shorter legs when walking. More dramatically, when calling, fish crows tend to hunch and fluff their throat feathers.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} the dodo {{differed}} much {{from those of}} other pigeons, especially in being more robust, the bill having a hooked tip, and in having a short cranium compared to the jaws. The <b>upper</b> <b>bill</b> was nearly {{twice as long as}} the cranium, which was short compared to those of its closest pigeon relatives. The openings of the bony nostrils were elongated {{along the length of the}} beak, and they contained no bony septum. The cranium (excluding the beak) was wider than it was long, and the frontal bone formed a dome-shape, with the highest point above the hind part of the eye sockets. The skull sloped downwards at the back. The eye sockets occupied much of the hind part of the skull. The sclerotic rings inside the eye were formed by eleven ossicles (small bones), similar to the amount in other pigeons. The mandible was slightly curved, and each half had a single fenestra (opening), as in other pigeons.|$|E
25|$|The {{woodcock}} {{uses its}} long prehensile bill to probe {{in the soil}} for food, mainly invertebrates and especially earthworms. A unique bone-and-muscle arrangement lets the bird open and close the tip of its <b>upper</b> <b>bill,</b> or mandible, while it is sunk in the ground. Both {{the underside of the}} upper mandible and the long tongue are rough-surfaced for grasping slippery prey.|$|E

40|$|Morphological {{differences}} between the sexes in Keas Nestor notabilis were quantified from a sample of 86 sexed museum specimens, nine sexed zoo captives and 129 live, wild-caught birds. The results demonstrate that Kea are sexually dimorphic. Males are about 5 % larger than females in linear measurements of body size and their <b>upper</b> <b>bills</b> are on average 12 - 14 % longer, with a slightly larger radius of curvature. The dimorphism in bill size was statistically independent {{of the difference in}} overall body size, suggesting the possibility of intersexual differences in niche utilisation. Culmen length appears to be a useful means for distinguishing sexes in the field: our data indicate an optimum separation criterion of 43. 9 mm for wild-caught individuals. Culmen length measurements from specimens originating in captivity were more variable. There was no evidence that sexual dimorphism increases with sexual maturity in this species...|$|R
50|$|This is a {{medium-sized}} species at 39 cm. Its crown, nape and <b>upper</b> parts, <b>bill,</b> legs and long tail are black, {{the eyes are}} red, the wings are chestnut, and the underparts are creamy white, with blackish barring on the flanks. The sexes are similar, but juveniles are browner and more heavily barred above, with buff to cinnamon, barred and streaked underparts.|$|R
500|$|On {{the basis}} of radiographs, D. T. Holyoak claimed that the {{mandible}} of the broad-billed parrot was weakly constructed and suggested {{that it would have}} fed on soft fruits rather than hard seeds. As evidence, he pointed out that the internal trabeculae were widely spaced, that the <b>upper</b> <b>bill</b> was broad whereas the palatines were narrow, and the fact that no preserved upper rostrum had been discovered, which he attributed to its delicateness. G. A. Smith, however, pointed out that the four genera Holyoak used as examples of [...] "strong jawed" [...] parrots based on radiographs, Cyanorhamphus, Melopsittacus, Neophema and Psephotus, actually have weak jaws in life, and that the morphologies cited by Holyoak do not indicate strength. Hume has since pointed out that the mandible morphology of the broad-billed parrot is comparable to that of the largest living parrot, the hyacinth macaw, which cracks open palm nuts with ease. It is therefore probable that the broad-billed parrot fed in the same manner.|$|E
2500|$|The bill is {{huge and}} {{flat on the}} top, with a large throat sac below, and, in the {{breeding}} season, is vivid orange in color as are the iris, the bare skin around the eye, and the feet. In the breeding season, there is a laterally flattened [...] "horn" [...] on the <b>upper</b> <b>bill,</b> located about one-third the bill's length behind the tip. This {{is the only one}} of the eight species of pelican to have a bill [...] "horn". The horn is shed after the birds have mated and laid their eggs. Outside the breeding season the bare parts become duller in color, with the naked facial skin yellow and the bill, pouch, and feet an orangy-flesh color.|$|E
2500|$|The {{legs were}} {{proportionally}} short, the feet probably webbed and the hallux was vestigial or entirely absent; the tarsometatarsi (anklebones) resembled those of albatrosses while {{the arrangement of}} the front toes was more like in fulmars. Typical for pseudotooth birds was a second toe that attached a bit kneewards from the others and was noticeably angled outwards. The [...] "teeth" [...] were probably covered by the rhamphotheca in life, and there are two furrows running along the underside of the <b>upper</b> <b>bill</b> just inside the ridges which bore the [...] "teeth". Thus, when the bill was closed only the upper jaw's [...] "teeth" [...] were visible, with the lower ones hidden behind them. Inside the eye sockets of at least some pseudotooth birds – perhaps only in the younger species – were well-developed salt glands.|$|E
50|$|Woodcocks have stocky bodies, cryptic {{brown and}} blackish plumage and long slender bills. Their eyes {{are located on}} the sides of their heads, which gives them 360° vision. Unlike in most birds, the tip of the <b>bill's</b> <b>upper</b> {{mandible}} is flexible.|$|R
50|$|A {{fish hook}} is a device for {{catching}} fish either by impaling {{them in the}} mouth or, more rarely, by snagging {{the body of the}} fish. Fish hooks have been employed for millennia by fishermen to catch fresh and saltwater fish. Early hooks were made from the <b>upper</b> <b>bills</b> of eagles and from bones, shells, horns and thorns of plants (Parker 2002). In 2005, the fish hook was chosen by Forbes {{as one of the top}} twenty tools in the history of man. Fish hooks are normally attached to some form of line or lure device which connects the caught fish to the fisherman. There is an enormous variety of fish hooks. Sizes, designs, shapes, and materials are all variable depending on the intended purpose of the hook. They are manufactured for a range of purposes from general fishing to extremely limited and specialized applications. Fish hooks are designed to hold various types of artificial, processed, dead or live baits (bait fishing); to act as the foundation for artificial representations of fish prey (fly fishing); or to be attached to or integrated into other devices that represent fish prey (lure fishing).|$|R
50|$|The {{laurel pigeon}} {{is a rather}} plain, dark grey bird of 38 cm. Large, dark brown and grey pigeon. Mainly dark sepia-brown, redder on underparts. Pale grey tail with broad, whitish {{terminal}} band. Extensive green gloss to rear crown and hindneck becoming pink on <b>upper</b> mantle. Whitish <b>bill</b> and pale eye.|$|R
2500|$|Short-tailed {{albatrosses}} are {{a type of}} albatross {{that belong}} to the family Diomedeidae, [...] order Procellariiformes, along with shearwaters, fulmars, storm petrels, and diving petrels. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the <b>upper</b> <b>bill</b> called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the albatross are {{on the sides of}} the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. Finally, they produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This is used against predators as well as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. They also have a salt gland which is situated above the nasal passage helping desalinate their bodies, as an adaptation to the high amount of ocean water they imbibe. It excretes a high saline solution from their nose. Going back in time, fossils of albatrosses from the mid-Pleistocene in Bermuda and North Carolina are considered to be closest to the short-tailed albatross.|$|E
60|$|The Mahar sank now till {{only the}} long <b>upper</b> <b>bill</b> and eyes were exposed {{above the surface}} of the water, and the girl had {{advanced}} until the end of that repulsive beak was but an inch or two from her face, her horror-filled eyes riveted upon those of the reptile.|$|E
60|$|Next day I {{came back}} again. The strange bird {{was there on}} her nest as before, her long bill resting {{over the edge of}} the hollow and looking like a twig at the first glance. She showed no fear whatever, and {{encouraged}} at her quietness and assurance I crept nearer and nearer till I touched her bill with my finger and turned it gently aside. At this she wiggled it impatiently, and my first child's observation was one that has only recently been noticed by naturalists, namely, that the tip of the <b>upper</b> <b>bill</b> is flexible and can be moved about almost like the tip of a finger in order to find the food that lies deep in the mud, and seize it and drag it out of its hiding. At the same time she uttered a curious hissing sound that frightened me again and made me think of snakes and hidden stings; so I drew back and watched her from a safe distance. She sat for the most part perfectly motionless, the only movement being an occasional turning of the long bill; and once when she had been still a very long time, I turned her head aside again, and to my astonishment and delight she made no objection, but left her head as I had turned it, and presently she let me twist it back again. After her first warning she seemed to understand the situation perfectly, and had no concern for the wondering child that watched her and that had no intention whatever of harming her or her nest.|$|E

50|$|The Antarctic petrel is {{the only}} known species in the genus Thalassoica, {{and is a member}} of the family Procellariidae, and the Procellariiformes order. Also, this petrel along with the snow petrel, the Cape petrel, both giant petrels, and the two species in the Fulmarus family, are {{considered}} to be a separate group from the other Procellariidae members. They share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the <b>upper</b> <b>bill</b> called naricorns. Although the nostrils on the petrels are on the top of the <b>upper</b> <b>bill.</b> The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates.

50|$|Ancient {{remains of}} spears, hooks and fishnet {{have been found}} in ruins of the Stone Age. The people of the early civilization drew {{pictures}} of nets and fishing lines in their arts (Parker 2002). Early hooks were made from the <b>upper</b> <b>bills</b> of eagles and from bones, shells, horns and plant thorns. Spears were tipped with the same materials, or sometimes with flints. Lines and nets were made from leaves, plant stalk and cocoon silk. Ancient fishing nets were rough in design and material but they were amazingly, as if some now use (Parker 2002). Literature on the indigenous fishing practices is very scanty. Baines (1992) documented traditional fisheries in the Solomon Islands. Use of the herbal fish poisons in catching fishes from fresh water and sea documented from New Caledonia (Dahl 1985). John (1998) documented fishing techniques and overall life style of the Mukkuvar fishing Community of Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu, India. Tribal people using various plants for medicinal and various purposes (Rai et al. 2000; Singh et al. 1997; Lin 2005) extends the use notion for herbal fish stupefying plants. Use of the fish poisons is very old practice in the history of human kind. In 1212, King Frederick II prohibited the use of certain plant piscicides, and by the 15th century similar laws had been decreed in other European countries as well (Wilhelm 1974). All over the globe, indigenous people use various fish poisons to kill the fishes, documented in America (Jeremy 2002) and among Tarahumara Indian (Gajdusek 1954).|$|R
50|$|The Queen-in-Parliament (or, {{during the}} reign of a male monarch, King-in-Parliament), {{sometimes}} referred to as the Crown-in-Parliament or, more fully, in the United Kingdom, as the King/Queen in Parliament under God, is a technical term of constitutional law in the Commonwealth realms that refers to the Crown in its legislative role, acting with the advice and consent of the parliament (including, if the parliament is bicameral, both the lower house and <b>upper</b> house). <b>Bills</b> passed by the houses are sent to the sovereign, or governor-general, lieutenant-governor, or governor as her representative, for Royal Assent, which, once granted, makes the bill into law; these primary acts of legislation are known as acts of parliament.

50|$|The {{northern}} fulmar and its sister species, the southern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialodes), are the extant {{members of the}} genus Fulmarus. The fulmars are in turn {{a member of the}} order Procellariiformes, and they all share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the <b>upper</b> <b>bill</b> called naricorns; however, nostrils on albatrosses are {{on the sides of the}} bill, as opposed to the rest of the order, including fulmars, which have nostrils on top of the <b>upper</b> <b>bill.</b> The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. One of these plates makes up the hooked portion of the <b>upper</b> <b>bill,</b> called the maxillary unguis. They produce a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defense against predators from a very early age, and as an energy rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. It will mat the plumage of avian predators, and can lead to their death. Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage that helps desalinate their bodies, due to the high amount of ocean water that they imbibe. This gland excretes a high saline solution from their nose.|$|E

50|$|A common {{question}} asked is why woodpeckers {{do not get}} headaches. The forces produced during beak pounding and drumming, at high-speed acceleration and decelerations, {{are thought to be}} offset by a number of factors within the bill and skull. Dense spongy cranial bones, a relatively small brain, low cerebral spinal fluid, the unequal <b>upper</b> and lower <b>bills</b> of the beak and its position in relation to the brain work together to provide shock absorbency to the brain. Beak trajectory during pounding and drilling is straight and this reduces the forces of shearing and rotation.|$|R
50|$|As WTRN {{was close}} to his home, Simpson moved AMN's {{corporate}} operations to this station. Many of AMN's properties were in communities that were large {{enough to make the}} radio business profitable, but perhaps not quite large enough to support a typical radio station's staff at the time. Thus, many duties were centralized (traffic, <b>billing,</b> <b>upper</b> management) in the Tyrone office, requiring only airstaff and sales consultants at the individual stations. This business model would start to become the accepted standard following the first round of FCC ownership limit changes that began in 1992.|$|R
