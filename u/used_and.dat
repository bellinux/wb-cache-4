40|$|Aims Genetically {{influenced}} {{aspects of}} adolescent behaviour {{can play a}} role in alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> peer affiliation. We explored the correlations between friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescent own <b>use</b> with a genetically sensitive design. Design Genetic and environmental factors were estimated on adolescent reports of their friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> their own <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. The correlations between the genetic and environmental factors that influence friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> were also estimated. Participants A total of 862 twin pairs aged 11 – 17 years sampled from the UK population-based Cardiff Study of All Wales and North-west of England Twins (CaStANET). Measurements Data on adolescent own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> <b>and</b> the alcohol <b>use</b> of their three best friends were obtained using self-report questionnaires. Findings A significant genetic influence was found on adolescent friends' alcohol use (about 30 %). Significant correlations of 0. 60 and 0. 70 were found between the genetic influences on friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' own <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> of alcohol. Common environmental influences were almost completely correlated for friends' alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> adolescents' own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> problem <b>use</b> (0. 91 <b>and</b> 0. 94). Conclusions There is considerable overlap in the common environmental and genetic factors that contribute to the relationship between adolescents' own alcohol <b>use</b> <b>and</b> that of their friends. These findings contribute to understanding of the mechanisms by which friends' alcohol use influences adolescent drinking behaviour...|$|R
