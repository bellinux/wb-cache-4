5|$|Microsoft {{originally}} {{announced that}} users {{who did not}} install the <b>update</b> would not receive any other updates after May 13, 2014. However, meeting this deadline proved challenging: The ability to deploy Windows 8.1 <b>Update</b> through Windows Server <b>Update</b> Services (WSUS) was disabled shortly after its release following {{the discovery of a}} bug which affects the ability to use WSUS as a whole in certain server configurations. Microsoft later fixed the issue but users continued to report that the <b>update</b> may fail to install. Microsoft's attempt to fix the problem was ineffective, to the point that Microsoft pushed the support deadline further to June 30, 2014. On 16 May, Microsoft released additional updates to fix a problem of BSOD in the <b>update.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 8, 2014, Microsoft {{released}} the Windows 8.1 <b>Update,</b> which included all past updates plus new features. It was unveiled by Microsoft vice president Joe Belfiore at Mobile World Congress on February 23, 2014, and detailed in full at Microsoft's Build conference on April 2. Belfiore {{noted that the}} <b>update</b> would lower the minimum system requirements for Windows, {{so it can be}} installed on devices with as little as 1GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. Unlike Windows 8.1 itself, this cumulative <b>update</b> is distributed through Windows <b>Update,</b> and must be installed in order to receive any further patches for Windows 8.1.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2010, Symantec {{released}} the 18.5 version through Norton LiveUpdate. However, this <b>update</b> was later pulled due to numerous {{reports on the}} Norton forums that the <b>update</b> is causing system instability and freeze ups during system scans (both full and quick scans). This issue only affects some customers. Users affected by this <b>update</b> are advised to uninstall the product, run the Norton Removal Tool, and reinstall the 18.1 version from http://www.norton.com/nis11. Symantec later fixed the bugs and re-{{released the}} <b>update.</b>|$|E

5|$|Day of Defeat: Source has {{undergone}} several updates. These updates have consisted of gameplay tweaks, maps and graphical effects. The first new level {{was released on}} November 30, 2005, and was followed on January 25, 2006 by another map, used as a demonstration for the Source engine's abilities in rendering snow and ice. A major <b>update</b> was announced on June 22, 2006, adding the detonation game mode, various gameplay tweaks and two further maps to accommodate the new game mode. The <b>update</b> was released on June 28, 2006. On April 26, 2007, a group of maps produced by the game's community, entitled the Community Assembled Map Pack (CAMP1), was released. Consisting of three maps, the pack was created with the assistance and support of Valve. This was followed by CAMP2 on July 26, 2007, a pack which consisted of a further five maps. On May 23, 2008, Valve announced another major <b>update</b> to Day of Defeat: Source, this time giving the game support for the company's new Steamworks programmer. The <b>update</b> is open to any owners of Day of Defeat: Source. Along with various gameplay tweaks, the <b>update</b> moves the game to the Source engine version used with The Orange Box, allowing the game to utilize particle effects, as well as adding a map based on a long-standing custom map for Day of Defeat and 54 achievement awards for players completing certain tasks.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDynamic Software <b>Updating</b> (DSU) is a {{technique}} of <b>updating</b> running software systems on-the-fly.

We present an algebraic methodology of specifying dynamic <b>updates</b> and verifying their behavioral correctness by using off-the-shelf theorem proving and model checking tools. By theorem proving we can show that systems after being <b>updated</b> indeed satisfy their desired properties, and by model checking we can detect potential errors. Our methodology is general in that: (1) it can be applied to three <b>updating</b> models that are mainly used in current DSU systems; and (2) it is not restricted to dynamic <b>updates</b> for certain programming models...|$|R
