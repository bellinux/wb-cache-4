In an effective photo management system photo annotation is the most challenging task. In this paper, we develop several innovative interaction techniques for semi-automatic photo annotation. Compared with traditional annotation systems, our approach provides the following new features: “cluster annotation ” puts similar faces or photos with similar scene together, and enables <b>user</b> <b>label</b> them in one operation; “contextual re-ranking ” boosts the labeling productivity by guessing the user intention; “ad hoc annotation ” allows <b>user</b> <b>label</b> photos while they are browsing or searching, and improves system performance progressively through learning propagation.

The {{framework}} {{developed in}} this paper can deal with sce-narios where selected sub-ontologies of a large ontology are oered as views to users, based on criteria like the user's access right, the trust level required by the application, or the level of detail requested by the user. Instead of materializing {{a large number of}} dierent sub-ontologies, we propose to keep just one ontology, but equip each axiom with a la-bel from an appropriate labeling lattice. The access right, required trust level, etc. is then also represented by a label (called <b>user</b> <b>label)</b> from this lattice, and the corresponding sub-ontology is determined by compar-ing this label with the axiom labels. For large-scale ontologies, certain consequence (like the concept hierarchy) are often precomputed. Instead of precomputing these consequences for every possible sub-ontology, our approach computes just one label for each consequence such that a com-parison of the <b>user</b> <b>label</b> with the consequence label determines whether the consequence follows from the corresponding sub-ontology or not. In this paper we determine under which restrictions on the user and axiom labels such consequence labels (called boundaries) always exist, describe dierent black-box approaches for computing boundaries, and present rst experimental results that compare the eciency of these approaches on large real-world ontologies. Black-box means that, rather than requiring modications of existing reasoning procedures, these ap-proaches can use such procedures directly as sub-procedures, which al-lows us to employ existing highly-optimized reasoners. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{framework}} {{developed in}} this paper can deal with scenarios where selected sub-ontologies of a large ontology are offered as views to users, based on contexts like the access rights of a user, the trust level required by the application, or the level of detail requested by the user. Instead of materializing {{a large number of}} different sub-ontologies, we propose to keep just one ontology, but equip each axiom with a label from an appropriate context lattice. The different contexts of this ontology are then also expressed by elements of this lattice. For large-scale ontologies, certain consequences (like the subsumption hierarchy) are often pre-computed. Instead of pre-computing these consequences for every context, our approach computes just one label (called a boundary) for each consequence such that a comparison of the <b>user</b> <b>label</b> with the consequence label determines whether the consequence follows from the sub-ontology determined by the context. We describe different black-box approaches for computing boundaries, and present first experimental results that compare the efficiency of these approaches on large real-world ontologies. Black-box means that, rather than requiring modifications of existing reasoning procedures, these approaches can use such procedures directly as sub-procedures, which allows us to employ existing highly-optimized reasoners. Similar to designing ontologies, the process of assigning axiom labels is error-prone. For this reason, we also address {{the problem of how to}} repair the labelling of an ontology in case the knowledge engineer notices that the computed boundary of a consequence does not coincide with her intuition regarding in which context the consequence should or should not be visible...|$|E

In this paper, we present a general framework for classifier adaptation, which improves an existing generic classifier in the new test environment.

The existing methods do not perform well since they do not consider scenes' multiple features from different views in low-dimensional subspace construction. In this paper, we describe scene images by finding a group of features and explore their complementary characteristics. We consider the problem of multiview dimensionality reduction by learning a unified low-dimensional subspace to effectively fuse these features. The new proposed method takes both intraclass and interclass geometries into consideration, {{as a result the}} discriminability is effectively preserved because it takes into account neighboring samples which have different labels. Due to the semantic gap, the fusion of multiview features still cannot achieve excellent performance of scene classification in real applications. Therefore, a <b>user</b> <b>labeling</b> procedure is introduced in our approach. Initially, a query image is provided by the user, and a group of images are retrieved by a search engine. After that, <b>users</b> <b>label</b> some images in the retrieved set as relevant or irrelevant with the query. The must-links are constructed between the relevant images, and the cannot-links are built between the irrelevant images. Finally, an alternating optimization procedure is adopted to integrate the complementary nature of different views with the <b>user</b> <b>labeling</b> information, and develop a novel multiview dimensionality reduction method for scene classification. Experiments are conducted on the real-world datasets of natural scenes and indoor scenes, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method has the best performance in scene classification. In addition, the proposed method can be applied to other classification problems. The experimental results of shape classification on Caltech 256 suggest the effectiveness of our method.

40|$|From Twitter to Facebook to Reddit, {{users have}} become {{accustomed}} to sharing the articles they read with friends or followers on their social networks. While previous work has modeled what these shared stories say about the user who shares them, the converse question remains unexplored: what can we learn about an article from the identities of its likely readers? To address this question, we model the content of news articles and blog posts by attributes {{of the people who}} are likely to share them. For example, many Twitter users de-scribe themselves in a short profile, labeling themselves with phrases such as “vegetarian ” or “liberal. ” By assuming that a <b>user’s</b> <b>labels</b> correspond to topics in the articles he shares, we can learn a labeled dictionary from a training corpus of articles shared on Twitter. Thereafter, we can code any new document as a sparse non-negative linear combination of <b>user</b> <b>labels,</b> where we encourage correlated labels to ap-pear together in the output via a structured sparsity penalty. Finally, we show that our approach yields a novel doc-ument representation that can be effectively used in many problem settings, from recommendation to modeling news dynamics. For example, while the top politics stories will change drastically from one month to the next, the “pol-itics ” label will still be there to describe them.
