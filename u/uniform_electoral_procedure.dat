I will test this argument {{by examining the}} manner in which political and ideological factors have played out at critical periods {{in the history of the}} directly elected EP and two member states to prevent the installation of uniform procedures. Results indicate that the issues under consideration during the debates on direct elections legislation have had lasting effects on subsequent efforts to impose <b>uniform</b> <b>electoral</b> <b>procedures.</b> Failure at the supranational level to find consensus on a reform proposal came even in the face of a concerted effort to account for domestic interests.

40|$|When {{developing}} electoral protocols, desiderata {{include a}} system which is transparent, non-manipulable, honest, and not open to strategizing. However, these desiderata are in tension with each other: Often, transparent <b>electoral</b> <b>procedures</b> are the least strategy resistant, and many honest procedures encourage manipulation. Thus, a balance between these different goals must be sought. In modern times, since the seminal result on vote manipulation, the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem, much attention {{has been devoted to}} developing voting rules where manipulation is never {{in the best interest of}} the voters, or which are computationally too complex for the average bounded agent to be able to manipulate. In medieval times, such computational routes were generally not available, meaning that other constraints had to be put in place to discourage strategizing and manipulation.
