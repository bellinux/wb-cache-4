5|$|While {{playing as}} Jodie, the game {{includes}} interactive objects {{marked with a}} white dot, which can be interacted with by tilting the controller stick in its direction. If Jodie must perform a specific action, icons pop <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screen</b> to prompt the player to press and/or hold certain controller buttons. Conversation prompts float in the air, defaulting to a certain choice if too much time passes before selection. During action sequences, like chases or hand-to-hand combat, the cinematography moves into slow motion whilst Jodie performs the physical manoeuvre; during this time, the player must determine the direction Jodie is moving and push the controller stick in that direction to complete the action. Other sequences require real-time stealth, which has the player sneak Jodie through environments while coordinating certain actions with Aiden. Failing certain action sequences will alter {{the course of a}} chapter (and sometimes later chapters) and in some cases lead to the death of a non-playable character.|$|E

40|$|The picture {{painted in}} South Africa when one reads or speaks about Internet access and the {{majority}} of our fellow countrymen and women, is not a statistic or number that anyone can really get excited about. The reality is pretty dismal. Compared with cellphone penetration and the reach this medium has had across all ethnic groups as well as urban and rural areas, the Internet still {{has a great deal of}} ground to cover within the South African population. The aim of this paper is to paint a picture of the Internet beyond what researchers see in their data and <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>screens.</b> <b>The</b> task is to illustrate to the readers, and of course the audience at SAMRA, how this picture is being transformed through various initiatives. This is not your typical paper, not your typical piece of research as an experienced researcher would say. However, it gels succinctly with the theme of the conference, being ‘Out the Box’. My mission is to look beyond the walls we normally confine ourselves to in typical research circles, and by using secondary research (information that is available but has not been widely publicised), to highlight that there is a great deal of progress here even though we are compared to and labelled as Third World. What this paper will do is show the industry just how much opportunity there is, if we are willing to look beyond our regular confines. ...|$|R

50|$|Up {{until the}} early 1970s, the time span between a film's {{theatrical}} release and its appearance on commercial network television was much longer.
