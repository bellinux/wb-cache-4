25|$|Two {{percent of}} ectopic pregnancies {{occur in the}} ovary, cervix, or are intraabdominal. Transvaginal <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> is usually able to detect a {{cervical}} pregnancy. An ovarian pregnancy is differentiated from a tubal pregnancy by the Spiegelberg criteria.|$|E
25|$|Carrier {{testing for}} Roberts {{syndrome}} requires prior {{identification of the}} disease-causing mutation in the family. Carriers for the disorder are heterozygotes due to the autosomal recessive nature of the disease. Carriers are also not at risk for contracting Roberts syndrome themselves. A prenatal diagnosis of Roberts syndrome requires an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> paired with cytogenetic testing or prior identification of the disease-causing ESCO2 mutations in the family.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} in Europe of the single-embryo transfer policy, which aims at {{the reduction of}} the incidence of multiple pregnancies after ART, usually one embryo or early blastocyst is replaced in the uterus. Serum hCG is determined at day 12. If a pregnancy is established, an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> at 7 weeks is performed to confirm the presence of a fetal heartbeat. Couples are generally advised to undergo PND because of the, albeit low, risk of misdiagnosis.|$|E

25|$|Two {{signs are}} truly 'diagnostic' of Graves' disease (i.e., {{not seen in}} other hyperthyroid conditions): exophthalmos and nonpitting edema (pretibial myxedema). Goiter is an {{enlarged}} thyroid gland and is of the diffuse type (i.e., spread throughout the gland). Diffuse goiter may be seen with other causes of hyperthyroidism, although Graves' disease {{is the most common}} cause of diffuse goiter. A large goiter will be visible to the naked eye, but a small one (mild enlargement of the gland) may be detectable only by physical examination. Occasionally, goiter is not clinically detectable, but may be seen only with computed tomography or <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> of the thyroid.|$|E
25|$|Spina bifida is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. After having one child with the condition or if one of the parents has the condition, there is a 4% chance that the next child will also be affected. Not having enough folate in the diet before and during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born. Before birth if a blood test or amniocentesis finds a high level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), there is a higher risk of spina bifida. <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> may also detect the problem. Medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth. It is a type of neural tube defect with other types including anencephaly and encephalocele.|$|E
25|$|Urinalysis is {{typically}} performed when LUTS are present and BPH is suspected to evaluate {{for signs of}} a urinary tract infection, glucose in the urine (suggestive of diabetes), or protein in the urine (suggestive of kidney disease). Bloodwork including kidney function tests and prostate specific antigen (PSA) are often ordered to evaluate for kidney damage and prostate cancer, respectively. However, checking blood PSA levels for prostate cancer screening is controversial and not necessarily indicated in every evaluation for BPH. Benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer are both capable of increasing blood PSA levels and PSA elevation is unable to differentiate these two conditions well. If PSA levels are checked and are high, then further investigation is warranted. Measures including PSA density, free PSA, rectal examination, and transrectal ultrasonography may be helpful in determining whether a PSA increase is due to BPH or prostate cancer. <b>Ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> of the testes, prostate, and kidneys is often performed, again to rule out cancer and hydronephrosis.|$|E

500|$|Also, {{unlike the}} {{arterial}} <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination,</b> blood velocity in veins has no diagnostic meaning. Veins are a draining system {{similar to a}} low pressure hydraulic system, with a laminar flow and a low velocity. This low velocity {{is responsible for the}} fact that it can only be detected spontaneously with the Doppler effect on the proximal and larger femoral and iliac veins. Here the flow is either modulated by the respiratory rhythm or is continuous in cases where the flow is high. The thinner veins do not have a spontaneous flow. However, in some circumstances the blood flow is so slow that it can be seen as some echogenic material moving within the vein, in [...] "spontaneous contrast". [...] This material can easily be mistaken for a thrombus, but can also easily be discounted by testing the vein's compressibility.|$|E
2500|$|The {{syndrome}} acquired {{its most}} widely used name due to the common sign on <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination</b> of multiple (poly) ovarian cysts.

2500|$|The use {{of dynamic}} {{endocrine}} tests is particularly helpful in isolating {{a diagnosis of}} PAIS. [...] One such test is the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation test. [...] If the gonads are testes, {{there will be an}} increase in the level of serum testosterone in response to the hCG, regardless of testicular descent. [...] The magnitude of the testosterone increase can help differentiate between androgen resistance and gonadal dysgenesis, as does evidence of a uterus on <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination.</b> [...] Testicular function can also be assessed by measuring serum anti-Müllerian hormone levels, which in turn can further differentiate PAIS from gonadal dysgenesis and bilateral anorchia.|$|E
2500|$|Gynecologic ultrasonography, {{specifically}} {{looking for}} small ovarian follicles. These {{are believed to}} be the result of disturbed ovarian function with failed ovulation, reflected by the infrequent or absent menstruation that is typical of the condition. In a normal menstrual cycle, one egg is released from a dominant follicle– in essence, a cyst that bursts to release the egg. After ovulation, the follicle remnant is transformed into a progesterone-producing corpus luteum, which shrinks and disappears after approximately 12–14 days. In PCOS, there is a so-called [...] "follicular arrest"; i.e., several follicles develop to a size of 5–7mm, but not further. No single follicle reaches the preovulatory size (16mm or more). According to the Rotterdam criteria, which are widely used for diagnosis, 12 or more small follicles should be seen in an ovary on <b>ultrasound</b> <b>examination.</b> More recent research suggests that there should be at least 25 follicles in an ovary to designate it as having polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in women aged 18–35 years. The follicles may be oriented in the periphery, giving the appearance of a 'string of pearls'. If a high resolution transvaginal ultrasonography machine is not available, an ovarian volume of at least 10 ml is regarded as an acceptable definition of having polycystic ovarian morphology instead of follicle count.|$|E
