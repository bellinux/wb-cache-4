The third section seems to have been in ancient times the beginning of Derek Ereẓ R. (Rashi on Ber. 22a; Pes. 86b; Tosef. 'Er. 53b), for which reason the old writers called the whole treatise [...] "Perek ben Azzai." [...] Yet it is difficult to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> section came to be taken as the introduction to the treatise, which otherwise, beginning with the fourth section, forms a connected whole, and has totally different contents from the Pereḳ ben Azzai.|$|E

They meet in battle and Talhand dies on his elephant without a wound. Believing that Gav had killed Talhand, their mother is distraught. Gav tells his mother that Talhand did not die by the hands of him or his men, but she does not <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> could be. So the sages of the court invent the game of chess, detailing the pieces and how they move, to show the mother of the princes how the battle unfolded and how Talhand died of fatigue when surrounded by his enemies. The poem uses the Persian term [...] "Shāh māt" [...] (check mate) to describe the fate of Talhand.|$|E

2500|$|Another way a {{three-dimensional}} viewer can comprehend {{the structure of}} a four-dimensional polytope is through being [...] "immersed" [...] in the object, perhaps via some form of virtual reality technology. To <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> might work, imagine what one would see if space were filled with cubes. The viewer would be inside one of the cubes, and would be able to see cubes in front of, behind, above, below, to the left and right of himself. If one could travel in these directions, one could explore the array of cubes, and gain an understanding of its geometrical structure. An infinite array of cubes is not a polytope in the traditional sense. In fact, it is a tessellation of 3-dimensional (Euclidean) space. However, a 4-polytope can be considered a tessellation of a 3-dimensional non-Euclidean space, namely, a tessellation of the surface of a four-dimensional sphere (a 4-dimensional spherical tiling).|$|E

It is still not <b>understood</b> <b>how</b> <b>this</b> molecular tropism of HIV- 1 is translated into the virus' ability to compromise normal cell functions, which results in impairment of lymphoid tissue and causes AIDS.

We used this technique to replicate and characterize withgreater precision the coarse-to-fine SF sampling observed in previous studies. Then we show that thevisual processing of real-world objects near an observer’s hands is biased toward the use of low-SFinformation, around 288 ms. Conversely, high-SF information presented around 113 ms impaired objectrecognition when objects were presented near the hands. Notably, both of these effects happenedrelatively late during object recognition and suggest that the modulation of SF use by hand position is atleast partly attentional in nature...|$|R
