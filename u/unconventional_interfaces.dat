In this paper, we introduce a framework for designing distributable web applications, which supports moving and sharing the different parts of a user interface across different devices. We depict the architectural solution and we introduce a set of distribution patterns. In addition, we describe a concrete application of the framework for a distributable video player application...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Ambient {{intelligent}} systems are context aware by perceiving and reasoning about their environment, they perceive {{the needs of}} their users and proactively respond to these needs by being context sensitive. Users do not interact with these systems by traditional means only, but also through behavioural interfaces. This combination of mixed initiative systems and <b>unconventional</b> <b>interfaces</b> puts strong requirements on the explanatory capabilities of any system. The work presented here focuses on explaining the behaviour of an ambient {{intelligent systems}} to its users. It demonstrates how explanations can be combined with context to deal with the different types of explanations that are required for a meaningful interaction of a system and its users. ...|$|E
40|$|Multi-channel sound {{diffusion}} {{has been}} {{an essential part of}} the electroacoustic music process from the very beginning of the genre. We see early experimentation in sound spatialization in Varèse’s use of loudspeaker “paths ” in Poéme Èlectronique, Stockhausen’s experiments in quad and cubebased speaker arrangements (Chadabe 1997), and Chowning’s computational approach to sound diffusion in works like Turenas (Roads and Strawn 1985). Experimentation in deployment and usage of audio loudspeakers is seen in the loudspeaker orchestras at Bourges (Clozier 2001), GRM and Birmingham (Harrison 1999), Richard Moore’s notion of loudspeakers as “windows ” to the virtual world beyond (Moore 1989), and the development of standard configurations for multichannel audio in digital video (5. 1, 6. 1, 7. 1, 10. 2) (Stampfl and Dobler 2004). And the recent interest in Ambisonic recording technologies (Malham and Myatt 1995) has furthered the aesthetic goal of an immersive audio environments that place the listener in an alternative sonic world – a “virtual world ” created by composers and sound artists. The Immersive Computer-controlled Audio Sound Theater (ICAST, pronounced “eye-cast”) is a project that addresses the various needs of multiple performance modes through a computer-controlled loudspeaker environment that is malleable, adaptable and intuitive. The system also explores new and novel metaphors for sound control using both conventional and <b>unconventional</b> <b>interfaces.</b> ICAST is a hardware and software solution, based on a client-server computer control system, commodity audio interface hardware, and high-quality audio amplifiers and loudspeakers. What we have learned from this research has applications that go well beyond concert hall performances, and include virtual reality environments, cinema, and video games...|$|E

With its <b>unconventional</b> <b>interface,</b> storyline, and characters, the game's peculiarity became its selling point. The characters are largely lifelike in appearance except for their clay-modeled faces, {{which are often}} distorted or feature grotesquely exaggerated features. This near-realism, {{sometimes referred to as}} the uncanny valley, contributes to the game's ambience of unease and anxiety.|$|R

We propose UTILIS, an interactive process to help users add new objects. While {{creating a new}} object, relaxation rules are applied to its current description to find similar objects, whose properties serve as suggestions to expand the description. A user study conducted {{on a group of}} master students shows that students, even the ones disconcerted by the <b>unconventional</b> <b>interface,</b> used UTILIS suggestions. In most cases, they could find the searched element in the first three sets of properties of similar objects.

40|$|Memories can {{be formed}} around contact with {{physical}} objects that populate our everyday lives, we {{make sense of}} the physical world by the memories we create. We can create levels of understanding in relation to objects by organising significant memories into stories that hold meaning. The story of an object can involve the story of the personal relationship people have with it, the object can be a trigger on more than one level. In this project the physical, acts as a bridge to the virtual to provoke memory and sometimes instigate new memory formation in relation to an object. The artefacts of collective digital memory are accessed and rearranged through interaction with objects, the performance of this interaction gives space in which memories and stories about the objects and virtual artefacts can form. Physical manifestations of meta-data are used to create an <b>unconventional</b> <b>interface</b> to a database of existing memories. This paper seeks to frame the project theoretically and describe the resulting piece of work...|$|R
40|$|Graphene hybrid planar {{structures}} {{consisting of}} two regions with different quantum Hall (QH) states exhibit unusual transport properties 1 - 5, originating from chiral edge states equilibration at the interface of the two different regions 6. Here we present a sub-nanometre-resolved scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) study of a monolayer-bilayer graphene planar junction in the QH regime. The atomically well-defined interface of such a junction allows us to spatially resolve the interface electronic properties. Around the interface, we detect Landau quantization of massless Dirac fermions, as expected in graphene monolayer, below the charge neutrality point Nc of the junction, whereas unexpectedly, only Landau quantization of massive Dirac fermions, as expected in graphene bilayer, is observed above the Nc. The observed <b>unconventional</b> <b>interface</b> Landau quantization arises {{from the fact that}} the quantum conductance across the interface is solely determined by the minimum filling factors (number of edge modes) in the graphene monolayer and bilayer regions of the junction 6, 7.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, for {{the very}} first time, a general {{algorithm}} for designing rectangular microstrip patch antenna, partially loaded with SNG (Single Negative) (MNG (µ Negative) and ENG (ε Negative)) metamaterial has been proposed to achieve better radiation performance. Then, applying our proposed algorithm, theoretically we have predicted novel dual band miniaturized rectangular patch antennas (loaded with MNG metamaterial) for two different bands using <b>unconventional</b> <b>interface</b> resonance mode under fundamental TM 010 mode. Then we have proposed a complete design of magnetic inclusions, presenting full wave numerical simulations of the structure, which effectively supports the theoretical expected resonant modes as well as satisfactory radiation pattern performance. Prior to our current work, impossibility of sub-wavelength or electrically small rectangular patch antenna has been demonstrated using ENG metamaterial. However, in this paper, we have indicated a direction towards the real-life implementation of possible miniaturized rectangular patch antennas partially loaded with MNG metamaterial. The algorithm proposed in this paper is the key to choose the appropriate material parameter to design all such antennas...|$|R
30|$|Apart {{from the}} gain {{parameters}} modulation, the mechanical capabilities {{and the design}} of the robot deeply influenced the capabilities of the proposed system. Nowadays active compliance control is supported by an increasing number of commercially available robots (e.g., the Barrett WAM arm, the Mekabot upper-torso humanoid or the Kuka/DLR LWR), each is characterized by shapes and mechanical features specifically designed to accomplish diverse tasks, from manipulation to whole body movement in space. These new capabilities could inspire novel paradigms of human-robot interaction applied to music content processing, contributing to the evolution of research on haptic music and, more generally, on new interfaces for musical expression. Consequently, possible extensions of our study include the use of different robots as collaborative tools shared by several artists playing from different locations, with the robots sequentially moving and behaving according to the contribution of the different performers. The use of these robots as platforms to test metaphors for music creation could also give birth to <b>unconventional</b> musical <b>interfaces,</b> half robots, and half instruments, directly inspired by robotic experimentation in music research.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{approach}} to visualise the domestic communication patterns by designing domestic interfaces. We conduct a review of literatures {{on the development of}} interaction interfaces including the design and evaluation methods, the communication patterns in the home, and the design methods for domestic infrastructures. Following an analysis of current design approaches and interface design and evaluation, we draw some implications from a practical consumption behaviour research; a study designed an <b>unconventional</b> control panel <b>interface.</b> And the evaluation results of the study provided us an illustration of new interface effectiveness by novel design approach. The study of interface design approach indicates that the pattern visualisation stretches insights into the design and understanding for domestic communicational patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} engineering of interfaces between inorganic nanocrystals and semiconducting {{organic molecules}} is currently viewed as key for further developments in critical {{fields such as}} photovoltaics and photocatalysis. In this work, a new and <b>unconventional</b> source of <b>interface</b> interaction based on metal–metal bonds is presented. With this aim, an AuI organometallic gelator was exploited {{for the formation of}} hydrogel-like nanocomposites containing inorganic nanoparticles and conjugated organic molecules. Noteworthy, the establishment of metallophilic interactions at the interface between the two moieties greatly enhances interparticle coupling in the composites. Thus, we believe that this new hybrid system might represent a promising alternative in several fields, such as in the fabrication of improved light-harvesting devices.

40|$|The {{increasing}} interest to utilize wind energy {{as a power}} source prompted more researches to be dedicated to the unconventional integration of this power source into the current grid. In this paper, one avenue to achieve this efficient utilization, {{through the use of}} integrated wind energy conversion system (WECS) using doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) is presented. Wind grid integration brings the problems of voltage fluctuation and harmonic distortion. This paper presents an <b>Unconventional</b> Power Electronic <b>Interface</b> (UPEI) to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) and enhance power quality during disturbances. The models used in the paper includes a pitch-angled controlled wind turbine model, a DFIG model, power system model and an UPEI having controlled converters. A phase to phase fault is simulated on 132 kV bus and the measured results obtained from grid connection of the wind generation system are presented. The results have demonstrated the ability of UPEI to regulate pitch angle, VAR and to reduce THD. The proposed system increases the effectiveness of the utilization of wind energy...|$|R
