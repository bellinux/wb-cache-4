6000|$|Again he comes; nor dart nor lance avail, [...] Nor {{the wild}} {{plunging}} of the tortured horse; [...] Though man and man's avenging arms assail, [...] Vain are his weapons, vainer is his force. [...] One gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse; [...] Another, hideous sight! <b>unseamed</b> appears, [...] His gory chest unveils life's panting source; [...] Though death-struck, still his feeble frame he rears; Staggering, but stemming all, his lord unharmed he bears.|$|E
6000|$|Looking for the {{complement}} and {{counterpart of}} Lady Casterley, one would perhaps have singled out her brother. All her abrupt decision was negated in his profound, ironical urbanity. His voice and look and manner were like his velvet coat, which had {{here and there}} a whitish sheen, {{as if it had been}} touched by moonlight. His hair too had that sheen. His very delicate features were framed in a white beard and moustache of Elizabethan shape. His eyes, hazel and still clear, looked out very straight, with a certain dry kindliness. His face, though unweathered and <b>unseamed,</b> and much too fine and thin in texture, had a curious affinity to the faces of old sailors or fishermen who have lived a simple, practical life in the light of an overmastering tradition. It was the face of a man with a very set creed, and inclined to be satiric towards innovations, examined by him and rejected full fifty years ago. One felt that a brain not devoid either of subtlety or aesthetic quality had long given up all attempts to interfere with conduct; that all shrewdness of speculation had given place to shrewdness of practical judgment based on very definite experience. Owing to lack of advertising power, natural to one so conscious of his dignity as to have lost all care for it, and to his devotion to a certain lady, only closed by death, his life had been lived, as it were, in shadow. Still, he possessed a peculiar influence in Society, because it was known to be impossible to get him to look at things in a complicated way. He was regarded rather as a last resort, however. [...] "Bad as that? Well, there's old Fitz-Harold! Try him! He won't advise you, but he'll say something." ...|$|E

It was made from a type of plywood Haskell produced, consisting of veneers of birch {{on the outside and}} a redwood core. The <b>unseamed</b> canoe was made from a single piece of plywood; thousands were sold in the US. There was no ribs used in the building of the canoe.|$|E

In 2017, an anthology he edited, Clockwork Phoenix 5, was a finalist for the [...] World Fantasy Award for best anthology.|$|R
6000|$|Lightly {{this little}} herald flew aloft, [...] Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands: [...] Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands [...] His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies [...] Dazzled to trace {{it in the}} sunny skies. [...] It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was; [...] 70 [...] And like a new-born spirit did he pass [...] Through the green evening quiet in the sun, [...] O'er many a heath, through many a {{woodland}} dun, [...] Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams [...] The summer time away. One track <b>unseams</b> [...] A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue [...] Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew, [...] He sinks adown a solitary glen, [...] Where there was never sound of mortal men, [...] Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences [...] 80 [...] Melting to silence, when upon the breeze [...] Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet, [...] To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet [...] Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide, [...] Until it reached a splashing fountain's side [...] That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd [...] Unto the temperate air: then high it soar'd, [...] And, downward, suddenly began to dip, [...] As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip [...] The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch [...] 90 [...] Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch [...] Even with mealy gold the waters clear. [...] But, at that very touch, to disappear [...] So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered, [...] Endymion sought around, and shook each bed [...] Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung [...] Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue, [...] What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest? [...] It was a nymph uprisen to the breast [...] In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood [...] 100 [...] 'Mong lilies, like {{the youngest of the}} brood. [...] To him her dripping hand she softly kist, [...] And anxiously began to plait and twist [...] Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: [...] "Youth! [...] Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth, [...] The bitterness of love: too long indeed, [...] Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed [...] Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer [...] All the bright riches of my crystal coffer [...] To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish, [...] 110 [...] Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish, [...] Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze; [...] Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws [...] A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands [...] Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands [...] By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells, [...] My charming rod, my potent river spells; [...] Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup [...] Meander gave me,--for I bubbled up [...] To fainting creatures in a desert wild. [...] 120 [...] But woe is me, I am but as a child [...] To gladden thee; and all I dare to say, [...] Is, that I pity thee; that on this day [...] I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far [...] In other regions, past the scanty bar [...] To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en [...] From every wasting sigh, from every pain, [...] Into the gentle bosom of thy love. [...] Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above: [...] But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel! [...] 130 [...] I have a ditty for my hollow cell." ...|$|R
40|$|Free Space Optical (FSO) Communication is {{preferred}} {{over the radio}} frequency communication and microwave systems for about three decades. Next generation FSO communication systems use fiber-optic technology for <b>unseamed</b> and better data propagation rates. Besides license-free long-range operations, it has many other advantages like high bandwidth, small size, cheap and easy installation [1]. However, atmospheric turbulence highly influences the optical waves. As a result, it has few limitations like scintillation, dispersion of beam, etc. [2]. Such challenges are overcome by using different mediums and wavelengths. This paper considers the wavelength of 1550 nm with PRBS generator at bit rate 1. 25 Gb/s using both LASER and LED. These two optical sources are then compared {{on the grounds of}} Q-factor, Bit Error Rate (BER), wavelength spectrum and eye diagrams for the analysis of the sources {{that can be used in}} the FSO systems...|$|E
