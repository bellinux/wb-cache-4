40|$|This project {{focused on}} the effects of scale on the {{backdraft}} phenomena. A full residential-scale compartment was constructed using a shipping container. An extensive amount of time and effort was taken, in order to design and construct a compartment in which backdrafts may be safely simulated and observed. To determine the effects of scale, results were compared with previous work (Fleischmann et al. 1993) which included quantitative backdraft experiments in a half residential-scale apparatus. The dimensions of the full scale compartment was constructed to give dimensions comparable to those of the half scale apparatus. For this comparison 21 experiments were conducted. Results include: energy flow rates, species concentrations (CH 4, 0 2, C 02), temperature and pressure histories, vent flows and gravity current velocities. Experiments retained consistent conditions, with only two controlled variables; gas flow rate and time. Varying these the total unbumt hydrocarbon (methane) concentration in the compartment prior to a backdraft was varied. The most significant <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>variable</b> was the ambient wind condition. This had a substantial effect on the results of each experiment.

40|$|Although some markers for the {{epidermal}} {{stem cell}} compartment have been proposed, {{their role in}} specifically identifying keratinocyte stem cells is still controversial. Therefore, the identification of surface epithelial stem cells relies on either the evaluation of their proliferative capacity or on the identification of slow cycling, [3 H]TdR- and BrdU-retaining cells, the latter being feasible only on laboratory animals. The proliferative capacity of human lining epithelial stem cells can be evaluated in vitro by means of clonal analysis. Indeed, three types of keratinocytes with different capacities for multiplication have been identified and isolated in human epidermis, hair follicle, limbal-corneal and conjunctival epithelia, i. e. holoclones, meroclones and paraclones. The authors have recently demonstrated that cultured autografts bearing holoclones can indeed rapidly and permanently cover a large body surface.

There is a highly significant correlation between AL food consumption, the resultant obesity and body weight, and low 2 -yr survival in rodents. AL feeding of diets with lowered protein, metabolizable energy (ME), and increased fiber does not improve survival. Only dietary restriction (DR) of all diets tested significantly improves survival and delays the onset of spontaneous degenerative disease (i. e., nephropathy and cardiomyopathy) and diet-related tumors. Moderate DR results in an incidence of spontaneous tumors similar to AL-fed rats, but the tumors are found incidentally and do not cause early mortality. There is a decreased age-adjusted incidence of pituitary and mammary gland tumors in moderate DR-fed rats, but tumor growth time is similar between AL and DR rats with only a delay in tumor onset time seen in DR-fed groups. Moderate DR does not significantly alter drug-metabolizing enzyme activities nor the toxicologic response to 5 pharmaceuticals tested at maximum tolerated doses (MTDs). However, moderate DR-fed rats did require much higher doses of 4 additional pharmaceutical compounds before classical MTDs were produced. Toxicokinetic studies of 2 of these compounds demonstrated equal or higher steady-state systemic exposures to parent drug and metabolites in moderate DR-fed rats. Markers of oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation) are decreased and cytoprotective anti-oxidant markers are preserved in moderate DR-fed rats.

However, traditional packaging methods for rAAV vectors are generally inefficient and contaminated with replication-competent AAV (rcAAV) particles. Although wild-type AAV is not associated with any known human diseases, contaminating rcAAV particles may affect rAAV gene expression and are an <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>variable</b> in many AAV gene transfer studies. In the current study, a novel strategy was designed to both optimize AAV rep gene expression and increase vector yield, as well as simultaneously to diminish the potential of generating rcAAV particles from the helper plasmid. The strategy {{is based on the}} insertion of an additional intron in the AAV genome. In the AAV infectious clone, the intron insertion had no effects on the properties of Rep proteins expressed. Normal levels of both Rep and Cap proteins were expressed, and the replication of the AAV genome was not impaired. However, the generation of infectious rcAAV particles using intronized AAV helper was greatly diminished, which was due to the oversized AAV genome caused by the insertion of the artificial introns. Moreover, the rAAV packaging was significantly improved with the appropriate choice of intron and insertion position. The intron is another element that can regulate the rep and cap gene expression from the helper plasmid. This study provides for a novel AAV packaging system which is highly versatile and efficient. It can not only be combined with other AAV packaging systems, including rep-containing cell lines and herpes simplex virus hybrid packaging methods, but also be used in other vector systems as well...|$|E

Use of a higher caloric content reward was effective in increasing operant training acquisition rate. Total trial number completed in FR and breakpoint in PR were higher using the two isocaloric milk products (PM and SM) than the lower caloric LM, with comparable outcomes between PM and SM conditions, suggesting that total caloric content determines reward strength.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Housing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} sources of wealth in Finland, and with an aging population, conventional life-cycle finance theory would argue that accessing that wealth will become increasingly important. Reverse mortgage is a financial innovation directed at creating liquidity in the illiquidity housing wealth. Despite a strong theoretical grounding and clear popularity, reverse mortgages, along with other consumer finance innovations, have received little attention in the finance literature. This thesis aims to contribute to the literature by reviewing prior literature on diffusion of innovations, and by utilizing a unique dataset, investigating the role of neighbours in this diffusion process. The objective is to understand whether the data shows signs of a social effect in the adaption decision i. e. whether the decisions by neighbours affect one's own decision to adapt. Along with this social effect, this thesis tests the fungibility of assets through considering what impact other wealth and income have on the adaption decision, along with the impact of several covariates. DATA This thesis utilizes a unique data set from a leading retail bank that includes exact information on adaption dates along with several key covariates including age, wealth, income and exact street addresses. The data period utilized in analysis covers full years 2006 to 2009. The information in street addresses is converted into coordinates which in turn are used to calculate neighbourhoods for individuals. These inner- and outer circle neighbourhoods are crucial in controlling for unobservable, spatially inhomogeneous effects. RESULTS The results show evidence that adoption by a near-neighbour increase the likelihood of one's own adoption. The impact however is relatively weak compared to the impact from age, and despite the utilized methodology, one cannot completely dismiss the existence of a local, <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>variable.</b> Age, along with travel insurance and early adoption of remote banking, play a significant role in determining the likelihood of taking a reverse mortgage. There is no evidence of the innovation spreading from urban to rural municipalities, which is in contraction to much of diffusion literature, and emphasizes the role of the marketer in the process. There is also weak evidence for the fungibility of assets, although as wealth and income seem to have limited impact on the adoption decision...|$|E

40|$|The {{fatigue crack}} {{initiation}} resistance of an alloy {{is determined by}} conducting {{a series of tests}} over a range of values of stress amplitude or strain range. The observed number of cycles to failure is plotted against the stress amplitude or strain range to obtain a fatigue curve. The fatigue properties quoted for an alloy are typically the constants used in the equation(s) that describe the fatigue curve. Fatigue lives of interest may be as low as 10 (exp 2) or higher than 10 (exp 9) cycles. Because of the enormous scatter associated with fatigue, dozens of tests may be needed to confidently establish a fatigue curve, and the cost may run into several thousands of dollars. To further establish the effects on fatigue life of the test temperature, environment, alloy condition, mean stress effects, creep-fatigue effects, thermomechanical cycling, etc. requires an extraordinarily large and usually very costly test matrix. The total effort required to establish the fatigue resistance of an alloy should not be taken lightly. Fatigue crack initiation tests are conducted on relatively small and presumed to be initially crack-free, samples of an alloy that are intended to be representative of the alloy's metallurgical and physical condition. Generally, samples are smooth and have uniformly polished surfaces within the test section. Some may have intentionally machined notches of well-controlled geometry, but the surface {{at the root of the}} notch is usually not polished. The purpose of polishing is to attain a reproducible surface finish. This is to eliminate surface finish as an <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>variable.</b> Representative test specimen geometries will be discussed later. Test specimens are cyclically loaded until macroscopically observable cracks initiate and eventually grow to failure. Normally, the fatigue failure life of a specimen is defined as the number of cycles to separation of the specimen into two pieces. Alternative definitions are becoming more common, particularly for low-cycle fatigue testing, wherein some prescribed indication of impending failure due to cracking is adopted. Specific criteria will be described later. As a rule, cracks that develop during testing are not measured nor are the test parameters intentionally altered owing to the presence of cracking...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{purpose of}} this study was to test, by means of a {{controlled}} classroom experiment, the effectiveness of an experimental method involving the introduction of regular dictation of unpracticed material beginning with Lesson 25 in the Gregg Shorthand Manual Simplified, Second Edition, by Gregg, Leslie, and Zoubek. The study involved one major hypothesis: the introduction of regular and frequent dictation of unpracticed material beginning with the 25 th lesson in a beginning high school class in Gregg Shorthand will result in reaching a dictation speed of 60 words a minute with at least 95 percent accuracy in less time than if dictation of unpracticed material is delayed until all 53 theory lessons have been presented. The experiment was conducted simultaneously in four high schools. In each high school one of the two beginning shorthand classes was selected at random to serve as the experimental group and the other class served as the control group. At each school the same teacher taught both the experimental and control classes. The sample at the four high schools totaled 73 in the control classes and 55 in the experimental classes. The study measured shorthand achievement in terms of the number of periods of instruction required before the student was able to transcribe with 95 percent accuracy unpracticed material dictated at a rate of 60 words a minute for three minutes. All of the experimental classes devoted 15 minutes a period four days a week to the dictation of new material with transcription two days a week. All experimental classes used the same material for new-matter dictation. Dictation material for the first semester was so selected that students would not be required to write outlines involving shorthand theory they had not yet studied. The control classes used the same material for three-minute takes as that used by the experimental classes. Transcripts were scored according to a uniform, predetermined scoring plan. At the end of the school year, the mean number of periods of instruction received before passing the 60 -word-a-minute take was computed for each class. A comparison of the means for the control and experimental classes at each school revealed a reversal effect between the results achieved at the two schools designated as School B and School D. In an effort to explain this reversal effect, the overall grade point average was secured for each student and the difference between the means was tested for statistical significance by computing the t-score with an analysis of covariance. The grade point average was considered the <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>variable</b> in this analysis. The t-scores were not statistically significant at the five-percent level except for School D. Thus, the analysis of covariance explained the reversal effect at School B but not at School D. Since the data from three out of four schools yielded t-scores which fell far short of statistical significance, the hypothesis was rejected. The study led to three conclusions: 1. The early introduction of unpracticed dictation material in beginning high school shorthand classes using the Gregg Shorthand Manual Simplified, Second Edition, does not reduce the time required to successfully transcribe unpracticed material dictated at 60 words a minute for three minutes. 2. The early introduction of unpracticed dictation material in beginning high school shorthand classes using the Gregg Shorthand Manual Simplified, Second Edition, has no discernible adverse effect on student achievement as measured in this study. 3. There is no evidence to justify early introduction of new-matter dictation before completion of the theory in the average beginning high school shorthand class using the Gregg Shorthand Manual Simplified, Second Edition...|$|E

For this reason, it is considered good economy in many programmes to throw away and replace all the used nozzle tips each month. Recent developments described in this paper, however, indicate that {{it may be possible to}} use nozzle tips for several months, in some cases for an entire season, and at the same time to obtain regulated discharge from the nozzle despite changes of pressure in the tank...|$|R
5000|$|At times, Young or {{his agents}} met {{incoming}} wagon trains of Mormon pioneers, assigning the groups a secondary destination {{to establish a}} new community.

Colonizers traveled at their own expense and success depended on appropriate supplies and personal resourcefulness, as well as <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>variables</b> such as water supplies and weather.|$|R
