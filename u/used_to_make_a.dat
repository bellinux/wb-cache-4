5|$|The {{fruit of}} Ficus aurea is edible {{and was used}} for food by the {{indigenous}} people and early settlers in Florida; it is still eaten occasionally as a backyard source of native fruit. The latex was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> chewing gum, and aerial roots {{may have been used}} to make lashings, arrows, bowstrings and fishing lines. The fruit was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> rose-coloured dye. F. aurea was also used in traditional medicine in The Bahamas and Florida. Allison Adonizio and colleagues screened F. aurea for anti-quorum sensing activity (as a possible means of anti-bacterial action), but found no such activity.|$|E
5|$|A {{circular}} {{patch of}} {{hair on the}} central pad of their hind paws marks plantar glands that give off a distinctive odor.

5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans can gather them en masse. Up to half a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E

Those potentially synthetic diamonds require more investigation in a specialized lab. Examples of commercial screening devices are D-Screen (WTOCD / HRD Antwerp) and Alpha Diamond Analyzer (Bruker / HRD Antwerp).|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man {{plutonium}} bombs used explosive {{compression of}} plutonium to obtain significantly higher densities than normal, {{combined with a}} central neutron source to begin the reaction and increase efficiency. Thus only 6.2kg of plutonium was needed for an explosive yield equivalent to 20 kilotons of TNT. Hypothetically, as little as 4kg of plutonium—and maybe even less—could be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> single atomic bomb using very sophisticated assembly designs.|$|E

5|$|Important {{information}} could be gained regarding {{the properties of}} superheavy nuclei by the synthesis of more livermorium isotopes, specifically those with a few neutrons {{more or less than}} the known ones – 286Lv, 287Lv, 288Lv, 289Lv, 294Lv, and 295Lv. This is possible because there are many reasonably long-lived isotopes of curium that can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> target. The light isotopes can be made by fusing curium-243 with calcium-48. They would undergo a chain of alpha decays, ending at transactinide isotopes that are too light to achieve by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion.|$|E
5|$|Tzfat cheese, a {{white cheese}} in brine, similar to feta, was first {{produced}} by the Meiri dairy in Safed in 1837 and is still produced there by descendants of the original cheese makers. The Meiri dairy also became famous for its production of the Balkan-style brinza cheese, which became known as Bulgarian cheese due to its popularity in the early 1950s among Jewish immigrants from Bulgaria. Other dairies now also produce many varieties of these cheeses. Bulgarian yogurt, introduced to Israel by Bulgarian Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> traditional yogurt and cucumber soup.|$|E
5|$|At Kelmscott Press the {{perfection}} of book-making was under his constant supervision and practical assistance. It was his ambition to produce a perfect work to restore all the beauty of illuminated lettering, richness of gilding and grace of binding that <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> volume the treasure of a king. His efforts were constantly directed towards giving the world at least one book that exceeded anything that had ever appeared. Morris designed his type after {{the best examples of}} early printers, what he called his “golden type” which he copied after Jenson, Parautz, Coburger and others. With this in mind, Morris took equal care on the choice of his paper which he adapted to his subject with the same care that governed his selection of material for binding. As a result, few but only the wealthy could purchase his lavish works, mainly due to how intrinsic his work was. However, he realized that creating works in the manner of the middle ages was difficult in a profit-grinding society.|$|E

5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here {{the focus is on}} the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.|$|E
5|$|Deoxyribozymes, {{also called}} DNAzymes or {{catalytic}} DNA, are first discovered in 1994. They are mostly single stranded DNA sequences isolated {{from a large}} pool of random DNA sequences through a combinatorial approach called in vitro selection or systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). DNAzymes catalyze variety of chemical reactions including RNA-DNA cleavage, RNA-DNA ligation, amino acids phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, carbon-carbon bond formation, and etc. DNAzymes can enhance catalytic rate of chemical reactions up to 100,000,000,000-fold over the uncatalyzed reaction. The most extensively studied class of DNAzymes is RNA-cleaving types which {{have been used to}} detect different metal ions and designing therapeutic agents. Several metal-specific DNAzymes have been reported including the GR-5 DNAzyme (lead-specific), the CA1-3 DNAzymes (copper-specific), the 39E DNAzyme (uranyl-specific) and the NaA43 DNAzyme (sodium-specific). The NaA43 DNAzyme, which is reported to be more than 10,000-fold selective for sodium over other metal ions, was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> real-time sodium sensor in living cells.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century, Tycho Brahe {{measured}} the diurnal parallax of Mars that Johannes Kepler <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> preliminary {{calculation of the}} relative distance to the planet. When the telescope became available, the diurnal parallax of Mars was again measured {{in an effort to}} determine the Sun-Earth distance. This was first performed by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1672. The early parallax measurements were hampered by the quality of the instruments. The only occultation of Mars by Venus observed was that of October 13, 1590, seen by Michael Maestlin at Heidelberg. In 1610, Mars was viewed by Galileo Galilei, who was first to see it via telescope. The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed any terrain features was the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens.|$|E

5|$|The {{game has}} been likened to both Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid {{due to the}} 3D {{platforming}} and stealth gameplay respectively. Players guide the forest inhabitants through 20 levels, during which they must infiltrate a series of suburban homes in order to steal a variety of items and destroy construction materials. The items needed to lure endangered animals to the forest must be collected from houses and carried back to the forest one at a time. Each level requires several trips to be completed. Security systems must be avoided or deactivated in order to progress through each level. Household members and their pets must also be avoided, distracted or stunned by a thrown object. For example, a phone card can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> prank call to lure a householder away, catnip {{can be used to}} distract cats.|$|E
5|$|The song {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, who praised Lee's vocals and its piano accompaniment, with some highlighting {{it as one}} of the album's best tracks. Following the digital sales of Evanescence, the song charted at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine on the UK Rock Chart. It also charted at numbers 31, 89, and 174 on the Swiss Singles Chart, Canadian Hot 100, and UK Singles Chart respectively. The band also added the song to the set list of their third worldwide tour Evanescence Tour (2011–12). After their performances at the Carnival of Madness tour, live footage of their performances were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> music video for the song. The song's live performance was received positively as well; one critic noted the song's building heaviness as the band became more involved.|$|E
5|$|After {{the birth}} of their son, Johnny's wife Sarah falls into a coma. Johnny soon discovers her talisman, which she had {{previously}} <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> deal with a demon {{to save the life of}} her sister Rachel, unbeknownst to Johnny. In order to save Sarah, Johnny also makes a deal with the demon, and is transported back to 1995, where he possesses the body of his younger self. He meets a younger Sarah, who invites him to a party. As they travel to the party, Johnny informs Sarah of the situation, but she dismisses it as a pick-up attempt. When they arrive, Johnny sees Rachel with the talisman and tells her to dispose of it; without responding, she ends the party. After she leaves, Rachel is involved in a car accident, and is transported to the hospital. Sarah, who now believes Johnny's story, goes to make a deal with the demon in order to save Rachel. However, upon discovering that the demon demands the sacrifice of Johnny and Sarah's child, Sarah destroys the talisman, and Rachel dies. These events alter those of the present day: Sarah never fell into a coma and instead lives normally with Johnny and their son.|$|E

5|$|Liquid {{crystals}} find wide use {{in liquid}} crystal displays, which {{rely on the}} optical properties of certain liquid crystalline substances in {{the presence or absence}} of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 μm thick) sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see Twisted nematic field effect). This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.|$|E
5|$|The museum's Film and Video Archive {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} film {{archives}} in the world. The archive preserves a range of historically significant film and video material, including the official British film record of the First World War. Notable among the archive's First World War holdings is The Battle of the Somme, a pioneering 1916 documentary film (which was inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World register in 2005), and Der Magische Gürtel, a German 1917 propaganda film about the submarine U-35. The archive's Second World War holdings include unedited film shot by British military cameramen, which document combat actions such as the British landings on D-Day in June 1944, and the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945. The archive also holds government information films and propaganda features such as Target for Tonight and Desert Victory. The archive's post-Second World War collections include material from the Korean War, Cold War material, the former film library of NATO, and material produced by the United Nations UNTV service in Bosnia. As an official repository under the 1958 Public Records Act, the archive continues to receive material from the Ministry of Defence. The archive also seeks to acquire amateur film taken by both service personnel and civilian cameramen. Material from the collection was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> number of well-known TV documentary series including The Great War and The World at War. In 2012 the museum reported the size of its film archive as being in excess of 23,000 hours of film, video and digital footage.|$|E
