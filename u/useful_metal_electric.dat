50|$|Of the p-block metals, several have {{fascinating}} properties. Gallium, in the 3rd row of column 13, is a {{metal that}} can melt {{in the palm}} of a hand. Tin, in the fourth row of column 14, is an abundant, flexible, and extremely <b>useful</b> <b>metal.</b> It is an important component of many metal alloys like bronze, solder, and pewter.|$|R
50|$|Ore {{concentrate}}, {{dressed ore}} or simply concentrate {{is the product}} generally produced by metal ore mines. The raw ore is usually ground finely in various comminution operations and gangue (waste) is removed, thus concentrating the metal component. The concentrate is then transported to various physical or chemical processes called hydrometallurgy, pyrometallurgy smelters, and electrometallurgy where {{it is used to}} produce <b>useful</b> <b>metals.</b>|$|R

50|$|The tin-plating {{process is}} used {{extensively}} to protect both ferrous and nonferrous surfaces. Tin is a <b>useful</b> <b>metal</b> {{for the food}} processing industry since it is non-toxic, ductile and corrosion resistant. The excellent ductility of tin allows a tin coated base metal sheet to be formed {{into a variety of}} shapes without damage to the surface tin layer. It provides sacrificial protection for copper, nickel and other non-ferrous metals, but not for steel.|$|R
25|$|Egypt's {{expanding}} {{interests in}} trade goods such as ebony, incense such as myrrh and frankincense, gold, copper and other <b>useful</b> <b>metals</b> compelled the ancient Egyptians {{to navigate the}} open seas. Evidence from the pyramid of Sahure, second king of the dynasty, shows that a regular trade existed with the Syrian coast to procure cedar wood. Pharaohs also launched expeditions to the famed Land of Punt, possibly the Horn of Africa, for ebony, ivory and aromatic resins.|$|R
50|$|Leaching is {{extensively}} used {{in metal}} processing industries. The <b>useful</b> <b>metal</b> may occur in mixtures with very {{large amounts of}} undesirable constituents, and leaching is used to remove the metals as soluble salts. The use of acids is prevalent in the metal processing industry. Sulfates are normally used to remove metals from the solid phase. These processes result in harmful sulfate-rich environmental byproducts. Because acids solubilize metals, large-scale release of heavy-metal-rich acidic mine drainage (AMD) can thereby occur.|$|R
50|$|The {{first record}} of {{sightings}} of {{small groups of}} Romani within the area of present-day Slovakia are from 1322 AD, when the region {{was part of the}} Kingdom of Hungary. Major waves of Romani nomads were recorded from 1417 onwards. In 1423 they received a decree from the Hungarian king Sigismund of Luxemburg at Szepes Castle, granting them Europe-wide right of passage and the right to settle. They proved to be <b>useful</b> <b>metal</b> workers for the royal armies fighting the Turks.|$|R

50|$|As a flamenco player Haddad {{is noted}} for his rich chord voicings, {{with a clear}} Moorish and Arabic influence. He {{frequently}} uses sophisticated jazz chords and innovative extended voicings for major and minor chords, and often creates a mysterious and atmospheric Moorish ambiance to his compositions through a lush tapestry of flat ninth, minor major seventh and augmented chords. Additionally he often uses slash chords, gripping the bass string. His picados are typically heavily executed and crisp-sounding, and his rasqueados are cascading and dynamic. He is also an adept player of rock music and <b>metal</b> <b>electric</b> guitar and embraces {{a wide range of}} styles.|$|R
5|$|Tantalum is inert against most acids except {{hydrofluoric}} acid and hot sulfuric acid, and hot alkaline solutions also cause tantalum to corrode. This property {{makes it a}} <b>useful</b> <b>metal</b> for chemical reaction vessels and pipes for corrosive liquids. Heat exchanging coils for the steam heating of hydrochloric acid are made from tantalum. Tantalum was extensively used {{in the production of}} ultra high frequency electron tubes for radio transmitters. The tantalum is capable of capturing oxygen and nitrogen by forming nitrides and oxides and therefore helps to sustain the high vacuum needed for the tubes.|$|R

50|$|Egypt's {{expanding}} {{interests in}} trade goods such as ebony, incense such as myrrh and frankincense, gold, copper and other <b>useful</b> <b>metals</b> inspired the ancient Egyptians to build suitable ships for navigation {{of the open}} sea. They traded with Lebanon for cedar and travelled {{the length of the}} Red Sea to the Kingdom of Punt—possibly modern day Somalia—for ebony, ivory and aromatic resins. Ship builders of that era did not use pegs (treenails) or metal fasteners, but relied on rope to keep their ships assembled. Planks and the superstructure were tightly tied and bound together.|$|R
