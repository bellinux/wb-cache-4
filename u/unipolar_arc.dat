Our analysis shows that the augmentation of surface roughness increases the electric field at the vicinity of the wedge-type tips, thus enabling the formation of electric arcs. Specifically, under reactor conditions, the breakdown of the sheath potential may trigger <b>unipolar</b> <b>arcs</b> that will strongly contaminate the plasma with the resulting tungsten ions.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn investigation, experimental and theoretical, into the breakdown mechanisms and associated minimum power levels {{required for the}} breakdown and unipolar arcing was conducted for AISI 304 stainless steel and Type 2024 aluminum. The experiment was conducted using a neodymium-glass Q-switched laser.

Despite {{years of research}} on electrical breakdown of fast pulsed high vacuum diodes, the mechanisms of the process are far from being fully discovered. It {{is well known that}} electrical breakdown with plasma formation on the electrode surfaces, but there is disagreement on how this occurs. The most widely accepted model, the Explosive Electron Emission model predicts plasma formation on the cathode by means of ohmic heating caused by a field emitted current. Anode plasma formation under this model is explained as due to energy deposition by fast electrons. A new model proposes that adsorbed neutral molecules on the electrode surfaces {{play a key role in}} developing the conditions where <b>unipolar</b> <b>arcs</b> cause plasma formation on both electrodes. In this work, simultaneous measurements of the light produced at the electrodes shows that plasma is produced on the anode in less than 2 nanoseconds after it is produced at the cathode. These findings support the new model. Captain, United States Arm...|$|R

40|$|We are {{developing}} a model of vacuum arcs. This model assumes that arcs develop {{as a result of}} mechanical failure of the surface due to Coulomb explosions, followed by ionization of fragments by field emission {{and the development of a}} small, dense plasma that interacts with the surface primarily through self sputtering and terminates as a <b>unipolar</b> <b>arc</b> capable of producing breakdown sites with high enhancement factors. We have attempted to produce a self consistent picture of triggering, arc evolution and surface damage. We are modeling these mechanisms using Molecular Dynamics (mechanical failure, Coulomb explosions, self sputtering), Particle-In-Cell (PIC) codes (plasma evolution), mesoscale surface thermodynamics (surface evolution), and finite element electrostatic modeling (field enhancements).

40|$|We {{present a}} time-resolved imaging and {{electrical}} study of an atmospheric pressure spark discharge. The {{conditions of the}} present study are those used for nanoparticle generation in spark discharge generator setups. The oscillatory bipolar spark discharge was generated between two identical Cu electrodes in different configurations (cylindrical flat-end or tipped-end geometries, electrode gap from 0. 5 to 4 [*]mm), in a controlled co-axial N 2 flow, and was supplied by a high voltage capacitor. Imaging data with nanosecond time resolution were collected using an intensified CCD camera. This data were used to study the time evolution of plasma morphology, total light emission intensity, and the rate of plasma expansion. High voltage and high current probes were employed to collect electrical data about the discharge. The electrical data recorded allowed, among others, the calculation of the equivalent resistance and inductance of the circuit, estimations for the energy dissipated in the spark gap. By combining imaging and electrical data, observations could be made about the correlation of the evolution of total emitted light and the dissipated power. It was also observed that the distribution of light emission of the plasma in the spark gap is uneven, as it exhibits a “hot spot” with an oscillating position in the axial direction, in correlation with the high voltage waveform. The initial expansion rate of the cylindrical plasma front was found to be supersonic; thus, the discharge releases a strong shockwave. Finally, the results on equivalent resistance and channel expansion are comparable to those of <b>unipolar</b> <b>arcs.</b> This shows the spark discharge has a similar behavior to the arc regime during the conductive phase and until the current oscillations stop...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Electrical breakdown in high voltage diodes {{has been studied}} since the 1920 s, yet {{it is still not}} well understood. This study characterizes the electron flow during breakdown in a high voltage vacuum diode. This was accomplished by measuring the x rays produced when electrons strike the anode of the diode. Current measurements taken during the experiment include both the displacement and conduction electron current, so the x-ray signal is the best measure of the conduction current. Knowledge of the electron flow is important in determining the mechanism of breakdown. The currently accepted explosive electron emission (EEE) model for electrical breakdown can not properly account for the energy required to form cathode spots. Schwirzke proposed a new model that involves an ionization process and a subsequent <b>unipolar</b> <b>arc</b> that accounts for the energy to form the spots. Electron flow for the two models is very different. The EEE model requires a large current density for several nanoseconds before plasma formation, whereas the new model predicts a large current density that develops simultaneously with the plasma formation. The results of thus experiment support the predictions of the new model. Captain, United States Arm...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{breakdown in}} 805 MHz rf accelerator cavities {{in terms of}} a number of self consistent mechanisms. We divide the breakdown process into three stages: 1) we model surface failure using molecular dynamics of fracture caused by electrostatic tensile stress, 2) we model the ionization of neutrals responsible for plasma initiation and plasma growth using a particle in cell code, and 3) we model surface damage by assuming a process similar to unipolar arcing. We find that the cold, dense plasma in contact with the surface produces very small Debye lengths and very high electric fields over a large area, consistent with <b>unipolar</b> <b>arc</b> behavior, although unipolar arcs are strictly defined with equipotential boundaries. These high fields produce strong erosion mechanisms, primarily self sputtering, compatible with the crater formation that we see. We use OOPIC modeling to estimate very high surface electric fields in the dense plasma and measure these field using electrohydrodynamic arguments to relate the dimensions of surface damage with the applied electric field. We also present a geometrical explanation of the large enhancement factors of field emitters. This is consistent with the apparent absence of whiskers on surfaces exposed to high fields. The enhancement factors we derive, when combined with the Fowler-Nordheim analysis produce a consistent picture of breakdown and field emission from surfaces at local fields of 7 - 10 GV/m. We show that the plasma growth rates we obtain from OOPIC are consistent with growth rates of the cavity shorting currents using x ray measurements. We believe the general picture presented here for rf breakdown arcs should be directly applicable to a larger class of vacuum arcs. Results from the plasma simulation are included as a guide to experimental verification of this model. Comment: 21 pages, 21 figure...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA 4. 55 microsecond, 15 joule pulsed CO 2 laser {{was used to}} illuminate a copper target. Bulk plasma {{was found to be}} emitted normally to the target surface independent of the laser angle of incidence over the range of 45 degrees +/- 15 degrees. Material ejected from a copper target was allowed to deposit onto polished type 304 stainless steel surfaces. The ejected material deposited in concentric 'rings' many places. The mechanism for this is unknown. Polished type 304 stainless steel surfaces were coated with one to ten micron copper films and shot with the laser. Damage to the films indicate that the damage mechanism may simply be Joule heating from the arc current. This lead to a procedure for calculating that arc current. The arc lifetime is necessary but still unknown. No correlation was found between unipolar are pit diameter and depth. Investigations into the role of surface tension on the dynamics of the molten surface lead to a comparison between <b>unipolar</b> arcing and <b>arc</b> welding. Much of the physics known about arc welding is qualitatively applied to describe the surface dynamics of molten metal produced by unipolar arcing. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
