5|$|Although {{water is}} vital for life, the {{structure}} of this water in the cytosol is not well <b>understood,</b> mostly because methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy only give information on the average structure of water, and cannot measure local variations at the microscopic scale. Even the structure of pure water is poorly <b>understood,</b> due {{to the ability of}} water to form structures such as water clusters through hydrogen bonds.|$|E

5|$|A droving dog was needed, but {{the colonial}} working dogs are <b>understood</b> {{to have been}} of the Old English Sheepdog type, {{commonly}} referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently <b>understood.</b> In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.|$|E

5|$|Ecological {{studies are}} {{necessarily}} holistic {{as opposed to}} reductionistic. Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is <b>understood</b> about the causal relations {{without reference to the}} whole system, which leads to 3) a metaphysical hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are <b>understood</b> without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from mysticism that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be <b>understood</b> through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the biomolecular properties of the exterior shells.|$|E
