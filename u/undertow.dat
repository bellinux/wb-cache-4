5|$|Diver Rodney Joyce from Scarborough, Ontario, aged 18, {{drowned in}} a slow {{whirlpool}} effect in the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. Joyce had been swimming for ten minutes, when he went closer to the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother Gregory, aged 20, rushed to help him, but was pulled under several times. Resuscitation efforts by security staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's director of engineering denied {{the existence of an}} <b>undertow.</b> A nearby life ring had been tied to a tree using three knots and was only equipped with 6 metres (20feet) of rope, not enough to reach the middle of the pool. One high diver, who had worked at the park for seven years, claims to have told his supervisor of the <b>undertow</b> during the previous season. That diver was concerned about landing someone, as he claimed unauthorized swimmers were a frequent occurrence at that time. The area was listed as barricaded in an early report, but later reports contradicted that. The witness claimed that there were 30 to 40 bathers at one time. The park's director of safety and security said he was never informed of the <b>undertow,</b> and only saw bathers in the pool on one occasion. Not only was there no statement about pool dangers on record, but the supervisor for the previous three years denied that anyone in their department had expressed concern. Security and extra signs were posted after the incident. Spokespeople pointed out that Joyce shouldn't have been throwing frisbees in the area and suggested that the witness shouldn't have continued to work for the park in the previous season if they had an unaddressed concern.|$|E
5|$|Ender's Game: Battle Room was {{a planned}} {{digitally}} distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games <b>Undertow</b> and Shadow Complex. Chair had sold the licensing of Empire to Card, {{which became a}} best-selling novel. Little was revealed about the game, save its setting in the Ender universe {{and that it would}} have focused on the Battle Room.|$|E
5|$|Hatchlings {{can lose}} up to 20% {{of their body}} mass due to {{evaporation}} of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the <b>undertow</b> to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, magnetite, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the Earth's magnetic field, for navigation.|$|E

25|$|Safe {{swimming}} {{is possible}} {{on the northern}} beaches, such as Emu Bay, Stokes Bay or Snellings Beach, and at Island Beach on the Dudley Peninsula. The south coast has dangerous <b>undertows</b> and is more suitable for stronger and experienced swimmers only.|$|R
5|$|Jones is {{responsible}} for most of the band's artwork concepts. Their album <b>Undertow</b> features a ribcage sculpture by Jones on its cover and photos contributed by the band members. Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: Ænima and Salival featured works by Cam de Leon; Lateralus and 10,000 Days were created with the help of Alex Grey. The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the Associated Press attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.|$|E
5|$|The band {{emerged with}} a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, <b>Undertow</b> (1993), and later became a {{dominant}} act in the alternative metal movement, {{with the release of}} their second album, Ænima in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution continued, with Lateralus (2001) and the most recent album, 10,000 Days (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim, and commercial success around the world.|$|E
5|$|High waves caused beach erosion northward through Virginia. At Virginia Beach, {{the waves}} led to minor {{flooding}} along the Sandbridge section; rough surf {{and a strong}} <b>undertow</b> drowned one swimmer there. The storm triggered statewide power outages that affected about 5,000residents, {{as well as the}} Hampton Roads Bridge–Tunnel. In Newport News, lightning set a roof on fire in the Lee Hall section of the city. Emily's light rains in the area were not enough to break a prolonged drought that plagued Virginia. Rough seas and high tides later caused coastal flooding along Fire Island in New York.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} water sport {{care must be}} taken to {{participate}} safely in this sport. Much surf fishing is done in rough whitewater surf conditions. Powerful waves and strong <b>undertows</b> can cause serious injury or death if proper attention is not paid to safety.|$|R

5|$|Tool {{was founded}} in 1988 by vocalist Maynard James Keenan and guitarist Adam Jones, who then {{recruited}} drummer Danny Carey and bassist Paul D'Amour. They initially released a demo EP in 1991 called 72826. Although demos are typically intended only for record labels, the band was so pleased with theirs that they sold copies to their fans. Tool signed to Zoo Entertainment just three months into their career, and released their first studio EP, Opiate, in March 1992. After touring to positive reviews, they released their first full-length album, <b>Undertow,</b> in April 1993. The album was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2001.|$|E
5|$|In Tampico, {{near the}} {{location}} of the storm's second landfall, the streets were littered with fallen trees branches, utility poles, and billboards. Additionally, many roads were inundated with water, leaving some impassable. Nearby, over 700people fled their homes for shelter due to flooding in Ciudad Madero. One death occurred in Pueblo Viejo when a woman was crushed by a tree that fell on her house. Six other deaths occurred in Veracruz, five from a ship capsizing near Boca del Río and another after a person was caught in an <b>undertow</b> offshore Úrsulo Galván. Two landslides in northern Puebla left roads impassable, isolating some communities such as Tlatlauquitepec. Hundreds of homes were destroyed leaving 35,000people homeless and there was severe damage in Tuxpan, Tamiahua, Pueblo Viejo, Platon, Pánuco, Tampico Alto, and elsewhere along the coast of northeast Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The docks {{maintenance}} {{facility was}} established {{on the land}} exposed by the damming of the river to construct the harbour and remains sited at this location to the present day. William Jessop had created a weir in the dam at Underfall to allow surplus water to flow back into the New Cut, this {{was known as the}} 'Overfall'. By the 1830s, the Floating Harbour was suffering from severe silting. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was, however, able to devise a solution to this problem. In place of the Overfall he advised better use of three shallow sluices and one deep scouring sluice between the harbour and the New Cut, together with a dredging vessel. This drag boat would scrape the silt away from the quay walls. When the deep sluice opened at low tide, a powerful <b>undertow</b> sucked the silt into the river to be carried away on the next tide. The shallow sluices enabled adjustment of the dock water level according to weather conditions.|$|E
50|$|Despite these reports, Kaena Point {{does not}} have the {{popularity}} with surfers of other North Shore locations. Kaena Point is located in a remote area with no direct paved road access and no rescue capabilities. Additionally, the point's geography results in <b>undertows,</b> dangerous rip currents and other hazardous ocean conditions that make any water activity highly dangerous.|$|R
50|$|The outlet of the Avon Heathcote Estuary at {{the western}} end of the beach, near another large {{volcanic}} outcrop known as Shag Rock, or Rapanui, forms the Sumner bar off shore of Cave Rock. The Sumner bar presents a major hazard to shipping, while the fast currents, strong rips and <b>undertows</b> in the area can be a danger to swimmers.|$|R

50|$|There {{are many}} {{beautiful}} beaches within a 15-minute drive of Todos Santos. However, {{some of the}} area’s beaches, with rip tides, <b>undertows,</b> and fairly steep drop offs that are close to shore, are not considered safe for swimming. Playa Las Palmas and Playa Los Cerritos are great beaches for swimming and shell collecting. San Pedrito Point, Los Cerritos and other local surf breaks attract surfers from around the world. There are many accommodations both at San Pedrito and at Cerritos beach.|$|R
50|$|The beach {{portion of}} Sandpoint lies {{to the west}} of the totem pole, and is marked off from the {{shipping}} channel by floating markers. Swimming beyond this area is dangerous, as it is located very near a shipping channel and the currents and <b>undertows</b> that lie beyond the buoys are very strong. Stop 26 Beach is a grassier area that lies to the east and is unprotected. While Sandpoint Beach has lifeguards on hand, Stop 26 is generally unmanned, with signs in place cautioning people of the strong currents in the Detroit River and Lake Saint Clair.|$|R

[...] SlowdiveMusic Blog called the album [...] "a journey through grandiose soundscapes, overwhelming <b>undertows,</b> and brilliant craftsmanship", declaring it [...] "the dreampop/shoegaze monument of the year".|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} paths {{defined by the}} authors who have participated in this book—all paths that lead towards the same sea. These waters are turbulent, moved by {{continuous}} currents, tides, and <b>undertows.</b> This is the sea of countless possibilities and endless forms that subjectivity can take on in different contexts of disease and care. Through their descriptions, the authors reflect on and discuss {{the importance of the}} construction of subjectivity within the system of relationships of healthcare that makes possible its emergence. Subjectivity is not just considered as an entity that a priori characterizes a person, but as a singular and original process that develops over time through the experiences with one’s own body, with others, and with the world...|$|R
50|$|Swimming is also {{popular in}} the middle reaches {{throughout}} winter, particularly around Warrandyte, however, {{it should be noted}} that around this area there are submerged mining shafts which can cause <b>undertows</b> that suck swimmers under the surface and into these shafts. In the period 2004-08, 3 people died in this manner in Warrandyte alone. Swimming is safer downstream, but not advisable below Dights Falls due to the high levels of pollution and high boating traffic. The Yarra River once held the world's largest swimming event, the Race to Prince's Bridge. The 3 Mile course ran in the lower reaches, from Twickenham Ferry (now MacRobertson Bridge) to Princes Bridge. The race often attracted greater than 500 competitors and large numbers of onlookers seeking to experience the spectacle.|$|R
25|$|As {{pointed out}} by Michael E. McIntyre, the mean {{horizontal}} mass transport will be (near) zero for a wave group approaching into still water, with also in deep water the mass transport caused by the waves balanced by an opposite mass transport in a return flow (<b>undertow).</b> This {{is due to the}} fact that a large mean force will be needed to accelerate the body of water into which the wave group is propagating.|$|E
25|$|However, for waves {{perpendicular}} to a coast line or in closed laboratory wave channel, the second definition (S2) is more appropriate. These wave systems have zero mass flux and momentum {{when using the}} second definition. In contrast, according to Stokes' first definition (S1), there is a wave-induced mass flux in the wave propagation direction, which has to be balanced by a mean flow U {{in the opposite direction}} – called the <b>undertow.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Mooring under a cliff to a buoy or by anchor, {{the ship}} would receive cargo down an apron chute or, later a wire chute. It usually took {{two days to}} load. All these ports were full of rocks both hidden and exposed. There were <b>undertows</b> and cross-rip {{currents}} and continual changing sandbars. The dog-hole operators obtained franchises to build and manage the chutes. When a ship entered a port, it moored to a buoy (often a log anchored to the bottom) and would be warped or winched into position for loading. A ship’s boat, crewed by three seamen and the second mate, carried the eight inch mooring lines to the buoy. The gravity chutes were troughs allowing cargo to be sent down a cliff to a ship. Besides bagged goods, the chutes were used to load other cargo, such as live hogs.|$|R
