25|$|As is {{well known}} in bicycle racing, the countersteering becomes evident when there is an {{obstacle}} preventing the wheel from countersteering (e.g., when closely overlapping wheels or riding very close to a curb).

25|$|The energy {{transferred}} from {{collapse of the}} core to rebounding material not only generates heavy elements, but provides for their acceleration well beyond escape velocity, thus causing a Type Ib, Type Ic, or Type II supernova.

25|$|Both in vivo {{study and}} {{modelling}} are necessary tools {{to understand this}} complex process. Vascular remodelling is pertinent to wound healing and proper integration of tissue grafts and organ donations. Promoting an active remodelling process in some cases could help patients recover faster and retain functional use of donated tissues. However, outside of wound healing, chronic vascular remodelling in the adult is often symptomatic of cardiovascular disease. Thus, increased <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> biomedical phenomenon could aid {{in the development of}} therapeutics or preventative measures to combat diseases such as atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|According to the Buddha {{the path}} to liberation is one of {{progressively}} coming out of delusion (Pali: Moha). This path is therefore regarded as a path of awakening. Progressing along {{the path to}}wards Nirvana one gains insight into {{the true nature of}} things. A Buddha is one who has attained liberation and an understanding of the causal mechanism by means of which sentient beings come into existence. This mechanism is called pratitya samutpada or dependent origination. The knowledge or <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is called bodhi.|$|E
25|$|These {{explanations}} {{come from}} the ambiguous {{meaning of the word}} 'week' in Hebrew, which means 'a heptad', or a group of seven. The Hebrew word for 'week' is used to refer to periods of seven days as well as seven years. The <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> number as referring to 490 years can also be found in Seder Olam. Christians also interpreted these verses as years and connect them to Jesus, although Rashi's interpretation is such that it upholds the tradition that the anointed one in question is the Persian king Cyrus.|$|E
50|$|The {{debate on}} the issue of {{modularity}} in language is underpinned, in part, by different <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> concept. There is, however, some consensus in the literature that a module is considered committed to processing specialized representations (domain-specificity) (Bryson and Stein, 2001) in an informationally encapsulated way. A distinction should be drawn between anatomical modularity, which proposes there is one 'area' in the brain that deals with this processing, and functional modularity that obviates anatomical modularity whilst maintaining information encapsulation in distributed parts of the brain.|$|R

25|$|As Erakat depicts {{in these}} anecdotes, the conflations and misconceptions of the west, {{that are a}} product of lack of {{representation}} {{of the reality of}} Arab women’s lives and experiences, as well as biased perspectives of what their cultural expressions actually mean, lead to problematic conclusions for many westerners. It is easy to draw the conclusions that some of Erakat’s peers drew in these stories she tells, because they lack the insight into how the occupation of the Palestinian territories actually impacts the daily lives of women living in these areas.

25|$|The {{principle}} of revolutionism {{went beyond the}} recognition of the reforms made during Atatürk's lifetime.

The current <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> concept can be described that active modification. Turkey and its society, taking over institutions from Western Europe, must add Turkish traits and patterns to them and adapt them to the Turkish culture, according to Kemalism. The making of the Turkish traits and patterns of these reforms takes generations of cultural and social experience (which results in the collective memory of the Turkish nation).|$|E
