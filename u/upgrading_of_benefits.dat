The category [...] "current transfers" [...] nearly tripled its share of GDP between 1973 and 1990, from under 5 percent to 13.4 percent, reflecting the explosive growth of the social security system, both with respect to the number of persons covered and the <b>upgrading</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> Escalating interest payments on the public debt, from less than half a percent of GDP in 1973 to 8.2 percent of GDP in 1990, were the result of both a rise in the debt itself and higher real effective interest rates.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether the New Cooperative Medical Insurance Scheme (NCMS) is associated with decreased levels of catastrophic health expenditure and reduced impoverishment due to medical expenses in rural households of China. Methods: An analysis of a national representative sample of 38, 945 rural households (129, 635 people) from the 2008 National Health Service Survey was performed. Logistic regression models used binary indicator of catastrophic health expenditure as dependent variable, with household consumption, demographic characteristics, health insurance schemes, and chronic illness as independent variables. Results: Higher percentage of households experiencing catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment correlates to increased health care need. While the higher socio-economic status households had similar levels of catastrophic health expenditure {{as compared with the}} lowest. Households covered by the NCMS had similar levels of catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment as those without health insurance. Conclusion: Despite over 95 % of coverage, the NCMS has failed to prevent catastrophic health expenditure and medical impoverishment. An <b>upgrade</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefit</b> packages is needed, and effective cost control mechanisms on the provider side needs to be considered...|$|R
25|$|A law of 9 June 1975 {{increased}} the number of eligible occupational diseases and extended the duration <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> A law <b>of</b> 3 June 1975 introduced various benefit improvements for pensioners. The multiplying coefficient was raised to 2% and applied to average earnings of the best 3 years in the last 10 years of work, and automatic annual adjustment of minimum pensions to increase of the minimum contractual wage in the industrial sector (with a smaller adjustment made for pensions higher than the minima). A law of 27 December 1975 introduced ad hoc <b>upgrading</b> <b>of</b> cash <b>benefits</b> for certain diseases and of all flat-rate allowances. A law of 14 July 1967 extended family allowances to self-employed farmers, sharecroppers, and tenant farmers.

A law of 16 February 1977 introduced ad hoc <b>upgrading</b> <b>of</b> cash <b>benefits</b> for the agricultural sector. In November 1977, pension linkage to the industrial wage was extended to all other pension schemes not administered by INPS. A law of 16 February 1977 extended family allowances to agricultural part-time workers. A law of 5 August 1978 introduced a ten-year housing plan, with the state making funds available to regions for public housing and subsidies for private housing.

40|$|Electric Energy Storage (EES) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} promising options for reducing the need for costly upgrades in distribution networks in Queensland (QLD). However, It is expected, the full potential for storage for distribution upgrade deferral cannot be fully realized due to high cost of EES. On the other hand, EES used for distribution deferral application can support a variety of complementary storage applications such as energy price arbitrage, time of use (TOU) energy cost reduction, wholesale electricity market ancillary services, and transmission <b>upgrade</b> deferral. Aggregation <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> these complementary storage applications would have the potential for increasing the amount of EES that may be financially attractive to defer distribution network augmentation in QLD. In this context, this paper analyzes distribution upgrade deferral, energy price arbitrage, TOU energy cost reduction, and integrated solar PV-storage <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> EES devices in QLD...|$|R
