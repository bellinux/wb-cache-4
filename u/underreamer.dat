50|$|The <b>underreamer</b> {{utilizes}} {{an increase}} in mud pressure or flow rate to deploy the expandable cutters. A corresponding pressure drop across the tool would indicate that the tool has fully deployed.|$|E
50|$|An <b>underreamer</b> is {{a device}} used {{to enlarge the}} {{borehole}} below an existing casing or restriction, during a well drilling operation.It can be positioned either above the drill bit or above a pilot assembly run inside the existing borehole.|$|E
5000|$|... 3 primary designs {{have been}} {{developed}} over the years. In chronological order :- [...] "Roller-cone" [...] type <b>underreamers,</b> based on roller cone cutters technology, were often plagued by low reliability and limited bottom hole time- [...] "hinge-and-pin" [...] PDC - [...] "block-type" [...] PDC, commonly used today, suitable for reaming-while-drilling operations.|$|R
5000|$|An <b>underreamer</b> is used {{to enlarge}} the well-bore, usually {{beginning}} at some point under the surface. It does this by utilizing expandable cutters that only deploy at the designated time or depth. It {{is not to be}} confused with hole opening which occurs from the surface and in most cases the hole opener tool is of a fixed diameter.|$|E
40|$|In {{the oil and}} gas industry, an <b>underreamer</b> is a tool used {{to extend}} and enlarge the {{diameter}} of a previously-drilled bore. The problem proposed to the Study Group is to obtain appropriate mathematical models of <b>underreamer</b> dynamics, in forms that will lead to feasible computation. The modes of dynamics of interest are torsional, lateral and axial. This report describes some initial models, two of which are developed in more detail: one for the propagation of torsional waves along the drill string and their reflection from contact points with the well bore; and one for the dynamic coupling between the <b>underreamer</b> and the drill bit during drilling...|$|E
40|$|When {{drilling}} a {{well there}} is a risk of serious damage caused by drillstring vibrations. Shock and vibration are identified as a cause of premature failure on drill bit and components in the bottom hole assembly (BHA), resulting in lost time for operators and costing service companies several millions in repair each year. The expenditures incurred by drillstring vibrations include reduced rate of penetration (ROP), tripping and poor drilling performance. Currently, several tools and techniques are used in the attempt to minimize shock and vibration. For vibration mitigation to be more effective in the future, the most effective tools and techniques must be designated, implemented and improved. The main objectives of this thesis are to give an insight into the main vibration problem and determine effective mitigation tools and techniques, with regards to the BHA design, which can minimize shock and vibration, and improve the drilling performance in the future. A particular focus was given to anti-vibration tools, and vibration prevention in <b>underreamer</b> applications. The thesis is divided into four main parts; theory on drillstring vibrations, evaluation of various tools and techniques for vibration mitigation, including supplier input, a performance analysis of the Anti Stick-slip Technology (AST) and finally a discussion and conclusion part. Several field case studies are presented to illustrate how the tools and techniques can reduce the risk of detrimental vibrations. The work is based on literature reviews and is substantiated by comparative field experiences. Additional information was acquired through conversations with Statoil, the directional drilling suppliers and tool suppliers. These conversations proved highly valuable and resulted in several proposed tools and techniques that should be considered when designing the BHA. The thesis revealed that BHA design awareness can lead to huge advancements in terms of minimizing shock and vibration. Roller reamers should be added to the assembly if high stick-slip levels are expected or if the stabilizers experience extensive friction. Anti-vibration tools, such as AST and Frank´s Harmonic Isolation (HI) tool should be considered, as field experience indicates that these tools can reduce the vibration level. The results of the AST performance analysis indicated a 21 % increase in ROP for runs including the tool. For <b>underreamer</b> operations a great potential exists in placing an expandable stabilizer above the <b>underreamer.</b> Another BHA alteration that should be considered is tapered stabilization, which can lead to fewer twist-offs in large hole sections. In the future, the industry must be willing to make changes in order to minimize shock and vibration. A constant push towards better procedures and innovative technology is needed...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} in the oil business are the cost of operations versus the sizes of the prospect. We are drilling smaller targets and {{over the last few}} years, rig cost, service company rates and materials have gone up significantly in accordance to the oil price. Industry is continuously searching for new technologies to make the drilling of well safer, more efficient and cheaper. This thesis explores the possibilities of combining existing technologies to solve these challenges. Drilling with casing (DwC) is using standard casing as the drillstring, and leaving it in place to case the well. It has almost no limitations and has a potential of saving 20 – 30 % of rig time by eliminating drillstring tripping and also minimizing downhole problems. With expandable technology, expanded casing can provide a larger diameter of the production casing. This can increase the productivity. Since both technologies have the same operational procedure, they could be combined into one operation. The concept is to use expandable casing as drillstring which will be expanded when the target depth is reached. To be able to expand the casing, one needs to drill with an <b>underreamer</b> to obtain a bigger hole and the BHA must be changed from a drilling into an expandable BHA. The conclusion of this thesis is that the drilling with expandable casing concept is possible. However, there are some technology challenges, especially on tools and on the strength of post expansion material. Limitations on drilling parameters such as: dog leg severity, RPM, mud properties etc also need to be considered to achieve a good expansion result. The case example analyzed, indicates that we can save almost 23 % of the operation time by running this combined technology. Expenses can be reduced through lowered rig costs and the operational risk can be mitigated. A better understanding of the technology and operational procedures will help to further reduce the risks and make the technology more acceptable. If this new method succeeds, there will have a high potential for cost savings, higher production and better well control...|$|E
40|$|Drilling with casing and liner are {{unconventional}} drilling methods {{developed to}} reduce both the non-productive {{time spent on}} drilling operations and drilling time in general. A casing or liner string is used as the drillstring, {{and the number of}} operations is therefore reduced from two to one as drilling and casing of the wellbore are performed in one operation. Even though there are many benefits with this drilling method, there are also some drawbacks and operational considerations. Statoil and Baker Hughes have developed a rotary steerable liner drilling system, called the Steerable Drilling Liner (SDL). Two offshore test wells have been drilled with this system, and Statoil is now planning to utilize it on more wells in the North Sea. The Oseberg field is a candidate field for liner drilling due to stability problems in the Draupne and Ness formations. Two wells on the Oseberg field have therefore been chosen as the candidate wells for this thesis. The case histories of the test wells show that the limitation may be the low flow rate circulated through the liner, which may cause cuttings accumulation on top of the liner where the flow area suddenly expands. A flow diverter is therefore developed to have more flexibility in the choice of flow rate above the liner. The flow diverter and other solutions to improve the hole cleaning have been evaluated in this thesis. The high annular circulating pressure is another issue with the liner drilling technique. Many of the factors which improve hole cleaning also increase the annular pressure. The ECD must also be taken into consideration when optimizing the hole cleaning of the candidate wells. The simulations of hole cleaning and annular circulating pressure for the SDL system have been performed in WellPlan. The recommended flow rate for hole cleaning in the sections above the liner is at least 500 lpm higher than the maximum possible flow rate through the liner. By circulating this recommended rate through the liner, the equivalent circulating density increases. The circulating pressure exceeds the fracture pressure of the formation for the 7 ” SDL system. It is therefore not an alternative to come up with solutions to be able to circulate with a higher flow rate through the SDL system. A flow diverter above the liner is the best solution to increase the flow rate in the critical part of the well. With the flow diverter above the liner, the flow rate can be increased to the minimum required rate for hole cleaning {{and at the same time}} keep the equivalent circulating density at an acceptable level. The increased flow rate above the flow diverter will have minimal effect on the annular circulating pressure below the previous casing shoe. The simulations also showed that this minimum rate can be significantly reduced by changing the drilling fluid parameters. If the flow rate is kept constant, the bed height of cuttings can be reduced by optimizing the fluid parameters. Optimization of the drilling fluid is also important to make sure the cleaning in the annulus outside the liner is good. The required rate could be reduced further by increasing the rotation of the string and increasing the size of the drillpipe above the liner, and these solutions have been evaluated. Future work should include the development of a simulation program that can include all the downhole tools and components required for the Steerable Drilling Liner system, including two flow split components. The simulation program should also be able to handle the combination of a pilot bottom hole assembly and an <b>underreamer</b> to ream the hole to full size, and then calculate the correct amount of cuttings in the annulus. The drilling fluids should also be optimized to improve the hole cleaning in liner drilling operations further. </p...|$|E
