5|$|Once Allied {{troops were}} on the ground, some German <b>units</b> <b>used</b> the Rommelspargel for defense, by cutting them down and using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions. Sturmmann Karl Vasold of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend described how his unit dug in under fire in a tank trench and foxholes on the road from Buron to Villons-les-Buissons, and used cut-down Rommelspargel poles to cover their positions and protect them from enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|In 1826 commissioners for {{the social}} and {{economic}} improvement of Oldham were established. The town was made part of a parliamentary borough, in 1832, though it was in 1849 when Oldham was incorporated as a municipal borough, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom, and in 1850 the Borough Council obtained the powers of the improvement commissioners. In 1880, parts of the Hollinwood and Crossbank areas of Chadderton and Ashton-under-Lyne townships were added to the Borough of Oldham. Oldham Above Town and Oldham Below Town were, from 1851 until c. 1881, statistical <b>units</b> <b>used</b> for the gathering and organising of civil registration information, and output of census data.|$|E

5|$|Technology {{and science}} in England {{advanced}} considerably during the Middle Ages, driven {{in part by}} the Greek and Islamic thinking that reached England from the 12th century onwards. Many advances were made in scientific ideas, including the introduction of Arabic numerals and a sequence of improvements in the <b>units</b> <b>used</b> for measuring time. Clocks were first built in England in the late 13th century, and the first mechanical clocks were certainly being installed in cathedrals and abbeys by the 1320s. Astrology, magic and palm reading were also considered important forms of knowledge in medieval England, although some doubted their reliability.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage done}} to Ford was great. The local fire brigades helped put out the {{numerous}} fires and clear up the dead {{in and around the}} station. Mostly foam was used as the main water pipe had burst. Other fire <b>units</b> <b>used</b> water from static water tanks and a ditch which had filled from the fractured pipe. Ford had received less warning than the other targets and suffered heavier casualties: 28 killed and 75 wounded. Some 14 aircraft were destroyed: five Blackburn Sharks, five Fairey Swordfish, and two Fairey Albacore. A further 26 aircraft were damaged but repairable. As well as petrol and oil installations, two hangars, the motor transport hangar, two stores buildings, the ratings' and petty officers' canteens and numerous accommodation buildings were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Under the D-series Tables of Organization (TO) from 1 July 1942, {{the role}} of AT weapons in Marine Corps service was officially {{entrusted}} to 20mm automatic guns, which were in the regimental weapon company (three platoons) and the battalion weapon company (one platoon). In practice, <b>units</b> <b>used</b> the World War I-era 37 mm M1916 for training. They were equipped with the M3 (four in each platoon) before {{being sent to the}} frontline. Additionally, a divisional special weapons battalion was equipped with self-propelled 37 mm GMC M6.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) units had been {{identified}} in AO Surfers, including the regular North Vietnamese 7th Division—consisting of the North Vietnamese 141st and 165th Regiments {{under the command of}} Nguyen the Bon, the Vietcong 5th Division—consisting of Viet Cong 274th and 275th Regiments, and the Dong Nai Regiment. These divisions were believed to have participated in the assault on Saigon and allied intelligence considered it likely they would attempt to withdraw through the Australian area of operations in order to regroup. Other forces included North Vietnamese 85th Regiment as well as the 165th, 233rd, 269th, 275th, D280 and 745th Viet Cong Infiltration Groups and various <b>units</b> <b>used</b> for reconnaissance, guiding, logistics, liaison and other tasks. In total, an estimated strength of 3,000 to 4,000 men. Regardless, despite earlier warnings that they may concentrate up to regimental-strength, a breakdown in the passage of intelligence led the Australians to believe that the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong would remain dispersed in small groups in an attempt to avoid detection. As such the Australians assumed that the communist forces would pose little threat and envisioned patrolling from company harbours to find and ambush them as they withdrew. Meanwhile, due to the risk of heavy ground fire, only a very limited aerial reconnaissance of the new area of operations was undertaken and this later had significant implications.|$|E
