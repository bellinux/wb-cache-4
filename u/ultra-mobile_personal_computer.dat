50|$|An ultra-mobile PC (<b>ultra-mobile</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> or UMPC) was a {{miniature}} {{version of a}} pen computer, a class of laptop whose specifications were launched by Microsoft and Intel in spring 2006. Sony had already made a first attempt in this direction in 2004 with its Vaio U series, which was however only sold in Asia. UMPCs are generally smaller than subnotebooks, have a TFT display measuring (diagonally) about 12.7 to 17.8 cm (5 to 7 inch screen), are operated like tablet PCs using a touchscreen or a stylus, and can also have a physical keyboard. There is no clear boundary between subnotebooks and ultra-mobile PCs.|$|E
30|$|Recently, {{demands of}} {{customers}} for wireless data communications in cellular networks are rapidly increasing as fascinating mobile devices, e.g., smart phone, tablet device, and <b>ultra-mobile</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> (UMPC), and mobile applications, e.g., mobile Internet protocol television (IPTV), high-definition video conference, and voice over IP (VoIP), have been introduced. For example, traffics for wireless data communications have increased by 5000 % {{over the past}} three years in AT&T networks[1]. Moreover, customers expect to be provided with enhanced quality of services since they spend more communication expenses to telecommunications companies for wireless data communications than they do for voice-only services.|$|E
40|$|Hands-free {{control of}} {{unmanned}} ground vehicles {{is essential for}} soldiers, bomb disposal squads, and first responders. Having their hands free for other equipment and tasks allows them to be safer and more mobile. Currently, the most successful hands-free control devices are speech-command based. However, these devices use external microphones, and in field environments, e. g., war zones and fire sites, their performance suffers because of loud ambient noise: typically above 90 dBA. This paper describes the development of technology using the ear as an output source that can provide excellent command recognition accuracy even in noisy environments. Instead of picking up speech radiating from the mouth, this technology detects speech transmitted internally through the ear canal. Discreet tongue movements also create air pressure changes within the ear canal, {{and can be used}} for stealth control. A patented earpiece was developed with a microphone pointed into the ear canal that captures these signals generated by tongue movements and speech. The signals are transmitted from the earpiece to an <b>Ultra-Mobile</b> <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> (UMPC) through a wired connection. The UMPC processes the signals and utilizes them for device control. The processing can include command recognition, ambient noise cancellation, acoustic echo cancellation, and speech equalization. Successful control of an iRobot PackBot has been demonstrated with both speech (13 discrete commands) and tongue (5 discrete commands) signals. In preliminary tests, command recognition accuracy was 95 % with speech control and 85 % with tongue control...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the Global Navigation System and wireless networking technologies have {{changed the way we}} live, communicate, share information and even the collection of geospatial data in the field. Along with wireless networking technologies, the improvement in computational power of handheld devices such as smartphones, tablet PCs, <b>ultra-mobile</b> <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> (UMPCs) and netbook computers allow field users to connect, store and stream large amounts of geospatial data from the web-server. Nowadays, geospatial data collection is more flexible and timely manner. In this paper we discuss field data collection using a smartphone and web-based GIS system, which collects, integrates, visualizes and analyzes the collected data in real-time. We built a web-GIS system for creating a user account, acquiring coordinates from GPS embedded de-vices or wireless access points, and providing a user-friendly survey form. The collected data can be visualized and analyzed by performing thematic mapping, labeling, symbolizing, querying and generating a summary report. We tested this system on a university campus management system, in which we collected information on illegal disposal sites and parking events within the universi-ty campus...|$|R

5000|$|The {{generic term}} <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> was in use before 1981, applied {{as early as}} 1972 to the Xerox PARC's Alto, {{but because of the}} success of the IBM <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer,</b> the term [...] "PC" [...] came to mean more {{specifically}} a desktop microcomputer compatible with IBM's <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> branded products. Within a short time of the introduction, third-party suppliers of peripheral devices, expansion cards, and software proliferated; the influence of the IBM PC on the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> market was substantial in standardizing a platform for <b>personal</b> <b>computers.</b> [...] "IBM compatible" [...] became an important criterion for sales growth; after the 1980s, only the Apple Macintosh family kept significant market share without compatibility with the IBM <b>personal</b> <b>computer.</b>|$|R

The 1981 launch of the IBM <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> coined both the term <b>Personal</b> <b>Computer</b> and PC. A <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> is one intended for interactive individual use,, {{as opposed to a}} mainframe computer where the end user's requests are filtered through operating staff, or a time-sharing system in which one large processor is shared by many individuals. After the development of the microprocessor, individual <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> were low enough in cost that they eventually became affordable consumer goods. Early <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> - generally called microcomputers - were sold often in electronic kit form and in limited numbers, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians.|$|R

40|$|A two-phased study {{investigating}} {{the role of}} attitudes and beliefs {{in the use of}} <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> was conducted in 9 organizations. During the first phase a questionnaire was administered to 278 knowledge workers within one organization. The measurement scale items were tested and revised slightly, and the research model tested also. In the second phase, the revised questionnaire was administered to 364 knowledge workers (80 % gross response rate) in 8 diverse organizations. The measures and research model were tested using Partial Least Squares. Nine of eleven hypothesized relations were supported statistically, and 38 % of the variance was explained in the major dependent variable, utilization. The general findings were: (1) There were three distinct components of attitudes identified which relate to the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers,</b> including (a) job-related expectations of use, (b) correspondence between job tasks and <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use, and (c) general beliefs about <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use (difficulty, time requirements). (2) Of the different attitude components, only correspondence had a significant influence on <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> utilization. (3) Experience with <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> strongly influenced all three components of attitudes, and also influenced the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> directly. (4) Management support had a positive influence on expectations and general beliefs about <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use, but there was no direct relation between management support and utilization. (5) A strong relation was observed between the utilization of <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> and related aspects of performance.;The implications of the findings for practitioners are that organizations wishing to increase the amount and effectiveness of <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> use by knowledge workers should stress the potential correspondence between the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> environment and current job tasks. As the experience level with <b>personal</b> <b>computers</b> increases, further applications for job tasks are discovered and utilization increases. The cycle repeats itself, with increased use and experience leading to greater appreciation of the correspondence between job tasks and the <b>personal</b> <b>computer</b> environment. For researchers, the results confirmed the need to examine separate components of attitudes within the context of system utilization.
