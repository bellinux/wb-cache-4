5|$|Lead {{commonly}} {{reacts with}} heavier chalcogens. Lead sulfide is a semiconductor, a photoconductor, and an extremely sensitive infrared radiation detector. The other two chalcogenides, lead selenide and lead telluride, are likewise photoconducting. They are <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that their color becomes lighter {{going down the}} group.|$|E
5|$|One of McCartney's first girlfriends, in 1959, {{was called}} Layla; a name he remembered as being <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> Liverpool at the time. She was {{slightly}} older than McCartney {{and used to}} ask him to baby-sit with her. Julie Arthur, another girlfriend, was Ted Ray's niece.|$|E

5|$|The {{beach at}} Village Bay is <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that its short stretch of summer sand recedes in winter, exposing the large {{boulders}} {{on which it}} rests. A survey of the beach in 1953 found only a single resident species, the crustacean isopod Eurydice pulchra.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe is <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> Africa in {{that there}} are a number of ancient ruined cities built in a unique dry stone style. The most famous of these are the Great Zimbabwe ruins in Masvingo. Other ruins include Khami Ruins, Zimbabwe, Dhlo-Dhlo and Naletale.|$|E
5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) is <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> {{that it can}} climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|About 20 radioisotopes and 7 {{nuclear isomers}} between 233Cm and 252Cm {{are known for}} curium, and no stable isotopes. The longest half-lives have been {{reported}} for 247Cm (15.6 million years) and 248Cm (348,000 years). Other long-lived isotopes are 245Cm (half-life 8500 years), 250Cm (8,300 years) and 246Cm (4,760 years). Curium-250 is <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that it predominantly (about 86%) decays via spontaneous fission. The most commonly used curium isotopes are 242Cm and 244Cm with the half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, respectively.|$|E
40|$|<b>Unusual</b> events {{observed}} <b>in</b> cosmic-ray {{experiments that}} cannot {{be explained in}} the context of modern theories and models are considered. The peculiarities of VHE (>= 100 TeV) muon interactions and their possible contribution to the production of various <b>unusual</b> events <b>in</b> cosmic rays are analyzed.

60|$|It was Ozma's custom on her {{birthday}} to give a grand feast at the palace, to which all her closest friends were invited. It was a queerly assorted company, indeed, for there are more quaint and <b>unusual</b> characters <b>in</b> Oz than in {{all the rest of}} the world, and Ozma was more interested <b>in</b> <b>unusual</b> people than <b>in</b> ordinary ones--just as you and I are.|$|R

5|$|Although <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> the West, school {{corporal}} punishment {{is not uncommon}} in more conservative areas of the state, with 28,569 public school students paddled at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of school {{corporal punishment}} in Texas is surpassed only by Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored the work, like other cantatas written in Weimar, {{for a small}} ensemble of three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir only in the chorales, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas (Va), cello (Vc), bassoon (Fg) and basso continuo. The setting for four violas is <b>unusual.</b> <b>In</b> a similar orchestration, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 also omits violins.|$|E
5|$|Eline was <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> its track after {{striking}} Madagascar. Most {{storms in}} the Mozambique Channel {{turn to the}} south, ultimately missing land; however, upon landfall, Eline became one of 5% of recorded cyclones to strike southern Africa. In addition, favorable conditions allowed the storm to maintain its identity over land. Overall, Cyclone LeonEline traveled over 11,000km (6,800mi) during its 29day duration.|$|E

5|$|Falco peregrinus madens, {{described}} by Ripley and Watson in 1963, is <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> having some sexual dichromatism. If the Barbary falcon (see below) {{is considered a}} distinct species, it is sometimes placed therein. It {{is found in the}} Cape Verde Islands, and is non-migratory; it is endangered with only six to eight pairs surviving. Males have a rufous wash on crown, nape, ears, and back; underside conspicuously washed pinkish-brown. Females are tinged rich brown overall, especially on the crown and nape.|$|E
5|$|Female {{marsupials}} have paired uteri and cervices. Most eutherian (placental) mammal {{species have}} a single cervix and single, bipartite or bicornuate uterus. Lagomorphs, rodents, aardvarks and hyraxes have a duplex uterus and two cervices. Lagomorphs and rodents share many morphological characteristics and are grouped together in the clade Glires. Anteaters of the family myrmecophagidae are <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that they lack a defined cervix; they {{are thought to have}} lost the characteristic rather than other mammals developing a cervix on more than one lineage.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1875 as the First Hebrew Congregation of Oakland, Temple Sinai is {{the oldest}} synagogue in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. It grew out of Oakland's Hebrew Benevolent Society, which had been {{organized}} in 1862 by eighteen merchants and shopkeepers from several foreign countries—predominantly Polish Jews from Posen. Although Hebrew Benevolent Societies typically ceased operations upon the founding of a synagogue, Oakland's was <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> continuing to function independently {{for a number of}} years (the two groups did not merge until 1881).|$|E

5|$|Haumea's moons are <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> {{a number}} of ways. They {{are thought to be}} part of its {{extended}} collisional family, which formed billions of years ago from icy debris after a large impact disrupted Haumea's ice mantle. Hiʻiaka, the larger, outermost moon, has large amounts of pure water ice on its surface, which is rare among Kuiper belt objects. Namaka, about one tenth the mass, has an orbit with surprising dynamics: it is unusually eccentric and appears to be greatly influenced by the larger satellite.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Joan's {{path through}} the {{southern}} Caribbean in late October was highly unusual. Most October storms in the Atlantic gravitate towards the northern portion of the Caribbean, and often recurve quickly. Joan took the southernmost path of a tropical cyclone since a June system in 1933, although Hurricane Irene in 1971 took a path that was just north of Joan's. Joan-Miriam was also <b>unusual</b> <b>in</b> that it survived passage from the Atlantic to Pacific Ocean. Only seven other storms {{have been known to}} survive the passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.|$|E
50|$|Many {{fine art}} photographers {{have a variety}} of {{subjects}} in their work, the nude being one.
