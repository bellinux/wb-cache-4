From a description provided by our source, I had easily identified the building in question, which was located in Baghdad's downtown Aadamiyah section. The ten crates of missile parts were stashed in a basement of the Baghdad headquarters of Saddam's own Ba'ath party. If we could achieve surprise and surround the site before the Iraqis could evacuate the crates, we would obtain the ultimate catch-22 situation: let <b>us</b> <b>inside</b> as promised and we would find the prohibited material; bar our entry and violate the Kofi Annan compromise, {{and in the process}} invite a devastating air strike by the United States. UNSCOM would be prepared to camp out around this site until the situation had been resolved one way or the other.|$|E

[...] He was the third of four {{defensive}} backs selected by the Bears in that draft (Vestee Jackson 2nd round, Bruce Jones 7th round and Barton Hundley 10th round). The 1986 Bears signed Douglass in mid-July. [...] In training camp, Douglas was switched from cornerback to safety and recovered a fumble in the first exhibition game against the Cowboys. [...] He was described by bears scout Rod Graves as [...] "built more like a fullback and could possibly help <b>us</b> <b>inside</b> as a strong-safety type". The Chicago Tribune listed him at [...] and , and the Chicago Sun-Times reported him at [...] and [...] with the description that [...] "Big, strong, tough hitter who likes to play.

2500|$|In {{his review}} in the New York Times, Stephen Holden called the film [...] "ravishingly handsome" [...] and added, [...] "The Governess is a {{wonderful}} showcase for Ms. Driver [...] [...] [...] If [...] performance is strong, it is less than great, because her face lacks the transparency of expression that would transport <b>us</b> <b>inside</b> her character's mind [...] [...] [...] The movie takes some missteps. Rosina's ability to support her family in luxurious style from her earnings as a governess is implausible. The screenplay includes some glaring lapses into contemporary slang. And dramatically, the movie peters out in its disappointingly perfunctory final scenes. But [...] still leaves a lasting after-image." ...|$|E

Midnight Oil's label, Powderworks, released the band's second EP, Meet <b>Us</b> <b>Inside</b> in October 1984, which {{was followed by}} the single [...] "One of a Kind" [...] in November 1984. The band's first full-length album, Harry's Reasons, was released in March 1986 on the Powderworks label and was produced by Leszek Karski. Singles included [...] "Injustice", about the plight of Australia's aboriginal communities (dedicated to the Aboriginal Arts Council) released in August 1985, [...] "Give Us Something" [...] dealing with the media, was released in February 1986 and [...] "Harry's Reasons", about a friend's heroin addiction ('Harry' is a euphemism for heroin), which was released in May 1986. Neither album nor singles had any major chart success.|$|E

It was {{just the two of}} <b>us</b> <b>inside</b> the area and he bumped into me with his shoulder", while Chiellini was adamant the incident cost Italy the game, and thought the lack of a red card was part of a conspiracy to keep {{the best players in the}} tournament. Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) announced they would be investigating the incident. The Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) attempted to claim that the images of bitemarks on Chiellini's shoulder had been manipulated to appear worse than reality, while Suárez's lawyer Alejandro Balbi claimed that there was a conspiracy between England, Italy and Brazil for Suárez and Uruguay to be severely punished, a sentiment Uruguay manager Óscar Tabárez agreed with, saying [...] "If the referee did not see anything, there is nothing to see. But Suárez is the target of some British press anyway". It was compared to Zinedine Zidane's headbutt on Marco Materazzi at the 2006 World Cup, however Zidane was shown a red card while Suárez did not go into the book.|$|E

All seemingly talking at once, they plied us with question after question of the trace, the Watauga settlements, the news in the Carolinys, and how the war went.|$|E

But we went into a shop. Ah Cum drew <b>us</b> <b>inside</b> the big door and bolted it, while the crowd blocked up the windows and shutter-bars. I thought more of the crowd than the jewellery.

60|$|The castle, after all, was not {{particularly}} worth seeing. The soldier's most romantic story was of a daughter of Lord Scroope, a former governor of the castle, when Mary of Scotland was confined here. She attempted to assist the Queen in escaping, but was shot dead in the gateway by the warder; and the soldier pointed out the very spot where the poor young lady fell and died;--all which would be very interesting were there a word of truth in the story. But we liked our guide for his intelligence, simplicity, and for the pleasure which he seemed to take, as an episode of his dull daily life, in talking to strangers. He observed that the castle walls were solid, and, indeed, there was breadth enough to drive a coach and four along the top; but the artillery of the Crimea would have shelled them into ruins in a very few hours. When {{we got back to}} the guard-house, he took <b>us</b> <b>inside,</b> and showed the dismal and comfortless rooms where soldiers are confined for drunkenness, and other offences against military laws, telling us that he himself had been confined there, and almost perished with cold. I should not much wonder if he were to get into durance again, through misuse of the fee which I put into his hand at parting.|$|E
