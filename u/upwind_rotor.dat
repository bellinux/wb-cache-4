40|$|Scarcity of land sites {{applicable}} {{for wind}} turbines {{is pushing the}} technology offshore. By going offshore the expenses of nearly all components increases, which has triggered extensive research {{with the aim of}} decreasing component costs, and increasing reliability, as also maintenance costs increase as going offshore. The focus of this thesis is to look at ways to reduce aerodynamic loads which can contribute in lowering structural fatigue loads and thereby component costs for offshore wind turbines. The loading is mainly reported as blade root flapwise bending moment on wind turbines intentionally made for bottom fixed offshore sites. The load reduction is investigated using a different wind turbine configuration with a downwind mounted rotor and further compared with the conventional <b>upwind</b> mounted <b>rotor</b> on a monopile tower. Blades on downwind mounted rotors are exposed to the fluctuating wake behind the towers, known as the tower shadow. The influence from the tower shadow on blade fatigue loads is investigated using three different types of towers; a full height truss type tower, a faring (airfoil shaped) tower and a monopile tower. For reliable wind turbine simulations with downwind mounted rotors, an accurate tower shadow model is essential. Thorough investigations of the tower shadow is presented, including the detailed flow picture of the mean velocity deficit, unsteady and turbulent motions, as well as velocity spectra. The tower shadow is investigated in three different ways; using three dimensional physical model scale experiments, steady tower shadow models and two dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. By use of the tower shadow from the CFD simulations, an artificial increase in blade fatigue loading is seen as the transversal grid is made coarser. Although this is a ’safe-fail’ design (for the coarser grid), it should be kept in mind as this ’simulated’ safety factor from the coarse grid simulations could increase wind turbine costs. A method for improving the accuracy of the steady tower shadow models (currently the most frequently used model in commercial software) through a preprocessing step, where the results are directly applicable in commercial software for full wind turbine simulations, is presented. This method will improve the reliability of the simulated results. The parameters of the steady tower shadow model and the turbulence intensity are fitted and calibrated with short CFD simulations of the relevant tower geometries. This method accounts for any deviation between the mean velocity deficit obtained from the steady tower shadow model and the CFD simulations, as well as the unsteady motions and turbulence due to the presence of the tower through the calibration of the turbulence intensity (maximum deviation of ± 3 percent with respect to the tower shadow based on the CFD simulations, measured as blade fatigue loading). The response measured as blade fatigue load show an increased loading for the blades on the downwind mounted rotors using the original blades, compared to the conventional <b>upwind</b> mounted <b>rotor</b> on a monopile tower. Introducing softer and lighter blades changed this result, with reductions in blade fatigue loading (compared to the <b>upwind</b> mounted <b>rotor</b> with the original blades) of three, four and five percent for the monopile, truss and fairing towers, respectively.

During wind turbine operations, television interference was experienced by the local residents. As a consequence, operations were restricted. Although not implemented, two potential solutions were identified. In addition to television interference, a few local residents complained bout objectionable sound, particularly the 'thump' as the blade passed behind the tower. To eliminate objections, the sound generation level was reduced by 10 dB by reducing the rotor speed from 35 rpm to 23 rpm. Bolts in the drive train fractured.

40|$|An {{acoustic}} source localization scheme applicable to noncompact moving sources is developed {{and applied to}} the blade-vortex interaction (BVI) noise data of a 40 % scale BO- 105 model rotor. A generalized rotor wake code is employed to predict possible BVI locations on the rotor disk and is found useful in interpreting the acoustic localization results. The highly varying directivity patterns of different BVI impulses generated at the same test condition is explained by both the localization results and predicted tip vortex trajectories. The effects of rotor tip-path-plane angle and advance ratio on the BVI source positions is studied. Decreasing tip-path-plane angle moves the general interaction region <b>upwind</b> on the <b>rotor</b> disk, significantly changing the interaction geometry.

25|$|The Éolienne Bollée was {{designed}} to be constructed in a modular form, thus allowing éoliennes of various sizes to be built. The tower could be a standard pylon type, either of triangular or square plan, or a cast-iron column with an external spiral staircase. The éoliennes built with this type of tower have a very distinctive appearance. The actual turbine itself consists of two rings, the first being the stator and the second being the rotor. The stator has more blades than the rotor. A new device added to the 1885 patent was a funnel affixed to the stator, enabling the éolienne to capture wind from a larger area than the rotor, and increasing its speed through the turbine. A small fantail operated <b>upwind</b> of the <b>rotor,</b> and through a system of gears turned the turbine to face the wind. Also, through a counterweight system, it turned the turbine out of wind as the wind speed increased, thus preventing damage in very strong winds, when the éolienne would be edge on into the prevailing wind.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — As wind {{turbines}} become {{larger and more}} flexible, {{the potential benefits of}} load mitigating control systems become more important to reduce fatigue and extend component life. In the last five years, there has been significant research activity exploring the effectiveness of preview control techniques that may be feasible using advanced wind measurement technologies like LIDAR (light detection and ranging). However, most control development tools use Taylor’s frozen turbulence hypothesis. The end result is that preview measurements made up-stream from the rotor can be obtained with unrealistic accuracy, because the same wind velocities eventually arrive at the turbine. In this study, we extend the spectral methods commonly used to generate turbulent wind fields for controls simulation, but in a way that emulates wind evolution. This changes preview measurements made <b>upwind</b> from the <b>rotor,</b> {{in such a way that}} the differences – between the preview measurements and speeds arriving at the turbine – increase with distance from the rotor. We then evaluate the degradation in load mitigation performance of a controller that uses preview measurements obtained at various distances in front of the rotor. I...|$|R
40|$|In {{support of}} a program to advance wood {{composite}} wind turbine blade technology, a design was completed for a prototype, 90 -foot diameter, two-bladed, one-piece rotor, with all wood/epoxy composite structure. The rotor was sized for compatibility with a generator having a maximum power rating of 4000 kilowatts. Innovative features of the rotor include: a teetering hub to minimize the effects of gust loads, untwisted blades to promote rotor power control through stall, joining of blades to the hub structure via an adhesive bonded structural joint, and a blade structural design which was simplified relative to earlier efforts. The prototype rotor was designed to allow flexibility for configuring the <b>rotor</b> <b>upwind</b> or downwind of the tower, for evaluating various types of teeter dampers and/or elastomeric stops, and with variable delta-three angle settings of the teeter shaft axis. The prototype rotor was also designed with provisions for installing pressure tap and angle of attack instrumentation in one blade. A production version rotor cost analysis was conducted. Included in the program were efforts directed at developing advanced load take-off stud designs for subsequent evaluation testing by NASA, development of aerodynamic tip brake concepts, exploratory testing of a wood/epoxy/graphite concept, and compression testing of wood/epoxy laminate, with scarf-jointed plies...|$|R
40|$|Modelling {{of entire}} wind farms in flat and complex terrain using a full 3 D Navier–Stokes solver for {{incompressible}} flow {{is presented in}} this paper. Numerical integration of the governing equations is performed using an implicit pressure correction scheme, where the wind turbines (W/Ts) are modelled as momentum absorbers through their thrust coefficient. The k–ω turbulence model, suitably modified for atmospheric flows, is employed for closure. A correction is introduced {{to account for the}} underestimation of the near wake deficit, in which the turbulence time scale is bounded using a general “realizability” constraint for the fluctuating velocities. The second modelling issue that is discussed in this paper is related to the determination of the reference wind speed for the thrust calculation of the machines. Dealing with large wind farms and wind farms in complex terrain, determining the reference wind speed is not obvious when a W/T operates in the wake of another WT and/or in complex terrain. Two alternatives are compared: using the wind speed value at hub height one diameter upstream of the W/T and adopting an induction factor-based concept to overcome the utilization of a wind speed at a certain distance <b>upwind</b> of the <b>rotor.</b> Application is made in two wind farms, a five-machine one located in flat terrain and a 43 -machine one located in complex terrain...|$|R

Fatigue loads are specified {{in the form of}} histograms for the 30 year life of the machine, while limit (or maximum) loads have been derived from transient dynamic analysis at critical operating conditions. Loads prediction was accomplished using state of the art aeroelastic analyses developed at General Electric. Features of the primary predictive tool - the Transient Rotor Analysis Code (TRAC) are described in the paper. Key to the load predictions are the following wind models: (1) yearly mean wind distribution; (2) mean wind variations during operation; (3) number of start/shutdown cycles; (4) spatially large gusts; and (5) spatially small gusts (local turbulence).

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{interactions that}} can occur within a wind farm can result in the constituent turbines generating a lower power output than would be possible if each of the turbines were operated in isolation. Tightening of the constraints on the siting of wind farms {{is likely to increase}} the scale of the problem in the future. The aerodynamic performance of turbine rotors and the mechanisms that couple the fluid dynamics of multiple rotors can be most readily understood by simplifying the problem and considering the interaction between only two rotors. The aerodynamic interaction between two rotors in both co-axial and offset configurations has been simulated using the Vorticity Transport Model. The aerodynamic interaction {{is a function of the}} tip speed ratio, and both the streamwise and crosswind separation between the rotors. The simulations show that the momentum deficit at a turbine operating within the wake developed by the rotor of a second turbine is governed by the development of instabilities within the wake of the <b>upwind</b> <b>rotor,</b> and the ensuing structure of the wake as it impinges on the downwind rotor. If the wind farm configuration or wind conditions are such that a turbine rotor is subject to partial impingement by the wake produced by an upstream turbine, then significant unsteadiness in the aerodynamic loading on the rotor blades of the downwind turbine can result, and this unsteadiness can have considerable implications for the fatigue life of the blade structure and rotor hub...|$|E
40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{has been}} written at the Blekinge Institute of Technology. This thesis {{concentrates}} on the wind power and their components, also the large wind farm is studied. The electrical power is generated by using the power in wind to drive a wind turbine to produce mechanical power. This mechanical power can be converted into electrical power by using electrical induction generators. There {{are two types of}} the wind turbines, the horizontal axis and vertical axis wind turbine, where the horizontal axis wind turbine is mostly used and was studied in this thesis. The rotor can be placed in two directions: an <b>upwind</b> <b>rotor</b> where the blade of turbine faces to the wind, so it operates more smoothly and transmit more power. The other type is a downwind rotor which orients itself with respect for the wind direction. Moreover, the tower shadow makes the blade to flex, consequently resulting in fatigue, noise, and reduces output of the power. The modern wind turbine has been built with an odd number of blades which is important for the stability of the turbine. The rotor with an odd number of blades can be considered to be similar to a disc when calculating the dynamic properties of the machine. The main idea of this thesis is to study the wind power in general and large wind parks specifically. The Horns Rev wind park was taken {{as an example of a}} wind park in Denmark and the Gotland wind park as an example of a wind park in Sweden too. Into account, the distance between wind turbine in the wind direction cannot be too small. If the wind turbines are located to close to each other, the wind will be more and more turbulent after it passes through each single wind turbine. This would lead to that wind turbines downstream in the wind park, and it might even have to shut down due to that mechanical loading gets to high during strong conditions. This is due to the fact that when wind passes through the rotor of the wind turbine it gets very turbulent and the wind speed is decreased. The minimum length of the rotor should be approximately 5 - 7 rotor diameters to avoid that issue. Gotland Energy AB (GEAB) considered, that high voltage direct current light would be the only realistic way to solve the technical problems for the high amount of wind power in-feed. One result is that The stability of voltage during transient events, has become much better by using the high voltage direct current light so that the output current stability from the asynchronous generators have been improved, which reduces the stresses on the AC grid and on the mechanical construction of the windmills. In general the wind turbines with three blades accommodated a thicker root are used. It is obvious that, the less number of blades on the wind turbine, the cost of material and manufacturing will be lower. It is worthy to mentioned that, the modern wind turbine has been built with an odd number of blades. When the length of the blade increases the deflection of blade tip due to axial wind force also increase as well. So without consider the increase in length of blade may lead to dangerous situation of collision of tower and blade. Moreover, by increasing the number of blades cost of the system would increased as well. The limit of transfer for the AC transmission system depends on the distance from shore and is therefore physically limited by this. AC large wind parks that are placed at a long distance from the shore, which means AC long transmission line, and more drop voltage A solution to AC long transmission line, it could be to decrease the offshore frequency and use a low frequency AC networks. There is a suggestion by for instance (Schütte, Gustavsson and Ström 2011). The usages of a low frequency system are in electrified railway systems, where the frequency ranges from 16. 67 Hz to 25 Hz. However, the network of a low frequency would allow a simpler design of the offshore WTs and The aerodynamic rotor of a large WT operates at maximum revolutions at 15 - 20 rpm. The lower frequency would then allow a smaller gear ratio for turbines with a gearbox, or decrease the poles number for WTs with direct driven generators. This would lead to lighter and cheaper turbines. One of the disadvantages by using a low frequency system is the size of transformer would be increased, and hence, the costs of transformer will increased too. The operator of the grid, Gotland Energy AB (GEAB) considered, that HVDC light would be the only realistic way to solve the technical problems for the high amount of wind power in-feed. The experiences have supported expected improvements in the characteristics for example: - Stability in the system arose. - Reactive demands, power flows, as well as voltage level in the harmonic and system were reduced. - Flicker problems were eliminated with the installation of HVDC light and transient phenomena disappeared. Moreover, Overall experiences of Gotland Energy AB (GEAB) are that the control of power flow from the converters makes the AC grid easier to observe than a conventional AC network and the power variations do not stress the AC grid as much as in normal network. Voltage quality has been better with the increased wind power production. A topic to study in the future is the consequences of blackouts in power supply with many wind power farm. 00467639601...|$|E
