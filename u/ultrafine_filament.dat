40|$|Loss {{measurements}} are presented on an <b>ultrafine</b> <b>filament</b> composite {{and on a}} regular AC conductor, having "thick" filaments. The wires {{have been subjected to}} an alternating transverse magnetic field. An AC as well as a DC transport current have been fed through the wires. The magnetic field and the AC transport current have been sinusoidal functions in phase. The magnetization losses and the transport current losses have been measured separately. The critical current - according to the 10 - 14 ¿m criterium - and the quality factor n - according to V = V 0 (I/Ic) n- have been determined...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{confirm the}} {{economical}} feasibility {{of the application}} of superconductors in AC power apparatus. The low-loss conductor which has been proposed still only exists in theory. Simple calculations show that the economic criterion described by Ogasawara and Hlásnik is inaccurate because of an oversimplified hysteresis loss formula. A necessary modification shows that stricter demands {{will have to be}} made. As production of <b>ultrafine</b> <b>filaments</b> is a big technological problem, final diameter reduction by rolling instead of drawing is proposed. The expected better performance of a rolled composite has been verified experimentally in test coils as well as in transformer geometry. Experimental set-up and results are presented...|$|R
