I had plenty of visitors, surprised to see a white man at work, and much astonished at the novel arrangements I was making in one of their native vessels. Luckily I had a few tools of my own, including a small saw and some chisels, and these were now severely tried, cutting and fitting heavy iron-wood planks for the flooring and the posts that support the triangular mast. Being of the best London make, they stood the work well, and without them it would have been impossible for me to have finished my boat with half the neatness, or in double the time. I had a Ke workman to put in new ribs, for which I bought nails of a Bugis trader, at 8d. a pound. My gimlets were, however, too small; and having no augers we were obliged to bore all the holes with hot irons, a most tedious and <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E

30|$|Resins mostly {{are applied}} in sand control studies in which, in those cases, liquid {{polymeric}} resins {{have the ability}} to change phase to solid (Marfo et al. 2015). Although resins are frequently used as a consolidation fluid in chemical methods, application of these materials is unpleasant under environmental and economic perspectives, due to their tendency to reduce the formation permeability (Sydansk 1992). In the case of operational feasibility, resins could not be easily embedded in the formation rock. Improper and unsafe aspects of fluid caused by acids and solvents as well as problems such as the application of surface equipment and pumping systems are among the other constraints of using resin materials (Villesca et al. 2010). Regarding the limited time of pumping, injection of highly viscous resin solutions into the formation leads to <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>operation</b> of the formations with permeability less than 50 mD (Sydansk 1988). Therefore, it is essential to use consolidating materials, which are environmentally friendly and cost-effective, to control sand production.|$|E

40|$|Background: Previous {{studies have}} {{employed}} short follow-up periods or examined only {{certain aspects of}} quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to {{examine the effect of}} communication on breast cancer patients ’ QoL and to investigate the role of age in this relationship. Patients and methods: In a prospective, observational study breast cancer patients were sent question-naires, including the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C 30, over 5 years. Results: Forty-five per cent of the sample reported that some aspect of the communication they received was unclear and 59 % wanted to speak with medical staff more. Patients under 50 years rated social and psycho-logical help as more important, they were more aware of such services, had greater contact with support groups but were less satisfied with the information they received. Seventeen of the 27 QoL variables were signifi-cantly worse (P < 0. 01), up to 4 years after diagnosis, for those patients reporting unclear information. For patients over 50 years, QoL was significantly (P < 0. 001) worse when communication was <b>unsatisfactory.</b> <b>Operation</b> method or arm problems did not mitigate the association between communication and QoL. Conclusions: Communication is clearly a vital clinical skill that {{may play a role in}} patient QoL. Key words: breast cancer, communication, elderly patients, quality of lif...|$|E
40|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, it is {{becoming}} an increasingly common requirement for ships to shut down ship generators and connect to high voltage shore power {{for as long as}} practicable while in port. Ship electrical equipment shall only be connected to shore supplies that are able to maintain harbor distribution system voltage quality. Voltage drop, which is produced by the possible loading conditions of a ship when connected to a shore supply, may result in <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>operation</b> of, and damage to, electrical and electronic equipment on board and thus, must be considered in the harbor distribution system design in order to comply with the requirements of international standards.

This paper presents the methodology and results for evaluation of the voltage drops of a practical harbor electrical distribution system with high voltage shore connection (HVSC). The potential voltage drops of the implemented HVSC are quantified using standard analytical formulas. Sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the critical parameters that significantly affect voltage drops. The parameters that have great improvement benefits should have high priority for implementation in other distribution systems with HVSC. The results obtained in this paper can provide engineers with useful information regarding the actual magnitude of voltage drops, {{as well as on the}} effectiveness of mitigation options for voltage drops, which would greatly enhance HV shore supply quality...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing concern over the {{congested}} conditions of our urban highway facilities. The continuing escalation of adverse driving conditions in major urban areas has generated a feeling of discontent among automobile owners and transportation planners alike. One major factor that has contributed to this feeling of dissatisfaction is the rapid pace with which many of the new highway facilities are being filled to capacity. In some instances, the traffic volume on a new facility will grow at such a rapid pace that within only a few years the twenty-year design volume will be exceeded. While the financial constraints of local, state, and federal governments may never permit the construction of highways that provide sufficient vehicular capacity for long-term traffic demands, there should at least be the capability to accurately predict near-term future traffic volumes on new highway facilities. A significant factor affecting future traffic volumes on new highway facilities is that of latent travel demand. Latent travel demand is defined as additional traffic that desires to use an existing facility, but is discouraged from doing so by the <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>operation</b> of the facility caused by high levels of congestion. ] Latent travel demand is commonly divided into the components of converted traffic (switch of modes), diverted traffic (switched routes), and induced traffic (new trips), and it constitutes the majority of the initial vehicular traffic that will use a new highway facility. ’ Because the traditional transportation planning process does not consider latent travel demand, when new facilities are constructed that provide a significant reduction in travel time within an area, the resulting traffic volumes are often seriously underestimated. This {{can be attributed to the}} fact that existing forecasting techniques have yet to quantify the component of future traffic volumes designated as latent travel demand...|$|E

It has been argued that the point of traffic breakdown might be more appropriate for estimating capacity. Elefteriadou et al.

In particular, the statistics of the operating noise is checked against its simple model and the compliance to the expected shape of the candidates for burst gravitational wave events is assessed by means of a χ 2 test. This approach helps in reducing the false alarm rate of each operating detector and moreover ensures the correctness of the estimated parameters of the candidate events...|$|R
40|$|A {{fair and}} just {{system is the}} {{cornerstone}} of a civilised society. Although landfill siting and operation are contentious, treating and involving the affected communities in a fair and meaningful manner are indispensable to achieving our shared goal of sustainability. In Hong Kong, landfills have been constructed and managed by the Environmental Protection Department (EPD) of the Government. Environmental impacts of these landfills on their adjacent communities have been extensively reported by the mass media. Yet, literature on environmental justice in Hong Kong has been very limited. This dissertation aimed to fill this research gap and extend previous studies by conducting an environmental justice analysis for Hong Kong, with a case study on the West New Territories (WENT) Landfill and Ha Pak Nai Tsuen that reflected our progress towards environmental justice. This dissertation adopted a qualitative and case study methodology: (1) to evaluate the distribution of benefits and burdens derived from the establishment and operation of the WENT Landfill to Ha Pak Nai Tsuen villagers; (2) to scrutinise the contextual and structural processes that have impacted the distribution of benefits and burdens; and (3) to examine the degree that Ha Pak Nai Tsuen villagers have been treated with dignity and respect regarding the establishment and operation of the WENT Landfill. A total of nine Ha Pak Nai Tsuen villagers were purposively sampled for the semi-structured personal interviews of this study. With reference to the qualitative data collected from these villagers; the EPD, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, the Yuen Long District Council and SITA Waste Services Limited were purposively sampled for the internet interviews of this study. This study revealed an inequitable and unfair distribution of benefits and burdens derived from the establishment and operation of the WENT Landfill to Ha Pak Nai Tsuen villagers. These villagers were exposed to air pollution, noise pollution, water pollution and pests caused by the inappropriate siting and <b>unsatisfactory</b> <b>operation</b> of the WENT Landfill, but they received few benefits in return. This study also revealed that the villagers were not informed, consulted, involved or responded to by the EPD regarding the establishment and operation of the WENT Landfill. The incomplete and ineffective civic engagement process, the inefficient and indirect communication channel between Government departments and citizens, and the lack of satisfactory response from Government departments to citizens were the negative structural processes identified. This study lastly revealed a lack of respect for an already degraded farming and fishing village with few, old and non-indigenous villagers by the EPD. A lack of trust was also caused by the broken promises by the Government to the villagers. This study concluded that there was a great difference between the ideal of environmental justice and the reality of the impacts of establishment and operation of the WENT Landfill on the villagers. This study recommends the EPD to implement environmental monitoring and audit programmes, to facilitate public participation, and to establish a compensation mechanism for communities affected by the establishment and operation of waste facilities in Hong Kong. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{drilling}} of deep holes {{remains an}} <b>unsatisfactory</b> machining <b>operation</b> due its limited productivity. This manufacturing process requires the chips {{to be evacuated}} {{through the use of}} retreat cycles and high-pressure lubrication, which is problematic both for productivity and the respect of the environment. An alternative response to the chip evacuation problem is the use of a vibratory drilling head which enables the chip to be split thanks to the drill's axial vibration. The high-speed drilling operation requires specific cutting conditions to be determined in order to maintain self-excited axial vibration throughout the drilling process. The prediction of adequate cutting conditions is determined {{on the basis of the}} frequency characteristics of the spindle/self-vibratory drilling head and the dynamics of the cutting process. It can be expressed in terms of a specific stability diagram indicating the zone of stable self-excited axial vibration. The aim of this study is to develop a high-speed spindle/drilling head/tool system finite element model to evaluate the system's dynamic characteristics and the adequate cutting conditions allowing stable self-excited axial vibration. The model is elaborated on the basis of rotor dynamics prediction, and takes into account the interfaces between system components, using the receptance coupling method. Using the model, adequate cutting conditions are determined by integrating the model-based tool tip transfer function into the chatter vibration stability approach proposed by Budak and Altintas. The simulated results are validated by performing vibration and drilling tests. The proposed model can be used to accurately evaluate the dynamic performance of the spindle/self-vibratory drilling head and can also be used to design an optimised spindle/drilling head for a given drilling process...|$|R

40|$|Recently, roofed {{landfills}} {{have been}} gaining popularity in Japan. Roofed landfills have several advantages over non-roofed landfills such as eliminating {{the visibility of}} waste and reducing the spread of offensive odours. This study examined the moisture balance and aeration conditions, which promote waste stabilisation, in a roofed landfill that included organic waste such as food waste. Moisture balance was estimated using waste characterization and {{the total amount of}} landfilled waste.

40|$|A unique {{configuration}} of the P&W SSME Alternate Fuel Turbopump turbine disk/blade assembly, combined with a severe thermal environment, resulted in several structural anomalies that were driven by frictional contact forces. Understanding the mechanics of these problems provides new quality checks for future turbo machinery designs. During development testing in 1997 of the SSME alternate fuel turbopump at Stennis Space Center, several potentially serious problems surfaced with the turbine disk/blade assembly {{that had not been}} experienced in extensive earlier testing. Changes to the operational thermal environment were noted based on analytical prediction of modifications that affected performance and on stationary thermal measurements adjacent to the rotor assembly. A detailed structural investigation was required to reveal the mechanism of distress induced by the change. The turbine disk experienced cracking in several locations due to increased thermal gradient induced stress during start and shutdown transients. This was easily predictable using standard analysis procedures and expected once the thermal environment was characterized. What was not expected was the curling of a piston ring used for blade axial retention in the disk, indentation of the axial face of the blade attachment by a spacer separating the first and second stage blades, and most significantly, galling and cracking of the blade root attachment that could have resulted in blade release. Past experience, in gas turbine environments, set a precedent of never relying on friction for help and to evaluate it only in specific instances where it was obvious that it would degrade capability. In each of the three cases above, friction proved to be a determining factor that pushed the components into an <b>unsatisfactory</b> mode of <b>operation.</b> The higher than expected temperatures and rapid thermal transients combined with friction to move beyond past experience. The turbine disk/blade assembly configuration contributed to the potential for these problems to occur by limiting the radial deflection from thermals and centrifugal loading. The cooled solid bore configuration was chosen to improve rotordynamic stability by limiting the length of rotor overhang while still protecting the roller bearing by maintaining zero slope under the inner race. During a start transient, the rim area of the disk heats rapidly and expands axially and circumferentially and requires corresponding radial and axial growth of the disk to maintain relative positioning of the disk, blades, spacers and retainer rings. The stiffness, large thermal mass, and bore cooling flow combine to severely limit the disk rim radial growth which results in the potential for relative movement between these parts. Friction then becomes a player in the determination of component stress...|$|R
