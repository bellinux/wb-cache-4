25|$|It was met {{according}} to official figures. There is also a Public Performance Target to remove more asylum seekers who have been judged not to be refugees under the international definition than new anticipated <b>unfounded</b> <b>applications.</b> This target was met early in 2006. Official figures for numbers of people claiming asylum in the UK were at a 13-year low by March 2006.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{a common}} legal {{opinion is that}} a clearly <b>unfounded</b> <b>application</b> for asylum does not {{automatically}} represent an abusive misuse of the law. This would only be the case if purposeful, abusive activity can be proven. Contrary to common belief, false or incomplete statements {{during the process of}} the asylum procedure are not immediately prosecutable.|$|R
40|$|Physicians {{have been}} found to be inadequately aware of the {{structure}} of the causes of headache, vertigo, and their clinical importance in patients with essential hypertension. Incorrect ideas lead to the <b>unfounded</b> <b>application</b> of diagnostic techniques for imaging the great arteries of the head and to extremely simplified approaches to treating cerebrovascular diseases as short-term courses of therapy with vasoactive and metabolic agents...|$|R
5000|$|Deductive, inductive, or floating: A {{deductive}} {{model is}} a logical structure based on a theory. An inductive model arises from empirical findings and generalization from them. The floating model rests on neither theory nor observation, but is merely the invocation of expected structure. Application of mathematics in social sciences outside of economics {{has been criticized for}} <b>unfounded</b> models. <b>Application</b> of catastrophe theory in science has been characterized as a floating model.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the legal}} {{profession}} and courts, a querulant (from the Latin querulus - [...] "complaining") {{is a person who}} obsessively feels wronged, particularly about minor causes of action. In particular the term is used for those who repeatedly petition authorities or pursue legal actions based on manifestly <b>unfounded</b> grounds. These <b>applications</b> include in particular complaints about petty offenses.|$|R
5000|$|Pisanu {{insisted on}} the main issues of the Italian {{presidency}} {{in the field of}} internal security: border control, migration, and asylum, war on terrorism and organised crime. Each country should decide on its own the number of immigrants to be received. Better cooperation is needed with the transit countries. In the border control [...] "common units" [...] should be established, first in the [...] "smallest and weakest" [...] countries so that the change for the Schengen-System would be easier for the countries of East Europe and the Mediterranean. He urged a strict visa policy and compulsory stamping for tourists with visa-waiver. The <b>unfounded</b> asylum <b>applications</b> should be firmly refused. Common investigation teams should be established in the fight against organized crime, where the national police chiefs might have a leading role in order to support the Europol’s strategic direction. A network of contact officers should be set up.|$|R
40|$|Ebselen (2 -phenyl- 1, 2 -benzisoselenazol- 3 (2 H) -one; PZ- 51, DR- 3305), is an organoselenium {{compound}} with {{glutathione peroxidase}} (GPx) -like, thiol-dependent, hydroperoxide reducing activity. As an enzyme mimic for {{activity of the}} selenoenzyme GPx, this compound {{has proved to be}} highly useful in research on mechanisms in redox biology. Furthermore, the reactivity of ebselen with protein thiols has helped to identify novel, selective targets for inhibitory actions on several enzymes of importance in pharmacology and toxicology. Importantly, the selenium in ebselen is not released and thus is not bioavailable, ebselen metabolites being excreted in bile and urine. As a consequence, initial concerns about selenium toxicity, fortunately, were <b>unfounded.</b> Potential <b>applications</b> in medical settings have been explored, notably in brain ischemia and stroke. More recently, there has been a surge in interest as new medical applications have been taken into consideration. The first publication on the biochemical effects of ebselen appeared 30 years ago (Müller et al. [4]), which prompted the authors to retrace the early development from their perspective. It is a fascinating example of fruitful interaction between research-oriented industry and academia...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{subjective}} listening trials, Torija and Flindell [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 135, 1 – 4 (2014) ] {{observed that}} low frequency content in typical urban main road traffic noise appeared {{to make a}} smaller contribution to reported annoyance than might be inferred from its objective or physical dominance. This paper reports a more detailed study which was aimed at (i) identifying the difference in sound levels at which low frequency content becomes subjectively dominant over mid and high frequency content and (ii) investigating the relationship between loudness and annoyance under conditions where low frequency content is relatively more dominant, such as indoors where mid and high frequency content is reduced. The results suggested that differences of at least + 30 ?dB between the low frequency and the mid/high frequency content are needed for changes in low frequency content {{to have as much}} subjective effect as equivalent changes in mid and high frequency content. This suggests that common criticisms of the A-frequency weighting based on a hypothesized excessive downweighting of the low frequency content may be relatively <b>unfounded</b> in this <b>application</b> area...|$|R
30|$|The Netherlands {{has special}} {{policies}} for immigrant startups, entrepreneurs and investors. The latter is hardly used and will therefore not be discussed here. 31 The startup policy launched in January 2015 grant {{a visa to}} immigrant startup only {{if they have the}} support of an officially recognized Startup Facilitator. 32 The facilitators are mostly private but can be public institutions. The facilitator must be an experienced business coach. By September 2017 the Immigration Authorities approved 34 facilitators and some 107 startups. 33 A startup action plan must provide insight into the role of the immigrant in the startup (which must be more than an investor) and the innovative aspects of the startup. The product or service is innovative if it is new to the Netherlands, it involves new technology for production, distribution or marketing or it involves an innovative organizational set-up and working method. 34 A specialized Economic Affairs Agency makes the assessment and advices the Immigration Authorities on this. Innovative are e.g. activities {{in the context of the}} Dutch Top Sectors which include water management, logistics and agriculture, self-developed new products or services, original approaches to sustainability problems and social innovation. The Immigration Authorities only ask Economic Affairs for an assessment if they deem the <b>application</b> not manifestly <b>unfounded.</b> The <b>application</b> of a Libyan entrepreneur applying for a startup visa to sell printers, import Arabic books and develop a new reading method for the blind other than braille, was deemed unfounded. 35 According to the Court hearing his case, the fact that he teamed up with a facilitator who did not properly substantiate the application to become a recognized facilitator while they could have been aware of the requirements through several channels, played against him. 36 The high evidentiary requirements are a noted obstacle (De Lange, 2016).|$|R
