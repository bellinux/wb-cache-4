The invocation of LI and LALS under FISA requires prior authorization by the FISC federal court. The Title II of US Patriot Act allows LEAs to obtain authorization for LI or LALS by demonstrating that the IRI and CC records are relevant for an investigation, rather than the stricter FISA requirement to demonstrate that the target identity is explicitly involved in unauthorized activities and terrorism.|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{broadcast}} nature of radio propagation, the wireless transmission can be readily overheard by <b>unauthorized</b> users for <b>interception</b> purposes and is thus highly vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. To this end, physical-layer security is emerging as a promising paradigm to protect the wireless communications against eavesdropping attacks by exploiting the physical characteristics of wireless channels. This article {{is focused on the}} investigation of diversity techniques to improve the physical-layer security, differing from the conventional artificial noise generation and beamforming techniques which typically consume additional power for generating artificial noise and exhibit high implementation complexity for beamformer design. We present several diversity approaches to improve the wireless physical-layer security, including the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), multiuser diversity, and cooperative diversity. To illustrate the security improvement through diversity, we propose a case study of exploiting cooperative relays to assist the signal transmission from source to destination while defending against eavesdropping attacks. We evaluate the security performance of cooperative relay transmission in Rayleigh fading environments in terms of secrecy capacity and intercept probability. It is shown that as the number of relays increases, the secrecy capacity and intercept probability of the cooperative relay transmission both improve significantly, implying the advantage of exploiting cooperative diversity to improve the physical-layer security against eavesdropping attacks.

40|$|A micro-miniature radio {{frequency}} (rf) transmitter {{has been developed}} and demonstrated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The objective of the rf transmitter development was to maximize the transmission distance while drastically shrinking the overall transmitter size, including antenna. Based on analysis and testing, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with a 16 -GHz gallium arsenide (GaAs) oscillator and integrated on-chip antenna was designed and fabricated using microwave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC) technology. Details of the development {{and the results of}} various field tests will be discussed. The rf transmitter is applicable to covert surveillance and tracking scenarios due to its small size of 2. 2 x 2. 2 mm, including the antenna. Additionally, the 16 -GHz frequency is well above the operational range of consumer-grade radio scanners, providing a degree of protection from <b>unauthorized</b> <b>interception.</b> Variations of the transmitter design have been demonstrated for tracking and tagging beacons, transmission of digital data, and transmission of real-time analog video from a surveillance camera. Preliminary laboratory measurements indicate adaptability to direct-sequence spread-spectrum transmission, providing a low probability of intercept and/or detection. Concepts related to law enforcement applications will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Abstract ― The {{development}} of digital information has lead to increasing demands on information security technology {{in order to}} protect the confidentiality of information. Digital steganography is one of technologies that is capable of protecting the information from <b>unauthorized</b> <b>interception.</b> It is due to its capability to hide the embedded of the information without attracting the eavesdropper’s attention. Among digital media, digital image is the most widely used medium for steganography. Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is a well known technique in digital image steganography. The use of DCT on small blocks may pose blocking effects and unintended artifacts on the overall image. These disadvantages of DCT can be eliminated by using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) which is more compatible with the Human Visual System (HVS). However the floating point of DWT can causes some loss of information. On the other hand, Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT) represented in finite precision can avoid the problem of floating point precision in DWT. In this paper, the messages are embedded on the 1 -level Integer Haar Wavelet Transform (IHWT) using coefficient difference scheme that is adopted from Pixel Value Differencing (PVD). The messages are embedded on the difference values of two adjacent wavelet coefficients. The result shows that the proposed method can easily outperform the existing method that employ IHWT and Pixel Mapping Method (PMM) in term of imperceptibility as well as the maximum capacity.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{practice of}} uploading photographs onto Internet social networking and business sites has converged with advances in face recognition technologies {{to create a}} situation where an individual {{can no longer be}} just a face in the crowd. Despite the intrusive potential of face recognition technologies, the unauthorized application of such technologies to online digital images so as to obtain identity information is neither prohibited nor part of the international law reform discourse. The {{purpose of this article is}} to consider the merits of enacting specific laws to address this problem, and to present recommendations as to the ambit and operation of such laws. As privacy is the primary public interest upon which such laws could be based, the article considers the need to reformulate the concept of privacy so as to address the characteristics of the digital environment. The changed online relationship between the observer and the observed, altered societal norms as to online privacy and the merits of seeking to support anonymity rather than control of information in the digital realm are integrated into this analysis. Further, existing laws prohibiting <b>unauthorized</b> <b>interception</b> and access of data and text are examined for the purpose of providing guidance as to the appropriate design of future laws protecting visual images. The article concludes by recommending the enactment of criminal laws prohibiting the unauthorized application of face recognition technologies to online visual images subject to enumerated exceptions that balance privacy against countervailing public interests such as law enforcement and national security. 32 page(s...|$|E
