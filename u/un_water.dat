50|$|In 1998, the Sixth Session of the Commission on Sustainable Development {{stated that}} there was a need for regular, global {{assessments}} on the status of freshwater resources. In response to this recommendation, the member organizations of UN-Water (known then as the ACC Subcommittee on Water Resources) decided to undertake a collective UN system-wide continuing assessment process. Founded in 2000, the flagship programme of UN-Water, the World Water Assessment Programme coordinates the production of the UN World Water Development Report (WWDR), with as aim to report on the status of global freshwater resources and the progress achieved in reaching the Millennium Development Goals and currently also the new set of Sustainable Development Goals related to water. Initially the periodicity and coverage of the Report was triennial and comprehensive, but in 2012, <b>UN</b> <b>Water</b> changed this for it to have an annual periodicity and being theme oriented (plus an additional synthesis report every five years) with as purpose to sharpen the focus of the Report on strategic water issues and become more topical. The first annual edition was published in March 2014 (Theme: Water and Energy) followed by the 2015 edition (Theme: Water for a Sustainable World). The WWDR 2016 (Theme: Water and Jobs) was launched on 22 March 2016 in Geneva during the official World Water Day celebrations held in ILO Headquarters.|$|E
50|$|After the war, Cade recuperated {{very briefly}} in Heidelberg Hospital, then {{took up a}} {{position}} at Bundoora Repatriation Mental Hospital in Melbourne. It was at an unused kitchen in Bundoora where he conducted crude experiments {{which led to the}} discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. Since he had no sophisticated analytical equipment these experiments mostly consisted of injecting urine from mentally ill patients into the abdomen of guinea pigs. His early experiments suggested to him that the urine from manic patients was more toxic. There are 2 toxic substances in urine: urea and uric acid. He found urea was the same in both ill and healthy people. He started to work on uric acid. In order to do that, he made artificial solutions of uric acid. To make up different strengths of uric acid he needed to convert it unto a substance that he could more easily manipulate. On its own uric acid would not dissolve <b>un</b> <b>water.</b> Then, in an effort to increase the water solubility of uric acid, lithium was added to make a solution of lithium urate. Cade found that in the guinea pigs injected with lithium carbonate solution, as a control solution, the guinea pigs were more restful. His use of careful controls in his experiments revealed that the lithium ion had a calming effect by itself, but even this finding may have been caused by the toxic effects of an excessive dose of Lithium. After ingesting lithium himself to ensure its safety in humans, Cade began a small-scale trial of lithium citrate and/or lithium carbonate on some of his patients diagnosed with mania, dementia præcox or melancholia, with outstanding results. The calming effect was so robust that Cade speculated that mania was caused by a deficiency in lithium.|$|E

30|$|The {{agricultural}} sector is currently coming under {{various types of}} pressure. Firstly, it is under pressure to produce more food to help reduce food import expenditure, which is very high for the region. This requires both an expansion of agriculture that will increase productivity per hectare {{as well as the}} total area under agriculture. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates account for the highest annual per capita withdrawal with 963 and 889  m 3 per inhabitant, respectively (FAO 2003; <b>UN</b> <b>Water</b> 2012). Municipal water withdrawal per inhabitant is approximately 90  m 3 per year for Arabian Peninsula as a whole, with variations between countries from 13  m 3 per inhabitant in Yemen to 245  m 3 per inhabitant in Bahrain. Industrial water withdrawal per inhabitant is 70  m 3 per year for the region, on average. However, this figure also varies considerably at country level. In some countries, it amounts to less than 10  m 3 per inhabitant per year, especially Yemen (<b>UN</b> <b>Water,</b> 2012), where industrial water withdrawal is 3  m 3 per inhabitant per year. In most of these countries, ground water is the main source of freshwater used for irrigation.|$|E

30|$|Gleick (1996) set {{guidelines}} for minimum {{amounts of water}} for domestic water use at 50  L person− 1  day− 1 (18.3  m 3  person− 1  year− 1), including drinking, food preparation, bathing and sanitation. Without the allotment for sanitation, the domestic water use is 30  L person− 1  day− 1 (11.0  m 3  person− 1  year− 1). In addition, Gleick (1996) suggested a minimum of about 3240  L person− 1  day− 1 (1180  m 3  person− 1  year− 1) in arid regions such as Egypt for food-crop irrigation. The sum of minimum domestic use and food-crop irrigation water, then, is close to 1200  m 3  person− 1  year− 1, a number that is considered to represent water stress by the United Nations: recommended water allotment is 1700  m 3  person− 1  year− 1, water stress is 1000 – 1700  m 3  person− 1  year− 1, water scarcity is 500 – 1000  m 3  person− 1  year− 1, and absolute water scarcity is less than 500  m 3  person− 1  year− 1 (<b>UN</b> <b>Water</b> 2013).

30|$|The {{intensive}} use of groundwater resources from shallow and deep aquifers to meet rising demand {{has led to}} further exploitation of water resources in excess of natural renewability and also resulted in the pollution of the existing groundwater aquifers due to the intrusion of saline seawater (especially in the coastal areas) and the up-coning of brackish and saline water supplies from lower aquifers. This is particularly serious in Oman, Bahrain and Qatar, and recovery may take generations (<b>UN</b> <b>Water</b> 2012). The increasing population pressure combined with urbanisation and economic development will increase water demand, leading to: an even greater pressure on the cities and their infrastructure, public services, housing and jobs; and an increased claim on water that is presently used for irrigated agriculture. By necessity, desalination {{has become a major}} component of the water-supply system in these countries for providing water to satisfy domestic requirements. Competition among sectors over utilisation of available groundwater sources in some of the countries has created water deficits. Rising demand is not only placing pressure on water resources, especially the most easily accessible sources, but also brings about an entirely new progression of environmental concerns and their associated development costs.|$|E
40|$|Water's {{central role}} in the {{biosphere}} implies that several of the large issues confronting humanity are in fact related to water: pollution, desertification, water scarcity-related conflicts, water-logging of mismanaged agricultural lands, forest die-back, eutrophication, and fish kill, to mention a few. The article identifies a number of reasons why man {{has not been able to}} solve water-related problems at lower hierarchical levels: complexity of water vs. simplicity with which it is being addressed; impact as non-professional perceptual differences leading to widespread communication problems; deep involvement of water in the generating, spreading and growth of environmental disturbances; and upstream/downstream dichotomies in international river basins. The global policy dimensions of water are clarified: on the one hand, the global circulation system of a resource that incessantly transcends international boundaries; on the other, the fact that water problems are common to all countries. After selected examples of past efforts in global problem-solving, the discussion concentrates on the <b>UN</b> <b>Water</b> Conference in Mar del Plata in 1977 and the extremely weak follow-up of its many recommendations and resolutions. The explanation is sought in pitfalls and barriers similar to those operating at lower hierarchical levels. Special emphasis is placed on decision-makers ' tendency to react to perceived rather than predicted problems, on an almost extreme administrative fragmentation, and on the general absence of a body combining overall overview with overall responsibility in the field of water. The article closes with the pessimistic observation that there are indeed limited alternatives to global policy-making, and that there is not much time for delay.
