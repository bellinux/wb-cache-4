5|$|During {{the chaotic}} {{days after the}} war, {{contradictory}} reports arose as to Bormann's whereabouts. Sightings were reported in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere. Bormann's wife was placed <b>under</b> <b>surveillance</b> in case he tried to contact her. Jakob Glas, Bormann's long-time chauffeur, insisted that he saw Bormann in Munich in July 1946. In case Bormann was still alive, multiple public notices about the upcoming Nuremberg trials were placed in newspapers and on the radio in October and November 1945 to notify him of the proceedings against him.|$|E

At {{the time of her}} death she was <b>under</b> <b>surveillance</b> by the FBI, and her phone had been tapped, so {{one of the first people}} informed about it was FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, via a teletype link. The news of her death was reported in Bay Area newspapers.|$|E

5|$|The {{daughter}} of John Strong Perry Tatlock, a prominent Old English philologist {{and an expert}} on Geoffrey Chaucer, Tatlock was a graduate of Vassar College and the Stanford Medical School, where she studied to become a psychiatrist. Tatlock began seeing Oppenheimer in 1936, when she was a graduate student at Stanford and Oppenheimer was a professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley. As a result of their relationship and her membership of the Communist Party, she was placed <b>under</b> <b>surveillance</b> by the FBI, and her phone was tapped.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{stay with}} her still grieving parents in heavily bombed Portsmouth, Manning moved into a London flat. Reggie arrived {{during the summer of}} 1945, and found a job in the Features Department of the BBC. He was {{identified}} as a Communist spy by MI5 in 1947, and placed <b>under</b> <b>surveillance.</b> According to his file, Reggie had been working to increase Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war. Manning did not share her husband's political beliefs, but was quite aware that their phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC. Reggie was soon transferred away from Features to the less politically sensitive Drama department. The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the Russian invasion of Hungary in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Both {{parents were}} monarchists and liberal conservatives, being {{committed}} to the emancipation reform of 1861 introduced by the reformist Tsar Alexander II; they avoided political radicals {{and there is no}} evidence that the police ever put them <b>under</b> <b>surveillance</b> for subversive thought. Every summer they holidayed at a rural manor in Kokushkino. Among his siblings, Lenin was closest to his sister Olga, whom he often bossed around; he had an extremely competitive nature and could be destructive, but usually admitted his misbehaviour. A keen sportsman, he spent much of his free time outdoors or playing chess, and excelled at school, the disciplinarian and conservative Simbirsk Classical Gimnazia.|$|E

5|$|Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; {{this caused}} her {{popularity}} in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government {{took an interest in}} her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her <b>under</b> <b>surveillance.</b> While {{she and her husband were}} travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, Wang was {{privy to}} details of Neil Heywood's death, and had {{reportedly}} attempted to voice his concerns to Bo about alleged poisoning. Around 16 January, Wang {{is believed to}} have confronted Bo over evidence that implicated Bo's wife in the murder. Although Bo initially agreed to allow an inquiry, he then changed course and sought to obstruct investigations. Wang was abruptly demoted on 2 February to the far less prestigious position of Vice-mayor overseeing education, science, and environmental affairs. Bo placed Wang <b>under</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and several of his close associates were reportedly taken into custody. Some reports allege that Bo may have been plotting to have Wang assassinated.|$|E

Tooms breaks into her apartment through a tiny air vent to kill her, but Mulder rushes there and apprehends him first. Tooms is put in an institution for the criminally insane where he begins to build another nest using newspaper. At the institution, Scully informs Mulder that medical tests on Tooms show an abnormal skeletal and muscle system, and a rapidly declining metabolism.

5|$|On 1October 1965, a {{group of}} Indonesian National Armed Forces members calling {{themselves}} the 30September Movement killed six Army generals and announced {{that the president was}} under their power; the coup was quashed the following day. Contemporary reports indicated that the PKI had been behind the G30S, a position endorsed by the Indonesian government. As a result, hundreds of thousands of registered and suspected PKI members were killed or exiled over the following decade, effectively destroying the Party. By 1974 Buru held some 10,000prisoners, while others were held elsewhere or forced to stay abroad. Political prisoners began to be released by the 1970s, but saw systematic discrimination at all levels of society: they found themselves <b>under</b> <b>surveillance</b> and with little hope of employment.|$|E
5|$|While Árbenz {{was living}} in Montevideo, his wife came to join him. He was also visited by Arévalo a year after his own arrival there. Although the {{relationship}} between Arévalo and the Árbenz family was initially friendly, it soon deteriorated due to {{differences between the two}} men. Arévalo himself was not <b>under</b> <b>surveillance</b> in Uruguay and was occasionally able to express himself through articles in the popular press. He left for Venezuela a year after his arrival to take up a position as a teacher. During his stay in Uruguay, Árbenz was initially required to report to the police on a daily basis; eventually, however, this requirement was relaxed a little. María Árbenz later stated that the couple was pleased by the hospitality they received in Uruguay, and would have stayed there indefinitely had they received permission to do so.|$|E
5|$|According to Viktor Luneyev, the {{struggle}} against dissent operated on many more layers than those registered in court sentences. We {{do not know how}} many the secret services kept <b>under</b> <b>surveillance,</b> held criminally liable, arrested, sent to psychiatric hospitals, or who were sacked from their jobs, and restricted in all kinds of other ways in the exercise of their rights. No objective assessment {{of the total number of}} repressed persons is possible without fundamental analysis of archival documents. The difficulty is that the required data are very diverse and are not to be found in a single archive. They are scattered between the State Archive of the Russian Federation, the archive of the Russian Federation State Statistical Committee (Goskomstat), the archives of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD of Russia), the FSB of Russia, the RF General Prosecutor's Office, and the Russian Military and Historical Archive. Further documents are held in the archives of 83 constituent entities of the Russian Federation, in urban and regional archives, as well as in the archives of the former Soviet Republics, now the 11 independent countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States or the three Baltic States (Baltics).|$|E

5|$|The parties {{reached a}} {{compromise}} which {{was recorded in}} the Kolozsmonostor Abbey on 6 July. They agreed that the tithe would be reduced by half. The payment of the rents, taxes and other levies due to the landowners and the royal treasury was suspended until the tithe was collected. The agreement abolished the ninth and prescribed that the peasants were only required {{to pay the rent}} to the landowners. The annual amount of the rent was fixed at 10 dinars, much lower than the rent from before the uprising. The noblemen also acknowledged the peasants' right to free movement, which could only be limited if a peasant failed to fulfill his obligations to the landowner. To keep the execution of the agreement <b>under</b> <b>surveillance,</b> the peasants were authorized to hold an annual assembly at Mount Bábolna. Their assembly was entitled to punish noblemen who had broken the compromise.|$|E
5|$|While {{eight of}} the Nine Ministers could be of {{commoner}} origin, the post of Minister of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng 宗正), {{also known as the}} Director of the Imperial Clan, was always occupied {{by a member of the}} imperial family. He oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. His ministry was responsible for record-keeping of all nobles, a register being updated at the beginning of each year. When a serious infraction was committed by a member of the imperial family, the Minister of the Imperial Clan was the first high official to be notified before the emperor, who made the ultimate decision about any possible legal action. This minister's subordinates heard grievances of imperial family members and informed them about new ordinances. Unlike kings and marquesses, who were not responsible to any of the Nine Ministers, imperial princesses and their fiefs were kept <b>under</b> <b>surveillance</b> by the Minister of the Imperial Clan.|$|E
5|$|With the Burger's {{house now}} empty, Rosa sells it and moves in with Conrad, {{a student who}} had befriended her during her father's trial. Conrad {{questions}} her about {{her role in the}} Burger family and asks why she always did what she was told. Later Rosa leaves Conrad and moves into a flat on her own and works as a physiotherapist. In 1975 Rosa attends a party of a friend in Soweto, and it is there that she hears a black university student dismissing all whites' help as irrelevant, saying that whites cannot know what blacks want, and that blacks will liberate themselves. Despite being labelled a Communist and <b>under</b> <b>surveillance</b> by the authorities, Rosa manages to get a passport, and flies to Nice in France to spend several months with Katya, her father's first wife. There she meets Bernard Chabalier, a visiting academic from Paris. They become lovers and he persuades her to return with him to Paris.|$|E
