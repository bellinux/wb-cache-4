40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>urban</b> wildlife <b>conservation</b> in Arizona {{as a function}} of public opinion and agency involvement. In the fall of 1985, a questionnaire was mailed to 1000 randomly chosen households. Respondents answered questions about urban wildlife-related activities, preferred species and locations for <b>urban</b> wildlife <b>conservation,</b> wildlife-related pest problems, a public agency's responsibility for urban wildlife, and potential agency-sponsored urban wildlife programs. Analysis of the survey data indicate that Tucsonans are aware of, have favorable opinions about, and actively encourage the presence of urban wildlife. An analysis of <b>urban</b> wildlife <b>conservation</b> as a public issue yields additional information pertinent to the design and implementation of a state agency <b>urban</b> wildlife <b>conservation</b> program. The combined results of these analyses suggest that state agency involvement in <b>urban</b> wildlife <b>conservation</b> is publicly acceptable; an urban constituency can potentially benefit an agency's support base; and urban wildlife conservation's unique characteristics warrant special attention during program and policy development...|$|R

25|$|In {{parallel}} with {{the restoration of the}} Old Bridge, the Aga Khan Trust for Culture and the World Monuments Fund, with funding provided by the World Bank, undertook a five-year-long restoration and rehabilitation effort in historic Mostar. Realizing early on that the reconstruction of the bridge without an in-depth rehabilitation of the surrounding historic neighbourhoods would be devoid of context and meaning, they shaped the programme {{in such a way as}} to establish a framework of <b>urban</b> <b>conservation</b> schemes and individual restoration projects that would help regenerate the most significant areas of historic Mostar, and particularly the urban tissue around the Old Bridge. The project also resulted in the establishment of the Stari Grad Agency which has an important role in overseeing the ongoing implementation of the conservation plan, as well as operating and maintaining a series of restored historic buildings (including the Old Bridge complex) and promoting Mostar as a cultural and tourist destination. The official inauguration of the Stari grad Agency coincided with the opening ceremony of the Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|The North Pond Nature Sanctuary (...) , {{located between}} Fullerton, Diversey, Stockton and Cannon, is a ten-acre pond {{that has become}} an {{important}} wildlife area. Historically the site was a dune, then a dumping ground, and an ornamental pond; it was converted in 1999-2000 into a natural area with a littoral zone that greatly improved the water quality by re-establishing native Midwestern ecology. The upland restoration of prairie, savanna, and woodland plants has included only top quality native species such as little bluestem, sky-blue aster, nodding wild onion, side-oats grama, butterfly weed, purple prairie clover, rough blazing star, wild quinine, prairie phlox, coneflowers, false dragonhead, northern prairie dropseed, showy goldenrod, rattlesnake master, shooting star, and wild bergamot. The North Pond Nature Sanctuary is notable as the site where Mayor Richard M. Daley and the US Fish and Wildlife Service signed an <b>Urban</b> <b>Conservation</b> Treaty for Migratory Birds in April 2004, making the city eligible for federal funds to restore habitat for the lakefront migratory pathway for birds.|$|E

40|$|The land conservancy {{movement}} in the United States has increased significantly {{over the past twenty}} years. The increased number and activity of local land trusts is especially notable. Rural and suburban land has been the most important conservation targets for these groups. However, there is growing interest in the <b>conservation</b> of <b>urban</b> land, and interest in the values and viability of natural areas in urban environments. To assess these values and viability, Cuyahoga County, Ohio is evaluated on its present and future potential for an <b>urban</b> land <b>conservation</b> program. Cuyahoga County’s human population has declined the past ten years but land development continues to increase. Loss of valuable ecological areas including riparian lands, wetlands and diverse plant communities continues at an alarming pace. An <b>urban</b> land <b>conservation</b> strategy that targets small parcels (< 10 acre) is needed to combat the loss of the ecological resources and to provide natural areas to an urbanizing county as a social and economic benefit. To determine the viability of an <b>urban</b> land <b>conservation</b> effort in Cuyahoga County, the following activities were evaluated. 1. The success and challenges of current <b>urban</b> land <b>conservation</b> efforts throughout the country and within Cuyahoga County; 2. The similarities and differences of approaches to rural land <b>conservation</b> and <b>urban</b> land conservation; 3. Defining eco-valued landscapes and their presence for conservation opportunities in Cuyahoga County; and 4. Organizational structures in Cuyahoga County that could institute an <b>urban</b> land <b>conservation</b> program. As our human population continues to move into and transform metropolitan areas, an <b>urban</b> land <b>conservation</b> strategy will provide an opportunity to establish natural areas where it is most needed and to lessen the pressure of the unwavering desire to live outside of the City...|$|R
