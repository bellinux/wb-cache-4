30|$|For {{the neat}} PC mix, the {{required}} amounts of resin and hardener were mixed together for 2 – 3  min using a low speed mixer, after which silica filling powder {{followed by the}} required coarse aggregate was added. Mixing continued for 2 – 3  min <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>was</b> uniform.

This relatively high mixing temperature was used to reduce the resin viscosity and improve the dispersion of MWCNTs. The mix was then sonicated for 2 additional hours at 65  °C. During the sonication, sound waves are generated from the transducer and radiate through the liquid causing high and low pressures releasing high amount of energy and improving the dispersion of MWCNTs. The epoxy-MWCNTs nanocomposite was left to reach room temperature and then mixed with the hardener for 2 – 3  min.

50|$|To {{make the}} dish, the kithul jaggery and thin coconut milk is mixed and boiled {{in a large}} pan <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> reduced to half the {{original}} amount.

30|$|The {{gelatinized starch}} (St) graft {{polyacrylamide}} sodium montmorillonite nanocomposite (PAAm-g-St/MMT) was synthesized by the free radical polymerization technique in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen using potassium persulphate (KPS) as an initiator (Ghorai et al. 2013; Mansoori et al. 2010). At first, MMT nanoparticles were dispersed in 150  mL {{double distilled water}} and stirred to form an aqueous dispersion of MMT nanoparticles in an ultrasonic bath (400  rpm) at room temperature <b>until</b> <b>the</b> full dispersion of MMT was obtained. Different MMT to monomer ratios (0.0005 – 0.0030) were used to obtain completely dispersed polymer matrix with MMT nanoparticles. The gelatinized starch was added to a 500 -mL three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser. The amount of gelatinized starch (1.0 – 3.0  g) was varied to produce the optimum grade of the nanocomposite. This flask was kept in an oil bath maintained at 60  °C. The dispersed solution of MMT was then added drop wise to the flask and allowed to mix <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>was</b> homogenized. After that, 20  mL aqueous solution containing 0.28  mol acrylamide monomer was poured into the flask having the dispersed starch–montmorillonite solution and was stirred for 45  min.

The high amount of MMT (> 2000  ppm) hindered the polymerization process, and the high amount of starch (> 2.0  g) resulted in a low product yield.

5000|$|Carburetor icing {{occurs when}} there is humid air, and the {{temperature}} drop in the venturi causes the water vapor to freeze. The venturi effect can drop the ambient air temperature by 30-40 degrees F, therefore carburetor icing often occurs when the outside air temperature is in the 60-70 degree F range. Unfortunately, the warm air temperature often causes pilots to overlook the possibility of carb icing. The ice will form on the surfaces of the carburetor throat, further restricting it. This may increase the Venturi effect initially, but eventually restricts airflow, perhaps even causing a complete blockage of air to the carburetor. The engine begins to run more rich as ice formation increases. Without intervention (carb heat or leaning) this can only continue <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> outside of the [...] "chemically correct" [...] range for combustion.

40|$|Accidental {{ignition}} of {{flammable gases}} {{is a critical}} safety concern in many industrial applications. Particularly in the aviation industry, the main areas of concern on an aircraft are the fuel tank and adjoining regions, where spilled fuel has a high likelihood of creating a flammable mixture. To this end, a fundamental understanding of the ignition phenomenon is {{necessary in order to}} develop more accurate test methods and standards as a means of designing safer air vehicles. The focus of this work is thermal ignition, particularly auto-ignition with emphasis on the effect of heating rate, hot surface ignition and flame propagation, and puffing flames. Combustion of hydrocarbon fuels is traditionally separated into slow reaction, cool flame, and ignition regimes based on pressure and temperature. Standard tests, such as the ASTM E 659, are used to determine the lowest temperature required to ignite a specific fuel mixed with air at atmospheric pressure. It is expected that the initial pressure and {{the rate at which the}} mixture is heated also influences the limiting temperature and the type of combustion. This study investigates the effect of heating rate, between 4 and 15 K/min, and initial pressure, in the range of 25 to 100 kPa, on ignition of n-hexane air mixtures. Mixtures with equivalence ratio ranging from 0. 6 to = 1. 2 were investigated. The problem is also modeled computationally using an extension of Semenov's classical auto-ignition theory with a detailed chemical mechanism. Experiments and simulations both show that in the same reactor either a slow reaction or an ignition event can take place depending on the heating rate. Analysis of the detailed chemistry demonstrates that a mixture which approaches the ignition region slowly undergoes a significant modification of its composition. This change in composition induces a progressive shift of the explosion limit <b>until</b> <b>the</b> <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> no longer flammable. A mixture that approaches the ignition region sufficiently rapidly undergoes only a moderate amount of thermal decomposition and explodes quite violently. This behavior can also be captured and analyzed using a one-step reaction model, where the heat release is in competition with the depletion of reactants. Hot surface ignition is examined using a glow plug or heated nickel element in a series of premixed n-hexane air mixtures. High-speed schlieren photography, a thermocouple, and a fast response pressure transducer are used to record flame characteristics such as ignition temperature, flame speed, pressure rises, and combustion mode. The ignition event is captured by considering the dominant balance of diffusion and chemical reaction that occurs near a hot surface. Experiments and models show a dependence of ignition temperature on mixture composition, initial pressure, and hot surface size. The mixtures exhibit the known lower flammability limit where the maximum temperature of the hot surface was insufficient at igniting the mixture. Away from the lower flammability limit, the ignition temperature drops to an almost constant value over a wide range of equivalence ratios (0. 7 to 2. 8) with large variations as the upper flammability limit is approached. Variations in the initial pressure and equivalence ratio also give rise to different modes of combustion: single flame, re-ignition, and puffing flames. These results are successfully compared to computational results obtained using a flamelet model and a detailed chemical mechanism for n-heptane. These different regimes can be delineated by considering the competition between inertia, i. e., flame propagation, and buoyancy, which can be expressed in the Richardson number. In experiments of hot surface ignition and subsequent flame propagation a 10 Hz puffing flame instability is visible in mixtures that are stagnant and premixed prior to the ignition sequence. By varying the size of the hot surface, power input, and combustion vessel volume, we determined that the instability is a function of the interaction of the flame with the fluid flow induced by the combustion products rather than the initial plume established by the hot surface. The phenomenon is accurately reproduced in numerical simulations and a detailed flow field analysis revealed a competition between the inflow velocity at the base of the flame and the flame propagation speed. The increasing inflow velocity, which exceeds the flame propagation speed, is ultimately responsible for creating a puff. The puff is then accelerated upward, allowing for the creation of the subsequent instabilities. The frequency of the puffing is proportional to the gravitational acceleration and inversely proportional to the flame speed. We propose a relation describing the dependence of the frequency on gravitational acceleration, hot surface diameter, and flame speed. This relation shows good agreement for lean and rich n-hexane-air as well as lean hydrogen-air flames. </p...|$|E
