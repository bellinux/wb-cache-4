5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case he noted a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes {{want to look like}} the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> to adopt a new fashion.|$|E
5|$|A {{full-time}} etiquette {{coach was}} hired to instruct the cast in the manners of the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> gentility in 1912. Despite this, several critics picked up on anachronisms in the film, not least involving the two main stars.|$|E
5|$|Brideshead Revisited (1981), {{based on}} Waugh's novel; a miniseries {{enormously}} popular in Britain and America, {{the film has}} sometimes been seen as drawing unwanted attention to Oxford's stereotypical reputation as a playground for the <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> It stars Jeremy Irons and most college shots are of Christ Church and Hertford.|$|E
50|$|While {{emerging}} adulthood exemplars {{are found}} mainly within {{the middle and}} <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> of OECD countries, the stage of development still seems to occur across classes, with {{the main difference between}} different ones being length—on average, young people in lower social classes tend to enter adulthood two years before those in <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R

Salih also confiscated the estates of numerous <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> Aleppines.|$|E

Women of the <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> are documented as owning and running shipping corporations.|$|R

5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the <b>upper</b> <b>class.</b> The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} {{to establish an}} officer candidate school to train an indigenous officer corps from among Haiti's educated <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> failed due to a reluctance among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American occupation, and by {{the perception that the}} methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month.|$|E
50|$|Having {{what was}} {{described}} as a brilliant education herself,a reputation for great learning, and a wide net of contacts in high society, she founded a pension or a Finishing school for girls from the <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> in Stockholm. For about fifteen years, this was regarded as the finest school for girls in the capital and popular among the <b>upper</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Originally, burlesque {{performances}} included comic sketches lampooning the <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> {{and high}} art, such as opera, Shakespearean drama, and classical ballet. The genre developed alongside vaudeville and ran on competing circuits. Possibly due to historical social {{tensions between the}} <b>upper</b> <b>classes</b> and lower classes of society, much of the humor and entertainment of later American burlesque focused on lowbrow and ribald subjects.|$|R

5|$|In Roman times, {{poisoning}} {{carried out}} {{at the dinner table}} or common eating or drinking area was not unheard of, or even uncommon, and was happening as early as 331 BC. These poisonings would have been used for self-advantageous reasons in every class of the social order. The writer Livy describes the poisoning of members of the <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> and nobles of Rome, and Roman emperor Nero is known to have favored the use of poisons on his relatives, even hiring a personal poisoner. His preferred poison was said to be cyanide.|$|E
5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe is a more historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E

5|$|Luís Alves' grandfather, José Joaquim, was a Portuguese {{military}} {{officer who had}} emigrated in 1767 to Brazil. He settled {{in the city of}} Rio de Janeiro, capital of both the Rio de Janeiro captaincy and of Brazil. He had neither noble rank nor noble ancestry and lacked patrons in an environment in which advancement depended upon exchanges of favors and family connections. Having fought against the Spaniards on Brazil's southern frontiers, he secured a place for himself in Rio de Janeiro's <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> when he married a member of a local and influential family.|$|E
5|$|Medieval Spanish explorers {{arriving}} in the islands during the 14th century reported the Guanche buried individuals of low social status in sandy graves, while <b>upper</b> <b>class</b> members were mummified and laid to rest in secluded caves. One of these mortuary caves may have held up to 1,000 mummies, however, many of these have disappeared with only 20 complete mummies left on the islands. The loss of such {{a large amount of}} mummies is generally attributed to the popularity of mummia, a pharmaceutical substance created out of pulverized mummies.|$|E
5|$|Public {{interest}} in the scandal eventually faded.

In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|The Titanics {{passengers}} {{were divided into}} three separate classes, determined {{not only by the}} price of their ticket but by wealth and social class: those travelling in first class, most of them the wealthiest passengers on board, included prominent members of the <b>upper</b> <b>class,</b> businessmen, politicians, high-ranking military personnel, industrialists, bankers, entertainers, socialites, and professional athletes. Second class {{passengers were}} middle class travellers and included professors, authors, clergymen, and tourists. Third class or steerage passengers were primarily emigrants moving to the United States and Canada.|$|E
