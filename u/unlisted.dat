5|$|Some of the {{buildings}} on Lindsey Street opposite the East Market were demolished in 2010 to allow {{the construction of the}} new Crossrail Station at Farringdon. The demolished buildings include Smithfield House (an early 20th-century <b>unlisted</b> Hennebique concrete building), the Edmund Martin Ltd. shop (an earlier building with alterations dating to the 1930s) and two Victorian warehouses behind them.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} filmed on sets that are an exact {{replica of the}} house. Details such as Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows, and {{hammered}} bronze light fixtures, were re-created to preserve {{the look of the}} house. The house became available for rent on Airbnb for six months, beginning February 2016, before being <b>unlisted.</b>|$|E
5|$|Google is a {{computer}} software and a web search engine company that has been acquiring, on average, more than one company per week in 2010 and 2011. The table below is an incomplete list of acquisitions, with each acquisition listed being for the respective company in its entirety, unless otherwise specified. The acquisition date listed is {{the date of the}} agreement between Google and the acquisition subject. As Google is headquartered in the United States, acquisition is listed in US dollars. If the price of an acquisition is <b>unlisted,</b> then it is undisclosed. If the Google service that is derived from the acquired company is known, then it is also listed here. Google itself was re-organized into a subsidiary of a larger holding company known as Alphabet Inc. in 2015.|$|E
5|$|On August 6, 1981, Ray Taylor {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} Jack Bridges in a fight in Chicago. In advance of the trial, the {{prosecutor}} submitted a request for all the defense witnesses in the case. The defense attorney for Taylor provided a list of four individuals, which did not include witnesses Alfred Wormley and Pam Berkhalter. When the defendant tried to introduce these witnesses {{on the second day of}} the trial, the trial judge sanctioned the defense for failing to put the witness names on the original list provided to the prosecution. Therefore, it ruled the two <b>unlisted</b> witnesses would not be allowed to testify. The trial judge was specifically frustrated that the witness, Wormley, was known to the defense prior to trial, but was hidden away from the prosecution.|$|E
5|$|The Princess Block {{disappeared}} from Henderson’s Directory, a local city directory, in 1956, implying that its researchers {{thought it was}} completely vacant. The building was re-included in 1960, but the theatre's former address at 10337 Whyte Avenue remained vacant and <b>unlisted</b> for another six years. By 1966, the exterior doors had been removed entirely to create storefronts (see photo), and the theatre itself had been occupied by Quick Cash Exchange, a pawnshop. The third floor was split into several apartments, while the second floor was entirely occupied by Strathcona TV and Columbia Photo Studio. The basement was still a pool hall, Princess Billiards.|$|E
25|$|As of April 2011, the Samsung Group {{comprised}} 59 <b>unlisted</b> {{companies and}} 19 listed companies, {{all of which}} had their primary listing on the Korea Exchange.|$|E
25|$|Although many of Barber's {{buildings}} are now listed, Spring Hall remains <b>unlisted,</b> although it retains its 17th-century cellars and many original 1871 features including the painted and galleried Arts and Crafts grand staircase.|$|E
25|$|Several Commodore 64 {{games were}} {{released}} on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console service in Europe and North America only. The games were <b>unlisted</b> {{from the service}} as of August 2013 for unknown reasons.|$|E

25|$|Weigman {{learned to}} phreak phones and phone networks; {{consequently}} {{he was able}} to shut off one’s phone service, dig up <b>unlisted</b> numbers, and listen in on conversations. Weigman also extensively employed the use of Caller ID spoofing by purchasing commercial services such as spoof cards.|$|E
25|$|This is an <b>unlisted</b> {{building}} in Killinghall, Harrogate, North Yorkshire. It {{is a large}} building for its simple, bell-gable design. It retains its original pews, font and pulpit. It has two bells by John Taylor of Loughborough and Mears & Stainbank, plus a clock with tower mechanism.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Weigman {{learned to}} gain access to Verizon and AT by imitating an {{employee}} of the company. Weigman was known for “conning telecom employees into believing he was a colleague {{to gain access to}} <b>unlisted</b> numbers, the ability to shut off a rival's service or listen in on others' calls”.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Shelbourne, who {{had beaten}} Glenavon in one semi-final, were awarded the Cup {{after the other}} semi-final was {{declared}} null and void as both of the clubs involved were ejected from the competition: Belfast Celtic after Celtic fans fired shots at Glentoran supporters during a riot, and Glentoran for fielding an <b>unlisted</b> player.|$|E
25|$|The {{governance}} {{activities of}} Council {{are supported by}} the Constitution of the Company and the Bond University ACT 1987 which gives statutory authority to the University and confirms its university status. The University is constituted as a Company limited by guarantee and {{is subject to the}} provisions of the Corporations Act as an <b>unlisted</b> public company.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} remained <b>unlisted.</b> The {{building was}} featured in the Channel 4 series Demolition in 2005. At the same time general interest in the car park increased, partly {{as a reflection of}} the recognition of Get Carter as a classic of British cinema, with Sylvester Stallone lending his weight to the calls for it to be preserved as a cinematic landmark.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{processing}} {{locked out}} the possibility of an <b>unlisted</b> religion, or any religious affiliation other than Muslim, Christian, or Jewish. Consequently, adherents of any other faith (or no faith) became unable to obtain any government identification documents (such as national identification cards, birth certificates, death certificates, marriage or divorce certificates, or passports) necessary to exercise their rights in their country unless they lied about their religion.|$|E
25|$|In the European Union (EU), the European {{parliament}} {{passed a}} regulation in July 2002 requiring companies listed in EU based stock exchanges to prepare their {{consolidated financial statements}} {{in accordance with the}} IFRS from 2005. Countries within the EU were allowed to make IFRS adoption optional for <b>unlisted</b> companies and for unconsolidated holding company financial statements, and were allowed to make several exceptions to IFRS adoption in 2005, for example for companies whose only listed securities were debt securities.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Westpac {{bought out}} the {{share in the}} {{development}} of C. Ito and Shimizu, and took over the AGC share in the property. Westpac put the tower's leasehold on the market in late 1996 at a hefty discount to its development cost. The leasehold was purchased in April 1997 by Schroders Property for $106 million. The acquisition was structured as a 50-50 joint venture between the Schroders Property Fund and the <b>unlisted</b> Schroders Private Property Syndicate.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{receipts}} {{of funds}} from the federal government, states and territories have their own taxes, in many cases as slightly different rates. State taxes commonly include payroll tax levied on businesses, a poker-machine tax on businesses that offer gambling services, land tax on people and businesses that own land and most significantly, stamp duty on sales of land (in every state) and other items (chattels in some states, <b>unlisted</b> shares in others, and even sales of contracts in some states).|$|E
25|$|Little Birdy {{undertook}} {{their own}} concerts throughout Australia in 2004 and 2005. They supported R.E.M. during the Australian leg {{of their world}} tour in 2005. Little Birdy appeared at national festivals in 2007, including Falls Festival, Big Day Out, Sonic Bloom Festival, Southbound (in Busselton, Western Australia), and Great Escape Festival (Sydney). The band played at the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne and supported Eskimo Joe's national tour in May. They were <b>unlisted</b> performers at the 18th East Coast Blues & Roots Music Festival.|$|E
25|$|Unveiled in 2006, the ABM {{project was}} a {{surprise}} to many observers. While DRDO had revealed some details about the project over the years, its progress had been marked by strict secrecy, and the project itself was <b>unlisted,</b> and not visible among DRDO's other programmes. The ABM project has benefited from all the incremental improvements achieved by the DRDO and its associated industrial partners via the long-running and often contentious Akash missile and Trishul missile programmes. However, it is a completely new programme, with much larger scope and with predominantly new subsystems.|$|E
25|$|In April 2007, My Maps was a {{new feature}} added to Google's local search maps. My Maps lets users and {{businesses}} create their own map by positioning markers, polylines and polygons onto a map. The interface is a straightforward overlay on the map. A set of eighty-four pre-designed markers is available, ranging from bars and restaurants to webcam and earthquake symbols. Poly line and Polygon color, width and opacity are selectable. Maps modified using My Maps can be saved for later viewing and made public or marked as <b>unlisted,</b> in which case a user will need the saved URL with a 42-character unique ID.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a debate}} around the {{distinction}} between private equity and foreign direct investment (FDI), and whether to treat them separately. The difference is blurred on account of private equity not entering the country through the stock market. Private equity generally flows to <b>unlisted</b> firms and to firms where the percentage of shares is smaller than the promoter- or investor-held shares (also known as free-floating shares). The main point of contention is that FDI is used solely for production, whereas {{in the case of}} private equity the investor can reclaim their money after a revaluation period and make investments in other financial assets. At present, most countries report private equity as a part of FDI.|$|E
25|$|The club prospered and by 1925 had {{purchased}} the freehold. Arsenal's subsequent success made Highbury well known, albeit initially with depressing effect on nearby housing. In 2006 the club moved to Ashburton Grove {{on the west}} side of Drayton Park in Highbury. The old stadium was converted into a luxury housing complex known as Highbury Square, with the two listed main stands being converted into apartments, ensuring their original exteriors remained almost entirely preserved. The <b>unlisted</b> North Bank and Clock End stands have been demolished to make way for entirely new apartment blocks. The pitch has been converted into a garden, with private gym and swimming pool located underneath it. Today, property in the area around the old Highbury stadium is highly sought after, and prices for apartments within the stadium start at £300k.|$|E
25|$|Among general {{reasons for}} {{harmful effects of}} dietary {{supplements}} are: a) absorption in a short time; b) quality and contamination; and c) enhancing {{both positive and negative}} effects at the same time. The number of incidents of liver damage from dietary supplements has tripled in a decade. Most of the products causing that effect were bodybuilding supplements. Some of the victims required liver transplants and some died. A third of the supplements involved contained <b>unlisted</b> steroids. Mild to severe toxicity has occurred on many occasions due to dietary supplements, even when the active ingredients were essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals or amino acids. This has been a result of adulteration of the product, excessive usage {{on the part of the}} consumer, or use by persons at risk for the development of adverse effects. In addition, a number of supplements contain psychoactive drugs, whether of natural or synthetic origin.|$|E
25|$|Some representatives mistrusted {{proposals}} to enlarge federal powers, {{because they were}} concerned about the inherent risks of centralizing power. Federalists, including James Madison, initially argued that a bill of rights was unnecessary, sufficiently confident that the federal government could never raise a standing army powerful enough to overcome a militia. Federalist Noah Webster argued that an armed populace would have no trouble resisting the potential threat to liberty of a standing army. Anti-federalists, on the other hand, advocated amending the Constitution with clearly defined and enumerated rights providing more explicit constraints on the new government. Many Anti-federalists feared the new federal government would choose to disarm state militias. Federalists countered that in listing only certain rights, <b>unlisted</b> rights might lose protection. The Federalists realized there was insufficient support to ratify the Constitution without a bill of rights and so they promised to support amending the Constitution to add a bill of rights following the Constitution's adoption. This compromise persuaded enough Anti-federalists to vote for the Constitution, allowing for ratification. The Constitution was declared ratified on June 21, 1788, when nine of the original thirteen states had ratified it. The remaining four states later followed suit, although the last two states, North Carolina and Rhode Island, ratified only after Congress had passed the Bill of Rights and sent it to the states for ratification. James Madison drafted what ultimately became the Bill of Rights, which was proposed by the first Congress on June 8, 1789, and was adopted on December 15, 1791.|$|E
500|$|... "The special {{character}} of Hebden {{is defined by}} a historic settlement pattern of great significance together {{with a collection of}} important listed buildings and a group of <b>unlisted</b> buildings which, although essentially vernacular and humble in architectural terms, combine well together to create a harmonious and generally high quality environment of buildings, open spaces and tree cover. In addition, the setting is very distinctive with natural topography of surrounding hills and adjacent steep sided valley combining with a man made agricultural landscape of some age and significance in its own right." ...|$|E
500|$|Completed in 1871, the rebuilt {{light had}} a {{dwelling}} with the attached tower containing a fourth-order Fresnel lens. It retained the original fixed red light, but {{also included a}} fog bell. In 1900, the lighthouse was identified in the Light List as having a red screw-pile structure, a white tower and dwelling with a slate-gray Mansard roof topped with a black lantern. The lighthouse had a fog signal that sounded every 15 seconds and was operated by machinery. Although the focal height of the light is <b>unlisted,</b> {{the center of the}} light stood [...] above the ground.|$|E
500|$|By 1985 {{the band}} were playing {{regularly}} around Melbourne and soon released a 10-track demo composed of selections from their recordings followed by their début single, [...] "Defecate on My Face" [...] (1986), a 7" [...] vinyl record packaged in a 12" [...] sleeve with all four sides glued shut. This song {{is also found}} (but is <b>unlisted)</b> on the EP Form and Meaning Reach Ultimate Communion as a country version. Their next single, [...] "40 Years – Then Death" [...] (1987), was released on transparent vinyl in a clear plastic sleeve with no cover art or labels. This Is Serious Mum's first radio-friendly single, despite the obscure packaging, was received well.|$|E
500|$|The {{hidden track}} [...] "Honey" [...] is a percussive, lighthearted love song that {{contains}} a sample of singer Nancy Wilson's 1978 song [...] "I'm in Love". The track opens with a reprise of [...] "Amerykahn Promise", with an announcer saying, [...] "We hope you enjoyed your journey and now we’re putting control of you back to you", and a countdown leading to [...] "Honey". According to Badu, the song is about [...] "a lover, a fictitious character named Slim, who I'm chasing." [...] Allmusic's Andy Kellman commented that the song is included as an <b>unlisted</b> track as [...] "it doesn't fit into the album's fabric, what with its drifting, deeply sweetened, synth-squish-and-string-drift groove." ...|$|E
500|$|Today, {{there are}} over a million rare and {{valuable}} works {{of art in the}} permanent collection of the Palace Museum, including paintings, ceramics, seals, steles, sculptures, inscribed wares, bronze wares, enamel objects, etc. A new inventory of the Museum's collections was conducted between 2004 and 2010. Subsequently, the Palace Museum was shown to hold a total of 1,807,558 artefacts and includes 1,684,490 items designated as nationally protected [...] "valuable cultural relics." [...] At the end of 2016, the Palace Museum held a press conference, announcing that 55,132 previously <b>unlisted</b> items had been discovered in an inventory check carried out from 2014 to 2016. The total number of items in the Palace Museum collection is presently at 1,862,690 objects.|$|E
500|$|The song [...] "The Diamond Sea" [...] {{is notable}} for its 19:35 duration. Moore {{explained}} {{the length of}} some of the album's songs: [...] "We all have different aesthetics as to how songs should work. I generally push for a lot of abandon while some people in the group are more interested in truncating things. If I was the leader as much as people say I am, every song would be 20 minutes long". The <b>unlisted</b> ninth track, officially called [...] "Becuz Coda", was originally part of the song [...] "Becuz", but the record label felt they needed to cut the seven-and-a-half-minute track to make the album's opening more accessible. The album was produced by Sonic Youth and John Siket, who also engineered the band's previous two albums. Audio mixing took place at Greene Street Studios in New York City in June 1995.|$|E
500|$|Having {{spent some}} US$4 billion {{during this period}} under the {{stewardship}} of Kikukawa, the company's aggressive strategy of external growth was not without criticism. According to an Olympus employee, the acquisitions process and funds movements were under the tight control of a small circle of executives in the 'Financial Affairs Group'. Japanese business daily {{is quoted as saying}} more than a hundred businesses were acquired during Kikukawa's tenure, and that the majority were <b>unlisted</b> and loss-making. The investments were in diverse sectors such as pet care and DVD production, and often had little connection with the core Olympus business. The most significant acquisition was the British medical equipment maker Gyrus Group, acquired in 2008 at a cost of $2billion – the equivalent of almost 5 times turnover and 27 times EBITDA. In the same year, Olympus also paid out ¥73.5billion ($965 million) when it acquired three [...] "small venture firms" [...] – Altis, Humalabo, and NewsChef. By contrast, in 2009 Olympus sold the profitable diagnostics unit it had built up over 40 years to Beckman Coulter for $1 billion – approximately two times turnover – to free up capital.|$|E
500|$|During a {{late night}} drug raid, Batman, the vigilante {{protector}} of Gotham City, discovers that the drug dealer he was tracking has already been assaulted and left for police to find. Next to his unconscious body is a spray painted Circle-A, announcing {{the arrival of a}} new vigilante, Anarky. Anarky continues his war against crime by targeting a business owner dumping pollutants in a river. Batman recognizes his M.O. and realizes he is attacking people based on the complaints raised in letters to the editor in a local newspaper. He alerts the police, who plan stake-outs at several events based on the letters. When Anarky strikes next, however, it is at a construction site <b>unlisted</b> in the paper. Anarky rallies the homeless to riot in response to the destruction of their [...] "Cardboard City", which has been bulldozed to build a new bank. Batman arrives but is attacked by the homeless mob so that Anarky may flee. The mob includes Legs, a homeless Vietnam veteran who Alan Grant would utilize as a partner for Anarky in future stories. Batman eventually catches Anarky, revealing him to be a disguised, twelve-year-old paperboy named Lonnie Machin. As a child prodigy with extensive knowledge of both radical philosophy and improvised munitions, Lonnie was confident that violent change was necessary to improve social conditions. Batman condemns his actions, but expresses admiration for his idealism.|$|E
