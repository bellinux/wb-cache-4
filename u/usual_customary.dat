Objective. To determine the efficacy of Hand and Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy Including Lower Extremity (HABIT-ILE) for children with USCP. Methods. Twenty-four children with USCP were randomized into 2 groups: an immediate HABIT-ILE group (IHG, initially receiving HABIT-ILE, 10 days = 90 hours), and a delayed HABIT-ILE group (DHG), which continued their conventional/ongoing treatment for an intended total duration of 90 hours. In phase 2, children in the DHG were crossed over to receive HABIT-ILE and children of the IHG were followed in their ongoing conventional therapy. Children were assessed using the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA, primary outcome), the ABILHAND-Kids, and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory. Dexterity (Box and Blocks Test [BBT]) and pinch strength were also measured. Locomotor abilities were assessed with Six-Minute Walk Test (6 MWT, primary outcome) and ABILOCO-kids. Social participation was measured with the Assessment of Life-HABITs. Results. A 2 (groups) × 3 (test sessions) analysis of variance indicated significant improvements for primary outcomes (AHA, P <. 001; 6 MWT, P =. 002) and all secondary assessments except BBT, step length and bodyweight distribution following HABIT-ILE, but not conventional therapy. Conclusion.

40|$|Abstract Background Residual {{disability}} after stroke is substantial; 65 % {{of patients}} at 6 months {{are unable to}} incorporate the impaired upper extremity into daily activities. Task-oriented training programs are rapidly being adopted into clinical practice. In {{the absence of any}} consensus on the essential elements or dose of task-specific training, an urgent need exists for a well-designed trial to determine the effectiveness of a specific multidimensional task-based program governed by a comprehensive set of evidence-based principles. The Interdisciplinary Comprehensive Arm Rehabilitation Evaluation (ICARE) Stroke Initiative is a parallel group, three-arm, single blind, superiority randomized controlled trial of a theoretically-defensible, upper extremity rehabilitation program provided in the outpatient setting. The primary objective of ICARE is to determine if there is a greater improvement in arm and hand recovery one year after randomization in participants receiving a structured training program termed Accelerated Skill Acquisition Program (ASAP), compared to participants receiving <b>usual</b> and <b>customary</b> therapy of an equivalent dose (DEUCC). Two secondary objectives are to compare ASAP to a true (active monitoring only) <b>usual</b> and <b>customary</b> (UCC) therapy group and to compare DEUCC and UCC. Methods/design Following baseline assessment, participants are randomized by site, stratified for stroke duration and motor severity. 360 adults will be randomized, 14 to 106 days following ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke onset, with mild to moderate upper extremity impairment, recruited at sites in Atlanta, Los Angeles and Washington, D. C. The Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT) time score is the primary outcome at 1 year post-randomization. The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) hand domain is a secondary outcome measure. The design includes concealed allocation during recruitment, screening and baseline, blinded outcome assessment and intention to treat analyses. Our primary hypothesis is that the improvement in log-transformed WMFT time will be greater for the ASAP than the DEUCC group. This pre-planned hypothesis will be tested at a significance level of 0. 05. Discussion ICARE will test whether ASAP is superior to the same number of hours of usual therapy. Pre-specified secondary analyses will test whether 30 hours of usual therapy is superior to current <b>usual</b> and <b>customary</b> therapy not controlled for dose.

Methods: Eight cancer patients (65 ± 11 yrs) completed this study, five exercising and three non-exercising controls.
