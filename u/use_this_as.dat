5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a starting point for the defence.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex {{may have been}} similar to extant ants within the subfamily. These ants foraged {{on the ground and}} possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods. These ants may have collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a food source. Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. Workers would have relied on their vision to hunt for prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E

5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E
5|$|In Beswick v Beswick {{an uncle}} gifted his nephew a business, on the {{condition}} that the nephew would pay the uncle (Mr Beswick) a certain amount per week, and in the event of the uncle's death, give a similar amount to his widow (Mrs Beswick). When the uncle died the nephew refused to pay the widow the money required, arguing that as she was not party to the original agreement she could not benefit from it. The Court of Appeal under Lord Denning tried to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> an opportunity to claim that the doctrine of privity was invalid, something the House of Lords rejected. However, the Lords did agree that Mrs Beswick could sue, not as a third party to the contract but as the executrix of her husband's estate. As executrix she would be acting as a representative of Mr Beswick, and the doctrine of privity would not apply.|$|E

25|$|After leaving, Belgrano wrote {{again to}} San Martín, advising him to {{strictly}} abide {{to the local}} religious customs.

25|$|Although {{the exact}} {{sequence}} of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the troika nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables.))

25|$|Thus, one may <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> an axiom schema in {{the place}} of the axioms of empty set and pairing. Normally, however, one uses the axioms of empty set and pairing separately, and then proves this as a theorem schema. Note that {{adopting}} this as an axiom schema will not replace the axiom of union, which is still needed for other situations.|$|E
25|$|Others {{have argued}} that {{regardless}} of {{the merits of the}} case, it was politically unwise for those worried about Hong Kong legal autonomy to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a test case to assert Hong Kong's judicial independence, since it is the general consensus that the Hong Kong public tended to support the position of the SAR government as well as the legal interpretation of the NPCSC.|$|E

25|$|Violations {{of trade}} treaty {{obligations}} by Austria were considered by Napoleon to be insufficient grounds for a war. There was discussion {{of whether the}} presence of an Austrian military garrison in Bologna might justify war against Austria, but the French emperor was in the end reluctant to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a pretext. There were Austrian troops not only in Bologna but also in Rome preserving the status quo, but in Rome there were also French troops for broadly similar reasons, and parallels between the garrisoning of Bologna and of Rome were uncomfortably close.|$|E
25|$|Many {{programs}} added UTF-8 conversions for UCS-2 {{data and}} did not alter this UTF-8 conversion when UCS-2 was replaced with the surrogate-pair using UTF-16. In such programs each half of a UTF-16 surrogate pair is encoded as its own three-byte UTF-8 encoding, resulting in six-byte sequences rather than four bytes for characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane. Oracle and MySQL databases <b>use</b> <b>this,</b> <b>as</b> well as Java and Tcl as described below, and probably many Windows programs where the programmers were unaware of the complexities of UTF-16. Although this non-optimal encoding is generally not deliberate, a supposed benefit is that it preserves UTF-16 binary sorting order when CESU-8 is binary sorted.|$|E
25|$|Carcetti {{watches a}} news {{report about the}} exhumed bodies and {{discusses}} the political implications with his staff. Norman Wilson remarks that the bodies are attributable to the Royce administration and Michael Steintorf, the new chief of staff, states that the silver lining {{of the story is}} that it draws attention away from the massive school deficit. Steintorf counsels that they should <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> cover to avoid dealing with the deficit as it would hamstring Carcetti's plans to run for governor and that Carcetti will have the funds to address the city's education problems when he becomes governor. Wilson is disappointed to see that Carcetti is willing to trade fulfilling his responsibilities as mayor with increasing his chances of becoming governor.|$|E

25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could cut him off.|$|E
25|$|On 27 October 1496, the Chapter of Notre Dame Cathedral {{ordered all}} the priests in the diocese {{to give up}} any women they were living with. There was violent {{opposition}} to this. The following year he got one vote in the election for Archbishop of Rheims and Jan was persuaded to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> {{a challenge to the}} dubious methods used by the winner, the candidate of the King. Charles VIII had died and the new king, Louis XII was crowned by the new archbishop at Rheims Cathedral on 17 December 1498. To consolidate his position, Louis divorced his wife, Jeanne, and married the widow, Queen Anne, of the late King, who had been his nephew. Jan unwisely advised the Queen against the marriage and preached against divorce (interestingly enough, except in cases of adultery). Early the following year, he, along with the other Doctors in the University went on strike in protest against what they saw as unlawful interference in their affairs by the King. He was prominent in setting out their case. He also helped one of the more forceful opponents of the divorce escape. The King got his divorce and set about punishing his opponents. Standonck was lucky to get only two years exile. He handed over direction of the College to Noël Béda and John Mair and set off to Cambrai in his native Flanders, where he was welcomed by the Bishop.|$|E
