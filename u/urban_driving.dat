Obligatory lessons include a minimum number of lessons each driving on: the motorway Autobahn; rural areas, and in the dark.

25|$|Mild hybrid, is {{a vehicle}} that cannot be driven solely on its {{electric}} motor, because the electric motor {{does not have enough}} power to propel the vehicle on its own. Mild hybrids only include some of the features found in hybrid technology, and usually achieve limited fuel consumption savings, up to 15 percent in <b>urban</b> <b>driving</b> and 8 to 10 percent overall cycle. A mild hybrid is essentially a conventional vehicle with oversize starter motor, allowing the engine to be turned off whenever the car is coasting, braking, or stopped, yet restart quickly and cleanly. The motor is often mounted between the engine and transmission, taking the place of the torque converter, and is used to supply additional propulsion energy when accelerating. Accessories can continue to run on electrical power while the gasoline engine is off, and as in other hybrid designs, the motor is used for regenerative braking to recapture energy. As compared to full hybrids, mild hybrids have smaller batteries and a smaller, weaker motor/generator, which allows manufacturers to reduce cost and weight.|$|E
25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and <b>urban</b> <b>driving</b> with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as you would a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal is to get the brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E

40|$|The heavy {{computational}} burden {{associated with the}} application of the traditional DP strategy to the energy management of range-extended electric buses poses a serious problem. On the basis of one Chinese typical <b>urban</b> bus <b>driving</b> cycle, an optimal control strategy is designed according to the SOC consumption trend, which is optimized by the DP algorithm. The dissipative energy and the energy-traction efficiency are our evaluation indices. The energy efficiencies of the powertrain system and components are analyzed by the energy flow diagram method. The results show that when the range-extended electric bus runs 35 Chinese typical <b>urban</b> bus <b>driving</b> cycles, the energy consumption and the energy efficiency of the powertrain system, which are optimized by the traditional DP strategy, can reach 2844. 28 [*]MJ and 31. 29 %, respectively.

The energy consumption and the energy efficiency of the powertrain system, which are based on one driving cycle optimal strategy, can reach 2857. 69 [*]MJ and 31. 14 %, respectively.
