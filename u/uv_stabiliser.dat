40|$|A {{variety of}} iron {{compounds}} containing vinyl or thiol functional groups (used as photoactivators) have been synthesised {{and some of}} these were successfully bound to both polyethylene and polypropylene backbones during processing in the presence of peroxide and interlinking agent. Concentrates (masterbatches) of the photoactivators in PP and PE were prepared and the pro-oxidant effect of the diluted masterbatches in absence and presence of an antioxidant was evaluated. An antioxidant photoactivator (FeDNC) was found to sensitise the photoactivity of pro-oxidants (Metone A / Metone M) whereas an antioxidant (ZnDNC) was found to stabilise the polymer (PP and PE) containing both of these combinations. It was observed that the lower concentration of FeDNC sensitises the stability of the polymer containing very small concentration of NiDNC whereas higher concentration of FeDNC stabilises the polymer (LDPE) containing same amount of NiDNC compared to FeDNC alone. The photostability of unstabilised PP containing FeAc could be varied by varying the concentration of ZnDEC. Both the induction period and the UV - life time of the polymer increased by increasing concentration of ZnDEC. It is suggested that ligand exchange reaction may take place between FeAc and ZnDNC. A polymer bound <b>UV</b> <b>stabiliser</b> (HAEB) and a thermal stabiliser (DBBA) were used with a non extractable photoactivator (FeAc) in PP. Small concentrations of the stabilisers (HAEB and DBBA) in combination with the photoactivator (FeAc) sensitise the polymer. The antioxidant present in commercial polymer (LDPE and PP) was found to be of a hindered phenol type, which was found to antagonise with ZnDNC when used in combination with the photoactivators...|$|E

M. 1, 21 Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing EngineeringFaculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra MalaysiaSelangor, Malaysia. 2 Biocomposite LaboratoryInstitute of Tropical Forestry and Forest Product (INTROP) Universiti Putra Malaysia, Selangor, Malaysia. Email: umarhanan@yahoo. com ABSTRACTIn this study, a {{high-density}} polyethylene composite reinforced with kenaf (Hibiscus Cannabinus L.) bast fibres (K-HDPE) was fabricated and {{tested for durability}} with regard to weather elements. The material consists of 40 % (by weight) fibres and 60 % matrix. Other additives, such as ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>stabiliser</b> and maleic anhydride grafted polyethylene (MaPE) as a coupling agent {{were added to the}} composite material. The biocomposite was subjected to 1000 hours (h) of accelerated weathering tests, which consisted of heat, moisture and UV light, intended to imitate the outdoor environment. The tensile properties of the K-HDPE composite were recorded after 0, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 h of exposure to the accelerated weathering. Compared with neat {{high-density polyethylene}} (HDPE), the K-HDPE composite has 22. 7 % lower tensile strength when produced but displays a less rapid rate of strength deterioration under weathering (After 1000 h of exposure the tensile strength of K-HDPE drops 29. 4 %, whereas, for neat HDPE, it falls rapidly by 36 %). Due to better stiffness, the Young’s modulus of the K-HDPE composite is much higher than that of neat HDPE. The fibres {{on the surface of the}} K-HDPE composite gradually start to whiten after 200 h of exposure and become completely white after 600 h of exposure. For neat HDPE, micro-cracking on the surface can be observed after 200 h of exposure and the stress-strain curve obtained from the tensile test indicates its increase in brittleness proportional to the amount of weathering time...|$|E
40|$|Photochromic {{surface coating}} on {{textiles}} may create new fashion opportunities. It also enhances the ultraviolet (UV) protection {{ability of the}} coated products. In this study, a spirooxazine dye and a silane that bears a long alkyl chain {{have been used to}} produce hybrid photochromic silica coatings on wool fabrics. Four stabilisers are added separately to the photochromic silica coatings to examine their influence on photostability and photochromic behaviour. It is found that the addition of <b>UV</b> <b>stabilisers</b> slightly reduces the photochromic response speed and photochromic absorption. However, the addition of <b>UV</b> <b>stabilisers</b> to the photochromic coating considerably improves the photochromic lifetime. Among the four <b>UV</b> <b>stabilisers</b> studied, the quencher results in the best improvement to photostability with the lowest reduction in photochromic absorption...|$|R

50|$|Phototendering is {{the process}} by which organic fibres and {{textiles}} lose strength and flexibility as a result of exposure to sunlight. It is the ultraviolet component of the sun's spectrum which affects fibres, causing chain degradation and hence loss of strength. The rate of deterioration is also affected by pigments and dyes present in the textiles. Pigments themselves can also be affected, generally fading after exposure. Great care is needed to preserve museum artefacts from the harmful effects of UV light, which can also be present in fluorescent lamps. Many synthetic polymers are also degraded by UV light, and <b>UV</b> <b>stabilisers</b> are added to many thermoplastics.|$|R
40|$|A thermogravimetric {{method was}} used to measure the vapour {{pressures}} of a series of hydroxybenzophenone <b>UV</b> <b>stabilisers.</b> Enthalpies of vaporisation were determined from the slope of a plot of the logarithm of the vapour pressure against reciprocal absolute temperature. Enthalpies of sublimation were measured either directly by the same method or by summing the enthalpy of vaporisation with the enthalpy of fusion determined by differential scanning calorimetry. Values of the vapour pressure at the melting temperature are given along with extrapolated values at 258 C and the estimated normal boiling temperature. Decreasing the hydrogen bonding potential within a series of compounds increases the volatility whereas increasing molecular weight has the opposite effect. # 1999 Elsevier Science B. V.

30|$|Phenolic benzotriazoles {{are used}} as <b>UV</b> <b>stabilisers</b> since they absorb the full {{spectrum}} of UV light. At the molecular level, UV radiation excites the phenolic benzotriazole. In this excited state, a proton from the OH group is transferred to a nitrogen atom. From this structure, a radiationless deactivation coupled with another proton transfer from the nitrogen back to the OH group will bring the molecule back to its ground state. The UV protection properties are based on this fully reversible and non-destructive process. Besides the group of benzophenones, phenolic benzotriazoles are technically the most important UV absorbers, especially for transparent plastic materials and coatings but also in certain personal care products. The different substitution patterns in ortho and para position to the hydroxyl group of the phenolic ring have effects on the solubility and the distinct coloration in different transparent plastic materials [17].|$|R
40|$|Key degradative {{processes}} for various polymers are itemised, together with photostabilisation mechanisms which can minimise these processes. Polymers can be conveniently classified as inherent absorbers, which absorb {{large amounts of}} solar uv, and as 2 ̆ 018 non-absorbers 2 ̆ 019, that is polymers transparent in the near uv. The former group which includes aramids, polycarbonates and polyesters is predominantly photodegraded by primary processes causing direct bond scission and stabilisation is best effected {{by the use of}} uv absorbing additives or opaque pigments. The 2 ̆ 018 non-absorbers 2 ̆ 019 include polyolefins and poly(vinylchloride) which are degraded as the result of oxidative chain processes initiated by chromophoric impurities. For polypropylene the dominant photooxidation product is hydroperoxide which photocleaves to initiate further oxidation. Various <b>uv.</b> <b>stabilisers</b> for polyolefins appear to owe their effectiveness to their ability to decompose hydroperoxide groups and/or to their ability to scavenge free radical intermediates in the oxidative process.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the photoselectivity of {{covering}} materials, four plastic films were tested in laboratory and under natural radiation evaluating R/FR and B/FR ratios. These films were: an experimental ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) photoselective film obtained by adding ultra violet (<b>UV)</b> <b>stabilisers</b> characterised by titania (PS); a film obtained by using copolymers of EVA featured with a specific photoselective screen giving an effect of reducing the plant shape and development (CLARIX Blue); an EVA film with high VA content characterised by total transmission of UV radiation (PATILUX TUV); an EVA photoselective film used for the protected cultivation of nectarines (IR Diffusive). The photoselective films tested for their potential use in orchard protection induced lower R/FR and B/FR ratios than characteristic of unaltered solar radiation. All the R/FR ratios of the tested films decreased slightly while the B/FR ratios decreased significantly {{for two of the}} photoselective materials (IR Diffusive film and PS film). The development of plastic films capable of modifying quality of radiation transmitted and of influencing the photomorphogenesis of the fruit trees by reducing vegetative elongation has potential economic benefits for fruit growers, due to decreased pruning costs and improved fruit quality...|$|R
40|$|Sulphur-free lignin {{coming from}} a novel alkaline-pulping process called NovaFiber, which has been {{developed}} by KIRAM AB, has been characterised and evaluated for potential applications. A Kraft lignin {{has been used for}} comparison. Considering the characterisation results of a NovaFiber softwood and Kraft lignin, it can be concluded that these lignins significantly differ in amounts of functional groups, molecular weight and acidity. This will affect their properties towards the potential applications studied in this project. The chemical composition and thermal stability to about 220 degreesC of both types of lignin are comparable. The "high molecular" NovaFiber lignin is totally different from the other lignins due to a high ash content, {{as a result of the}} different precipitation procedure used. This study has shown that NovaFiber lignin has a great potential as functional additive for UV stabilisation of thermoplastics and as part of a phenol formaldehyde-based wood adhesive. Initial results demonstrate that NovaFiber and Kraft lignin act as <b>UV</b> <b>stabilisers</b> in polyethylene with comparable or only slightly inferior product performance, with respect to UV exposure, compared to a relatively very expensive commercially applied stabiliser (HALS). This means that NovaFiber lignin has a very good price/performance ratio. Without loss of adhesive strength, 31 % of phenol formaldehyde can be replaced by NovaFiber and Kraft lignin in a wood adhesive. The adhesive properties have been improved to a level substantially higher than the phenol formaldehyde resin by using modified lignin, after sodium dithionite treatment, and/or by using a higher curing temperature. Furthermore, the processing of NovaFiber lignin is easier compared to Kraft lignin in respect of the mixing/solubility of the lignin in the thermoplastic or glue matrix and the amount of released odour seems to be much less.

40|$|An initial aim of {{this project}} was to {{evaluate}} the conventional techniques used {{in the analysis of}} newly prepared environmentally friendly water-borne automotive coatings and compare them with solvent-borne coatings having comparable formulations. The investigation was carried out on microtuned layers as well as on complete automotive multi-layer paint systems. Methods used included the very traditional methods of gloss and hardness and the commonly used photo-oxidation index (from FTIR spectral analysis). All methods enabled the durability to weathering of the automotive coatings to be initially investigated. However, a primary {{aim of this}} work was to develop methods for analysing the early stages of chemical and property changes in both the solvent-borne and water-borne coating systems that take place during outdoor natural weathering exposures and under accelerated artificial exposure. This was achieved by using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), in both tension mode on the microtomed films (on all depths of the coating systems from the uppermost clear-coat right down to the electron-coat) and bending mode of the full (unmicrotomed) systems, as well as MALDI-Tof analysis on the movement of the stabilisers in the full systems. Changes in glass transition temperature and relative cross-link density were determined after weathering and these were related to changes in the chemistries of the binder systems of the coatings after weathering. Concentration profiles of the UV-stabilisers (UVA and HALS) in the coating systems were analysed as a consequence of migration in the coating systems in separate microtomed layers of the paint samples (depth profiling) after weathering and diffusion co-efficient and solubility parameters were determined for the <b>UV</b> <b>stabilisers</b> in the coating systems. The methods developed were used to determine the various physical and chemical changes that take place during weathering of the different (water-borne and solvent-borne) systems (photoxidation). The solvent-borne formulations showed less changes after weathering (both natural and accelerated) than the corresponding water-borne formulations due to the lower level of cross-links in the binders of the water-borne systems. The silver systems examined were more durable than the blue systems due to the reflecting power of the aluminium and the lower temperature of the silver coatings.

40|$|This {{project is}} {{concerned}} with the deterioration of surface coatings as a result of weathering and exposure to a pollutant gas (in this case nitric oxide). Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) plastisol surface coatings have been exposed to natural and artificial weathering and a comparison of the effects of these two types of weathering has been made by use of various analytical techniques. These techniques have each been assessed as to their value in providing information regarding changes taking place in the coatings during ageing, and include, goniophotometry, micro-penetrometry, surface energy measurements, weight loss measurements, thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy. The results of each of these studies have then been combined to show the changes undergone by PVC plastisol surface coatings during ageing and to show the effects which additives to the coatings have on their behaviour and in particular the effects of plasticiser, pigment and <b>uv</b> and thermal <b>stabilisers.</b> Finally a preliminary study of the interaction between five commercial polymers and nitric oxide has been carried out, the polymers being polypropylene, cellulose acetate butyrate, polystyrene, polyethylene terephthalate and polycarbonate.
