5|$|According to the Provisional Population Totals 2011 {{census of}} India, the {{population}} of Gangtok Municipal Corporation has been estimated to be 98,658. Males constituted 53% {{of the population and}} females 47%. The Gangtok subdivision of the East Sikkim district had a population of 281,293, Gangtok has an average literacy rate of 82.17%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 85.33%, and female literacy is 78.68. About 8% of Gangtok's population live in the nine notified slums and squatter settlements, all on Government land. More people live in areas that depict slum-like characteristics but have not been notified as slums yet because they have developed on private land. Of the total urban population of Sikkim, Gangtok Municipal Corporation has a share of 55.5%. Including Gangtok, East District has a share of 88% of the total urban population. The quality of life, the pace of development and availability of basic infrastructure and employment prospects has been the major cause for rapid migration to the city. With this migration, the <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> are under pressure, intensified by the lack of availability of suitable land for infrastructure development.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Joaquín {{purchased}} land on {{the outskirts}} of Guadalajara with the intent of forming a small community made up exclusively by members of LLDM. The land was then sold at reduced prices to church members. The community included most necessities; services provided in Hermosa Provincia included health, education, and other <b>urban</b> <b>services,</b> which were provided in full after six years partly with help that the Church received from municipal and non-municipal authorities. This dependency upon outside assistance to obtain public services ended by 1959 when residents formed the Association of Colonists of Hermosa Provincia, which was used to directly petition the government. Hermosa Provincia received a white flag from the city for being the only neighborhood in the city that has eliminated illiteracy by the early 1970s. Joaquín started missionary efforts in Central America and by the early 1960s, La Luz del Mundo had 64 congregations and 35 missions. By 1964, after his death, the Church had between 20,000 and 30,000 members spread through five countries, including Mexico. The neighborhood became a standard model for the Church which has replicated it in many cities in Mexico and other countries.|$|E

25|$|Following the referendum's failure, Nashville annexed some 42 {{square miles}} of {{suburban}} jurisdictions to expand its tax base. This increased uncertainty among residents, and created resentment among many suburban communities. Under the second charter for metropolitan government, which was approved in 1962, two levels of service provision were proposed: the General Services District and the <b>Urban</b> <b>Services</b> District, to provide for a differential in tax levels. Residents of the <b>Urban</b> <b>Services</b> District had {{a full range of}} city services. The areas that made up the General Services District, however, had a lower tax rate until full services were provided. This helped reconcile aspects of services and taxation among the differing jurisdictions within the large metro region.|$|E

25|$|In December 1953, a {{major fire}} {{destroyed}} the slum area in Shek Kip Mei {{and more than}} 50,000 refugees were made homeless. After the disaster, then Governor Sir Alexander Grantham ordered Holmes to establish the Resettlement Department and appointed him as the Deputy Colonial Secretary and the first Commissioner of Resettlement. To resettle the homeless refugees {{in a short period}} of time, he took the lead to construct a number of resettlement estates on the burnt ground in Shek Kip Mei and in its neighbouring area. Some of the notable examples included Shek Kip Mei Estate and Tai Hang Tung Estate. Since the creation of the Resettlement Department, constructing public housing estate for resettling the poor people had become one of the primary policy goals set by the government in postwar Hong Kong. On the other hand, Holmes was also an official member of the Urban Council during his tenure as the Commissioner of Resettlement. In October 1955, when he succeeded the retired Harold Giles Richards as the Director of <b>Urban</b> <b>Services,</b> he stepped down from the Resettlement Department but was also appointed official member of the legislative council. His original post of the Commissioner of Resettlement was succeeded by Arthur Walton. During his tenure as the Director of <b>Urban</b> <b>Services,</b> Holmes witnessed the expansion of the Council that the number of unofficial members was increased to eight in 1956. It was the first time in history that unofficial member occupied half of the seats in the Council. However, the demand on further reform was not satisfied by the expansion, and therefore the relationship between the unofficial members and the government became worsening under his term of office.|$|E
25|$|In the Chilean rural areas, the {{ministry}} of health and {{the ministry}} of economy are responsible for supervising water cooperatives and water committees. In rural areas there is no independent regulator, such as the SISS in urban areas. Since 1994, the Direction for Water Works (DOH) is in charge of executing the national program of Rural Potable Water (APR). Unlike urban service providers, rural water supply and sanitation sector has not been subject of regulation like <b>urban</b> <b>services.</b> Currently, the Government of President Bachelet has submitted before the Chilean Congress a Bill to give this sector a new institutional framework. According to Law 19,549 of 1998, urban concessionaires have to provide technical and administrative assistance to water committees and cooperatives in their respective region.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipal}} administration is {{formed by the}} mayor and nine vereadores (aldermen), who are elected for a term of four years. The installation of the Municipal Council and the inauguration of the first Sanitary Mayor, Carlos Mauro, appointed by the State Governor, took place on 2 April 1949. The mayor holds executive power and has nine secretariats under his command: Administration, Education, Finances, Tourism, Environment and Safety, Health, Social and Thermal Promotion, Public Works, and <b>Urban</b> <b>Services.</b> They assist the mayor in his government, planning, developing, orienting, coordinating and implementing policies in their respective areas. The legislative power {{is represented by the}} unicameral Municipal Council and its aldermen, who are responsible for legislating and supervising the actions of the City Hall. The municipality is governed by the Organic Law of the Municipality of the Spa of Águas de São Pedro, from 5 April 1990.|$|E

25|$|Efficiency {{and service}} quality {{improved}} substantially {{over the following}} years. The level on non-revenue water decreased from an estimated 36% in 2005 to 10% in 2009; one quarter of residents received continuous water supply (although the average supply remained at only 7hours per day) in 2009; the share of metered connections increased from 2% in 2007 to 26% in 2009; the number of customers increased; and the company recovered its operating costs plus a portion of capital costs. Identifying and legalising illegal connections was {{an important element in}} the reduction of non-revenue water. The utility prides itself today of the good drinking water quality provided and encourages its customers to drink from the tap. The utility also operates a wastewater treatment plant that meets discharge standards. The private utility pays salaries that are higher than civil service salaries and conducts extensive training programs for its staff. It has also installed a modern system to track and resolve customer complaints. Furthermore, it conducts independent annual customer satisfaction surveys. JUSCO’s vision is to be the preferred provider of water supply and other <b>urban</b> <b>services</b> throughout India. Together with Ranhill Malaysia it won a 25-year concession contract for providing the water supply in Haldia City, West Bengal.|$|E
