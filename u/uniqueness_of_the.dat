5|$|If {{dropping}} {{the requirement for}} the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution, 41-clue minimal pseudo-puzzles are known to exist, {{but they can be}} completed to more than one solution grid. Removal of any clue increases the number of the completions and from this perspective none of the 41 clues is redundant. With slightly more than half the grid filled with givens (41 of 81 cells), the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution constraint still dominates over the minimality constraint.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{limestone}} quarrying {{has been}} a particular area of contention. Most of the mineral extraction licences were issued by national government for 90 years in the 1950s, and remain legally binding.

5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement of organs, joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body. The terminology used describes this motion according to its direction relative to the anatomical position of the joints. Anatomists use a unified set of terms to describe most of the movements, although other, more specialized terms are necessary for describing the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movements {{such as those of}} the hands, feet, and eyes.|$|E

5|$|The {{fortress}} contained barracks, granaries, headquarters, military baths, and {{an unusual}} elliptical building which {{had it been}} finished may have been intended to act as the governor of Britain's headquarters. Several factors including the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elliptical building, the method of construction, and the unusual size of the fortress– 20% larger than other Roman fortresses in Britain– suggest {{that it may have}} been intended as the base for a potential invasion of Ireland, and perhaps eventually to become the capital of the unified British Isles under Rome.|$|E

5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L.

Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work {{as a challenge to}} the <b>uniqueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
