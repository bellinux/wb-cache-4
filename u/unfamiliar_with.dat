40|$|Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) {{provides}} {{many individuals}} {{with little or}} no functional speech (LNFS) with a means to function within their daily environments and lives. AAC comprises the use of either or both unaided (the individual with LNFS‘s body) and aided (high- and low-technology devices) methods for communicating. High-technology non-dedicated devices like the iPad™ with Proloquo 2 Go have changed the future of augmentative and alternative communication. This study aimed to determine and compare the attitudes of typically developing children towards an <b>unfamiliar</b> peer <b>with</b> LNFS who uses a high-technology nondedicated communication device, namely the iPad™ with Proloquo 2 Go (Video 1), and the same <b>unfamiliar</b> peer <b>with</b> LNFS using a low-technology communication board (Video 2). Seventy-eight (78) {{children between the ages of}} 9; 00 - 12; 11, participated in the study. The participants were divided into two groups and a 2 x 2 crossover design was utilized. Group 1 was required to watch two videos in a specific sequence, one video of an <b>unfamiliar</b> peer <b>with</b> LNFS communicating with the high-technology non-dedicated iPad™ with Proloquo 2 Go, followed by a video of the same <b>unfamiliar</b> peer <b>with</b> LNFS in a communication interaction using a low-technology communication board. Participants were required to complete a Communication Aid/Device Attitudinal Questionnaire (CADAQ) after viewing each video. Participants in Group 2 watched the same videos in an alternating sequence in order to counterbalance effects of order. Results revealed that the video of the <b>unfamiliar</b> peer <b>with</b> LNFS using the iPad™ with Proloquo 2 Go was perceived more positively by the participants within certain dimensions of the CADAQ and the possible reasons are described. This is followed by a critical evaluation of the study and recommendations for future research.

5|$|Adults who {{do believe}} that zero is even can {{nevertheless}} be <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> thinking of it as even, enough so to measurably slow them down in a reaction time experiment. Stanislas Dehaene, {{a pioneer in the}} field of numerical cognition, led a series of such experiments in the early 1990s. A numeral or a number word is flashed to the subject on a monitor, and a computer records the time it takes the subject to push one of two buttons to identify the number as odd or even. The results showed that 0 was slower to process than other even numbers. Some variations of the experiment found delays as long as 60 milliseconds or about 10% of the average reaction time—a small difference but a significant one.|$|E

5000|$|Besic and Kerr {{believes}} that appearance {{can be a}} factor for social inhibition. In their study they hypothesized that a way to handle difficult situations with behavioral inhibition was to present an off-putting appearance. They examined [...] "radical" [...] crowds, such as those labeled as goths and punks and if their appearances fulfilled a functions for their inhibition. They state that a radical style {{could be used to}} draw away the social boundaries and relieve them of pressures or expectations to interact in <b>unfamiliar</b> situations <b>with</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> peers. Another possibility is that an individual my be self-handicapping to ensure that they will not have to interact <b>with</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> peers. The results revealed that radicals were significantly more inhibited than other groups. However, there are other inhibited individuals in other social classifications. The highest inhibited radical was no more inhibited than the highest inhibited individual in other groups.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of commissioning, Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were {{considered}} for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively, though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as the leads in March 2003. Morrissey gained two stone for his role and had his hair permed and dyed. He researched Brown's background by travelling to Kirkcaldy—where Brown grew up—and reviewing numerous biographies and information about the Treasury. In comparison to his preparation for the BBC thriller State of Play, Morrissey discovered that no politicians wanted {{to help him with}} his research, so he turned to journalists Jon Snow and Simon Hoggart.

5|$|Before Game of Thrones both Benioff and Weiss {{worked in}} film, and were <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> {{working on a}} {{television}} show. This resulted in several first-season episodes being about 10 minutes too short for HBO, forcing them to write another 100 pages of scripts in two weeks. Due to lack of budget the new scenes were designed to be inexpensive to film, such as two actors conversing in one room. Benioff and Weiss noted {{that some of their}} favorite scenes from the first season were the results of the dilemma, including one between Robert and Cersei Baratheon discussing their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh. This process was quite lengthy—and costly. In addition, the heralds in Britain could sometimes be <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> Canadian history and symbols. In time, many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office that would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians.|$|E
30|$|There {{were several}} {{limitations}} {{to the current}} study. One limitation is the small sample size.

Additionally, the children interviewed were participants in one camp in a specific geographic location. This also may have impacted the specific themes observed. Another limitation was the difficulty experienced in building rapport with the quieter children. Some children were hesitant to answer questions in an <b>unfamiliar</b> place <b>with</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> adults, despite the use of probes and follow-up interviews.|$|R

John Philip Law was cast as Diabolik as a favour by De Laurentiis after production on Barbarella, which Law was acting in, was postponed due to technical difficulties. Law was initially <b>unfamiliar</b> <b>with</b> the characters in either Barbarella and Diabolik, and read the comic books to understand the characters.
