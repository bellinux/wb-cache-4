Before leaving Glasgow, he married a 16-year-old girl, Lynda Campbell. It was a marriage of convenience which allowed her to travel with him as she was too young to have her own passport. They split <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> few months and Jansch was eventually repatriated to Britain after catching dysentery in Tangiers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major supply base for {{supporting}} the Spanish uprising against Napoleon. The French invasion of Spain in 1808 prompted Gibraltar's British garrison {{to cross the border}} and destroy the ring of Spanish fortresses around the bay, as well as the old Spanish fortified lines on the isthmus, to deny the French the ability to besiege Gibraltar or control the bay from shore batteries. French forces reached as far as San Roque, just north of Gibraltar, but did not attempt to target Gibraltar itself as they believed that it was impregnable. The French besieged Tarifa, further down the coast, in 1811–12 but gave <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> month. Gibraltar faced no further military threat for a century.|$|E

5|$|The 2012–13 season saw Newcastle regain European {{football}} {{for the first}} time since 2007. Newcastle made few acquisitions in the summer and suffered injuries over the season, including layoffs to key midfielders Yohan Cabaye and Hatem Ben Arfa, and defenders Steven and Ryan Taylor. As a result, the first half of the season was marred by a run of ten losses in 13 games, which saw the club sink near the relegation zone. In January, Newcastle signed five French players, and advanced to the Europa League quarter-finals before bowing out to eventual finalists Benfica. Domestically, Newcastle struggled, and stayed <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> 2–1 victory over already-relegated Queens Park Rangers on the penultimate game of the season.|$|E

Following the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals, the 20 nameplates on the new tier were filled up, so the first nine winners' nameplates were moved up to the remaining three sides of the foundation tier, with the remaining nameplates shifted accordingly to keep the winners in chronological order.

5|$|Mackintosh's party, {{which left}} the ship {{on the morning}} of 3 January, {{consisted}} of Mackintosh and three sailors, with a sledge containing supplies and a large mailbag. Two sailors quickly returned to the ship, while Mackintosh and one companion went forward. They camped on the ice that evening, only to find next day that the whole area around them had broken <b>up.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> desperate dash over the moving floes, they managed to reach a small glacier tongue. They camped there, and waited for several days for their snow-blindness to subside. When their vision returned, they found that Cape Royds was in sight but inaccessible, as the sea-ice leading to it had gone, leaving a stretch of open water. They {{had little choice but to}} make for the hut by land, a dangerous undertaking without appropriate equipment and experience.|$|E

Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E

5|$|On {{a meeting}} on 10 October, O. T. Blindheim, a {{geological}} consulting company, and Selmer presented three alternatives: continued injection of cement, recommended by Blindheim; freezing, recommended by Selmer {{because it was the}} cheapest, but would take more time; and use of a water-tight shield. A technical committee was established, and on 16 December they recommended the use of cement injection combined with a ring of drainage holes around the tunnel before blasting. The method was to be continually tested, and if it was insufficient, freezing could be used. As the tunnel advanced, the hole was to be continuously secured using carbon fibre-reinforced carbon gunite, self-boring bolts, steel ribs and full pouring. Work was taken <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> meeting on 27 March 1995, and on 16 August the final blast was made. Representatives from Selmer stated that the method they had chosen had resulted in international interest for the tunnel, and they had demonstrated it to several international delegations.|$|E

Tennessee advanced {{the ball to the}} Crimson Tide 21-yard line on their next possession before Robert Lester intercepted the second Bray pass of the evening for a touchback. Early in the fourth, Alabama extended their lead to 37–10 on a 39-yard McCarron pass to Kenny Bell. The Alabama defense then held the Volunteers on a fourth down to give the Crimson Tide possession at their 42-yard line. Three plays later, Yeldon scored on a 43-yard run for the final Alabama points and a 44–10 lead. Tennessee then scored the final points of the game on a 21-yard Palardy field goal that was set <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> Blake Sims fumble gave the Volunteers possession at the Alabama 24-yard line that made the final score 44–13.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Bonham {{had been}} {{admitted}} to St John's College, Cambridge, in 1581. Earning a bachelor's degree in 1584, he completed a master's by 1588 and studied for a medical doctorate at Cambridge, which was later granted by the University of Oxford. By 1602, he had completed his studies and moved to London, where he practised medicine and associated himself with the Barber-Surgeons' Company, campaigning {{for it to be}} allowed to authorise medical practitioners in a similar way to the College of Physicians. Apparently giving <b>up</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> failed petition to Parliament in 1605, Bonham petitioned to join the college on 6 December 1605 but was rejected and told to return after further study. Returning on 14 April 1606, he was again told he could not join and was fined £5 and threatened with imprisonment for continuing to practise. Bonham still kept working as a doctor; on 3 October it was announced he was to be arrested and fined £10. Bonham again appeared before the college, now with a lawyer, on 7 November. He announced that he would continue to practise without seeking the college's permission, which he claimed had no power over graduates of Oxford or Cambridge. He was then imprisoned (some say at Fleet Prison, and some say at Newgate Prison) for contempt, but his lawyer had a writ of habeas corpus, issued by the Court of Common Pleas, which freed him on 13 November.|$|E
