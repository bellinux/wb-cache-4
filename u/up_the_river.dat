5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|Emerald, Pandour, and Drake {{then pushed}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river,</b> {{sometimes}} in less water than the frigates required to float properly, until on 5 May they arrived {{close to the}} forts Leyden and Frederici. The British landed a detachment of troops under Hughes some distance away, which marching {{under the cover of}} the forests and swamps, launched an attack that resulted in the swift capture of the two forts. By this time, most of the squadron had managed to work its way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> as far as Frederici, Maitland was advancing along the Commewine River, and with troops poised to attack the fort of New Amsterdam, the Batavian commandant, Lieutenant-Colonel Batenburg, duly surrendered.|$|E
5|$|Gambier's fleet {{spent the}} next two weeks {{attempting}} to capture or destroy the stranded French vessels, with some success. The attack came to an end on 29April when the last French ship was re-floated and taken <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> to safety at Rochefort.|$|E

5|$|In 1901, trader Ebenezer Barnette sailed up Alaska's Tanana River {{in hopes}} of {{establishing}} a trading post on the trail connecting the coastal town of Valdez with the gold-mining community of Eagle. Due to low water, however, the steamboat Barnette chartered was unable to continue <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Discouraged, Barnette deposited his cache of goods on a riverbank of the Chena River and sailed downstream {{with the intent of}} making another attempt to sail <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> during the following year. In 1902, miner Felix Pedro struck gold at a spot about 15 miles north of the spot where Barnette left his supplies. Seeing an opportunity, Barnette decided to establish a trading post at the spot. Other miners and suppliers arrived, attracted by the gold, and Barnette named the settlement Fairbanks, after Indiana Senator and later Vice President of the United States Charles W. Fairbanks.|$|E

5|$|Bishop Maurice oversaw early preparations, {{although}} it was primarily under his successor, Richard de Beaumis, that construction work fully commenced. Beaumis was assisted by King Henry I, who gave the bishop stone and commanded that all material brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>River</b> Fleet for the cathedral should be free from toll. To fund the cathedral, Henry gave Beaumis rights to all fish caught within the cathedral neighbourhood and tithes on venison taken in the County of Essex. Beaumis also gave a site for the original foundation of St Paul's School.|$|E
5|$|Collier's fleet {{arrived at}} the mouth of the river early on August 13. He boarded 123 marines onto the Hope, and ordered her and the Blonde <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river.</b> Word of this reached the militia, and thrty-five men mustered to oppose them. The ships reached the log boom, and a firefight began between the two forces. The militia {{resistance}} was sufficient to keep the British from attempting a landing that day. Early the next morning, under the cover of fog, the marines were landed. They cut the log boom, seized a sloop carrying lumber, and set fire to a storehouse, seizing stores of flour, rice, corn, shoes, and ammunition before returning to the ships.|$|E

However, 14th-century Hungarian chronicles narrate that he fled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> Tisza where he was seized and murdered by the locals.

5|$|Milton Blockhouse was an {{artillery}} fortification constructed {{as part of}} Henry VIII's Device plan of 1539, in response to fears of an imminent invasion of England. It was built at Milton, near Gravesend in Kent at a strategic point along the River Thames, and was operational by 1540. Equipped with 30 pieces of artillery and a garrison of 12 men and a captain, {{it was probably a}} two-storey, D-shaped building, designed to prevent enemy ships from progressing further <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>river</b> or landing an invasion force. It was stripped of its artillery in 1553 and was demolished between 1557 and 1558; nothing remains of the building above ground, although archaeological investigations in the 1970s uncovered parts of the blockhouse's foundations.|$|E
