2500|$|On September 16, 2010, the Allegheny County Sports and Exhibition Authority voted {{unanimously}} to demolish the Civic Arena. SEA Board chairman, State Senator Wayne Fontana, DBrookline, said the board's decision will not be final unless someone comes forward with a better idea on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Arena.</b> During the summer of 2010, workers removed asbestos from the building while a demolition plan was designed. The board also decided to sell assets (handled by the auction company Asset Auctions) from inside and would later award a demolition contract in February 2011. Proponents for retaining the building have vowed to fight the demolition decision in court, and continue to seek landmark status. On November 24, 2010, the building's demolition was delayed due to a last-minute nomination as a National Historic Landmark. Also, on January 5, 2011, the Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission voted 5–1 in favor for preliminary approval of the arena's historic nomination status. The vote {{paved the way for}} a formal hearing on the proposed designation on March 2. The HRC ultimately voted against landmark status on March 2. After also failing to get historic status approval from City Planning and City Council, Preservation Pittsburgh filed a federal lawsuit in another attempt to save the arena. The 3rd appeals court denied the lawsuit saying it had no jurisdiction in the matter, and demolition began Monday, September 26, 2011. The demolition is not a traditional type of demolition for sports arenas. In November 2011, the Penguins started selling Christmas ornaments crafted from the Civic Arena's steel roof. The team used the promotion to raise money for its charitable foundation. Grove City-based Wendell August Forge, the oldest and largest forge in the United States, created two types of ornaments: one with the arena and the Pittsburgh skyline and another with the arena with the Penguins' logo. The Penguins had originally planned to sell 6,000 ornaments, but due to demand, the team ended selling over 40,000 pieces. The arena was being disassembled over time, and originally expected to be complete in May 2012. However, demolition was finished early as the last panel of the retractable roof fell down on March 31, 2012. A timelapse video on YouTube breaks down 9 months of Civic Arena demolition work in just 31 seconds. It is called [...] "THE DISAPPEARING CIVIC ARENA".|$|E

40|$|The {{matching}} habitat choice hypothesis {{posits that}} individuals actively choose those microhabitats that best match their specific phenotype to maximize fitness. Despite the profound implications, matching habitat choice {{has not been}} unequivocally demonstrated. We conducted two experiments to examine <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> pigmentation pattern in the color polymorphic pygmy grasshopper Tetrix subulata on habitat choice in a laboratory thermal mosaic arena. We found no behavioral differences in the thermal mosaic among pygmy grasshoppers belonging to either pale, intermediate or dark natural color morphs. However, after manipulating the grasshoppers’ phenotype, the utilization through time of warmer and colder parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> was different for black-painted and white-painted individuals. White-painted individuals <b>used</b> warmer parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>arena,</b> at least during <b>the</b> initial stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiment.

Thus, even if the choice itself is flexible and not genetically determined, it can still lead to spatial genetic structure in the population because the phenotypes themselves may be genetically mediated [Current Zoology 58 (3) : 392 - 400, 2012]...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] This paper {{argues that}} while <b>the</b> {{internationalization}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> economy {{has tended to}} weaken national labor movements, <b>the</b> internationalization <b>of</b> domestic politics may expand <b>the</b> traditional <b>arenas</b> for strategic action for labor unions. In particular, the North American Free Trade Agreement has been portrayed by some of its many critics as representing <b>the</b> consolidation <b>of</b> a neoconservative or neoliberal project that will not only shape the future economic development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region, but also constrain its social policies and limit its political options (Grinspun and Cameron 1993 : Chapter 1). However, these same critics have {{also noted that the}} debate surrounding NAFTA in Mexico, Canada, and the United States has led to a broad range of contacts and cooperative efforts among labor, environmental, women 2 ̆ 7 s, religious, and educators 2 ̆ 7 groups in the three countries. This process is not only itself an expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> search for new strategies in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> regional integration, it has also altered the traditional ways in which U. S. -Mexican relations have been carried out and shaped the political process within Mexico. While the constraints to transnational labor collaboration remain strong, these new dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international and political environments nonetheless potentially offer new opportunities to weakened labor movements in all three countries. This paper will begin with a discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contours <b>of</b> this new international political environment—in particular, <b>the</b> internationalization <b>of</b> domestic politics—and how this environment differs from traditional, nationally bounded notions of domestic politics and state action. I then discuss how both <b>the</b> transnationalization <b>of</b> politics and regional economic integration change <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> for strategic action by labor groups, how this new environment affects the labor movement in Mexico, and <b>the</b> kinds <b>of</b> strategies Mexican and U. S. labor unions have begun to pursue in this context. Finally, I consider whether the side agreement on labor standards that was developed as a complement to the NAFTA represents an example of institutionalization of this political internationalization, thus potentially facilitating further transnational collaboration among unions, or whether, alternatively, the side accord buttresses national institutions and state autonomy in ways that could constrain labor 2 ̆ 7 s strategic <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> international <b>arena...</b>|$|R
40|$|Democratic regimes {{around the}} world find {{themselves}} besieged by antidemocratic groups that seek to use <b>the</b> electoral <b>arena</b> as a forum to propagandize their cause and rally their supporters. Virtually all democratic countries respond by restricting <b>the</b> participation <b>of</b> groups or political parties deemed to be beyond <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> tolerable conduct or viewpoints. <b>The</b> prohibition <b>of</b> certain views raises serious problems for any liberal theory in which legitimacy turns on <b>the</b> democratic consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> governed. When stripped down to the essential, all definitions of democracy return ultimately to <b>the</b> primacy <b>of</b> electoral choice and <b>the</b> presumptive claim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majority to rule. <b>The</b> removal <b>of</b> certain political views from <b>the</b> electoral <b>arena</b> calls into question <b>the</b> legitimacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> choices that are then permitted to the citizenry and, by extension, the entire democratic enterprise. This article asks under what circumstances may democratic governments act (perhaps, must they act) {{to ensure that their}} state apparatus not be captured wholesale for socially destructive forms <b>of</b> intolerance. <b>The</b> problem <b>of</b> democratic intolerance takes on special meaning in deeply fractured societies, in which <b>the</b> electoral <b>arena</b> may serve as a parallel or even secondary front for extraparliamentary mobilizations. Such democratic societies are not without recourse to <b>the</b> threat <b>of</b> being compromised from within. At the descriptive level, the prime method is the prohibition on extremist participation in <b>the</b> electoral <b>arena,</b> a practice which exists with surprising regularity across <b>the</b> range <b>of</b> democratic societies. Seemingly the world has learned something since <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electoral <b>arena</b> as <b>the</b> springboard for fascist mobilizations to power in Germany and Italy. The primary concern in this article is with the institutional considerations that either do or should govern restrictions on political participation, with particular attention to how these have been assessed by reviewing courts in a variety of countries, including India, Israel, Turkey, the Ukraine, and the United States. The article distinguishes among <b>the</b> types <b>of</b> parties that may be banned or impeded, with the greatest attention being given to mass antidemocratic parties that actually seek to win elections. Further lines are drawn among types of prohibitions, ranging from <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> criminal sanctions in the U. S. to party prohibitions in most European countries to restrictions on electoral speech and conduct in India. Ultimately, the argument is that democratic societies must have weapons of self-preservation available to them, but that strong institutional protections must be in place before they may be deployed...|$|R

A remote file sharing experiment, [through a VideoConference link], of a 3 D CAD estate model, collaboratively developed with a local resident?s association, is discussed. A different example looks at <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Internet route by a small practice in the North West, developing QuickTime and QuickTimeVirtual Reality files for remote distribution and collaboration. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full building object-orientated, data based model, [incorporating all related data and decisions from conception, client participation, project and facilities and life time management], is seen to offer an excellent vehicle for illustrating, negotiating and recording decisions. New international CAD standards for remote transfer and file sharing bring ease <b>of</b> <b>use</b> into <b>the</b> <b>arena.</b> Associated peripherals for remote file sharing through both Internet and video/teleconferencing, point to a transformation {{in the way we}} collaborate in the future.

The key change is that those who understand this, build on the particular opportunity to contact and relate with any community of interest and to develop dialogue in a deeper, closer manner. So, we can see a strange phenomenon that the remoteness can actually bring a closeness of a new kind, as communities explore common interests.
