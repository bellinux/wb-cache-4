The option {{to apply a}} regional lockout to games is available to publishers, although DVD region codes are always enforced for movies. Microsoft has implemented methods to prevent hacking through the drive. Later drive models have the external debug triggering removed and black hard glue added {{to cover all the}} chip and controller pins. The drive is able to read both DVD±R and DVD±RW in addition to being able to play DVD-Video out of the box, unlike its predecessor, which required the purchase of an add-on remote. The system is also capable of playing standard CDs along with CD-R/RW, CD-DA, CD-ROM XA, CD-Extra, WMA-CD, MP3-CD, and JPEG Photo CD. Some users reported problems with the disc drive, as when a user changes the console's orientation, the inserted disc may brush against the drive's pickup assembly and incur scratches to it. The <b>users</b> <b>manual</b> advises against changing the console's position while there is a disc in the drive. Other users report experiencing disc scratching during normal horizontal usage.|$|E

To ease the use of the <b>user</b> <b>manual</b> the disposition must be clear. In this document an appropriate course of action to get a good disposition is explained. At the actual authoring as simple as possible language should be used, use explana-tory figures in an suitable amount and a well thought-out layout. It is of great im-portance that the subject index is thoroughly worked through and the writer of the <b>user</b> <b>manual</b> have to predict all imaginable words the reader may want to search for. When the <b>user</b> <b>manual</b> finally is finished it has to be checked before it goes to print. To ease the checking it is appropriate to follow checklists, in particularly if it is in-experienced persons who checks the document. In this document there is two checklists, one for check of proof and one for check of language. To be able to evaluate the <b>user</b> <b>manual</b> there is a questionnaire last in this document.

Alain Perrier of INRA {{was looking for a}} computer for process control in his crop evapotranspiration measurements. The software was developed by Benchetrit. Beckmann designed the I/O boards and controllers for peripheral magnetic storage. Lacombe was responsible for the memory system, I/O high speed channel, power supply and front panel. Gernelle invented the Micral N, which was much smaller than existing minicomputers. The January 1974 <b>Users</b> <b>Manual</b> called it [...] "the first {{of a new generation of}} mini-computer whose principal feature is its very low cost," [...] and said, [...] "MICRAL's principal use is in process control.

5000|$|Perecs {{most famous}} novel La Vie mode demploi (Life a <b>Users</b> <b>Manual)</b> was {{published}} in 1978. Its title page describes it as [...] "novels", in the plural, the reasons for which become apparent on reading. La Vie mode demploi is a tapestry of interwoven stories and ideas as well as literary and historical allusions, based {{on the lives of}} the inhabitants of a fictitious Parisian apartment block. It was written according to a complex plan of writing constraints, and is primarily constructed from several elements, each adding a layer of complexity. The 99 chapters of his 600-page novel, move like a knights tour of a chessboard around the room plan of the building, describing the rooms and stairwell and telling the stories of the inhabitants. At the end, it is revealed that the whole book actually takes place in a single moment, with a final twist that is an example of [...] "cosmic irony". It was translated into English by David Bellos in 1987, and has since been classified as a major example of postmodern fiction.|$|E
