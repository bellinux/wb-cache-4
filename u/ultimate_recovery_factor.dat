This work reports a systematic study of the effect of rutile TiO 2 nanoparticle-assisted brine flooding. Rutile ellipsoid TiO 2 nanoparticles were synthesized and stabilized by trisodium citrate dihydrate for brine flooding of water-wet Berea sandstone cores. Careful characterization of the rock samples and nanomaterials before and after the flooding was conducted, and the relative contributions to the modified flooding results from the stabilizer and the nanoparticles of different concentrations were examined. The oil recovery performance was evaluated both at the breakthrough (BT) point {{and at the end of}} flooding (∼ 3. 2 pore volumes). Nanoparticle migration behavior was also investigated in order to understand the potential mechanisms for oil recovery.

This numerical study investigates various steam-based gravity drainage process well patterns in NFR including conventional SAGD, off-set SAGD, staggered SAGD and vertical-injection SAGD. Furthermore, to obtain the best well location, sensitivity analysis of well spacing was carried out for each well pattern and the impacts of oil viscosity, preheating and fracture permeability and water saturation were assessed as well. The best well location case for staggered SAGD represented the <b>ultimate</b> oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of 59  % among all the cases with the SOR of 4.1, while the best off-set SAGD case showed a low SOR of 3.7 with a moderate <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of 57  %.

40|$|Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is used widely as {{a thermal}} {{recovery}} technique in Canada {{to produce a}} very viscous bitumen formation. The main research objectives of this simulation and experimental study are to investigate oil recovery mechanisms under SAGD process with different injection fluids, including steam, solvent or steam with solvent. 2 D simulation studies based on typical Athabasca reservoir properties have been performed. Results show that a successful solvent co-injection design can utilize the advantages of solvent and steam. There is an optimal solvent type and concentration ratio range for a particular reservoir and operating condition. Long, continuous shale barriers located vertically above or near the wellbore delay production performance significantly. Co-injecting a multi-component solvent can flush out the oil in different areas with different drainage mechanisms from vaporized and liquid components. Placing an additional injector {{at the top of}} the reservoir results only in marginal improvement. The pure high-temperature diluent injection appears feasible, although further technical and economic evaluation of the process is required. A 2 D scaled physical model was fabricated that represented in cross-section a half symmetry element of a typical SAGD drainage volume in Athabasca. The experimental results show co-injecting a solvent mixture of C 7 and xylene with steam gives better production performance than the injection of pure steam or steam with C 7 at the study condition. Compared to pure steam injection runs (Run 0 and 1), coinjecting C 7 (Run 2) with steam increases the <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of oil inside the cell from 25 percent to 29 percent and decreases the ultimate CSOR from 2. 2 to 1. 9 and the ultimate CEOR from 4892 J/cm 3 to 4326 J/cm 3; coinjecting C 7 and Xylene (Run 3) increases the <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of oil from 25 percent to 34 percent, and decreases the ultimate CSOR 2. 2 to 1. 6 and the ultimate CEOR from 4892 J/cm 3 to 3629 J/cm 3.

Special core analysis tests were run on two core samples to nd out relative permeability and end point saturations. Wellhead separator oil and gas samples were collected and recombined to a reservoir gas- oil ratio. A core ooding system with a capability of free and forced imbibition testing was designed and installed. A number of free and forced imbibition tests with dierent cores under reservoir conditions were conducted. The results of the tests revealed that capillary imbibition is an almost fast process at laboratory scale and the higher permeable cores will imbibe more easily.

40|$|Increasing energy {{consumption}} and continuous depletion of hydrocarbon reservoirs {{will result in}} a conventional oil production peak in the near future. Thus, the gap between the global conventional oil supplies and the required amount of fossil fuel energy will grow. Extensive attempts were made during the last three decades to fill this gap, especially using innovative emerging heavy oil and bitumen production technologies. Most of these recovery methods have been developed in Canada, considering the fact that Canada and Venezuela have the largest deposits of heavy oil and bitumen throughout the world. The horizontal well drilling technology opened a new horizon for the recovery of heavy oil and bitumen. Most of the in-situ recovery techniques, including Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) recovery method, take advantage of horizontal injection and production wells. The vacated pores in the reservoir are filled mainly either with steam or with a mixture of steam and solvent vapour {{in the case of the}} SAGD and Solvent Aided SAGD (SA-SAGD) recovery methods, respectively. The use of long horizontal wells combined with the reduced viscosity of the produced oil allows economic production with limited amount of bypassed residual oil in the invaded region. The macro-scale success of the SAGD recovery technique is greatly affected by its pore-scale performance. It is beneficial to understand the pore-level physics of the SAGD process in order to develop mathematical models for simulating field-scale performance. Available commercial reservoir simulators cannot describe pore-level mechanisms of the SAGD process including mechanisms related to the fluid-flow as well as heat-transfer aspects of the process. A systematic series of flow visualization experiments of the SAGD process using glass-etched micromodels was developed to capture the pore-level physics of the process using qualitative analysis. With the aid of image processing techniques, the pore-scale performance of the SAGD process was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated. The main objective of Chapter 2 of this thesis is to address the relevant pore-scale mechanisms responsible for the in-situ oil mobilization and drainage in a conventional SAGD process. Transport processes, occurred in a conventional SAGD process at the pore-level including fluid flow and heat transfer aspects, were mechanistically investigated and documented. The qualitative analysis of the results revealed that near a well-established oil-steam interface, gravity drainage takes place through a thick layer of pores, composed of about 1 - 6 pores in thickness, within the mobilized region. The drainage of the mobile oil takes place due to the interplay between gravity and capillarity forces near this mobilized region. In-situ mobilization of bitumen was found to be as a result of both conductive and convective elements of the local heat transfer process. Moreover, the phenomenon of water-in-oil emulsification at the interface was also demonstrated which is due to the local steam condensation and spreading characteristics of water droplets over the oil phase in the presence of a gas phase. Other pore-scale aspects of the process such as drainage displacement as well as film-flow drainage mechanisms of the mobile oil, localized entrapment of steam bubbles as well as condensate droplets within the mobile oil continuum due to capillarity phenomenon, sharp temperature gradient along the mobilized region, co-current and counter-current flow regimes at the chamber walls, condensate spontaneous imbibition followed by mobile oil drainage, and snap-off of liquid films are also illustrated using these pore-level studies. The second objective of Chapter 2 is to quantitatively analyze the production performance of the SAGD process based on the micro-scale measurements. Our pore-scale experiments revealed that the rate of pore-scale SAGD interface advancement depends directly on the pore-scale characteristics of the employed models and the pertaining operating conditions. The average sweep rate data were correlated using an analytical model proposed by Butler (1979, 1981, 1991) and a pore-scale performance parameter was defined for the SAGD process. The measured horizontal sweep rates of the SAGD process at the pore-scale are in good agreement with the theory predictions provided by the performance parameter. In addition, the effect of different system variables on the <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of the SAGD experiments were investigated and it was found that higher permeability values and lower in-situ oil viscosities lead to higher <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> values for a particular SAGD trial. Moreover, the Cumulative Steam to Oil Ratio (CSOR) data were scaled and a reasonably good fit for the experimental data was achieved by defining a scaling parameter. Although the SAGD process offers several inherent advantages including high ultimate recovery, stable oil production rates, reasonable energy efficiency, and high stable sweep efficiency, there are some drawbacks associated with the SAGD process such as high {{energy consumption}}, high levels of CO 2 emission, and usage of large quantities of fresh water which make this process uneconomical in reservoirs with thin net pay, low matrix porosity and thermal conductivity, and low initial pressure. The most promising route for improving the SAGD performance appears to be the co-injection of a light hydrocarbon solvent with steam in the context of the Solvent Aided SAGD (SA-SAGD) process. The pore-level aspects of the SA-SAGD process are not yet understood to the extent of incorporating the pore-scale physics into mathematical models. The main objective of Chapter 3 of my thesis is to mechanistically investigate the SA-SAGD process at the pore-level to enlighten the unrecognized pore-scale physics of the process. A methodical set of pore-scale SA-SAGD experiments were designed and carried out with the aid of glass micromodels. The methodology used in this set of the SA-SAGD trials was similar to that of the pore-scale SAGD experiments described in Chapter 2. Normal Pentane and Normal Hexane were used as the steam additives. The pore-level events were recorded on a real-time basis and then analyzed using the image processing techniques. According to the qualitative results, it was obtained that all the condensate and gaseous phases flow simultaneously in the mobilized region composed of about 1 - 4 pores in thickness. Heat transfer mechanisms at the pore-scale include conduction as well as convection. The mechanisms responsible for the mass transfer at the pore-level include molecular diffusion as well as convection. The mobile oil drains as a result of two active mechanisms of film flow as well as direct capillary drainage displacements at the pore-scale. Due to the near miscible nature of the displacement process, the residual oil left behind in the invaded portion of the micromodels was negligible and asphaltene precipitation and plugging was found to be a temporary phenomenon. The second objective of Chapter 3 is to quantify the pore-scale production performance of the SA-SAGD process using the flow visualization experiments. The horizontal SA-SAGD interface advancement velocity was chosen to be the indicator of the pore-scale performance of the process. It was found that addition of n-C 6 as the steam additive was more effective than n-C 5 in terms of enhanced pore-scale interface advancement as well as achieving higher <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> when all the other experimental variables are unchanged. The higher the solvent concentration in the injection mainstream is, the higher would be the pore-scale sweep rate as well as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of the process. When oil type with lower in-situ viscosity was used, higher sweep rates as well as higher ultimate recovery factors values were achieved compared to the trials in which the more viscous bitumen was employed as the oil type. In addition, a scaling parameter composed of porous media properties was found by which the pore-scale interface advancement velocity and the <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of the SA-SAGD trials were scaled when all other experimental variables remain unchanged. In Chapter 4 of this thesis, the production performance of the SAGD and SA-SAGD processes were demonstrated and compared at the macro-scale under controlled environmental conditions. A 2 D physical model was designed and fabricated and Athabasca bitumen was used as the oil type. According to the experimental results, it was obtained that the average mobile oil as well as dead oil production rates are reasonably constant over the course of the SAGD and SA-SAGD trials. As far as the SAGD experiments are concerned, there is a linear correlation between the mobile oil production rates and the square root of the porous media permeability when all the other experimental variables remain unchanged. In addition, the Steam to Oil Ratio (SOR) values of the SAGD trials correlate reasonably well with the inverse of the square root of permeability when all the other experimental variables are fixed. By introducing the solvent additive to the injection mainstream of the SAGD process, it was found that enhancements of about 18 % and 17 % were observed in the mobile oil and dead oil production rates of the SAGD process respectively. In addition, the SOR values of the SA-SAGD process was reduced by about 35 % compared to that of the SAGD process. Finally, an advanced photomicrography unit with an integrated image processing software was used in order to investigate size of the enclosed water condensate droplets in the continuum of the mobile oil produced during the course of the SAGD and SA-SAGD experiments. The captured microscopic snapshots were analyzed using the image processing techniques and some representative average values of the water condensate droplet sizes were reported for the corresponding SAGD and SA-SAGD trials...|$|E

Among the latter, there is little costly technology to restore oil production in open wells with a horizontal end, which operate carbonate reservoirs of the Lower and Middle Carboniferous deposits in the Republic of Tatarstan. The essence of the technology is to lower the suspension of the pump directly to the horizontal part of the well, if possible, to the lowest hypsometric mark of its trajectory in the oil-saturated part of the operational object.

Composite sand bodies can macroscopically control the geometry and distribution of the sand bodies in a reservoir (Zhang et al. 2009, 2010; Er et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013) and microscopically control the internal variations of the physical properties in the reservoir (Zeng et al. 2013; Cao et al. 2010; Zhu et al. 2012; Ji et al. 2013). The overlaying properties of a composite sand body can significantly affect seismic waveforms; therefore, the distribution of a sand body can be predicted using waveform classification techniques (Jing et al. 2014). The overlaying relationship of a composite sand body reflects the vertical evolution of the hydrodynamic properties, the provenance, and the sedimentary facies during its formation (Tian et al. 2013). The scale of the composite sand body can control the physical properties of the reservoir; the thicker the composite sand body is, the stronger its compressional resistance is to preserve the original intergranular pores and provide channels for the transport of late stage acidic fluids to form a reservoir with good physical properties (Fu et al. 2013). The type of composite sand body can directly affect the results of water injection during the exploitation of an oil reservoir. The best water drive effect is obtained from braided river sands, followed by meandering river sands, while delta sands have the poorest performance and result in the most oil remaining in the reservoir (Zhao et al. 2014). Therefore, studies of composite sand bodies are useful for determining the mechanism and distribution of sand bodies with different origins, the reservoir heterogeneity, and the potential remaining oil, to predict reservoir performance and to increase the <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E

A high <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> is expected, yet significant quantities of undrained oil remain at the fan margins.

A high-angle well offers greater pay exposure than can be achieved with a vertical well. Hydraulic-fracture treatments will establish vertical communication between thin interbedded layers and the wellbore. The equivalent production rate and reserves of three vertical wells are anticipated at a cost of approximately two vertical wells. The near-horizontal well penetrated the Yowlumne sand; a Stevens sand equivalent, in the distal fan margin in the northeast area of the field. The well was drilled in a predominately westerly direction towards the interior of the field, in the direction of improving rock quality. Drilling and completion operations proved to be very challenging, leading to a number of adjustments to original plans. Hole conditions resulted in obtaining less core material than desired and setting intermediate casing 1200 ft too high. The 7 in. production liner stuck 1000 ft off bottom, requiring a 5 in. liner to be run the rest of the way. The cement job on the 5 in. liner resulted in a very poor bond, which precluded one of three hydraulic fracture treatments originally planned for the well. Openhole logs confirmed most expectations going into the project about basic rock properties: the formation was shaly with low porosities, and water saturations were in line with expectations, including the presence of some intervals swept out by the waterflood. High water saturations at the bottom of the well eliminated one of the originally planned hydraulic fracture treatments. Although porosities proved to be low, they were more uniform across the formation than expected. Permeabilities of the various intervals continue to be evaluated, but appear to be better than expected from the porosity log model derived in Budget Period One. The well was perforated in all pay sections behind the 5 in. liner.

Furthermore, it was revealed that for both aforementioned systems, the solubility of CO 2 reduces when temperature increased. It was found that introducing CO 2 to the oil reservoirs through injection water provides great opportunity to lock large quantity of CO 2 inside the porous medium with high retention factor. Results of this study showed that both secondary and tertiary scenarios of CO 2 -saturated water flooding are favourable with the storage capacity between 34 % to 45 % of the injected CO 2 in the sand-pack model. In addition, the solubility trapping was shown to be the main CO 2 trapping mechanism during CO 2 -saturated water flooding. According {{to the results}} of this study, most of the injected CO 2 was trapped in the porous medium through dissolution in the reservoir fluids, i. e., solubility trapping. As an example, the flooding tests conducted in secondary mode at P = 10. 3 MPa and T = 25 °C, showed that about 95 % of the injected CO 2 can be trapped by dissolution mechanism into the reservoir oil and brine. In terms of oil recovery, {{it was found that the}} <b>ultimate</b> oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> of CO 2 -saturated water flooding is consistently more than that of conventional water flooding leading this technique to be a more viable option as a means of improved oil recovery technique. In this study, flooding tests conducted at pressure of P = 10. 3 MPa and temperature of T = 25 °C, verified that injection of CO 2 -saturated water resulted in improving the conventional water flooding oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> by about 19. 0 % and 12. 5 % of OOIP for secondary and tertiary scenarios, respectively. Based on the results obtained in this work, it was concluded that mixing CO 2 with injected water noticeably provides permanent, safe, and practical CO 2 storage together with considerable oil recovery improvement in light oil systems...|$|R

This thesis presents {{the character}}ization of the Upper and Lower Repetto reservoirs of the Santa Clara field, which lies seven miles offshore of Ventura County, California. The approaches that we adopted for this reservoir characterization are based on the analysis of field production data. These reservoir characterization approaches include: The application of the Fetkovich/McCray decline type curve to estimate original oil-in-place, drainage area, flow capacity, and a skin factor for each well. This approach requires converting the field production data for each well to dimensionless decline flowrate, dimensionless rate integral, and dimensionless rate integral-derivative functions. These functions are then simultaneously plotted against dimensionless decline time so that a unique match of these plots can be obtained using the Fetkovich/McCray decline type curve (in this research, data conversion and type curve matching are performed using a software package). The analysis of plots of reciprocal production rate versus material balance time to estimate "movable" or recoverable oil reserves. This new material balance approach is used in conjunction with a semi-analytical method of graphical analysis (pressure drop normalized rate versus cumulative oil production), which also provides estimates of recoverable oil reserves. Together, these plotting techniques provide good estimates of the estimated <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery</b> for each well. Our approaches for the analysis of field production data allow us to provide <b>recovery</b> <b>factors</b> for each well (using our estimates of original oil-in-place and estimated <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery).</b> Furthermore, we were able to generate maps of original oil-in-place, estimated <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery,</b> flow capacity, and permeability for both the Upper and Lower Repetto reservoirs...|$|R

40|$|When {{estimating}} a waterflood {{performance and}} <b>ultimate</b> <b>recovery,</b> practitioners usually prepare {{a plot of}} log of water-oil ratio vs. cumulative production or <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> and extrapolate the linear section of the curve to a pre-established economic limit of water production. Following this practice, engineers {{take the risk of}} overestimating oil production and/or underestimating water production if the economic limit is optimistic. Engineers would be able to avoid that risk if they knew where the linear portion of the curve finishes. We called this linear portion the "straight-line zone" of simply SLZ. In this research, we studied that ?straight-line zone? and determined its boundaries (beginning and end) numerically using mathematics rules. We developed a new procedure and empirical correlations to predict oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> at any water/oil ratio. The approach uses the fundamental concepts of fluid displacement under Buckley-Leverett fractional flow theory, reservoir simulation, and statistical analysis from multivariate linear regression. We used commercial spreadsheet software, the Statistical Analysis Software, a commercial numerical reservoir simulator, and Visual Basic Application software. We determined generalized correlations to determine the beginning, end, slope, and intercept of this line as a function of rock and fluid properties, such as endpoints of relative permeability curves, connate water saturation, residual oil saturation, mobility ratio, and the Dykstra-Parsons coefficient. Characterizing the SLZ allows us to estimate the corresponding <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> and pore volumes injected at any water-oil ratio through the length of the SLZ. The SLZ is always present in the plot of log of water-oil ratio vs. cumulative production or <b>recovery</b> <b>factor,</b> and its properties can be predicted. Results were correlated in terms of the Dykstra-Parsons coefficient and mobility ratio. Using our correlations, practitioners can estimate the end of the SLZ without the risk of overestimating reserves and underestimating water production. Our procedure is also a helpful tool for forecasting and diagnosing waterfloods when a detailed reservoir simulation model is not available...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecent {{developments}} in nanotechnology illustrates that addition of nanoparticles in the polymer flooding process {{can improve the}} oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor.</b> But there exists few researches about the polymer performance {{in the presence of}} nanoparticles. Also there is no information about the effect of silica nanoparticles on the heavy oil recovery during the polymer flooding by anionic hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM). Therefore, {{for the first time in}} this study the effect of nanosilica (NS) in the polymer flooding in the presence of salt on the oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> has been investigated in a strongly oil wet five-spot glass micromodel saturated with the heavy oil and the image processing technique was applied to analyze the displacement mechanisms and also for calculation of the efficiency in each flooding test. The oil <b>recovery</b> <b>factor</b> after one pore volume of the injected fluid has been obtained and results indicate that in the presence of NS an improvement about 10 % in the <b>ultimate</b> oil <b>recovery</b> can be achieved and this is due to the viscosity enhancement of the injected fluid. Also it has been understood that nanoparticles have ability to change the wettability to water-wet in some portions of the micromodel...|$|R
