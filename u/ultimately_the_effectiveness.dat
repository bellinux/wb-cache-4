The problem is not simply the legal and moral grounds for the policy, nor the tactical implementation of the policy.

In this thesis, we propose a six-step methodology with an embedded robust analytic framework for determining those relationships and, <b>ultimately,</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of targeted killing. By analyzing Israel's program during the Second Intifada, this thesis demonstrates a causal understanding of whether targeted killing is efficacious.

Results indicate that students used three major categories in defining their perceptions of what each letter grade represent – Knowledge, Effort and Assignment, along with three minor categories – Learning, Critical Thinking and Success. Results also indicate that only about a third of participants actually engaged in self-grading in college and out of those who, do about 65 % indicate that they graded themselves harder than their professors.

Methods: A systematic search of the scientific literature from January 1970 to March 2009 was conducted using CINAHL, Cochrane, PEDro, Pubmed and Web of Science. keywords used included stroke, severe, hemiplegia, UL, task-oriented, robot, non-robot and electrical stimulation. Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the PEDro rating scale. Studies were grouped into one of three intervention categories: robotic therapy, electrical stimulation or 'other' therapy. Results: Seventeen randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria.

40|$|Prosperity {{during the}} early 20 th century in the United States of America enticed {{millions}} of European immigrants to leave their native lands for its shores. Arriving as sojourners and settlers, these new immigrants of various social classes and nationalities found commonality in their belief that America could change their lives for the better. Due to the chaotic nature of immigration, these new immigrant groups found solace and support among {{members of their own}} ethnicity. As a consequence, ethnic communities emerged throughout America's cities and countryside. These communities functioned and survived by providing cultural familiarity in a new land, as well as, economic and social services to immigrants in return for their member support.

As these communities grew so too did their services and with it the emergence of cultural organizations.

By comparing these organizations it will highlight the complex nature of cultural integration on a specific ethnic minority community and the effects they have on a group?s cultural identity and mentality.

40|$|For {{renewable}} energy {{to make a}} significant contribution to economic development, job creation, reduced oil dependence, and lower greenhouse gas emissions, it will be essential to improve the efficiency of technologies, reduce their costs, and develop mature, self-sustaining industries to manufacture, install and maintain {{renewable energy}} systems. The goal must not be simply to install capacity, but to provide the conditions for creation of a sustained and profitable industry, which, in turn, will result in increased renewable energy capacity and generation, and will drive down costs. To achieve this end, a viable, clear and long-term government commitment is critical. Also essential are policies that create markets, and ensure a fair rate of return for investors.

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} use of antivenoms, many questions remain about their effectiveness in the clinical setting. The almost universal acceptance of their value is based mainly on in vitro studies, animal studies and human observational studies. Numerous examples exist where they demonstrate clear benefit, such as consumption coagulopathy in viper envenoming, prevention of neurotoxicity in Australasian elapid bites, systemic effects in scorpion and funnel-web spider envenoming. There are also concerns about the quality and efficacy of some antivenoms. However, {{it is important not}} to confuse the efficacy of antivenom, defined as its ability to bind and neutralise venom-mediated effects under ideal conditions, and the effectiveness of antivenom, defined as its ability to reverse or prevent envenoming in human cases. There are numerous potential reasons for antivenom failure in human envenoming, of which antivenom inefficacy is only one. Other important reasons include venom-mediated effects being irreversible, antivenom being unable to reach the site of toxin-mediated injury, or the rapidity of onset of venom-mediated effects. A number of recent studies in Australia bring into question the effectiveness of some antivenoms, including snake antivenom for coagulopathy, redback spider and box jellyfish antivenoms. Despite brown snake antivenom being able to neutralise venom induced clotting in vitro, use of the antivenom in human envenoming does not appear to change the time course of coagulopathy. However, it is important that apparent antivenom ineffectiveness in specific cases is correctly interpreted and does not lead to a universal belief that antivenom is ineffective. It should rather encourage further studies to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of envenoming, the pharmacokinetics of venoms and antivenoms, and <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of antivenom based on snake type, clinical effects and timing of administration...|$|E
40|$|A healthy {{democracy}} is generally {{seen as one}} in which citizens participate regularly in formal political activities. Citizens’ participation in governance {{has come to be}} accepted as an expression of their rights and the manifestation of citizen agency. Access to information remains a crucial component of the right to participate. Transparency, as a normative and constitutional value, represents a means, not an end. The means is the mechanism of access to information. Within the South African context, there is evidence of an increase in participation of a variety of interest groups by means of different processes, as well as through the establishment of numerous consultative bodies and mechanisms for popular participation {{at all levels of the}} political structure (Houston, 2001 : 1). However, accountability to citizens can best be gauged by assessing citizens’ opportunities to influence legislation between elections. <b>Ultimately,</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and sustainability of mechanisms aim at improving citizens’ participation in policy formulation in order to become effective when they are “institutionalized” and when the state’s own “internal” mechanisms are rendered more transparent and open to civic engagement. Furthermore, the success depends on some form of effective interaction between the state and civic society. In the case of South Africa, whilst the political context and culture for participation exist in the form of the constitutional provisions and several pieces of legislation, a discrepancy exist whereby many South Africans are excluded or devalued by the vast differences in wealth. Citizen’s votes may count equally, but they are still not able to participate on an equal basis between elections. Participatory mechanisms established to ensure citizen’s participation, access to information and monitoring inside and outside the legislature, remain ineffective. These unequal opportunities mean that the poorer and less organised segments of society are prejudiced in terms of influencing legislation and policy. Their lack of full and meaningful participation means legislative outcomes are less representative of, and responsive to, the interests of the poorer segments of society (Habib, Shultz – Herzenberg, 2005 : 144). The focus of this study is limited to the province of KwaZulu-Natal. The aim is to, firstly, assess the extent to which citizens can control those who make collective decisions about public affairs. Secondly, it assess the extent to which citizens participate in the existing participatory mechanisms, and thirdly, the study explores the possibilities of the synergy between the state and civil society in promoting effective participation by its citizens. The study, therefore : 1. Assess the theoretical and policy framework for citizen’s participation in South Africa; and 2. Evaluate the level of participation and effectiveness of participatory mechanisms inside and outside the KwaZulu - Natal Legislature. The study introduces the theoretical and conceptual framework of citizen participation through a literature review; followed by an empirical study of citizen participation in the legislative process in the kwaZulu Natal legislature. The study makes the following findings: 1. The literature review concurs that South Africa has one of the most progressive and liberal constitutions in the world. This is coupled with a sound policy framework demonstrating genuine political will for citizens’ participation in policy formulation. 2. Within the political context and culture for citizen participation, the main question of how much control citizens have over the actions of their government remains. Another issue is whether existing mechanisms in the legislature are effective in engendering citizen’s participation and quality input in public policy – making processes. 3. The study showed that <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and sustainability of citizen participation mechanisms is improved when they are “institutionalised” and when the state’s own internal mechanisms of accountability are rendered more transparent and open to civic engagement. The study also highlighted the need for synergy between the state and civil society. This includes, among other things, participatory budgeting, public expenditure tracking, monitoring of public service delivery, investigative journalism and citizens’ advisory boards. The study, therefore, makes two recommendations: 1. A comparative Citizens Education and Outreach Programme be developed and spearheaded by both the legislature and civil society in kwaZulu-Natal; and 2. A further study needs to be undertaken to investigate the possible structural nature of the synergy (relationship) between the state and civil society in the provinc...|$|E

Defined here as “a change in understanding that goes beyond the individual to become situated within wider social units or communities of practice through social interactions between actors within social networks” (Reed et al. 2010), a social learning approach situates scientific research as just one form of specialised knowledge amidst other contextual knowledge. Co-learning – by bringing diverse knowledge and social worlds together to exchange needs, values and norms – is considered necessary for addressing complex, wicked problems and for building decision processes and adaptive structures that help navigate uncertain futures. Including socially differentiated groups into processes of knowledge creation and decision- making may fundamentally alter what questions are asked, how changes in practices are framed and how to break down systemic patterns of vulnerability and marginalisation. This paper investigates the synergies (and trade-offs) associated with integrating socially differentiated stakeholders and/or groups – the poor, women, elderly, youth and indigenous – into social learning processes aimed at addressing poverty reduction, livelihood development and longer term resilience. An exploratory scan of CGIAR identifies projects that engage socially differentiated groups in processes of social learning. Cases were characterised for their treatment of i) the particular context, including rationale for the engagement of socially differentiated groups, ii) the design of engagement interfaces, iii) the type of learning loops occurring, iv) particular channels that contributed to learning across networks and, where applicable, v) the outcomes and lessons from the learning process. The findings suggest that diverse forms of social differentiation and learning are occurring across many of CGIAR’s fifteen research centres. This is in part due to institutional reform that has put an increasing emphasis on gender strategies and monitored development outcomes. A more explicit recognition of the role and ‘added value’ that social learning research approaches have can enhance its visibility and <b>ultimately</b> <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of CGIAR’s vast research partnerships...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{active control}} of planar {{structural}} radiators has approached the problem through integrating sensors and actuators on {{or into the}} structure. In such an approach, {{the goal is to}} modify the systems response to disturbance, rather than influence the disturbance path to the radiating structure. Many practical issues exist, which <b>ultimately</b> limit <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of such an approach. A general problem in industry is noise radiation from a structure housing a rotating device, where the rotating device creates the disturbance. In this project we have attacked the problem by seeking to reduce the force transmission in the path, which is the root cause of the sound radiation, rather then the vibration on the radiating surface itself. It is hoped that higher levels of attenuation may result. Presented {{here are some of the}} design requirements to integrate an active bearing, possible control approaches and preliminary experimental data. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article investigates a {{language}} learner’s cognitive ability (i. e., form-orientation) in detecting the corrective nature of non-salient feedback, by reviewing the operationalizations and reported effectiveness of recasts in recent SLA literature. Two directionalities {{which seem to}} {{have resulted in the}} divergent findings of recast effectiveness will be discussed: (a) operationalized (or intact) explicitness or implicitness of recasts, which designate the level of noticeability (i. e., feedback factors) and (b) contextual variables, including where a study was conducted and participants’ learning background, which <b>ultimately</b> influence <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of recasts on language development (i. e., learner factors). To expose learner factors accordingly, learning contexts and learner’s explicit knowledge will be discussed as possible variables in forming cognitive orientation. By taking an interdisciplinary approach to explore the constitution of the orientation, namely, SLA, psycholinguistic, and sociocultural approaches, this article concludes that contexts and explicit knowledge interdependently create the cognitive ability that enhances the noticing of implicit recasts, which then arguably determines subsequent language development...|$|R
40|$|European {{integration}} {{has long}} {{relied on the}} democratic legitimacy of its Member States without paying {{much attention to the}} increasing importance of its multilevel governing processes. At this time, however, Europe is caught in the intersection of multiple crises, all of which—Brexit as well as the euro crisis, the refugee crisis as well as the crises in Europe's relations with its Eastern and Southern ‘near abroad’—are challenging <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> as well as the democratic legitimacy of government on European and national levels. These dual challenges are connected: Democratic legitimacy presupposes effective governing and problem-solving capacity. Hence the failure of output legitimacy may undermine or even destroy the possibility of input legitimacy—a risk for which the fate of the Weimar Republic remains a most disturbing memento. At the same time, however, the lack of input legitimacy in the present European context will constrain and may <b>ultimately</b> destroy <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of measures based on non-accountable supranational authority. 1 Democratic aspirations 2 The asymmetric impact of excessive consitutionalisation 3 The joint decision trap 4 From legitimating consensus to legitmate majority rule? 5 Differentiated integration and the empowerment or democratic politic...|$|R
