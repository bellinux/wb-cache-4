50|$|When {{floppy disk}} media was first {{available}} {{this type of}} file system was adequate due to the relatively small amount of data space available. CP/M machines featured a flat file system, where files could be {{assigned to one of}} 16 <b>user</b> <b>areas</b> and generic file operations narrowed to work on one instead of defaulting to work on all of them. These <b>user</b> <b>areas</b> were no more than special attributes associated with the files, that is, it was not necessary to define specific quota for each of these areas and files could be added to groups for as long as there was still free storage space on the disk. The early Apple Macintosh also featured a flat file system, the Macintosh File System. It was unusual in that the file management program (Macintosh Finder) created the illusion of a partially hierarchical filing system on top of EMFS. This structure required every file to have a unique name, even if it appeared to be in a separate folder. IBM DOS/360 and OS/360 store entries for all files on a disk pack (volume) in a directory on the pack called a Volume Table of Contents (VTOC).|$|R
