40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effect of early ambulation after cardiac catheterization (CC) on patients’ back pain, puncture site pain, vascular complications, <b>urinary</b> <b>discomfort,</b> general well-being perception and satisfaction level. Methods: This study was a randomized single-blinded controlled trial. Overall, 137 participants were randomly assigned to experimental (63 participants) or control (74 participants) group according to a computer generated random list. Early ambulation (ambulate at 4 hours post-CC) and routine post-procedure care of 12 to 24 hours were used in the experimental and control groups respectively. Independent t-test, Chi-square test, multiple logistic regression and generalized estimation equation model were applied to compare various outcomes between experimental and control groups. Results: Only one patient in the control group experienced puncture site bleeding after CC. Ambulation at 4 hours after CC significantly reduced patients’ back pain 8 hours after they returned to the unit (OR= 0. 19, 95 % CI: 0. 08 - 0. 45, p< 0. 001) and in the next morning (OR= 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 15 - 0. 87, p= 0. 023), decrease <b>urinary</b> <b>discomfort</b> (OR= 0. 35, 95 % CI: 0. 14 - 0. 90, p= 0. 03 for “very or unbearable urination discomfort” and OR= 0. 22, 95 % CI: 0. 06 - 0. 74, p= 0. 015 for “much difficulty or unable to urinate at all”), and increase general well- being (p= 0. 005 for vitality subscale and p= 0. 014 for the total general well-being). However, it made no significant differences on puncture site pain as well as the satisfaction level of patients. Conclusion: The study enhanced health providers’ understanding about the effects of early ambulation on patient outcomes.

40|$|Background: Recent {{substance}} abuse research indicates {{gender differences in}} the substance-related epidemiology, biological responses, progression to dependence, medical consequences and treatments. Studies exploring human sex-different responses to ketamine are rare and there has been no systemic survey of gender differences in ketamine use. Determining whether females are more susceptible than males to ketamine withdrawal symptoms and adverse effects is important, because it associated with treatment retention and outcome in drug users. Methods: The Taiwanese juridical system has implemented a new regulation on ketamine in the year 2009. Ketamine users who are caught by the police, are mandated to attend an educational program. We recruited ketamine offenders from February 2010 to May 2012 at the Kunming branch of the Taipei City Hospital, where the educational classes are held. A designed questionnaire was performed to gather information about demographic characteristics, discontinuation symptoms, concomitant use of other substances, and subjective experience of memory impairment or <b>urinary</b> <b>discomforts,</b> and to compare the gender differences. Results: A total of 1, 614 ketamine users were surveyed and most of them were males (83. 8 %), with an average age of 26. 3 ± 5. 4 years. Female ketamine users presented significantly more discontinuation symptoms such as anxiety, dysphoria, and tremors compared with male users. 72. 4 % of total ketamine users smoked cigarettes concomitantly.

No studies have evaluated ECT performed in vulvar cancer. The aim of our study was to evaluate the safety, local tumour efficacy and relief of symptoms of ECT treatment in patients affected by recurrence of squamocellular vulvar cancer (V-SCC) unsuitable for standard treatments. MethodsWe enrolled nine patients with histological diagnosis of recurrence of V-SCC. Intravenous bleomycin was injected under general sedation after an accurate mapping of all lesions and ECT was performed. Patients were reviewed after one, three and six months. Response to therapy was evaluated using RECIST criteria {{and quality of life}} (QoL) was evaluated via questionnaires. ResultsThe median age was 84 years (range 80 – 90 years). The main location of recurrences was the vulva (87. 5 %). Multiple lesions were present in 25 % of cases. No peri-operative complications were observed. Response to therapy was complete in 62. 5 % of patients, partial in 12. 5 %, no change was observed in 12. 5 % and progression of disease in 12. 5 % of patients respectively. Evaluation of symptoms showed a significant reduction of pain, bleeding, odour (p< 0. 04) and <b>urinary</b> <b>discomfort</b> (p< 0. 04). We observed two relapses at four and seven months after treatment. After nine months fifty percent of patients were alive.

30|$|<b>Urinary</b> catheter-related <b>discomfort</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as a burning sensation spreading from the suprapubic area to the penis with an urge to void thought to be due to friction between the catheter and the urothelium. This friction causes involuntary bladder contractions through muscarinic receptors; the first line treatment is anticholinergic medications similar to the treatment for overactive bladder. However, these treatments are not without side effects, most notably dry mouth, blurred vision, and facial flushing (Kaufman et al. 2007). Targeting this discomfort early is essential, because these effects often first occur in the recovery unit, and are very concerning for patients and their families as it often exacerbates the incisional pain from surgery. Intravenous or oral narcotic medication have been shown to be effective in the prevention and treatment catheter-related discomfort, but these agents cause sedation after the operation, delayed bowel function, and may prolong hospitalization (American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Acute Pain Management 2012).|$|R

However, surgeons and anaesthetists may be wary of operating on this age group as surgery is life-enhancing rather than life-saving. Traditionally, vaginal repair surgery performed includes vaginal hysterectomy, anterior/posterior colporrhaphy and sacrospinous fixation. All of these carry a significant morbidity, such as secondary haemorrhage, infection and exacerbation of pre-existing medical problems. These risks increase in the very elderly. We hypothesise that reconstructive laparoscopic surgery, with low infection risk and little risk of significant blood loss, is an acceptable alternative option for this age group.|$|R

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. March 2014. Major: Veterinary Medicine. Advisors: Jody P. Lulich, Michael P. Murtaugh. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 50 pages. Calcium oxalate (CaOx) urolithiasis {{is an important}} disease in companion animals and remains challenging for veterinarians to manage, because the precise etiological cascade of events leading to urolith formation is unknown. Over the past three decades, prevalence of CaOx stones has increased in dogs and cats. Medical therapy to dissolve calcium oxalate uroliths is currently unavailable. As a result, therapies are unsuccessful and uroliths are commonly associated with lower <b>urinary</b> tract <b>discomfort</b> and potential life-threatening urethral obstruction, as well as ureteral obstruction and kidney failure. Hyperoxaluria, due to increased urine CaOx saturation, is an important risk factor for calcium oxalate stone formation. Although the majority of urinary oxalate is derived from endogenous metabolic pathways, increased urinary oxalate appears to be sustained by an increased dietary load of oxalate and increased intestinal absorption, which is then secreted through the urine, since mammals are incapable of metabolizing oxalate. Our research goal is to develop safe and effective treatments to prevent stone recurrence, evaluating various approaches for gene therapy and their feasibility in a cell culture model system. The specific goal is to evaluate oxalate-degrading enzyme gene expression and activity in a feline kidney cell line, {{in order to identify}} potential candidates for future gene therapy applications in dogs and cats. Our hypothesis is that kidney cells (Crandell-Rees Feline Kidney-CRFK cell line) will stably degrade oxalate in vitro by expressing and secreting a functional oxalate-degrading enzyme into the media of transfected cells. Our objectives are: 1) to molecularly clone oxalate-degrading enzymes from available gene sequences for gene expression analysis; 2) to evaluate plasmid transfection into feline kidney cells, in order to optimize and characterize transfection of this cell line; and 3), to test the ability of oxalate-degrading activity of clones to decrease the oxalate content of media (measured by ion chromatography). Lastly, the most active protein will be tested for functionality. Results showed that oxalate-decarboxylase from different microorganisms sources were cloned, expressed and secreted in an eukaryotic cell system, and that these enzymes retained their oxalate-degradation activity...|$|R
40|$|Interstitial {{cystitis}} (IC) is {{a chronic}} bladder disease with <b>urinary</b> frequency, bladder <b>discomfort</b> or bladder pain of unknown etiology. Based on cystoscopic findings, patients with IC {{are classified as}} either Hunner-type/classic IC (HIC), presenting with a specific Hunner lesion, or non-Hunner-type IC (NHIC), presenting with no Hunner lesion, but post-hydrodistension mucosal bleeding. Inflammatory cell infiltration, composed predominantly of lymphocytes, plasma cells and epithelial denudation, {{has in the past}} been documented as a major pathological IC finding. However, the significance of the pathological evaluation of IC, especially with regard to the difference between HIC and NHIC, has been downplayed in recent years. In this study, we performed immunohistochemical quantification of infiltrating T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and plasma cells, and measured the amount of residual epithelium in urinary bladder biopsy specimens taken from patients with HIC and NHIC, and those with no IC, using image analysis software. In addition, in situ hybridization of the light chains was performed to examine clonal B-cell expansion. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was significantly more severe in HIC specimens than in NHIC specimens (P < 0. 0001). Substantial lymphoplasmacytic inflammation (≥ 200 cells/mm 2) was observed in 93 % of HIC specimens, whereas only 8 % of NHIC specimens were inflamed. Plasmacytic infiltration was more prominent in HIC specimens compared with NHIC and non-IC cystitis specimens (P < 0. 005). Furthermore, expansion of light-chain-restricted B-cells was observed in 31 % of cases of HIC. The amount of residual epithelium was decreased in HIC specimens compared with NHIC specimens and non-IC cystitis specimens (P < 0. 0001). These results suggest that NHIC and HIC are distinct pathological entities, with the latter characterized by pancystitis, frequent clonal B-cell expansion and epithelial denudation.

Erosions, crusting, and atrophic scarring of the shaft and coronal sulcus before treatment. help minimize further progression of the disease. Other treatment options include topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical and systemic retinoids, cyclosporine, methotrexate, potassium para-aminobenzoate, antibiotics, phototherapy, cryotherapy, and carbon dioxide laser. All of these treatments have been described anecdotally in small numbers of patients, without consistent results. 1 Testosterone and other hormonal agents are no longer recommended. 1 Prevention of significant scarring is the goal of therapy because it leads to psychosocial, sexual, and physical morbidity. Once scarring has developed, treatment options are limited, and, often, urological surgery seems to offer the best chance at improvement. 1 Because the treatment responses are inconsistent, another form of therapy that has the potential to reduce the risk of scarring was sought in this case...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{study the}} feasibility/toxicity of {{urethral}} stenting with the Memokath® 028 SW stent in patients undergoing prostate implant (PI) for prostate adenocarcinoma. Material and methods: An Investigational Device Exemption from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and {{institutional review board}} (IRB) approval were obtained. Twenty patients enrolled.

Removal of the stent was planned at six months after PI, or earlier due to excessive toxicity/patient request. Results: Median age was 66. 5 years. The median prostate volume was 39 cc (range: 10 - 90). The median baseline AUA score was 7. 5 (range: 1 - 21). Three patients required intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) within 3 days after PI. No patients required ISC beyond day 3 after PI. The median duration of ISC was 1 day (range: 1 - 2). AUA scores returned to baseline values 6 weeks after PI. The week 6 AUA score was 10 (range: 4 - 16). Seven patients (35 %) underwent early removal because of patient preference. The reasons were: incontinence (n = 3), discomfort (n = 2), hematuria (n = 1), and obstructive symptoms (n = 1). The median time of stent removal in these patients was 13. 9 weeks (range: 0. 9 - 21. 4). Thirteen patients (65 %) had ISC and/or urinary catheterization post stent removal. Median time for ISC use was 10 days (range: 1 - 90). Conclusions: Urethral stenting with Memokath® in patients undergoing PI was feasible, but resulted in relatively high rate of <b>urinary</b> incontinence and <b>discomfort.</b> Given the adverse effects experienced by patients of this study, further studies should focus only on patients with highest risk of urinary obstruction from PI or those with obstruction needing ISC...|$|R
40|$|Trata-se de um ensaio clínico prospectivo comparativo que objetivou comparar os efeitos do tratamento com eletroestimulação transvaginal (ET) e do nervo tibial (ENT) sobre a qualidade de vida (QV) e queixas de perda urinária em mulheres com bexiga hiperativa. Participaram 42 pacientes com bexiga hiperativa ou incontinência urinária (IU) mista e foram divididas para tratamento com ET ou ENT. A QV foi avaliada pelo questionário de QV genérico, o Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF- 36) e um questionário específico para IU, o Incontinence Quality of Life Instrument (I-QOL). Os relatos de perdas urinárias e incômodos ocasionados foram avaliados, respectivamente, por meio do diário miccional de 24 horas e Escala Visual Analógica (EVA). O tratamento foi realizado uma vez por semana, totalizando doze semanas. O grupo da ENT teve melhora significativa em três domínios do I-QOL, na EVA, que avaliou o grau de incômodo causado pela IU e em quatro aspectos do diário miccional. No grupo de ET houve melhora significativa de dois domínios do SF- 36, três domínios do I-QOL, na EVA e em quatro aspectos do diário. Houve melhora da QV em ambos os grupos, assim como uma diminuição das queixas de perda urinária, entretanto, o grupo que recebeu ET obteve melhora nos escores em dois domínios do questionário de QV genérico após o tratamento, que teve limitação por aspectos físicos e limitação por aspectos emocionais. O que não ocorreu com o grupo de ENT. This is a {{prospective}} comparative clinical study. This study aimed {{to compare the}} effects of intravaginal electrical stimulation therapy (IS) and the tibial nerve (TNS) on quality of life (QOL) and complaints of urinary incontinence in women with overactive bladder. Participants 42 patients with overactive bladder or urinary incontinence (UI) mix and were divided for treatment with IS or TNS. To assess QOL we used a generic QOL questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF- 36) and a specific questionnaire for urinary incontinence, the Incontinence Quality of Life Instrument (I-QOL). The reports of <b>urinary</b> incontinence and <b>discomfort</b> caused were evaluated, respectively, through the 24 -hour voiding diary and visual analog scale (VAS). Treatment was performed once a week, twelve weeks in total. The PTNS group had significant improvement in three areas of the I-QOL in VAS, which assessed the degree of discomfort caused by IU and four aspects of voiding diary. In the IS group significantly improved in two domains of the SF- 36 domains of the three I-QOL in VAS and on four issues of the journal. There was improvement in QOL in both groups, {{as well as a}} decrease in complaints of urinary leakage, however, the group that received IS had been improved scores in two areas of the generic QOL questionnaire after treatment, which were limited by the physical limitation and by emotional aspects. What did not happen with the group of TNS...|$|R
