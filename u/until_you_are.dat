25|$|The {{street system}} of Peoria {{is based on}} the city of Phoenix {{traditional}} grid system, with most roads oriented either north-south or east-west. The zero point is in downtown Phoenix at Central Avenue and Washington Street. Since Peoria is always west of zero, its north-south numbered Streets are Avenues. Major arterial streets are spaced one mile (1.6km) apart (<b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> north of roughly Pinnacle Peak Road). The one-mile (1.6km) blocks are divided into approximately 800 house numbers although this varies. 83rd Avenue, being 8300 West. The numbers in Phoenix start at Central Avenue at a half-mile increment, going west to 7th Avenue ½ mile from Central but considered the arterial. Then the numbers go to 19th (1 mile from 7th), 27th, 35th, 43rd, 51st, 59th, 67th (in many places Peoria's eastern border), 75th, 83rd, 91st, 99th, and so on. In northern Peoria streets are more curvilinear and begin to not follow the north-south route due to rivers, mountains, and terrain challenges. The northern end of the city does still follow the alignment theory and still has blocking according to Phoenix.|$|E
500|$|According to Taraborrelli, [...] "Many female artists {{behave like}} a diva for a period when they reach superstar status, and the 'Who's That Girl?' tour marked the {{beginning}} of Madonna's." [...] For instance, she would not allow crew members to talk directly to her; they had to talk to her representatives, lest they distract her from the business at hand. She also forbade her dancers from speaking to her and her musicians were not permitted to even look at her unless they were onstage with her. Moreover, when coming on and off the stage, Madonna demanded that road managers hold sheets around her in order to shield her from the eyes of [...] "those who couldn't help but stare". DeMann commented: [...] "She has a way of demanding that compels you to give her your undivided attention", to which Taraborrelli felt that such behavior actually was an indication of how successful and strong Madonna was. [...] "You don't {{behave like a}} bitch <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> that successful. The tour sure helped cement her star status", he commented.|$|E

500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} {{to me that}} they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there {{is likely to be a}} fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in and stick it out... dig, dig, dig <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> safe". The survivors had to fight on alone until 28 April when four battalions of the Royal Naval Division were attached to the corps.|$|E
500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "I have {{a strong}} memory from my {{childhood}} of just how dark and gruesome their tale was and I wondered {{what would have happened}} to the two of them when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as I thought about it, it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "baptized in the Holy Spirit" [...] occurs {{two times}} in Acts of the Apostles, first in Acts 1:4–5 and second in Acts 11:16. Other {{terminology}} {{is used in}} Acts to indicate Spirit baptism, such as [...] "filled". [...] "Baptized in the Spirit" [...] indicates an outward immersion into {{the reality of the}} Holy Spirit, while [...] "filled with the Spirit" [...] suggests an internal diffusion. Both terms speak to the totality of receiving the Spirit. [...] The baptism with the Holy Spirit is described in various places as the Spirit [...] "poured out upon", [...] "falling upon", [...] "coming upon" [...] people. To [...] "pour out" [...] suggests abundance and reflects John 3:34, [...] "God gives the Spirit without limit". Another expression, [...] "come upon" [...] is related to a statement by Jesus in Luke 24:49, [...] "I am sending the promise of my Father upon you. But stay in the city <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> clothed with power from on high". The language of [...] "come on" [...] and [...] "clothed with" [...] suggest possession by and endowment with the Holy Spirit.|$|E

500|$|With the {{intention}} of playing the 2015 season in the forward line alongside Jesse Hogan and Chris Dawes, a groin injury hampered Watts' pre-season training for three months heading into the season. He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called {{for him to be}} dropped with David Schwarz stating he [...] "might have to sit out a week" [...] and Dermott Brereton professing [...] "you have to make a stand as to what your team stands for, and that means you can't bring him back in <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> convinced he will not do that again"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting [...] "he can't relapse into these kind of performances", adding [...] "I don't like using the word, but he looked a little soft at times".|$|E
500|$|J.R. {{explains}} to Jock and Bobby that Ewing Oil is doing fine, leaving Bobby suspicious. J.R. had swindled {{most of the}} other oilmen that he knows to salvage Ewing Oil by convincing their cartel to buy worthless oil fields from him just prior to nationalization. Cartel member, Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide {{as a result of the}} dealings. Soon thereafter, Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization. The report ends with the story of the widowed Marilee Stone, whose husband Seth had bought shares from Ewing Oil. Marilee's calls to J.R. are refused. Cartel member Vaughn Leland, who lost $20 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in the deal, reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him, but Jock refuses to offer any restitution. All of the cartel members have lost everything they had in the deal and J.R. increased his wealth in the dealings. [...] The Ewings question whether J.R. took advantage of inside information. J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him. [...] Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor/boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason. Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone. Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information. [...] Shepard has been tape recording secrets of the cartel members from between the sheets and learned how J.R. got them all to buy his oil wells. Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R.'s secretary. Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother, Rebecca. They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger. Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re-institutionalize her. Bobby says he will try to keep J.R. from taking that action. J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard's request for records and to shred them. [...] Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Elby. She gets a reminder about drinking <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> unconscious and promises to stop. J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief. He tries to bribe her to leave, but she does not accept the offer. J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen. She alerts him that Bobby is going to speak up for her. He is not worried. She then inquires about whether he is going to be unfaithful. When he leaves for another woman she gets upset, but finds a gun lying around, which gives her pause.|$|E

2500|$|The dueling {{deaths of}} Brigadier Generals Allen and Hogan {{demonstrate}} the difficulty Governor Miller had in recruiting a good officer corps. Mr. Shinn {{wrote that the}} Territorial Militia officers were often [...] "of the Western type, free and easy in their manners, very outspoken in their conversation and therefore very hard to control". Indeed, Shinn concludes, the militia was composed of [...] "combustible elements". [...] The method of selecting militia officers contributed to their poor quality. By both law and custom company-level officers, and some at higher levels, were elected by the enlisted men. This frequently resulted in two bad side-effects: [...] (1) popularity, rather than intelligence or ability, became the basis upon which officers were elected; and (2) the militia became deeply immersed in politics. Actually, the militia had long been a stepping stone to political office: George Washington himself had been a Virginia militiaman. Even the backwoodsman Davey Crockett commented on the political nature of the frontier militia when called upon to give his formula for political success: [...] "Intrigue <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> elected {{an officer of the}} militia; this is the second step toward promotion, and can be accomplished with ease".|$|E
