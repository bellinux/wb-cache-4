5|$|On {{the nights}} of 13 and 14 March 1941, the Clydebank Blitz {{virtually}} destroyed the town. 528 civilians were killed, over 617 people were seriously injured, and 48,000 civilians lost their homes. Only seven properties in Clydebank were <b>undamaged,</b> {{in one of}} the worst bombing raids in Britain. The raids, involving 260 Luftwaffe bombers on the first night and 200 on the second, targeted the industry of Clydeside, but the Titan crane was <b>undamaged.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{only one}} of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other strand {{can be used as a}} {{template}} to guide the correction of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an <b>undamaged</b> nucleotide complementary to that found in the <b>undamaged</b> DNA strand.|$|E
5|$|If the <b>undamaged</b> part {{were the}} rear {{half of the}} train, this would be driven by the Chef du Train, who is a fully {{authorised}} driver and occupies the rear driving cab while the train travels through the tunnel for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The 8th Panzer Division and 16th Motorised Infantry Division faced {{almost no}} {{resistance}} {{as they drove}} east towards Belgrade, capturing Našice, Osijek, Vinkovci and Vukovar during the day. On the night of 11/12 April, they captured Sremska Mitrovica, Ruma and secured a crossing over the Danube via an <b>undamaged</b> bridge near Bogojevo.|$|E
5|$|The next notable {{victim of}} the fire was the church Trinitatis Kirke, which housed the University Library in its attic. The flames got a hold the church around 5p.m. and when the ceiling gave around 10p.m., the entire library's {{collection}} was delivered into a sea of flames. Rundetårn was left {{for the most part}} <b>undamaged,</b> but the observatory at the top burned out.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{incendiary}} devices had {{decreased by}} the 14th century, {{perhaps due to}} the economic realities of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were <b>undamaged.</b> Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century, {{perhaps because of the}} prior success of the incendiary weapons at destroying them.|$|E
5|$|A single Pe-3 was {{captured}} by the Finns when it {{had to make a}} forced landing in marshy ground near Lake Inari on 28 November 1942. It was relatively <b>undamaged</b> and was recovered, repaired and placed into service as 'PE-301'. It served with PLeLv 48 and was converted into a photo-reconnaissance aircraft in 1944 before being destroyed by a Soviet bombing raid on the airfield at Lappeenranta on 2 July 1944. By then, it had flown over 222 hours in Finnish service.|$|E
5|$|After being {{selected}} in April 1945, Hiroshima was spared conventional bombing {{to serve as}} a pristine target, where the effects of a nuclear bomb on an <b>undamaged</b> city could be observed. While damage could be studied later, the energy yield of the untested Little Boy design could be determined only at the moment of detonation, using instruments dropped by parachute from a plane flying in formation with the one that dropped the bomb. Radio-transmitted data from these instruments indicated a yield of about 15 kilotons.|$|E
5|$|Although {{of little}} {{strategic}} value and <b>undamaged</b> {{during the early}} stages of World War II, {{in the final stages of}} the war a number of V-1 flying bombs and V-2 ballistic missiles struck the area. The worst attack occurred in February 1945, when a V-2 struck Westbeech Road, killing 17 and injuring 68. The bombsites were redeveloped with housing in then-current styles, rather than to Plumbe and Earle's designs.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{one hour}} later, Hiryū's second attack wave, {{consisting}} of ten B5Ns and six escorting A6Ms, arrived over Yorktown; the repair efforts {{had been so}} effective that the Japanese pilots assumed that Yorktown must be a different, <b>undamaged</b> carrier. They attacked, crippling Yorktown with two torpedoes; she lost all power and developed a 23-degree list to port. Five torpedo bombers and two fighters were shot down in this attack.|$|E
5|$|As {{his works}} have sold since the 2010s, Invader adopted a new {{strategy}} to avoid them being removed. In late 2015, Invader planned a series of art pieces in New York City, putting out a call on social media for building owners who {{would be willing to}} host his mosaics legally. In addition, he has chosen sites with architectural features restricting access. Also, his works may be larger and use more delicate tiles so that they cannot be removed <b>undamaged.</b>|$|E
5|$|As of September 2017, {{reconstruction}} of the damaged lower section of the spillway was about one-third complete, {{with the goal of}} making the spillway operational by November 1. In 2018, the upper section of the spillway which was <b>undamaged</b> by the flood but also has been identified as structurally defective, will be demolished and rebuilt. In addition, crews are working to extend a cutoff wall under the emergency spillway to prevent erosion should that structure be used again in the future.|$|E
5|$|At 11:35, Kinkaid {{decided to}} {{withdraw}} Enterprise and her screening ships from battle, since Hornet {{was out of}} action, Enterprise was heavily damaged, and surmising, correctly, that the Japanese had one or two <b>undamaged</b> carriers in the area. Leaving Hornet behind, Kinkaid directed the carrier and her task force to retreat {{as soon as they}} were able. Between 11:39 and 13:22, Enterprise recovered 57 of the 73 airborne U.S. aircraft as she retreated. The remaining U.S. aircraft ditched in the ocean, and their aircrews were rescued by escorting warships.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the Necropolis station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was <b>undamaged</b> {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign, and services generally continued as normal.|$|E
5|$|Finally at 7:58pm, President ceased {{fire and}} hoisted {{a light in}} her rigging, {{indicating}} that she had surrendered. Endymion ceased firing on the defeated American ship but did not board to take possession of her prize, {{due to a lack}} of <b>undamaged</b> boats. Endymions foresails had been damaged in the engagement and while she hove to for repairs, Decatur took advantage of the situation and, despite having struck, made off to escape at 8.30pm; Endymion, hastily completed repairs and resumed the chase at 8.52pm.|$|E
5|$|For {{ten hours}} in December 1982, the Washington Monument and eight {{tourists}} were {{held hostage by}} a nuclear arms protester, Norman Mayer, claiming to have explosives in a van he drove to the monument's base. U.S. Park Police shot and killed Mayer. The monument was <b>undamaged</b> in the incident, and it was discovered later that Mayer did not have explosives. After this incident, the surrounding grounds were modified in places to restrict the possible unauthorized approach of motor vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Schoemann was <b>undamaged</b> by British aircraft, but was {{repeatedly}} {{struck in the}} stern by 20mm cannon shells from the defending German fighters. Later that afternoon, Vice Admiral (Vizeadmiral) Otto Ciliax, commander of the battleship flotilla, {{was transferred to the}} ship after his temporary flagship, the destroyer , was disabled by a premature detonation in one of her guns that sent shrapnel into the machinery spaces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of development, {{hitherto}} unknown information contained within <b>undamaged</b> DNA would be enough to bring others back from the dead including their memories and personality. This would be done by taking a small sample from someone's body and preserving it at the time when the level of the brain's efficiency and knowledge is highest. On the day of death, a cell would be taken from the sample for the cloning to take place, and the memories and personality would be restored to their peak level.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} {{structures}} were demolished during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines (1941–1945), but some still exist, including the Palma Bridge and Baker Memorial Hall (both built during Dean Bienvenido M. Gonzalez's term from 1927 to 1938). All the student residences, 23 College of Agriculture buildings, 13 student dormitories and bungalows, and 22 faculty and employee houses were destroyed during the Second World War. The School of Forestry was also devastated. Only the agricultural engineering building was left <b>undamaged.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ten-Go was {{the last}} major Japanese naval {{operation}} of the war, and the remaining Japanese warships had little involvement in combat operations {{for the rest of}} the conflict. Suzutsuki was never repaired. Fuyuzuki was repaired but hit a U.S. air-dropped mine at Moji, Japan, on 20 August 1945, and was not subsequently repaired. Yukikaze survived the war almost <b>undamaged.</b> Hatsushimo hit a U.S. air-dropped mine on 30 July 1945, near Maizuru, Japan, and was the 129th, and last, Japanese destroyer sunk in the war.|$|E
5|$|The German vessels {{were largely}} <b>undamaged</b> but the French lost their gunboat. Several of Papeete's {{buildings}} were destroyed and the town's economy was severely disrupted. The main strategic {{consequence of the}} engagement was the disclosure of the cruisers' positions to the British Admiralty, {{which led to the}} Battle of Coronel where the entire German East Asia Squadron defeated a Royal Navy squadron. The depletion of Scharnhorsts and Gneisenaus ammunition at Papeete also contributed to their subsequent destruction at the Battle of the Falklands.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese {{units that}} participated in the battle took heavy losses in their failed attempt to destroy the Viet Cong forces. South Vietnamese {{casualties}} included 83 killed in action and at least 100 wounded. The American participants, who included advisors and aircrews, counted three dead and eight wounded. Of the 15 American helicopters sent to support the operation, only one escaped <b>undamaged,</b> and five were downed or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The only {{portion of}} the Canadian assault that did not go as planned was the advance of the 4th Canadian Division, {{collapsing}} almost immediately after exiting their trenches. The commanding officer {{of one of the}} assaulting battalions requested that the artillery leave a portion of German trench <b>undamaged.</b> Machine-gun nests in the <b>undamaged</b> sections of the German line pinned down, wounded or killed much of the 4th Canadian Division's right flank. The progress on the left flank was eventually impeded by harassing fire from the Pimple that was made worse when the creeping barrage got too far ahead of the advancing troops. In view of the German defence, the 4th Canadian Division did not attempt a further frontal assault throughout the afternoon. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division came forward and once again attacked the German positions {{on the top of the}} ridge. Persistent attacks eventually forced the German troops holding the south-western portion of Hill145 to withdraw but only after they had run out of ammunition, mortar rounds and grenades.|$|E
5|$|The voyage was re-attempted on 3 July, but Integrity again {{ran into}} heavy weather off Cape Howe {{and was forced}} to turn towards the shore to seek shelter. The cutter entered what would later be known as Twofold Bay on the New South Wales South Coast, where to her crew's {{surprise}} they discovered Contest, <b>undamaged</b> but unable to return to sea in the storm.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of night engagements between the I Squadron battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1 June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; five of the I Squadron battleships took up {{defensive}} positions in the outer roadstead, and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The rest of the fleet entered Wilhelmshaven, where Friedrich der Grosse and the other ships still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. In {{the course of the}} battle, Friedrich der Grosse had fired 72 main battery shells and 151 rounds from her secondary guns. She emerged from the battle completely <b>undamaged.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the storm, {{approximately}} 100,000people {{were facing}} starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno {{reported that the}} government had inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens to assist with repairing infrastructure and providing food and shelter to others. The Government of Haiti, in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country. The approximately 10,000people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, <b>undamaged</b> buildings. Within {{a few months after the}} storm, 299homes were rebuilt or repair, costing almost $37,000. The vehicular paths destroyed by the hurricane were eventually replaced by -wide paved gravel roads. In September, the American Red Cross donated $10,000 to the Haitian Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|All of the gliders {{successfully}} {{took off}} at 07:20 on 24 March, but seven were lost {{en route to}} the landing zones, the majority being forced to cast off and land in Allied territory due to their tugs suffering engine failures; however, one Hamilcar which carried an M22 Locust broke up in mid-air as it approached the Rhine, possibly due to structural failure, and all aboard were killed. Three more of the gliders were destroyed by German anti-aircraft fire as they approached the landing zones, as their slow speed made them easy targets. The thirty-eight that remained landed successfully between 10:46 and 11:00, although a number of them suffered damage from anti-aircraft fire. Particularly hard hit were the Hamilcars that carried the RASC personnel and supplies; eight landed successfully, but only three were sufficiently <b>undamaged</b> to allow the stores they carried to be recovered. Of the eight Hamilcars that transported the M22 Locusts of 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment, seven reached the landing zones intact but had problems when they landed due to anti-aircraft fire and smoke obscuring the area. Four landed safely, but the other three came under heavy German anti-aircraft fire and crashed as they landed; one tank survived with a damaged machine gun, another crashed through a house which put its wireless radio set and main armament out of action, and the third broke loose of the glider as it landed and was flipped over onto its turret, which rendered it useless. After the operation had come to an end, a few of the <b>undamaged</b> Hamilcars were dismantled and their parts shipped to England to aid in the construction of further gliders.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, Persano {{broke off}} the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, {{he refused to}} {{counter-attack}} with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively. Kaiser Max had emerged from the battle essentially <b>undamaged,</b> the Italian shells having been unable to penetrate her armor.|$|E
5|$|As Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) {{struggles to}} gain {{government}} {{support for his}} moon colonisation project, his interest becomes focused on reports of hundreds of meteorites landing in Winnerden Flats. Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague (Bryan Forbes), Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an <b>undamaged</b> meteorite is shaped like a small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd V-shaped mark on his face. Black-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with machine guns and sporting similar V-shaped marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and ordering him to leave.|$|E
5|$|At about 08:00, the 4th Cavalry Division's 2nd Lancers (10th Cavalry Brigade) and the 5th Cavalry Division's 29th Lancers (Deccan Horse) (14th Cavalry Brigade) entered Afulah. Here about 75 German and 200 Ottoman {{prisoners were}} {{captured}} at the railway station, along with ten locomotives and 50 railway trucks or wagons in the sidings. A hospital, an aerodrome with three <b>undamaged</b> aircraft, a large quantity of petrol, and large stocks of champagne and hock were also captured. Armoured cars continued the pursuit, capturing 12 German lorries {{on the road}} to Beisan, while the railway running south and east from Afulah was cut; the line to the west had already been cut by the 13th Cavalry Brigade (5th Cavalry Division).|$|E
5|$|Between 1926 and 1972, no Albertosaurus fossils {{were found}} at all; but, since the seventies, {{there has been a}} steady {{increase}} in the known material. Apart from the Dry Island bonebed, six more skulls and skeletons have since been discovered in Alberta and are housed in various Canadian museums: specimens RTMP 81.010.001, found in 1978 by amateur paleontologist Maurice Stefanuk; RTMP 85.098.001, found by Stefanuk on 16 June 1985; RTMP 86.64.001 (December 1985); RTMP 86.205.001 (1986); RTMP 97.058.0001 (1996); and CMN 11315. However, due to vandalism and accidents, no <b>undamaged</b> and complete skulls could be secured among these finds. Fossils have also been reported from the American states of Montana, New Mexico, and Wyoming, but these probably do not represent A. sarcophagus and may not even belong to the genus Albertosaurus.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War Waterloo {{station and}} the nearby Thames bridges were a {{significant}} target for Axis bombing, and there were several near-misses on the station during the London Blitz of 1940–41. Although there were several interruptions to the Necropolis train service owing to enemy action elsewhere on the line, the Necropolis station was <b>undamaged</b> {{during the early stages}} of the bombing campaign. During the night of 16–17 April 1941, in one of the last major air raids on London, bombs repeatedly fell on the Waterloo area. The rolling stock berthed in the Necropolis siding was burned, and the railway arch connecting the main line to the Necropolis terminus was damaged, but the terminal building itself remained unscathed.|$|E
5|$|During the duel between Vengeur and Brunswick, the <b>undamaged</b> HMS Ramillies had {{approached}} and put {{herself in a}} favourable position to rake Vengeur, and was waiting for Brunswick to separate to open fire. When she did so, Ramillies fired two broadsides, leaving Vengeur with only her foremast standing, which fell half an hour later. Ramillies sustained some damage herself. Soon afterwards, seawater inundated the powder room of Vengeur, denying her all means of defence, and 250 of her crew were out of action. The Trente-et-un Mai closed in around 3:30, attempting to provide assistance, but the proximity of several British sails endangered her so that she eventually sailed away.|$|E
5|$|Himeji {{was heavily}} bombed in 1945, {{at the end}} of World War II, and {{although}} most of the surrounding area was burned to the ground, the castle survived intact. One firebomb was dropped {{on the top floor of}} the castle but failed to explode. In order to preserve the castle complex, substantial repair work was undertaken starting in 1956, with a labor expenditure of 250,000 man-days and a cost of 550 million yen. In January 1995, the city of Himeji was substantially damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake, but Himeji Castle again survived virtually <b>undamaged,</b> demonstrating remarkable earthquake resistance. Even the bottle of sake placed on the altar at the top floor of the keep remained in place.|$|E
5|$|However, landing paratroopers, and {{especially}} gliders, without {{the cover of}} darkness left them exceedingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The official history of the British Airborne Divisions highlights {{the cost of this}} trade-off, stating that of the 416 gliders that landed, only 88 remained <b>undamaged</b> by enemy fire, and that between 20–30percent of the glider pilots were casualties. Another historian argues that the gliders landing in daylight was a calamity, with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment having two-thirds of their gliders hit by ground fire and suffering heavy casualties as they landed. The casualty rates were worsened by the slow rates of release and descent of the gliders themselves, and the fact that each aircraft towed two gliders, slowing them even further; as the time to release a glider unit was 3–4 times longer than a parachute unit, the gliders were vulnerable to flak.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941, Emden was {{assigned}} to an operation in the Gulf of Riga to provide gunfire support to German troops. On the 16th, she was operating off Dagö with Leipzig and three torpedo boats; the ships came under fire from Soviet coastal batteries, but were <b>undamaged.</b> A group of four Soviet torpedo boats also made an unsuccessful attack on the German squadron. Emden was then assigned to the Baltic Fleet, centered on the newly commissioned battleship Tirpitz; the Baltic Fleet was tasked with preventing the Soviet Navy from breaking out of the Baltic. Emden and Leipzig were {{the core of the}} southern group, which was based in Libau. The fleet remained on station only briefly, and by 29 September, the ships were recalled to Gotenhafen.|$|E
