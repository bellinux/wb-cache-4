Both questionnaires and personal observations survey methods were used to elicit relevant data and the analysis of data generated revealed very poor housing and environmental conditions in these slum areas.

The paper thereafter recommended the integration of slum development into the urban planning framework and the upgrading of the present housing units to a well-structured low cost housing units affordable to the residents of the study area...|$|R

40|$|This book {{is based}} on the papers that were {{presented}} at the First International Urban Anthropology Conference, which was opened in Beijing on December 28, 1989. It contains twenty-two papers and six introductory contributions, dealing with the following subjects: 2 ̆ 7 Comparative Urbanism: Socialist and Asian Cities 2 ̆ 7; 2 ̆ 7 Chinese Urbanization 2 ̆ 7; 2 ̆ 7 Chinese Urban Ethnicity 2 ̆ 7; 2 ̆ 7 Chinese Urban Culture and Life Cycle 2 ̆ 7. These papers are written by Chinese and non-Chinese authors. The conference of 1989 / 1990 marked the beginning of urban anthropology in China. Before this, the objects of ethnological, sociological and anthropological research in China were rural, rather than urban. Besides, the attention of scholars was mostly directed towards the ethnic minorities in China. In the late 19702 ̆ 7 s however, contacts with Western anthropologists helped in redirecting part of Chinese anthropology towards the study of <b>urban</b> <b>conglomerations.</b> The congress of 1989 / 90 marked the acceptance of this new approach in China...|$|R

I believe that phenomena with destructive potential will occur with greater force in <b>urban</b> <b>conglomerations,</b> since the degree of vulnerability in these areas is quite high. I discuss the factors behind the disasters in large cities, with special emphasis on the processes of urbanization and growing metropolization worldwide; random urban growth, destruction of the environment; urban poverty; and the low levels of economic and institutional development available to prevent and mitigate natural and/or man-made disasters. Finally, I make recommendations for developing institutional plans that will help reduce the vulnerability of urban and densely populated areas in the face of disasters. About the Autho...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe built {{environment}} represents a major share of global energy consumption. To effectively reduce the energy consumption of <b>urban</b> <b>conglomerations,</b> concepts to sufficiently integrate and manage energy from renewables are necessary. In this paper the energy-hub concept will be applied, which describes {{the relation between}} input and output energy flows {{and can be used}} to optimize the energy consumption during planning and operation. The concept will be used to evaluate a number of future energy scenarios for a village in Switzerland which has the goal of eliminating the consumption of fossil fuels. As a starting point the existing situation concerning the energy demand of the village with respect to different uses, the different energy carriers, their origin, their distribution and networks is captured and analyzed. In the next step the potential for different means of decentralized energy production is evaluated. Decentralized energy production includes building integrated or local renewable energy production by photovoltaics, biomass, or small hydro power. In the third step, different future energy scenarios for an energy sustainable community are defined. These different scenarios are distinguished by their scale of implementation. Finally an energy hub model of the village is developed and used to evaluate the different energy scenarios...|$|R
40|$|After an {{introduction}} and {{overview of the}} state-of-art of electric vehicles (EVs) fleet and technology, this chapter addresses the bottlenecks on the take-up by the public of this technology, mainly: price of purchasing of an EV, their limited range (range anxiety) and long charging time. The chapter will also give an overview of battery, super-capacitors and hybrid power-pack (batteries plus supercapacitor) developments that in a near future will probably reduce these obstacles. In any introduction of a new technology the role of stakeholders (both public and private) is very important {{and they need to}} be defined and addressed. Because of the role of EV in reducing the level of ambient pollution in <b>urban</b> <b>conglomerations,</b> the chapter will also look to different efforts and programs that some stakeholders as for instance different municipalities and regional and national governments, are setting in order to actively support and stimulate the introduction of EVs. Finally, the chapter address how technical and non-technical developments will support the introduction of EV in the urban environment; it will also describe how better Total Cost of Ownership will translate into more business cases and how this will impinge in a more general electrification of public transport with the consequent improvement of urban ambient air quality.

The government censorship and limitations on foreign websites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have not eliminated the presence of social media within China.

For firms to successfully encourage brand awareness and loyalty from this generation of consumers, they will need to be utilising social media to distribute their message.

40|$|In {{the past}} fifty years {{the number of}} {{casualties}} due to the occurrence of earthquake events has been notably increasing, {{due in part to the}} demographic explosion that the world has seen in the XX century. Many of the large urban centres populating the globe are located in costal zones or next to mountain areas that are part of tectonic systems that include subduction zones or important faults capable of generating large earthquake events. Moreover, most of these <b>urban</b> <b>conglomerations</b> are located in developing areas of the world that have low resilience against natural hazards, posing high levels of risk against seismic hazard. The low resilience is mainly due, among other factors, including socio-economic ones, due to the high vulnerability of the building stock, which is characterized by poor construction quality and absence of seismic design features, commonly found in what is known as non-engineered structures. The aim of this paper is to present a summary of the common features and observed performance of this type of structures resulting from the experience of the Joint Research Centre from a number of post-earthquake field reconnaissance missions in developing areas the world, as well as the undergoing efforts to reduce their vulnerability and mitigate the construction of new ones.
