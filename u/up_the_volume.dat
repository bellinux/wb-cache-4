5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E

Many smartphones and personal media players are sold with earphones that do {{a poor job of}} blocking ambient noise, leading some users to turn <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> to the maximum level to drown out street noise.

Under the direction of co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, the Edge pursued more ambient guitar playing, Clayton turned <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> on his bass, and Mullen experimented with an electronically enhanced drum kit. Despite the work they continued to put into the track, the group considered abandoning the song, as they could not find an arrangement they liked.|$|E

25|$|Slater's career rose to {{new heights}} when he played the dark {{character}} J.D. in the 1989 film Heathers alongside Winona Ryder. Heathers was billed as the teen film of 1989, which {{had turned into a}} hit musical a year later. Slater beat out many other actors such as Brad Pitt for the part and his performance drew comparison with a young Jack Nicholson. After Heathers, Slater had offers to play more troubled youths, including as a rebellious teen in Pump <b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>Volume</b> (1990) and a wild gunman in Young Guns II (1990), in which Slater acted alongside Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland.|$|E

500|$|Square began {{planning}} Chrono Cross {{immediately after}} the release of Xenogears in 1998 (which itself was originally conceived as a sequel to the SNES game). Chrono Triggers scenario director Masato Kato had brainstormed ideas for a sequel as early as 1996, following the release of [...] Square's managers selected a team, appointed Hiromichi Tanaka producer, and asked Kato to direct and develop a new Chrono game in the spirit of Radical Dreamers. Kato thought Dreamers was released in a [...] "half-finished state", and wanted to continue the story of the character Kid. Kato and Tanaka decided to produce an indirect sequel. They acknowledged that Square would soon re-release Chrono Trigger as part of Final Fantasy Chronicles, which would give players a chance to catch up on the story of Trigger before playing Cross. Kato thought that using a different setting and cast for Chrono Cross would allow players unfamiliar with Chrono Trigger to play Cross without becoming confused. The Chrono Cross team decided against integrating heavy use of time travel into the game, as they thought it would be [...] "rehashing and cranking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> of the last game". Masato Kato cited the belief, [...] "there's no use in making something similar to before [...] ", and noted, [...] "we're not so weak nor cheap as to try to make something exactly the same as Trigger... Accordingly, Chrono Cross is not Chrono Trigger 2. It doesn't simply follow on from Trigger, but is another, different Chrono that interlaces with Trigger."

2500|$|Sullivan, already {{bothered by}} the choice of songs, was now even angrier. He cut the Crickets' act from two songs to one, and when {{introducing}} them mispronounced Holly's name, so it came out vaguely as [...] "Hollered" [...] or [...] "Holland." [...] In addition, Sullivan {{saw to it that}} the microphone for Holly's electric guitar was turned off. Holly tried to compensate by singing as loudly as he could, and repeatedly trying to turn <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>volume</b> on his guitar. For the instrumental break he cut loose with a dramatic solo, making clear to the audience that the technical fault wasn't his. The band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back for a third appearance. Holly's response was that Sullivan did not have enough money. Film of the performance survives; photographs taken that day show Sullivan looking angry and Holly smirking and perhaps ignoring Sullivan.|$|E
