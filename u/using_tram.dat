5000|$|The {{main problem}} with a train on tram rails is the {{relatively}} narrow width of frog and switch gaps and channels of the groove rails designed to accommodate the narrow flanges of tram wheels [...] The wider flanges of train wheels {{increase the risk of}} derailment at these points. On routes where train carriages are driven on tram tracks (as in the past in parts of The Hague), wider grooves are required as a compromise that is practical as wide grooved girder rail is available. A larger structure gauge would also be required This was also done in Los Angeles and in Vancouver as well as elsewhere in North America.

40|$|Abstract — Memories are {{increasingly}} dominating Systems on Chip (SoC) designs and thus contribute {{a large percentage}} of the total system’s power dissipation, area and reliability. In this paper, we present a tool which captures the effects of supply voltage Vdd and temperature on memory performance and their interrelationships. We propose a Temperature- and Reliability- Aware Memory Design (TRAM) approach which allows designers to examine the effects of frequency, supply voltage, power dissipation, and temperature on reliability in a mutually interrelated manner. Our experimental results indicate that thermal unaware estimation of probability of error can be off by at least two orders of magnitude and up to five orders of magnitude from the realistic, temperature-aware cases. We also observed that thermal aware Vdd selection <b>using</b> <b>TRAM</b> can reduce the total power dissipation by up to 2. 5 X while attaining an identical predefined limit on errors. I...|$|E

In order to have a regular and reliable rail system on campus, we optimize the route among major stations on campus, using shortest path problem Dijkstra algorithm in conjunction with a computer software called LINDO to arrive at the optimal route. In particular, it is observed that the shortest path from the main entrance gate (Canaan land entrance gate) to the Electrical Engineering Department is of distance 0. 805 km...|$|E
40|$|High {{overhead}} of fine-grained {{communication is}} a significant performance bottleneck for many classes of applications written for large scale parallel systems. This thesis explores techniques for reducing this overhead through topological aggregation, in which fine-grained messages are dynamically combined not just at each source of communication, but also at intermediate points between source and destination processors. The performance character-istics of aggregation and selection of virtual topology for routing are analyzed theoretically and experimentally. Schemes that exploit fast intra-node communication to reduce the num-ber of inter-node messages are also explored. The presented techniques are implemented for the Charm++ parallel programming system in the Topological Routing and Aggregation Module (TRAM). It is also demonstrated how TRAM can be automated {{at the level of}} the runtime system to function with little or no configuration or input required from the user. <b>Using</b> <b>TRAM,</b> the performance of a number of benchmark and scientific applications is evaluated, with speedups of up to 10 x for communication benchmarks and up to 4 x for full-fledged scientific applications on petascale systems...|$|E

40|$|The growing {{interest}} in an adequate modelling of time in Artificial Intelligence {{has given rise to}} the research discipline of Temporal Reasoning (TR). Due to different views, different approaches towards TR such as PL 1, modal logics or Allen 2 ̆ 7 s intervall logic have been investigated. It was realized at an early stage that each of this approaches has some strong points whereas it suffers from certain drawbacks. Thus recently, a number of research activities have emerged aiming at a combination of the classical paradigms for representing time. In {{the first part of this}} paper, we present an overview of the most important approaches to the integration of temporal knowledge into logic programming. In the second part, we present the CRONOLOG temporal logic programming language which has been developed to cover the quintessence of the approaches presented before. The third part of the paper describes TRAM, which it is an extension of CRONOLOG to a temporal knowledge representation system. <b>Using</b> <b>TRAM</b> it is possible to represent knowledge depending on time and to reason about this knowledge. TRAM has been conceptually based on a combination of modal logics with Allen 2 ̆ 7 s interval logic. We present the Extended Modal Logics (EML) which establishes the theoretical framework for TRAM.

40|$|We {{performed}} an innovative systematic meta-analysis of gene expression profiles of whole normal human brain and heart {{to provide a}} quantitative transcriptome reference map of it, i. e. a typical reference value of expression for all the known, mapped and uncharacterized (unmapped) transcripts. For this reason, we used the software named TRAM (Transcriptome Mapper), which is able to generate transcriptome maps based on gene expression data from multiple sources. We also analyzed differential gene expression by comparing brain with human foetal brain, with a pool of non-brain tissues and with the three brain sub-region: cerebellum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, the main regions severely affected with cognitive impairment, {{as seen in the}} case of trisomy 21. Data were downloaded from microarray databases, processed and analyzed <b>using</b> <b>TRAM</b> software and validated in vitro by assaying gene expression through several magnitude orders by "Real Time" reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The excellent agreement between in silico and experimental data suggested that our transcriptome maps may be a useful quantitative reference benchmark for gene expression studies related to the human brain and heart. We also generated an integrated quantitative transcriptome map by systematic meta-analysis from all available gene expression profile datasets related to AMKL in paediatric age. The incidence of Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (AMKL) is 500 -fold higher in children with Down Syndrome (DS) compared with non-DS children. We present an integrated original model of the DS AMLK transcriptome, providing the identification of genes relevant for its pathophysiology which can potentially be new clinical markers. Finally, computational and molecular analysis of a highly restricted region of chromosome 21, which represents a strong candidate for typical DS features and is considered as intergenic, was performed.

40|$|Background:The {{transverse}} rectus abdominis musculocutaneous TRAM) flap {{remains the}} gold standard for postmastectomy reconstruction either immediate or delayed. However,transfer of TRAM flap can be associated with donor site morbidities and complications in flap. A successful reconstruction consists of careful patient selection, surgical technique and meticulous preoperative planning. This study was designed to evaluate outcome and complications of breast reconstruction with TRAM flap in association with patient conditions and risk factors, prospectively.  Methods: Breast reconstruction was performed in 44 women consecutively,using the TRAM flap during a 3 -year period, 1999 – 2002. Modified radical mastectomy accompanying immediate reconstructions with TRAM flap was performed for 12 patients and delayed reconstruction was used for other patients with previous mastectomy.  Results: The mean age of the patients was 40. 41 ± 4. 43 years. Thirty (68. 18 %) patients had comorbidities, consisting of radiation therapy, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking and abdominal scar. Contralateral and ipsilateral TRAM flaps were used in 26 (59. 09 %) and 14 (31. 81 %) reconstructions, respectively. The abdominal defect was repaired in layers with the use of synthetic mesh in 30 (68. 18 %) patients. The overall complication rate was 31. 82 %, such as fat necrosis (15. 91 %), partial flap loss (13. 64 %), etc. Satisfaction rates were excellent in 10 (22. 72 %), good in 25 (56. 82 %), moderate in five (11. 36 %), and poor in four (9. 09 %) patients. The mean of postoperative inpatient hospital days were 15. 18 ± 4. 89 and 14. 28 ± 6. 52 in patients with contralateral and ipsilateral flaps,respectively (p> 0. 05). A significant association was observed between overall complications and comorbidities. Partial flap loss and fat necrosis was associated with smoking, and abdominal hernia was associated with obesity marginally. Conclusions:The outcome of breast reconstruction <b>using</b> <b>TRAM</b> flap is similar by surgical technique and time of reconstruction. The most common flap complications were fat necrosis and partial flap loss that was associated with smoking. Acceptable satisfaction is obtained by TRAM flap...|$|E
