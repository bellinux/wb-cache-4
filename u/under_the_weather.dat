500|$|The band's {{set list}} {{was similar to}} that of most shows on the PopMart Tour, but with [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" [...] in place of The Edge's karaoke segment and the {{addition}} of [...] "Miss Sarajevo" [...] in the second encore. The night was a celebration {{of the end of the}} war, with Bono setting the tone by shouting out [...] "Viva Sarajevo! Fuck the past, kiss the future!" [...] at the beginning of [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing". Bono had struggled with his voice throughout the tour, and the morning of the concert he woke up [...] "without a voice". There was no intent to cancel, and the show went ahead as planned. Though Bono had few difficulties through the opening quartet of [...] "Mofo", [...] "I Will Follow", [...] "Gone", and [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", his voice gave out during [...] "Last Night on Earth". In 2006, The Edge suggested that Bono's vocal troubles had been caused by laryngitis or by the stress of the previous few months of touring, though he later remarked that [...] "it didn't really matter that our lead singer was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> because every member of the audience seemed to join in on every song. There was a mass chorus for the whole concert." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 4, 1953 a Slick Airways Curtiss-Wright C-46 Commando N4717N on a cargo {{flight from}} New York-Idlewild Field crashed.

2500|$|It {{should be}} noted that, in this context, the {{evidence}} cited by Abert is selective and suits the intended trajectory of his biography. With the exception of citations from Mozart's letters, all of the testimony is posthumous and prompted by complicated motives both personal and financial. Although it is 'authentic' {{in the sense that}} it derives from those who witnessed Mozart's death, or were close to him, it is not necessarily accurate. ... To be sure, Mozart was <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather</b> in Prague. But there is no evidence that he was 'very ill' and it is not true that his health 'continued to deteriorate'. As Abert himself notes later in this chapter, Mozart's health improved in October and early November (Abert/Eisen 2008:1305).|$|E

Six hours later it was evident that there was some slight diminution in the force of the wind.|$|E

Well, I hope I shall either get off to Portsmouth again to-morrow or go down to the dear old pater. I wish this dinner was over. No doubt there will be some more of these old admirals there, and they will be wanting to learn all the ins and outs, just as if twenty words would not tell them how it was we thrashed them so easily.

60|$|I know {{no other}} reason why this man chose to select me for his {{companion}} in such an adventure, than the circumstance that I happened to be alone, and perhaps I may have looked a little <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>weather.</b> He was no sooner gone, however, than I managed to get near my shipmates, and to call {{them out of the}} garden, one by one. As we went away, I told them all that had happened, and we laid our counter-plot. When we reached the Telegraph, it was near night, and finding only two of the blacks on board her, we let them into the secret, and they joined us, heart and hand. We got something to drink, as a matter of course, and tried to pass the time as well as we could, until the hour for springing the mine should arrive.|$|E
