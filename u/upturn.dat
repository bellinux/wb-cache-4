5|$|By 1911 {{the textile}} {{industry}} in Bolton employed about 36,000 people. The last mill to be constructed was Sir John Holden's Mill in 1927. The cotton industry declined from the 1920s. A brief <b>upturn</b> after the Second World War was not sustained, {{and the industry}} had virtually vanished {{by the end of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Somerset towns {{charter of}} {{incorporation}} was received in 1705. Growth {{in the trade}} and economy largely depended on the drainage of the surrounding moors. The opening of the Glastonbury Canal produced an <b>upturn</b> in trade, and encouraged local building. The parish {{was part of the}} hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides, until the 1730s when it became a borough in its own right.|$|E
50|$|Klondike {{is played}} with a {{standard}} 52-card deck, without Jokers. After shuffling, seven piles of cards are laid from left to right. Each pile begins with one <b>upturned</b> card. From left to right, each pile contains one more card than the last. The first and left-most pile contains a single <b>upturned</b> card, the second pile contains two cards (one downturned, one <b>upturned),</b> the third contains three (two downturned, one <b>upturned),</b> and so on, until the seventh pile which contains seven cards (six downturned, one <b>upturned).</b> The piles should look like the figure to the {{right at the beginning}} of every game.|$|R

5|$|After the {{appointment}} of Geoff Henke—who {{had been unable to}} compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application—as team manager in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians were regarded as medal prospects. The <b>upturn</b> in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports, the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria.|$|E
5|$|By 2010, census figures {{showed a}} strong <b>upturn,</b> with the {{association}} in April 2010 claiming its {{highest rate of}} growth in UK since 1972, with total claimed participation reaching just under half a million. In 2014, the association claimed an increase in youth membership of 100,000 in the ten years since 2004. In 2016 it claimed eleven years of consecutive growth {{and an increase in}} female membership, with 25% of participants now female in the 25 years since girls were first welcomed in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and <b>upturn</b> their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5000|$|In 1980, Lisa Birnbach {{published}} The Official Preppy Handbook, {{in which}} she extolled the [...] "virtues of the <b>upturned</b> collar". According to Ms. Birnbach, rather than being a sports innovation, the <b>upturned</b> collar on a tennis shirt was simply a signal that the wearer is a [...] "preppy". Despite this obviously tongue-in-cheek characterization, Ms. Birnbach did correctly identify that one {{was more likely to}} view an <b>upturned</b> collar on the beaches of Nantucket than one would in middle America.|$|R

5|$|Outside of the Taylor family, {{the show}} explores {{the lives of}} the Dillon high school {{football}} players. In the pilot, Coach Taylor's protege and star quarterback Jason Street (Scott Porter), suffers a spinal injury that ends his football career. He faces life as a paraplegic. At first, Street struggles with these disabilities and the <b>upturn</b> of his life. Gradually, he copes with his new reality. Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly), his girlfriend, undergoes her own changes, making a transition from a Panthers cheerleader to a Christian youth leader.|$|E
5|$|Thatcher was {{replaced}} as Prime Minister and party leader by Chancellor John Major, who prevailed over Heseltine {{in the subsequent}} ballot. Major oversaw an <b>upturn</b> in Conservative support in the 17months leading to the 1992 general election and led the party to a fourth successive victory on 9 April 1992. Thatcher favoured Major in the leadership contest, but her support for him waned in later years.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of taller buildings during the 1870s was hindered {{by the financial}} Panic of 1873 and the ensuing economic depression, which lasted until around 1879. Construction slowed, and property values slumped. By 1880, however, the recovery was well underway, with new construction in New York returning to the pace of 1871, and the economic <b>upturn</b> making the {{construction of}} taller buildings an attractive financial option again, establishing many of the preconditions {{for the development of}} the skyscraper.|$|E

5|$|After Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden in 1814, Aalborg {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as the}} country's centre for Norwegian trade. Its former prosperity also suffered {{as a result of}} difficulties with the herring industry as the fish disappeared after the sea breached the Agger Tange (which had linked Thy with the rest of Jutland at the western end of Limfjord) in the 1825 North Sea storm. The after effects of the state bankruptcy in 1813 also contributed to widespread poverty in the city. In the mid-19th-century, Aalborg was overtaken by Aarhus as the largest city in Jutland. Towards the end of the 19th century there was however an <b>upturn.</b> In 1865, the pontoon bridge over Limfjord was completed, and in 1869, the railway reached the city with a railway bridge over the sound to Vendsyssel three years later. The harbour facilities were also improved, making Aalborg Denmark's second port. Aalborg became the country's main producer of tobacco products and spirits, followed in the 1890s by fertilisers and cement. By 1901, the population had increased to almost 31,500.|$|E
5|$|Andersen went to sea at age 15, {{and later}} found {{work as a}} mason's assistant. On 7November 1916 he married Lovise Kristine Klausen, {{who worked as a}} {{waitress}} at a restaurant frequented by Andersen. They soon got an apartment at Torshov and had a son. Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an <b>upturn</b> during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for the worse, no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E
5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry <b>upturn</b> in the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Continued {{investment}} in players followed in successive seasons, and results began {{to match the}} <b>upturn</b> in player quality. City reached the 2011 FA Cup Final, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-final, {{the first time they}} had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. They defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup, the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. In the same week, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time since}} 1968 with a 1–0 Premier League win over Tottenham Hotspur. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City passed Arsenal for third place in the Premier League, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.|$|E
5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this <b>upturn</b> in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won {{more than twice as}} many points in the second half of the season than they did in the first. Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made to Sam Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{immediate}} {{impact on the}} pitch and the <b>upturn</b> in Reading's form, Friday's off-the-field activities unsettled some of his teammates. Most tolerated his lifestyle because of his importance to the team, but some, particularly defender Tommy Youlden, were sceptical. He drank extremely heavily, favouring American Colt 45 malt liquor, and his antics during his drinking sessions caused many landlords to lose patience with him. For example, Friday was barred from Caversham's Crown public house after he ended a night there leaping between the tables and dancing on the bar. The Boar's Head in Reading banned him on ten separate occasions. One night, after the pubs closed, Friday and a friend, Rod Lewington, went to an all-night club called Churchill's where they could continue drinking. When they entered, Friday, wearing a long overcoat and hobnail boots, walked onto the dancefloor and removed the coat to reveal that he was wearing nothing underneath. He then began to dance, completely naked apart from the boots.|$|E

5|$|During the 2014–15 season, {{a dismal}} run of form saw the team slip {{to the bottom}} of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could have brought a sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant the Foxes {{finished}} the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers. Their <b>upturn</b> in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest ever escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up.|$|E
5|$|Financially the Militia was {{neglected}} also. Despite the <b>upturn</b> in {{the economic}} situation in the early 1930s there was little financial respite for the Militia in this time. As the situation continued to improve, however, the defence vote was increased steadily after 1935. Indeed, in 1938 the government decided to double {{the strength of the}} Militia as war clouds began to loom on the horizon, and late in the year a recruiting campaign was launched that saw the size of the Militia increase from 35,000 to 43,000 men over the space of three months. This trend continued into 1939 and by midway through the year there were over 80,000 men serving on a part-time voluntary basis. Nevertheless, there was a serious shortage of equipment and as a result, when World War II broke out in September 1939 the Militia was by no means an effective fighting force and {{the nation as a whole}} was not as well prepared for war as it had been in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was once}} again fastest during third {{practice}} on Saturday morning, even while suffering from overheating under his seat. The two Mercedes cars were separated by two-tenths of a second with the two Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen behind, another half a second down. Red Bull had a slight <b>upturn</b> in fortune, with Daniel Ricciardo and Daniil Kvyat finishing fifth and sixth respectively. McLaren-Honda had another problematic session as Fernando Alonso stopped the car just after starting his installation lap. Teammate Jenson Button was called into the pit lane as well, citing a similar problem with the engine, but was able to continue later in the session. Felipe Massa experienced smoke in his cockpit both on Friday and Saturday, apparently caused by the new titanium plates underneath the cars which also create sparks when driving over bumps on the track.|$|E
