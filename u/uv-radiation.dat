The mass of the disk around a classical T Tauri star is about 1–3% of the stellar mass, and it is accreted {{at a rate of}} 10−7 to [...] per year. A pair of bipolar jets is usually present as well. The accretion explains all peculiar properties of classical T Tauri stars: strong flux in the emission lines (up to 100% of the intrinsic luminosity of the star), magnetic activity, photometric variability and jets.

The jets are byproducts of accretion: they carry away excessive angular momentum. The classical T Tauri stage lasts about 10million years. The disk eventually disappears due to accretion onto the central star, planet formation, ejection by jets and photoevaporation by <b>UV-radiation</b> from the central star and nearby stars. As a result, the young star becomes a weakly lined T Tauri star, which slowly, over hundreds of millions of years, evolves into an ordinary Sun-like star.|$|E
2500|$|The {{control and}} {{mechanics}} of rapid pigment translocation {{has been well}} studied {{in a number of}} different species, in particular amphibians and teleost fish. It has been demonstrated that the process can be under hormonal or neuronal control or both and for many species of bony fishes it is known that chromatophores can respond directly to environmental stimuli like visible light, <b>UV-radiation,</b> temperature, pH, chemicals, etc. [...] Neurochemicals that are known to translocate pigment include noradrenaline, through its receptor on the surface on melanophores. The primary hormones involved in regulating translocation appear to be the melanocortins, melatonin, and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), that are produced mainly in the pituitary, pineal gland, and hypothalamus, respectively. These hormones may also be generated in a paracrine fashion by cells in the skin. At the surface of the melanophore, the hormones have been shown to activate specific G-protein-coupled receptors that, in turn, transduce the signal into the cell. Melanocortins result in the dispersion of pigment, while melatonin and MCH results in aggregation.|$|E

40|$|Tyrosinase is an {{oxidoreductase}} enzyme (EC 1. 14. 18. 1) {{involved in}} the two main steps of the biochemical melanin pathway. In humans it is also related {{to the process of}} freeradical scavenging avoiding <b>UV-radiations</b> side-effects. However, abnormal overproduction of melanin lead to hyperpigmentation, that includes, melanoma, lentigenes, age spots and other skin disorders. Therefore, the research of novel chemical with inhibitory activity against the enzyme remains as a challenge to scientific community.

40|$|Induced {{formation}} of tryptophanase in Escherichia coli B/r is temporarily inhibited by near-ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. The inhibition is greater when irradiation is at 5 C than when at room temperature. Hence, the inhibition {{is the result}} of a photochemical, rather than photoenzymatic, alteration of some cellular component. The action spectrum has a peak in the region of 334 nm and is similar to that for growth delay. However, inhibition of tryptophanase formation is more sensitive to near-UV irradiation than are growth, respiration, and the induced {{formation of}} β-galactosidase. Thus, for tryptophanase the lack of formation cannot be due to general inhibition of metabolism. Pyridoxal phosphate absorbs in the near-UV region of the spectrum and is a cofactor for tryptophanase, but this enzyme in induced cells is not inactivated by near <b>UV-radiations.</b> An experiment in which toluene-treated suspensions from irradiated and unirradiated cells were mixed showed that irradiation does not cause the formation of an inhibitor of tryptophanase activity.

40|$|Aquatic {{ecosystems}} of the Bolivian Altiplano (similar to 3800 m a. s. l.) {{are characterized}} by extreme hydro-climatic constrains (e. g., high <b>UV-radiations</b> and low oxygen) and are {{under the pressure of}} increasing anthropogenic activities, unregulated mining, agricultural and urban development. We report here a complete inventory of mercury (Hg) levels and speciation in the water column, atmosphere, sediment and key sentinel organisms (i. e., plankton, fish and birds) of two endorheic Lakes of the same watershed differing with respect to their size, eutrophication and contamination levels. Total Hg (THg) and mono-methylmercury (MMHg) concentrations in filtered water and sediment of Lake Titicaca are in the lowest range of reported levels in other large lakes worldwide. Downstream, Hg levels are 3 - 10 times higher in the shallow eutrophic Lake Uru-Uru than in Lake Titicaca due to high Hg inputs from the surrounding mining region. High percentages of MMHg were found in the filtered and unfiltered water rising up from < 1 to similar to 50 % THg from the oligoihetero-trophic Lake Titicaca to the eutrophic Lake Uru-Uru. Such high % MMHg is explained by a high in situ MMHg production in relation to the sulfate rich substrate, the low oxygen levels of the water column, and the stabilization of MMHg due to abundant ligands present in these alkaline waters. Differences in MMHg concentrations in water and sediments compartments between Lake Titicaca and Uru-Uru were found to mirror the offset in MMHg levels that also exist in their respective food webs. This suggests that in situ MMHg baseline production is likely the main factor controlling MMHg levels in fish species consumed by the local population. Finally, the increase of anthropogenic pressure in Lake Titicaca may probably enhance eutrophication processes which favor MMHg production and thus accumulation in water and biota...|$|R

50|$|Secondary {{metabolism}} {{produces a}} large number of specialized compounds (estimated 200,000) that do not aid in the growth and development of plants but are required for the plant to survive in its environment. Secondary metabolism is connected to primary metabolism by using building blocks and biosynthetic enzymes derived from primary metabolism. Primary metabolism governs all basic physiological processes that allow a plant to grow and set seeds, by translating the genetic code into proteins, carbohydrates, and amino acids. Specialized compounds from secondary metabolism are essential for communicating with other organisms in mutualistic (e.g. attraction of beneficial organisms such as pollinators) or antagonistic interactions (e.g. deterrent against herbivores and pathogens). They further assist in coping with abiotic stress such as increased <b>UV-radiation.</b> The broad functional spectrum of specialized metabolism is still not fully understood. In any case, a good balance between products of primary and secondary metabolism is best for a plant’s optimal growth and development as well as for its effective coping with often changing environmental conditions. Well known specialized compounds include alkaloids, polyphenols including flavonoids, and terpenoids. Humans use quite a lot of these compounds, or the plants from which they originate, for medicinal and nutraceutical purposes.|$|E
