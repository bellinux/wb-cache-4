40|$|Background: The risk to dentists, dental assistants, and {{patients}} {{of infectious diseases}} through aerosols has long been recognized. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate and compare the efficacy of commercially available preprocedural mouthrinses containing 0. 2 % chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate, chlorine dioxide (ClO 2) mouthwash, and water in reducing the levels of viable bacteria in aerosols. Materials and Methods: This single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-group parallel-designed study was conducted over a period of 4 months. One hundred twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were divided randomly into three groups (A, B, and C) of 40 patients each to receive the ClO 2 mouthwash, water, and 0. 2 % CHX gluconate respectively as preprocedural rinse. The aerosol produced by the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>unit</b> was collected at five standardized locations with respect to the reference point, i. e., the mouth of the patient. The blood agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, and the total number of colony-forming units (CFUs) was counted and statistically analyzed.

An ultrasonic signal reflection technique was used. The study was carried out with paper mill effluent (average particle size of 0. 947 μm) from a wastewater treatment plant. Ultrasonic response signals were obtained as particles initiated and a cake layer formed on the membrane surface. The ultrasonic testing technique can measure the cake thickness as a function of time. Results also showed that the <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>unit</b> is a suitably programmed microprocessor and can be used to compare reference and test signals. It produced a separated signal (from reference and test signals), indicating the state and progress of the cake layer on the membrane surface under operating conditions. A predictive modeling program, ultrasonic reflection, was developed to better understand the processes related to the deposition of cake layers on the membrane surface. The modeling program can predict the shape of the curve {{at the beginning of the}} signals, indicating the cake compressibility. In microfiltration, the flux decline is related not only to the layer thickness but also to the cake density (compressibility).

Ultrasonic pretreatment was applied with three amplitude settings of 33 % (52. 8 µm pp), 66 % (105. 6 µm pp), and 100 % (160 µm pp) as well as five time settings of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds, respectively, {{to each of the}} four by-products before setting up a bench top BMP trial. Biogas production was measured and analyzed for methane content and accumulated methane production. Without ultrasound pretreatment, corn-syrup had the highest methane production potential (408 ml/g VS added) compare to the other by-products. Methane production was increased by 25 and 12 % for the ultrasound pretreated DDGs samples and solids samples, respectively, compared with untreated samples.

Like many other dental and medical specialties, endodontics has evolved and changed over the years. The changes that have occurred in the past 10 years, however, have been of great magnitude and profundity. The microscope, <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>units</b> with specially configured tips, superbly accurate microchip computerized apex locators, flexible nickel-titanium files in rotary engines, and greater emphasis on microscopic endodontic surgery have totally changed the way endodontics and endodontic surgery are practiced.

Piezosurgery (piezo-electric surgery) is a hard tissue surgical application which can be undertaken using multi-purpose high-end ultrasonic units, employing different settings on the base <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>unit.</b> A critical feature of a piezosurgery unit is the ability to vary the oscillation frequency and the cut-ting energy. A typical piezoelectric handpiece uses a functional frequency between 25 and 29 kHz, with the possibility of digital modulation up to 30 kHz as a “boost”. Piezosurgery devices are fitted with a cooling irrigation system with 0 to 60 mL/min of variable sterile solution flow. Specific inserts act in a linear vibration pattern, moving over a spatial range between 60 and 210 µm, at an ultrasonic power of up to 16 Watts. 6 Piezosurgery units are some 3 times more powerful than conventional ultrasonic units (5 Watts), which allows them to cut highly mineralized cortical bone. The reduced range and the linearity of the vibrations allow for precise control of cutting. Examples of contemporary multipurpose base units are the Satalec Newtron (Figure 1) and the Mectron Piezosurgery, which offer a range of appli-cations according to the handpiece and tips used. Multipurpose units can also be used for bone cutting (Figure 2), endosonics, periodontal applications, and implant debridement (Figure 3), offering considerable versatility within the operatory. Instrument tips with abrasive particles can be used for caries removal, and finishing crown and bridge preparations. Piezosurgery: an increasing role in dental hard tissue surger...|$|E
40|$|Aim : To {{compare the}} {{integrity}} of root apices of cadaver and extracted teeth after resection, ultrasonic root-end cavity preparation at medium and low ultrasonic power settings and retrieval. Methodology : Root canal treatment, perpendicular root-end resection and root-end preparation were performed on single-rooted anterior and premolar teeth (49 teeth in situ in maxillary and mandibular jaws from cadavers and 45 extracted teeth). Apical root-end cavities were prepared with the S 12 / 90 &DEG; D tip and the Suni-Max <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>unit</b> (Satelec, Merignac, France) at the intensity prescribed by the manufacturer (power 7 at power mode S) (34 cadaver teeth, 30 extracted teeth) and at a lower intensity (power 4 at power mode S) (15 cadaver teeth, 15 extracted teeth). After ultrasonic preparation the cadaver teeth were retrieved from the jaws. Exaflex impressions (GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) were made of the root apices after resection, root-end preparation and retrieval. These impressions were processed for SEM analysis, and the recordings evaluated for cracks and marginal chipping. Results : In general, extracted teeth showed significantly more cracks and chipping than cadaver teeth. Lowering the ultrasonic power from medium to low intensity resulted in equal scores for cracks on extracted teeth and for chipping on cadaver teeth, in higher scores for cracks on cadavers and in lower scores for chipping on extracted teeth. Complete cracks and cracks originating from the root surface occurred only in extracted teeth. Conclusions : The number of cracks and degree of chipping caused by ultrasonic root-end preparation was higher on extracted teeth than on cadaver teeth. Lowering the ultrasonic power from medium to low intensity cannot be recommended as it resulted in more cracks and equal chipping on cadaver teeth. Investigation of techniques and materials should be conducted in situ and not on extracted teeth...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ultrasonic}} treatment (UST) on the solidification microstructure of a 35 CrMo steel cast ingot were investigated. To avoid {{the erosion of}} a high-temperature melt, a T-shaped <b>ultrasonic</b> waveguide <b>unit</b> was used to introduce ultrasonic vibrations into a 35 CrMo steel die casting melt. The experimental {{results show that the}} microstructure of the ingot was refined by ultrasonic treatment. While the microstructure of untreated 35 CrMo steel is coarse dendritic grains, after the introduction of ultrasonic treatment, the solidification microstructure transforms from coarse dendritic to equiaxed grains, and the dendrites are also refined. Samples from different positions of the ingots were subjected to different ultrasonic effects, and the effects on grain refinement also varied due to the severe attenuation of the ultrasound in the melt. The mechanisms of grain refinement using ultrasonic treatment for 35 CrMo steel melt are presented...|$|R
30|$|Microscope slides were cleaned in an <b>ultrasonic</b> {{cleaning}} <b>unit</b> at 50 °C and 100 % {{power for}} 20 min in a 20 % (v/v) solution of Extran® MA 01 {{and after a}} thorough wash in ddH 2 O again at 50 °C and 100 % power for 20 min in ddH 2 O. The cleaned microscope slides were blown dry and stored until use. One microscope slide and one cover slip with a modified surface were assembled to one chamber, using the microscope slide as top and the modified cover slip as bottom of the chamber. Four spacers made of cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) of a height of 0.8 mm were used to define the chamber height, using one spacer per cover slip corner. The assembly of cover slip-spacer-microscope slide was sealed with a biocompatible, fast curing silicone-based polymer (twinsil®), leaving two gaps for entry and exit to the chamber.|$|R
