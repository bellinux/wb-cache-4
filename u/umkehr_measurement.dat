5000|$|The Umkehr is {{the time}} {{variation}} of {{the ratio of the}} scattered intensity at two different wavelengths. The word means reversal in German. The Umkehr effect is observed when measurements are made with ultraviolet spectrophotometer of the ratio of the zenith sky light intensities of two wavelengths in the solar ultraviolet when the sun is near the horizon. The shorter of two wavelengths (intensity I) is strongly absorbed and other (intensity I [...] ) is weakly absorbed. If the value of log(I/I [...] ) is plotted against the suns zenith angle, it is observed that this log-intensity ratio decreases as the zenith angle increases until a minimum is reached for a zenith angle of about 80 (when the wavelengths are 3114 and 3324 A0). This effect was first noticed by Götz in 1930. The <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurement</b> is known as customarily N-value and is given by the logarithm base 10 of the ratio of cloudless zenith sky intensitities at two different wavelengths scaled by a multiplicative factor 100 plus a constant which depends on instruments and extraterrestrial radiation. Methods for deriving vertical distribution from the umkehr measurements were developed by Götz, Dobson and Meetham in 1934, using the Dobson ozone spectrophotometer developed by Gordon Dobson. In 1964 Carlton Mateer provided analysis on information content in umkehr measurements.|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} Dobson Umkehr methodology {{to retrieve}} coarse-resolution ozone profiles {{used by the}} National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration uses designated solar zenith angles (SZAs). However, some information may be lost if measurements lie outside the designated SZA range (between 60 ° and 90 °), or {{do not conform to}} the fitting technique. Also, while Umkehr measurements can be taken using multiple wavelength pairs (A, C and D), past retrieval methods have focused on a single pair (C). Here we present an Umkehr inversion method that uses measurements at all SZAs (termed operational) and all wavelength pairs. (Although, we caution direct comparison to other algorithms.) Information content for a Melbourne, Australia (38 ° S, 145 ° E) <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurement</b> case study from 28 January 1994, with SZA range similar to that designated in previous algorithms is shown. When comparing the typical single wavelength pair with designated SZAs to the operational measurements, the total degrees of freedom (independent pieces of information) increases from 3. 1 to 3. 4, with the majority of the information gain originating from Umkehr layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10 – 20 km and 25 – 30 km respectively). In addition to this, using all available wavelength pairs increases the total degrees of freedom to 5. 2, with the most significant increases in Umkehr layers 2 + 3 to 7 and 9 + (10 – 40 and 45 – 80 km). Investigating a case from 13 April 1970 where the measurements extend beyond the 90 ° SZA range gives further information gain, with total degrees of freedom extending to 6. 5. Similar increases are seen in the information content. Comparing the retrieved Melbourne Umkehr time series with ozonesondes shows excellent agreement in layers 2 + 3 and 4 (10 – 20 and 25 – 30 km) for both C and A + C + D-pairs. Retrievals in layers 5 and 6 (25 – 30 and 30 – 35 km) consistently show lower ozone partial column compared to ozonesondes. This is likely due to stray light effects that are not accounted for in the forward model, and under represented stratospheric aerosol...|$|E

Taking this relation into account, statistically significant negative trends were found in the Upper Umkehr layers. It is pointed out that upper stratospheric ozone could be sensitive to long-term solar variability as well as other possible influences in addition to CFM-induced effects, and therefore the cause or causes of the estimated trend cannot be unambiguously estimated using current Umkehr data...|$|R

40|$|Since mid-to late 1980 s {{decreasing}} {{amounts of}} ozone concentration {{has been observed}} in northern mid-latitudes mainly due to the ozone depleting chlorofluorocarbon loading in the stratosphere. Recent works indicate the stabilization of ozone loss in the mid-latitudes, in the upper stratosphere in particular. In order to further investigate the evolution of ozone in the mid-latitudes, a coherent dataset is required. As a first step, we diagnose the long term evolution of ozone at Observatoire de Haute Provence (OHP - 43. 93 °N, 5. 71 °E), one of the northern mid-latitude stations. In this study, we present the inter comparison of ozone measurements from OHP LIDAR with collocated SBUV, SAGEII, HALOE, MLS and GOMOS satellite observations {{as well as the}} ground based Ozonesondes and <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurements.</b> A detailed statistical study on the relative differences of the compared measurements is performed to check any specific drifts with time. In addition, the seasonal and annual averages of the relative deviations are also checked to quantify agreement among the data. On average, all instruments show their best agreement with LIDAR between 20 and 40 km, where the differences are within 5 %. The agreement with SAGEII measurements are remarkably good since it falls within 1 % at 17 - 41 km. A similar result is also found from the Ozonesondes comparison at 22 - 31 km. Most comparisons exhibit slightly larger deviations below 20 and above 42 km, of about 10 %. The LIDAR masurements are also compared to <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurements</b> by converting its ozone number density to Dobson units for each Umkehr layer.

40|$|Trend analyses, {{assuming}} a linear trend which started at 1970, were performed from total ozone measurements from Arosa (Switzerland, 1926 - 1991). Decreases in monthly mean values {{were statistically significant}} for October through April showing decreases of about 2. 0 - 4 percent per decade. For the period 1947 - 91, total ozone trends were further investigated using a multiple regression model. Temperature of a mountain peak in Switzerland (Mt. Santis), the F 10. 7 solar flux series, the QBO series (quasi biennial oscillation), and the southern oscillation index (SOI) were included as explanatory variables. Trends in the monthly mean values were statistically significant for December through April. The same multiple regression model was applied to investigate the ozone trends at various altitudes using the ozone balloon soundings from Payerne (1967 - 1989) and the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurements</b> from Arosa (1947 - 1989). The results show four different vertical trend regimes: On a relative scale changes were largest in the troposphere (increase of about 10 percent per decade). On an absolute scale the largest trends were obtained in the lower stratosphere (decrease of approximately 6 per decade {{at an altitude of}} about 18 to 22 km). No significant trends were observed at approximately 30 km, whereas stratospheric ozone decreased in the upper stratosphere...|$|R

The instruments included two UV lidar systems, one from JPL and the other from Goddard Space Flight Center, ECC balloon-sondes, a ground-based microwave instrument, <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurements,</b> and a new ground-based FTIR instrument. The MLS instrument on the UARS satellite provided correlative profiles of ozone, and there was one close overpass of the SAGE II instrument. The results show that much better consistency among instruments is being achieved than even a few years ago, usually to within the instrument uncertainties. The different measurement techniques in this comparison agree to within +/- 10 % at almost all altitudes, and in the 20 km to 45 km region most agreed within +/- 5 %. The results show that the current generation of lidars are capable of accurate measurement of the ozone profile to a maximum altitude of 50 km. SAGE agreed well with both lidar and balloon-sonde down to at least 17 km. The ground-based microwave measurement agreed with other measurements from 22 km to above 50 km.

The time period covered corresponds to the reduced spectral resolution period of the MIPAS instrument, i. e. January 2005 -April 2012. The comparison with satellite instruments includes all post- 2005 satellite limb and occultation sensors that have measured the vertical profiles of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone: ACE-FTS, GOMOS, HALOE, HIRDLS, MLS, OSIRIS, POAM, SAGE II, SCIAMACHY, SMILES, and SMR. In addition, balloon-borne MkIV solar occultation <b>measurements</b> and ground-based <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurements</b> have been included, as well as two nadir sensors: IASI and SBUV. For each reference data set, bias determination and precision assessment are performed. Better agreement with reference instruments than for the previous data version, V 5 R-O 3 - 220 (Laeng et al. 2014), is found: the known high bias around the ozone vmr (volume mixing ratio) peak is significantly reduced and the vertical resolution at 35 km has been improved. The agreement with limb and solar occultation reference instruments that have a known small bias vs. ozonesondes is within 7 % in the lower and middle stratosphere and 5 % in the upper troposphere. Around the ozone vmr peak, the agreement with most of the satellite reference instruments is within 5 %; this bias is as low as 3 % for ACE-FTS, MLS, OSIRIS, POAM and SBUV.

Ozone values over Syowa have remained low since 2001. The time series of upper stratospheric ozone from the homogenized NOAA (/ 2) SBUV 8. 6 overpass data (± 4 &deg;, 24 h) are in qualitative agreement with Syowa station data. Ozone recovery during the austral spring over Syowa station appears to be slower than predicted by the Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) curve. The long-term changes in station's equivalent latitude are derived from MERRA analysis at ~ 2 hPa and ~ 50 hPa. These data are used to attribute some of the upper and middle stratospheric ozone changes to the changes in vortex position relative to station location. In addition, high correlation of the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) with polar upper stratospheric ozone during years of maximum solar activity points toward a strong relationship between the strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and the polar stratospheric ozone recovery. We have analyzed the results of ozone profiles over Syowa determined from <b>measurements</b> of the <b>Umkehr</b> effect by Dobson ozone spectrophotometers. The ozone depletion attributable to CFCs is clearly visible in the record, but the recovery is slower than predicted.

40|$|Regular balloon ozone {{soundings}} with electrochemical sondes {{have been}} performed at Uccle since 1969. More than 450 ozone soundings between 1985 and 1989 were {{used to calculate the}} altitudes Zs from the VIZ radiosonde data and the altitudes Zr deduced from the tracking of the balloon train with a primary wind-finding radar. The values of Zs at fixed times appeared to be systematically too low as compared to Zr. The differences Zr-Zs increase with altitude; at 30 km the annual mean values of Zr-Zs (plus or minus standard deviation) vary between 590 plus or minus 910 m and 1410 plus or minus 1160 m, according to the pressure calibration of different manufacturing series of radiosondes. From these results it is found that around the 30 km level the ozone concentrations calculated from soundings with VIZ sondes are too low by 7. 5 to 14 percent, depending upon the manufacturing series of radiosondes. At least part of the discrepancy which has often been found between ozone profiles from balloon soundings and from other techniques such as rocket observations or <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurements</b> may be explained by this effect. An altitude correction would have important consequences as to the climatology of ozone in the middle stratosphere as adopted at the moment. About half of the day-to-day variability of ozone observed from soundings with VIZ radiosondes above the 30 km level, is induced by the variability of Zr-Zs. The agreement between altitudes calculated from radar data and Vaisala radiosondes is much better; from 34 comparative soundings a mean difference (plus or minus standard deviation) of about - 300 plus/minus 180 m was found at 30 km...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid-eighties, {{stratospheric ozone}} has been {{monitored}} at Observatoire de Haute-Provence (OHP - 44 °N, 6 °E) {{by a variety}} of instruments. Ozone total column measurements are provided by Dobson and DOAS spectrometers since respectively 1983 and 1992 while ozone vertical distribution is obtained by lidar, sondes and <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurements</b> since respectively 1985, 1984 and 1983. In addition to the ozone data obtained at OHP, satellite ozone measurements from SAGE II, MLS and GOMOS are used {{for the study of the}} short term and long term evolution of ozone total column and vertical profile at the station. First, the coherence of ozone time series is evaluated from the analysis of the differences with satellite and ground-based coincident ozone records. This analysis shows generally non significant drifts between the various measurements, especially in the 20 - 40 km range. The stratospheric ozone total column and vertical profile trends are then estimated using the equivalent effective stratospheric chlorine (EESC) time series and two linear trend functions to simulate the change in the trends of ozone depleting substances. To that aim, a multiple linear regression model is used with different explanatory variables such as the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), the Northern Atlantic oscillation (NAO), solar flux, eddy heat flux, stratospheric aerosols optical depth and trend function. The computed trends from the ozone column at OHP indicate a clear signal of ozone recovery after 1997. Likewise, significant positive trends of the ozone vertical distribution are estimated in the 15 - 45 km altitude range after 1997. The influence of the various proxies on the medium and short term ozone variability is also analyzed, indicating that the QBO and eddy heat flux have contributed to the large ozone levels observed in 2010. In the lower stratosphere, the regression model is less efficient in reproducing ozone variability and other proxies are tested such as equivalent latitude in order to represent the advection of polar and tropical air masses over OHP during the winter and springtime...|$|R

Average tropospheric concentrations of CO 2, N 2 O, CH 4, and CHCIF 2 and the daytime diurnal variations or the total columns of NO and NO 2 {{have also been}} inferred. The retrieved total columns (in molecules /sq cm) of the nondiurnally varying gases are 1. 6 +/- 0. 2 x 10 (exp 15) for HCl, 5. 9 +/- 1. 2 x 10 (exp 15) for HNO 3, 2. 0 +/- 0. 2 x 10 (exp 21) for H 2 O 16, 4. 4 +/- 0. 7 x 10 (exp 18) for H 2 O 18, 2. 7 +/- 0. 1 x 10 (exp 17) for HDO, 2. 3 +/- 0. 2 x 10 (exp 19) for CH 4, 5. 0 +/- 0. 5 x 10 (exp 21) for CO 2, 6. 7 +/- 0. 8 x 10 (exp 18) for O 3, 4. 3 +/- 0. 4 x 10 (exp 18) for N 2 O, 1. 0 +/- 0. 2 x 10 (exp 16) for C 2 H 6, and 9. 7 +/- 2. 5 x 10 (exp 14) for CHClF 2. We compare the total column measurements of HCl and HNO 3 with previously reported ground-based, aircraft, and satellite measurements. The results for HCl are or particular interest because of the expected temporal increase in the concentration of this gas in the stratosphere. However, systematic differences among stratospheric HCl total column measurements from 1978 to 1980 {{and the absence of}} observations of free tropospheric HCl above Mauna Loa make it impossible to obtain a reliable estimate of the trend in the total burden of HCl. The measured HNO 3 total column is consistent with aircraft measurements from approx. 12 km altitude. The O 3 total column deduced from the IR spectra agrees with correlative Mauna Loa <b>Umkehr</b> <b>measurements</b> within the estimated error limits. The column-averaged D/H ratio of water vapor is (68 +/- 9) x- 10 (exp - 6), which is 0. 44 +/- 0. 06 times the reference value of 155. 76 x 10 (exp - 6) for standard mean ocean water (SMOW). This large depletion in the D content of water vapor is similar to published measurements of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Average tropospheric concentrations deduced for CO 2, N 2 O, and CH 4 are in good agreement with correlative NOAA GMCC surface data, indicating consistency between the measurement techniques for determining tropospheric volume mixing ratios. Results of the present study indicate that Mauna Loa is a favorable site for infrared monitoring of atmospheric gases. The site is particularly favorable for monitoring the tropospheric volume mixing ratios of long-lived gases, since the high altitude of the tropopause reduces corrections required to account for the decrease in volume mixing ratio in the stratosphere...|$|R

The updated algorithm is able to simulate observations more accurately and provides data output that is easier to analyze. Among the new diagnostic capabilities that the updated algorithm provides is the averaging kernel (AK) method. The AK approach allows studying how the algorithm responds when a small perturbation is made in a particular layer of the atmosphere [Rodgers 1976, 1990]. We will use the AK method to define precisely what Umkehr should measure given a set of profiles measured by other platforms. This method allows us to compare trends and offsets in data more accurately {{than it has been}} done in the past. The updated Umkehr retrievals will be validated against SAGE II ozone profiles as well as SSBUV ozone profile data. We will discuss possible reasons for offset between data and differences in derived ozone profile trends. Considerable variability of the ozone profile within the 10 -degree latitude envelope creates noise in the SAGE matching dataset and makes comparisons difficult. To eliminate this problem, the SAGE and Umkehr data had been previously de-seasonalized by subtracting the latitude/season dependent ozone climatology. However, the remaining noise in the ozone residuals was still considerably high for trend analysis and was attributed to longitude variability of SAGE sampling. The new ozone climatology (Labow, NASA) that has longitude dependent ozone variability will be used to minimize contribution of sampling noise in comparisons of satellite and ground station. The comparison of zenith-sky radiances (<b>Umkehr</b> N-value <b>measurements)</b> synthesized for a given set of SAGE profiles will be used to determine whether SAGE-derived N-values agree with the Umkehr-measured N-values. The instrumental effects will be discussed. Both the Umkehr data and SAGE II measurements will be analyzed for their information about ozone variability and loss and recovery rates at the mid- and upper (40 km) levels. The updated long-term Umkehr dataset can be used to provide high quality information for identifying signs of ozone recovery. The long Umkehr historical record can provide additional information for separating the dynamic and chemical mechanisms of depletion, and can help the community better understand climate change effects...|$|R
