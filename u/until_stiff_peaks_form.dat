It was often draped over another item to give the appearance of snow having fallen over the item.|$|R

5000|$|Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff</b> is {{the second}} release, and first {{full-length}} album, by Hullabaloo. It was released in 1989 on Toxic Shock. For Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff,</b> TQ had taken over as full-time lead singer for the band (though Sluggo sings on the tune [...] "Taskmaster" [...] and hidden track [...] "Sea of Trash"), and his vocals that range from a growl to a scream begin to characterize the bands sound. The bands punk rock sensibilities {{are still in the}} forefront with fast, thrashy songs like [...] "The Lickyerbutt Song" [...] and [...] "This is My Rifle", and with subjects like [...] "Retardo Porn" [...] and [...] "Suicidal Maniac." [...] But with the songs [...] "Beat Until Stiff" [...] and [...] "Gotta Go" [...] some slower tempos and heavier guitars are introduced, giving the album a proto-grunge feel. The trademark trumpet and saxophone solos are still present throughout. Kris Fell, in the Boston Phoenix said that the [...] "lyrics on Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff</b> are blunt, almost photographic representation of the grotesque..." [...] This album features a guitar solo by Mr. Horribly Charred Infant of the Happy Flowers.|$|R

50|$|According to most recipes, the yolks must be whipped {{until they}} swell to double their {{original}} volume. Some recipes also call for egg whites (1--2 whites for each 10 yolks), beaten separately to <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks</b> consistency and gently mixed into the yolks. The mixture is then poured into greased muffin forms (about 1/2 tablespoon each) and baked {{until they are}} firm but still without crust. The pieces are then boiled lightly in the syrup, which may be flavored with rum, vanilla, or orange peel.|$|R

Therefore, chiffon cakes, like angel cakes and other foam cakes, achieve a fluffy texture by having egg whites beaten <b>until</b> <b>stiff</b> and folded them into the cake batter before baking. Its aeration properties rely on both {{the quality of the}} meringue and the chemical leaveners. Its oil-based batter is initially blended before folding into the meringue.|$|R

40|$|International audienceTelephone: + 45 4677 4920 ABSTRACT Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) {{data from}} quartz can follow {{different}} mathematical forms {{depending on the}} stimulation mode. These data {{can be described in}} terms of different multi-exponential models and can be numerically fitted using several well-known methods. Here we make a comparative analysis of the performance and stability of two models, the decay and <b>peak</b> <b>form,</b> and we consider different transformation methods for obtaining the <b>peak</b> <b>form.</b> For the numerical computations we use a nonlinear least squares (NLS) method and a method based on a first-kind Fredholm integral equation (FIE). Our analysis uses artificial data with three components (seven parameters including the background), and ten different levels of background, both the signal and the background contain Poisson distributed noise. Parameters derived using both models are acceptable (statistically consistent and on an average within ~ 1 % of the expected value) and no obvious preference is observed for any particular model, although there may be a suggestion that <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> data shows a smaller mean bias. This conclusion seems to be independent of the type of peak transformations investigated here. Furthermore, it is found that transformation of OSL decay data to a <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> gives better results than direct measurement of <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> data by, for example, varying the stimulation light intensity. The comparison of the two numerical methods suggests that the NLS method performs somewhat better than the FIE method; however, the latter has the advantage that it does not require the 2 user's judgement on the number of components in the data. Testing of the NLS procedure on a measured quartz time-resolved OSL signal (TR-OSL) transformed into <b>peak</b> <b>form</b> yielded reliable parameter estimates even when the signal intensity was deliberately reduced by a factor of sixteen...|$|R

5000|$|Chemical {{leavening}} agents {{include a}} weak base, such as baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) plus a weak acid, such as cream of tartar, lemon juice, or cultured buttermilk, {{to create an}} acidâ€”base reaction that releases carbon dioxide. (Quick bread leavened specifically with baking soda is often called [...] "soda bread"). Baking powder contains both an acid and a base in dry powdered form, and simply needs a liquid medium in which to react. Other alternative leavening agents are egg whites mechanically beaten to <b>form</b> <b>stiff</b> <b>peaks,</b> {{as in the case}} of many waffle recipes, or steam, in the case of cream puffs. Nevertheless, in a commercial process, designated chemical leavening acids and bases are used to make gas production consistent and controlled. Examples of acidâ€”base combinations include: ...|$|R

5000|$|The five {{original}} {{songs on}} the EP show that the transition started with Beat <b>Until</b> <b>Stiff</b> had completed, as band's sound had moved away from punk, more fully into the territory of grunge. The extra guitar makes for a much heavier sound, and the tempos are slower and songs longer that on previous releases. Nonetheless, the band continued to experiment with unusual song forms and odd meters. And the unusual instrumentation comes to the forefront: the song [...] "Die Laughing" [...] begins with a prominent, blaring trumpet solo, and [...] "Curse of Civilization" [...] features TQ on an extended sax solo as well.|$|R
