[...] "That seemingly pedestrian four-note loop might stir us in the most primitive of ways, but that it stirs <b>us</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> is worthy of note. By demonstrating that game sound could {{be more than a}} simple tune to fill the silence, Space Invaders moved video game music closer to the realm of art." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} years, Coldplay became widely {{known in the}} media for giving 10 per cent of the band's profits to charity, which they {{continue}} to do. Bassist Guy Berryman said, [...] "You can make people aware of issues. It isn't very much effort for <b>us</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> but if it can help people, then {{we want to do}} it." [...] The band also asks that any gifts intended for them are donated to charity, according to a response on the FAQ section of Coldplay's website. Martin spoke out against the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the US, UK and other forces during the Teenage Cancer Trust show at London's Royal Albert Hall on 24 March 2003, where he encouraged the sell-out crowd to [...] "sing against war". He would later endorse the US Democratic presidential candidates John Kerry and Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 respectively.|$|E

500|$|Historians criticized Blassingame for {{dismissing the}} WPA slave {{interviews}} and relying solely on fugitive slave narratives. In the Journal of American History, Willie Lee Rose writes that Blassingame's {{use of the}} fugitive slave narratives is marred by his neglect of the WPA interviews. Kenneth Wiggins Porter regards Blassingame's dependence on printed sources as a [...] "major weakness" [...] and believes he does not use enough white sources like plantation records and travel narratives, particularly Frederick Law Olmsted's account {{of life in the}} antebellum South. According to George Rawick, [...] "We desperately need work that depicts and analyzes the lives of black women under slavery. We have had very largely a male-dominated literature about slavery." [...] He notes, [...] "Blassingame, unfortunately, does not help <b>us</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> in this task." [...] Rawick surmises that if Blassingame had consulted the WPA slave interviews, he would have developed a picture of the [...] "heroic struggles of black women on behalf of themselves and of the whole black community".|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Gunn {{travelled}} {{with the}} Scotland Under-19s to Mexico for the 1983 FIFA World Youth Championship. Gunn played {{in all four}} of Scotland's matches {{and it was a}} formative experience, as he faced a variety of challenges in the tournament. The adidas ball in use [...] "really zipped through the air", which encouraged long-range shots at the high altitude. In the first match, against South Korea, an element of the 26,000 crowd [...] "clearly didn't like <b>us</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> ... I got absolutely pelted with coins ... and rotten fruit". The final insult was when he was hit {{on the back of the}} neck by a rancid-smelling plastic bag containing rotten fish. [...] Gunn found it [...] "intimidation ... a nightmare" [...] but adopted the strategy of patrolling the edge of his area to stay out of range and had [...] "one of the best games of my life": he kept a clean sheet as Scotland won 2–0. Scotland's coach and future manager of the full international team Andy Roxburgh told Gunn [...] "it was the best performance he'd ever seen from a Scottish goalkeeper, at any level." [...] The final group match, which Scotland needed to win in order to progress, was against the home side, Mexico. The official attendance at the Azteca Stadium was 86,582, although Gunn believes the true figure was over 100,000. Once more, Gunn was targeted with a variety of missiles, including a bottle of Johnnie Walker, but as Scotland held on to their early 1–0 lead, the fans became disillusioned with their own team and switched to sending a [...] "hail of bottles and coins" [...] on the Mexican players. Scotland lost 1–0 in the quarter final against Poland.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I on 4 August 1914, Asquith proposed a Suspensory Bill for the Home Rule Bill. It received Royal Assent simultaneously with its counterpart, the Government of Ireland Act 1914, on the 18 September. Although the two controversial Bills had now finally reached the statute books, the Suspensory Act ensured that Home Rule would be postponed {{for the duration of}} the conflict. [...] In the debate on 15 September in the House of Commons concerning the Suspensory Bill, O'Brien made it again clear [...] "that while we are prepared to pay almost any other price for a general national settlement, there is one price which some of <b>us,</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> events, will never in any possible circumstances consent to pay, and that is the dismemberment of our ancient Irish nation". He concluded by turning to 'our fellow countrymen in Ulster' in proposing to secure for them a position of undiminished citizenship in this Empire under some projected scheme of federalism.|$|E

2500|$|In later {{collections}} Lagerfeld {{chose to}} break away from the ladylike look of Chanel and began to experiment with fabrics and styles. During the 1980s, more than 40 Chanel boutiques opened worldwide. By the end of the 1980s, the boutiques sold goods ranging from US$200-per-ounce perfume, US$225 ballerina slippers to US$11,000 dresses and US$2,000 leather handbags. Chanel cosmetics and fragrances were distributed only by Chanel outlets. Chanel marketer Jean Hoehn explained the firm's approach, saying, [...] "We introduce a new fragrance every 10 years, not every three minutes like many competitors. We don't confuse the consumer. With Chanel, people know what to expect. And they keep coming back to <b>us,</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> ages, as they enter and leave the market." [...] The 1984 launch of a new fragrance, in honor of the founder, Coco, continued the label's success. In 1986, the House of Chanel struck a deal with watchmakers and in 1987, the first Chanel watch debuted. By the end of the decade, Alain moved the offices to New York City.|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} both its {{popularity}} in the late 1990s and early 2000s {{and the fact that}} it is widely considered to be a genre of heavy metal music, nu metal has often been criticized by many fans of heavy metal music, often being labelled with derogatory terms such as [...] "mallcore" [...] and [...] "whinecore". Gregory Heaney of AllMusic called nu metal [...] "one of metal's more unfortunate pushes into the mainstream". Lucy Jones of NME called nu metal [...] "the worst genre of all time". In Metal: The Definitive Guide : Heavy, NWOBH, Progressive, Thrash, Death..., Garry Sharpe-Young described [...] as [...] "a dumbed-down and—thankfully shortlived exercise". When Machine Head moved to the nu metal genre with their album The Burning Red and their vocalist Robb Flynn spiked his hair in the fashion of many nu metal musicians, the band were accused of [...] "selling out" [...] and many fans criticized their change of appearance and musical style. Machine Head's drummer Dave McClain said, [...] "Pissing people off isn't a bad thing, you know? For people to be narrow-minded is bad... t doesn't bother <b>us</b> <b>at</b> <b>all,</b> we know we're going to piss people off with this record, but some people hopefully will actually sit down and listen to the whole record". Robb Flynn, Machine Head's vocalist, said ...|$|E
2500|$|As Debussy's {{popularity}} increased, he {{was often}} engaged as a conductor throughout Europe during this period, most often performing Pelléas, La Mer, and Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. He was also an occasional music critic, to supplement his conducting fees and piano lessons, writing under the pseudonym [...] "Monsieur Croche". He avoided analytical dissection and attempts to force images from music, saying [...] "Let <b>us</b> <b>at</b> <b>all</b> costs preserve this magic peculiar to music, since of all the arts it is most susceptible to magic." [...] He could be caustic and witty, sometimes sloppy and ill-informed. He was {{for the most part}} enthusiastic about Richard Strauss and Stravinsky, and worshipful of Chopin and Bach, the latter being acknowledged as [...] "the one great master." [...] His relationship to Beethoven was a complex one; he was said to refer to him as [...] "le vieux sourd" [...] (the old deaf one) and adjured one young pupil never to play Beethoven's music for [...] "it is like somebody dancing on my grave." [...] It was said that [...] "Debussy liked Mozart, and he believed that Beethoven had terrifically profound things to say, but {{that he did not know}} how to say them, because he was imprisoned in a web of incessant restatement and of German aggressiveness." [...] He also admired the works of Charles-Valentin Alkan. Schubert and Mendelssohn fared much worse, the latter being described as a [...] "facile and elegant notary".|$|E
