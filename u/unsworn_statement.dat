5|$|The {{hearing in}} the case of Muthaura, Kenyatta and Ali took place between 21 September and 5 October 2011. Kenyatta and Ali {{submitted}} challenges to the court's jurisdiction which were rejected. The defence teams presented two witnesses each and Kenyatta made a sworn statement. Francis Muthaura exercised his right to make an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The defence {{opted for}} Einem {{to give an}} <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> from the dock, rather than given sworn {{evidence}} from the witness box. In his <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement,</b> Einem detailed his alibi with what he claimed happened between 5 June and 11 July 1983. He again claimed that on 5 June he had picked up Kelvin in North Adelaide, had driven him to his home, and later had dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD. He also claimed that he was sick with the flu {{for the next week}} after that and did not return to work until 14 June. Einem was quite sketchy on his activities after that, however he did remember what he did on 10 July, the day the body was dumped on the airstrip. He said that he was at a relative's birthday party with his mother for most of that evening, and after dropping off a friend on the way home, had gone straight to bed and then to work the next day. He also addressed the issue of the noisy exhaust on the car heard during the abduction of Kelvin, by stating that the exhaust on his Ford Falcon (which Einem had sold on 16 July 1983, purportedly to raise money for his overseas trip) was less than two years old and in good condition. He closed his <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> by again claiming his innocence.|$|E
500|$|Asquez, who {{provided}} an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> to the [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] team through an intermediary, which the journalists {{included in the}} programme, reluctantly appeared. He retracted the statements he made to [...] "Death on the Rock", which he claimed he had made up after [...] "pestering" [...] from Major Bob Randall (another [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] witness, who had sold the programme a video recording of {{the aftermath of the}} shootings). The British media covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused Asquez of lying for the television (and [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of encouraging him) in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. Nonetheless, Pizzarello asked Asquez if he could explain why his original statement mentioned the Soldiers [...] "C" [...] and [...] "D" [...] donning berets, showing identity cards, and telling members of the public [...] "it's okay, it's the police" [...] after shooting Savage (details which were not public before the inquest); Asquez replied that he could not, because he was [...] "a bit confused".|$|E
50|$|Seacrest {{was given}} {{testimonial}} immunity {{in exchange for}} his testimony. Pfeifer and Coen submitted <b>unsworn</b> <b>statements</b> to the court and, therefore, did not have to face cross-examination.|$|R
2500|$|The {{judicial}} {{function of}} the Royal Prerogative is performed in trust and in the Queen's name by officers of Her Majesty's court, who enjoy the privilege granted conditionally by the sovereign {{to be free from}} criminal and civil liability for <b>unsworn</b> <b>statements</b> made within the court. This dispensation extends from the notion in common law that the sovereign [...] "can do no wrong".|$|R
5|$|The {{hearing in}} the case of Ruto, Kosgey and Sang took place in The Hague between 1 and 8 September 2011. The three {{defendants}} had all filed applications challenging the jurisdiction of the court which were rejected by the chamber. Although the defence teams had initially proposed calling 43 witnesses to the confirmation of charges hearings the chamber instructed them to present just two witnesses each at the confirmation hearings, which they did. Ruto and Sang additionally made <b>unsworn</b> <b>statements</b> in person.|$|R
500|$|Maxie Proetta {{appeared}} on 22 September. He told the coroner {{that he had}} witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and {{he believed that the}} shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car {{he and his wife had}} seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south, and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers, but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' suggestion did not make sense. Carmen Proetta appeared the following day. Mrs Proetta's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to [...] "Death on the Rock"; she was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground, because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers' weapons. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] had been shown. Asquez, who provided an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> to the programme through an intermediary, reluctantly appeared at the inquest. He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists, which he claimed he had made up after [...] "pestering" [...] from Major Bob Randall (who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British tabloids covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. However, Asquez's statement contained several details that were not released publicly, and which only entered the public domain during the inquest, though, when questioned by the coroner, Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was [...] "a bit confused". The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing.|$|E
2500|$|In the Privy Council case Haw Tua Tau v. Public Prosecutor (1981), the appellants criticized {{amendments}} to the Criminal Procedure Code ("CPC") that removed an accused person's right to make an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> not subject to cross-examination, {{and replaced it with}} a power exercisable by the court to draw an adverse inference if the accused person opts to remain silent after being warned about the possible consequences of doing so. They submitted that the changes violated the privilege against self-incrimination which was a fundamental rule of natural justice. Lord Diplock, speaking for the court, questioned if the right to silence is a fundamental rule of natural justice but found it unnecessary to decide this point as he held that the new CPC provisions provided an accused person with an inducement to testify but did not compel him or her to do so. In reaching this conclusion, the judge noted that [...] "n considering whether a particular practice adopted by a court of law offends against a fundamental rule of natural justice, that practice must not be looked at in isolation but in light of the part which it plays in the complete judicial process", and that [...] "what may properly be regarded by lawyers as rules of natural justice change with the times".|$|E

5000|$|The Charter {{provided}} that evidence against the accused could include any document [...] "without proof of its issuance or signature" [...] {{as well as}} diaries, letters, press reports, and sworn or <b>unsworn</b> out-of-court <b>statements</b> relating to the charges. Article 13 of the Charter read, in part: [...] "The tribunal {{shall not be bound}} by technical rules of evidence...and shall admit any evidence which it deems to have probative value".|$|R
5000|$|The Court {{ruled that}} the {{appellant}} had suffered a prejudicial error when his trial counsel presented an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> that had revealed privileged communications without the appellant's permission, {{on the basis that}} [...] "evidence of a statement or other disclosure of privileged matter is not admissible against the holder of the privilege if disclosure was compelled erroneously or was made without an opportunity for the holder of the privilege to claim the privilege" [...] and that he [...] "did not waive his attorney-client privilege. Appellant’s affidavit demonstrates that defense counsel never asked Appellant for permission to use the written summary", and that [...] "trial counsel repeatedly referred to Appellant’s <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> during his sentencing argument" [...] On this basis, the Court reversed the sentence, authorizing a sentencing rehearing.|$|E

5000|$|On March 24, 2009, after a {{trial at}} Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Kreutzer {{was convicted of}} one {{specification}} of premeditated murder, 18 specifications of attempted murder, one specification of violating a general order by transporting weapons on post, and one specification of larceny of government property (theft of government ammunition). Prior to his sentencing, Kreutzer stood at attention while {{a member of his}} defense team read his <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> to members of the court: ...|$|E
5000|$|I {{would like}} to tell the members of the jury why I can't go in the witness box is because I am a {{pathological}} liar. Secondly, I did not kill Teresa De Simone.

50|$|The {{investigating}} officer will, generally, {{review all}} non-testimonial evidence and then proceed to examination of witnesses. Except {{for a limited}} set of rules on privileges, interrogation, and the rape-shield rule (MRE 412), the military rules of evidence do not apply at this investigative hearing. This does not mean, however, that the investigating officer ignores evidentiary issues. The investigating officer will comment on all evidentiary issues that are critical to a case’s disposition. All testimony is taken under oath or affirmation, except that an accused may make an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... “It is, in my humble view, {{quite clear}} that the accused was merely trying to tailor his defence {{in an attempt to}} create doubts about theprosecution’s case knowing full well, having opted to give his {{evidence}} {{in the form of an}} <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> from the dock that his story cannot be tested by cross examination. The end result of his statement is just a mere denial and assertions not supported by evidence. It is trite that mere denial without other proof to reasonably dislodge the evidence presented by the prosecution is insufficient to inject reasonable doubt into the prosecutions’ case''''" ...|$|E
50|$|According to the Army News Service, in Kreutzer's <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> {{he closed}} with saying he can't change the past, so his heartfelt and sincere desire {{was to provide}} any measure of help, closure, and comfort he can to all of his victims. Another member of Kreutzer's defense team made brief remarks, {{suggesting}} clemency in the sentencing since Kreutzer had been a role model prisoner for the past 13 years. Colonel Patrick Parrish, the military judge at Fort Bragg, then ruled {{that in addition to}} life in prison, Kreutzer should be reduced in rank to E-1, forfeit pay and allowances, and be given a dishonorable discharge.|$|E
5000|$|Also on 9 August, Kaitani {{filed an}} <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> {{in court that}} he had {{deliberately}} remained in the parliamentary complex during the upheaval, not to support the rebels, but to use his skills as a qualified conflict management trainer to calm the situation. [...] "In my professional capacity, I simply could not leave the parliamentary complex and watch it being taken over," [...] he said. [...] "I {{decided to take the}} bull by the horn and remain there." [...] He continued to deny having taken an oath or signing an oath. [...] "I did not take an oath of allegiance or sign any documents," [...] he declared, adding that the first he knew of his alleged unconstitutional ministerial appointment was from a newspaper.|$|E

5000|$|Furthermore, {{shortly after}} the bill was killed in {{committee}} two Federal District Court judges began questioning {{the constitutionality of the}} 120 hearings, U.S. District Judges Philip Brimmer and William Martinez. Judge Martinez stated, “At issue is a provision in state law that allows lawyers to assert that their client, typically a bank, has the right to foreclose on a property even though they might not have the original mortgage paperwork to prove it. Colorado is the only state in the country that allows an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> by an attorney for a foreclosing party - without any penalty - to say, ‘Trust me, judge, these guys are the qualified holder for this deed of trust,’ “Is there another state that has lowered the bar for a foreclosure any lower?” ...|$|E
50|$|In the Furman v. Georgia case, the {{resident}} awoke {{in the middle}} of the night to find William Henry Furman committing burglary in his house. At trial, in an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> allowed under Georgia criminal procedure, Furman said that while trying to escape, he tripped and the weapon he was carrying fired accidentally, killing the victim. This contradicted his prior statement to police that he had turned and blindly fired a shot while fleeing. In either event, because the shooting occurred during the commission of a felony, Furman would have been guilty of murder and eligible for the death penalty under then-extant state law, according to the felony murder rule. Furman was tried for murder and was found guilty based largely on his own statement. Although he was sentenced to death, the punishment was never carried out.|$|E
5000|$|In England and Wales, {{the right}} of {{suspects}} to refuse to answer questions during their actual trial (the [...] "right to silence", or {{the right to remain}} silent as it is now known) was well established at common law from the 17th century. The defendant was considered [...] "incompetent" [...] to give evidence and attempts to force defendants to provide answers, such as the efforts of the Star Chamber, were judged unlawful. Being unable to speak at their own trial, the practice of defendants giving an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> was introduced and was recognised in law in 1883. Defendants testifying in their own defence was also introduced in the 1880s (and extended to all offences by 1898) although the right to silence was clearly protected. As the right to testify was extended the possibility of unsworn statements was withdrawn.|$|E

50|$|In R v Sullivan 1981 Crim LR 46, CA, the {{appellant}} {{was tried}} {{on charges of}} causing grievous bodily harm with intent and inflicting grievous bodily harm. The victim said that the appellant and a companion were drunk. He said {{that while he was}} in a street that was eight feet wide and had a narrow pavement, the appellant drove a car through that street at twenty five to thirty miles an hour, mounted the pavement and injured him. The appellant denied that he was the driver of the car in a written statement to the police and said he could add nothing to that statement in an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> from the dock. However, during his closing speech, counsel for the defence suggested that all the appellant intended to do was frighten the victim and no more. The jury were directed that if there was an intention to frighten, and injury took place as a result, the appellant was guilty of an offence under section 20. The appellant was acquitted of the offence under section 18, but convicted of offences under section 20. The Court of Appeal held that an intention to frighten was not enough to constitute the necessary mens rea for section 20, and that the direction to the contrary effect was a misdirection. However, they dismissed the appellant's appeal. They said that a properly directed jury could not in the circumstances have come to any other conclusion than that the appellant must have been aware that what he was doing was likely to cause physical injury to the victim.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} the protections for vulnerable accused in Malaysian criminal trials are not sufficient. It is crucial to ensure that vulnerable accused receive proper treatment when dealing with the court. After thoroughly scrutinising the law and practice in several other jurisdictions, this dissertation proposes several amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code and the Evidence Act 1950 to provide clear guidelines {{as to how to}} deal with vulnerable accused in a criminal trial. It is ultimately recommended that the right to give an <b>unsworn</b> <b>statement</b> be modified so that it is more effective and fair in its operation. This dissertation further recommends the introduction of an adverse inference clause for the right to remain silent at trial so accused person can better understand the effect of their choice. Recommendations are also made to introduce an intermediary service for those vulnerable accused who choose to give sworn evidence in court, and to allow a support person to accompany a vulnerable accused during trial. These amendments aim to assist vulnerable accused persons physically and emotionally, and to protect their fair trial rights...|$|E
