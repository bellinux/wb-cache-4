500|$|Tony, Carmela, and AJ {{meet for}} dinner, while the Journey song [...] "Don't Stop Believin'" [...] {{plays in the}} background. The camera cuts away from the Soprano family and {{presents}} vignettes of other diners. As the tension increases, Meadow is shown struggling with parking then crossing {{the street to the}} restaurant. A man, who had been previously shown at the counter specifically taking notice of Tony, is shown entering the restroom, the door of which is directly facing and approximately 90 degrees to the table at which Tony and his family are sitting. As Meadow walks <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> the screen goes to Tony. The diner door opens with a bell ringing, Tony looks up and the show smash cuts to black and after a few seconds the credits roll in silence.|$|E
500|$|Much of [...] "Closing Time" [...] {{was filmed}} in a {{department}} store in Cardiff. As the store had to be closed, they filmed over four or five nights, sometimes going until 6:00 in the morning. Hughs {{said it was a}} [...] "drain" [...] on the production team, while Corden recalled it made the cast and crew [...] "lightheaded" [...] and [...] "hysterical". Reportedly, the department store scenes were shot in March 2011. The rest of the episode was filmed in a private home in Cardiff; the couple who owned the house allowed the filming to take place in order for it to be an experience for their two young boys. Production at the house also went into {{the early hours of the}} morning. The window of the sliding door in the house that the Doctor jumps through to save Craig from the Cybermat was too small, so the production team built another one. The new door was too big for shatterglass; instead, glass that breaks into chunks was used, wired with a small explosive that would crack the glass when Smith's stuntman jumped through it. Hughs wanted it to look as if the audience was crashing through the window with the Doctor; he spliced together shots of Smith filmed running <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> the stuntman jumping through it, and Smith landing with shards of glass thrown over him.|$|E

2500|$|Ted Rothe {{had been}} {{across the street}} {{attending}} a meeting with Warden Powell and some architects who were designing the new facility Powell wanted to build. [...] Rothe returned to his desk inside the prison at {{a few minutes before}} 4:00, oblivious to the inmate takeover. [...] To this point, there had been almost no noise, few scuffles, and no casualties. [...] He chatted with a guard for a few minutes before sitting behind his desk, which was in view of the door where inmates came to receive their medication. [...] Myles, Smart, and a third inmate named Toms came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> where Myles asked to receive some pills for his migraines. [...] The guard on duty, Officer Cox, turned to retrieve them as another guard opened the door to let a third guard out. [...] As soon as the door opened, Myles rushed through, brandishing a meat cleaver he had acquired from the kitchens. [...] Toms threatened the other guards with a knife, and they allowed themselves to be herded into a nearby lavatory. [...] Myles burst into Deputy Warden Rothe's office and attacked Rothe with the cleaver. [...] Rothe deflected the blow with a plywood letterbox.|$|E
