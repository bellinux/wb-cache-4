500|$|Drosera regia {{plants are}} fairly large herbs that produce {{horizontal}} woody rhizomes and {{a crown of}} large, linear leaves up to [...] long and [...] wide. The leaves possess stalked glands (tentacles) on the upper surface of the lamina along nearly {{the entire length of}} the leaf. The leaves lack petioles and stipules, emerging by circinate vernation (<b>uncurling)</b> and tapering to a filiform point. The tentacles and the leaf itself are capable of responding to prey by bending toward insects trapped in the sticky mucilage produced by the glands. Leaves are even capable of folding over themselves several times. Each leaf can possess thousands of tentacles, which can aid in the retention of larger prey when combined with the leaf wrapping tightly around captured insects. In its native habitat, D.regia has been known to capture large beetles, moths and butterflies. Plants go dormant during the colder season and form a dormant bud, consisting of a tight cluster of short, immature leaves. Plants begin to break dormancy in mid-July with a typical growing season lasting from October to April, though this is variable and plants can continue growing year-round without dormancy. Individual leaves die back but remain attached to the short stem, clothing the bottom portion of the plant in the blackened dead leaves of former years.|$|E

That god came slowly, stalking across far over our heads from top to top; then, of a sudden, his flame-white form was seen standing in a gap of the valley walls; the trees flung themselves along the ground before him, and censers of pine gum began swinging in the dark aisles, releasing their perfumed steam. Throughout these happy ravines where no man lives, he shows himself naked and unashamed, the colour of pale honey; on his golden hair such shining as one has not elsewhere seen; his eyes like old wine on fire.

5000|$|Leaf: The green, {{photosynthetic}} part of {{the plant}} is technically a megaphyll and in ferns, it {{is often referred to}} as a frond. New leaves typically expand by the unrolling of a tight spiral called a [...] "crozier" [...] or [...] "fiddlehead fern". This <b>uncurling</b> of the leaf is termed [...] "circinate vernation". Leaves are divided into two types a trophophyll and a sporophyll. A trophophyll frond is a vegetative leaf analogous to the typical green leaves of seed plants that does not produce spores, instead only producing sugars by photosynthesis. A sporophyll frond is a fertile leaf that produces spores borne in sporangia that are usually clustered to form sori. In most ferns, fertile leaves are morphologically very similar to the sterile ones, and they photosynthesize in the same way. In some groups, the fertile leaves are much narrower than the sterile leaves, and may even have no green tissue at all (e.g., Blechnaceae, Lomariopsidaceae). The anatomy of fern leaves can either be simple or highly divided. In tree ferns, the main stalk that connects the leaf to the stem (known as the stipe), often have multiple leafy. The leafy structures that grow from the stipe are known as [...] "pinnae" [...] and are often again divided into smaller pinnules.|$|E

5000|$|A {{recording}} thermometer {{is a type}} of thermometer that records temperature changes over a period of time.

The pen traces a rising and falling line on a strip of paper attached to a slowly turning drum. The drum usually makes one turn every seven or so days, so afterwards each strip of paper contains a complete and accurate record of temperature changes for a whole week.
