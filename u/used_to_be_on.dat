2500|$|After the {{official}} physical {{boundary between the}} United States and Mexico was set, Mexicans that lived in territory now belonging to the U.S. faced {{a new kind of}} border. This border was much more than simply a line dividing two nations. Although the geographic boundary was permanently set to the south of them, these new Mexican Americans were still seen as foreigners and outcasts in their new country. [...] The rhetoric of dominance used by Euro-Americans prevented Mexican Americans from feeling like true American citizens. [...] The steadfast public opinion of white superiority prevented Mexican Americans from being treated as equals. [...] This racial difference is what caused a new type of border to form between the two groups. [...] This racial border unfairly discriminated against Mexican Americans even though they had the same status as citizens of the United States. [...] Due to the rhetoric of dominance utilized by whites, Mexican Americans were given a much lower social and economic status that they could not overcome. [...] It also caused many Mexican Americans to question their cultural identity. [...] As the border shifted and they became U.S. residents, the culture shifted around them, too. [...] Some homes that <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> Mexican territory were now on American soil and were surrounded by a new, unfamiliar culture. [...] The decision each individual had to make was whether to embrace their new citizenship and assimilate into American society or hold tight to their culture and continue to self-identify as Mexican. [...] By way of the rhetoric of dominance, Mexican Americans faced new social, economic, and identity crises in the United States.|$|E
