25|$|On November 24, 1992, Travolta was {{piloting}} his Gulfstream N728T {{at night}} above a solid <b>undercast,</b> when he experienced a total electrical system failure, while flying under instrument flight rules into Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. During the emergency landing, he almost had a mid-air collision with a USAir Boeing 727, an event {{attributed to a}} risky decision by an air traffic controller.|$|E
25|$|At times, C-123 {{crews were}} {{uncomfortable with the}} assault role. South Vietnamese Special Forces were {{sometimes}} capricious about when and where they would fight. Straight cargo operations were hazardous enough, especially during the monsoon season when South Vietnamese troops were socked in within the mountainous valleys. To execute the mission, the C-123s would line up in a proper direction, let down in the <b>undercast,</b> {{and if they did}} not break out by a given altitude, would climb back up. There were usually 800-foot ceilings in the valleys, {{and most of the time}} they broke out.|$|E
500|$|The {{exercise}} {{began at}} noon on 12 August 1937 and was scheduled to end in 24 hours. After several hours of searching through a foggy <b>undercast</b> that extended [...] offshore, Navy planes found the Utah [...] from the coast and tracked it heading northwest. Air Corps bombers were sent to attack the ship but searched well into the evening without locating it. Admiral King then found an error in the Navy's position reports, which he later attributed to [...] "clerical error". The Utah had actually been [...] west of the search area provided to the Air Corps. Worse, the ship disappeared into the extensive low fog during the night, breaking the contact by the Navy's scout planes. The poor weather also prevented an early morning search for the Utah.|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{materials}} technology {{have resulted in}} newer products {{for the construction of}} stoppings used in USA underground coal mines. Some of the newer materials were developed for the construction industry and were consequently introduced into the mining industry [...] Ventilation control devices such as stoppings, overcasts and <b>undercasts</b> have traditionally been constructed of concrete block or metal panels. Efforts to reduce material and labor costs in the construction of stoppings and other ventilation controls have led to the introduction and use of “nontraditional ” materials. The “nontraditional ” or newer materials may consist of lightweight blocks composed of various cement-type compounds or panels composed of gypsum or other mineral-type compounds, and plastic membrane and steel fabricated designs. Reduced labor and material costs may be derived from such materials, while required safety properties are maintained. An MSHA engineering evaluation program was developed to assess the suitability of such newer products in terms of the safety standards for fire endurance and flexural strength as specified in USA Title 30, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 75. 333. The engineering evaluation program is described and a short description of the fire endurance and flexural strength tests is presented. A discussion of the newer materials evaluated is included...|$|R
2500|$|Hegenberger {{attempted}} to check wind drift by launching smoke bombs (carried for that purpose) over the tail, but was hindered by glare. Strong crosswinds that lasted all morning and rough surface conditions {{made use of}} the smoke bombs beneath the aircraft ineffectual. Hegenberger was able to visually confirm their course by sighting the Army transport ship Chateau Thierry, as planned, as it approached California. By 9:00a.m., however, the clear weather gave way to increasing cloud cover. Maitland held the Bird of Paradise at , just above the <b>undercast,</b> to enable Hegenberger to attempt intermittent drift readings of the ocean waves through holes in the clouds, but by 9:30a.m. {{he was forced to}} cruise at just [...] altitude {{to be able to see}} the ocean's surface. Strong winds and rain hampered the effort and obscured the horizon. Hegenberger took drift readings through the floor of the airplane and used the sextant to shoot the sun when it occasionally broke through the clouds.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese air {{operations}} against FEAF airfields on Luzon {{were scheduled to}} take off from their Formosan bases beginning at 1:30am on 8 December, with attacks to commence 21 minutes after dawn (and approximately four hours after offensive operations began in Hawaii), at 6:30am. However, reconnaissance flights dispatched to check weather conditions between Formosa and Luzon neither returned nor reported as launch time approached, and a thick fog over southern Formosa set back the timetable by 90 minutes. The commanders of Japanese units were disturbed when monitoring of American radio traffic indicated that the weather flights had been detected despite the darkness and attempts were made by Iba-based P-40s to intercept. Although all the interceptions failed, Iba Field was then substituted as a target in place of Nichols (where {{it was assumed that}} two squadrons of B-17s had dispersed) to deal with the new interceptor threat. Further radio monitoring revealed to the Japanese that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet had been alerted at 4:00am of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and they expected attacks on their own bases by B-17s (bombing through the fog <b>undercast)</b> at any time after 7:00am. The air defense weaknesses of the FEAF were mirrored by those of the Japanese, who had prepared only for offensive operations, but no attack came before a final revised plan was issued at 7:50am, ordering the main attack force of Japanese land-based aircraft to launch at 9:15am and attack at 12:30pm ...|$|E

50|$|The {{first attempt}} to {{establish}} the record was flown on July 10, 1923. Maughan took off from Mitchel Field, Long Island, at 4:56 a.m. The Allegheny Mountains were obscured by a thick <b>undercast,</b> and unable to navigate by landmarks, Maughan flew by dead reckoning, arriving at McCook Field 90 minutes behind schedule, where a broken tail fin rib caused an additional delay. The engine of the PW-8 quit in flight over Illinois because of a clogged fuel line, and Maughan made a forced landing in a farm field, damaging the landing gear and ending the attempt.|$|E
5000|$|After {{attempting}} {{unsuccessfully to}} contact Flight 773, Oakland ARTCC asked another {{aircraft in the}} immediate vicinity, United Air Lines Flight 593, {{if they had the}} plane in sight. Flight 593's flight crew responded that they did not see Flight 773, but a minute later they reported: [...] "There’s a black, uh, cloud of smoke coming up through the <b>undercast</b> at, uh, three-thirty, four o’clock position right now. Looks like (an) oil or gasoline fire." [...] Oakland ARTCC realized that the smoke spotted by the United air crew was likely caused by the crash of Pacific Air Lines Flight 773.|$|E
5000|$|On 13 March 1982, Arizona ANG KC-135A, 57-1489 {{collided}} {{in mid-air}} with a civilian Grumman-American AA-1 Yankee near Luke AFB, AZ. The collision, which occurred as the tanker was descending on an IFR flight plan through an <b>undercast,</b> {{was struck by}} the civilian aircraft operating VFR just below the cloud deck, causing the tail of the KC-135 to be severed by the force of the impact. The two civilians on the AA-1 and four military personnel on the KC-135 were killed. Included among the dead was the squadron commander of the 197th AREFS, Lt Col James N. Floor.|$|E
50|$|On 2 September, the 16th group {{participated in}} a show of force mission over Tokyo which took place while the {{surrender}} terms were being signed on the battleship Missouri in Tokyo Bay. The mission was carefully planned as it represented the first attempt at formation flying that the organization had made since its arrival overseas. The aircraft flew over Tokyo Bay just as the surrender terms were signed and the men could watch the Missouri {{at the same time that}} they heard the broadcast of the ceremony over the radio. The B-29s flew at approximately 3000 ft and could see clearly through a scattered <b>undercast.</b>|$|E
50|$|There were 42 RCM {{missions}} {{starting on}} 4 May 1945, which included 35 regular BG missions; two missions {{to assist the}} 315th BW, which had no RCM capability, and five special radar signal search missions. During this period, 440 enemy radar signals were observed and analyzed and this information was forwarded to higher echelons for collation with information from other sources. On the regular BG missions, the RCM observer would spot or barrage jam the detected Japanese signals but, since the aircraft {{would be in the}} area for only 10 to 15 minutes, it was not effective during the entire time that the group was over the target. The Group had six Porcupine aircraft and more were being added when the war ended. These B-29s were dedicated mainly to analyzing and jamming Japanese radar signals. They were used over targets with heavy concentrations of gun-laying and searchlight-controlling radar. They would stay in the target area during the entire bombing period. RCM activities were very effective based on numerous crew reports of searchlights frantically searching the sky with little degree of accuracy when there was partial <b>undercast</b> cloud cover. At times of completely <b>undercast</b> skies, the anti-aircraft fire was totally inaccurate when radar jamming was employed. Over Shimonoseki, with over 200 anti-aircraft guns, a Porcupine was in the area and no Group planes were lost. The 315th BW planes, employing the AN/APQ-7 Eagle radar, had a 70 nmi km long bomb run lasting 15 minutes, ideal for gun-laying radar. But at the heavily defended Kawasaki oil refinery no B-29's were lost due to the effects of the Porcupine jammers.|$|E
50|$|Operations against Northern Japan {{became the}} new {{mission of the}} Eleventh Air Force, and it was being {{successfully}} carried out. Except for July 1944, when the weather was especially bad, each month of 1944 showed a steady increase in operations against the Kuriles. Each month's record showed planes turned back short of their targets, weather again protecting the Japanese. Often, too, B-24 Liberator bomb loads were dropped through the <b>undercast</b> by aid of the newly installed radar bombing equipment, {{a far cry from}} the timed runsmade on the Kiska main camp area using the Kiska volcano as an initial point when the target was closed in. The record month, June 1945, for the Eleventh Air Force showed a record number of tons of bombs dropped.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exercise}} {{began at}} noon on 12 August 1937 and was scheduled to end in 24 hours. After several hours of searching through a foggy <b>undercast</b> that extended 200 nmi km offshore, Navy planes found the Utah 275 nmi km from the coast and tracked it heading northwest. Air Corps bombers were sent to attack the ship but searched well into the evening without locating it. Admiral King then found an error in the Navy's position reports, which he later attributed to [...] "clerical error". The Utah had actually been 50 nmi km west of the search area provided to the Air Corps. Worse, the ship disappeared into the extensive low fog during the night, breaking the contact by the Navy's scout planes. The poor weather also prevented an early morning search for the Utah.|$|E

50|$|The unit's origins {{begin on}} 9 August 1946, when an Army Air Forces C-47 Skytrain {{departed}} Tulln Air Base near Vienna, Austria, on a scheduled courier run {{that would take}} it to Venice, Italy, then south to Rome. These flights were routine, and this aircraft had three passengers besides the crew and cargo. As the C-47 flew toward Venice, it encountered heavy weather, including an <b>undercast,</b> and, unknown to its crew, blundered into Yugoslav airspace for several minutes. Before long Yugoslav Yak-3 fighters {{came on the scene}} and shot the C-47 down. The pilot skillfully crash-landed and all the people aboard survived but were interned. This caused an immediate uproar from the US government, and stern statements were issued to Yugoslav prime minister Josip Broz (Tito) about immediate release and access to the crash site. Talks were underway when, on 19 August, incredibly, almost the same exact event occurred again. Another C-47 courier aircraft was shot down by Yugoslav fighters in the same area. This time the crew was not so fortunate and all aboard perished.|$|E
5000|$|Theatre work {{includes}} five productions for the Young Vic in London {{and which}} range from The Government Inspector to Annie Get Your Gun. Black Snow was directed for the American Repertory Theatre, plus All's Well That Ends Well for the Public Theater in New York. In London, Holy Mothers {{was presented at the}} Ambassadors and the Royal Court Theatre, while La Bête was seen in London's West End and on Broadway, where it received a Tony nomination. On Broadway, Jones' productions of Titanic (the musical) and Wrong Mountain were presented. For the Royal Shakespeare Company, Jones directed A Midsummer Night's Dream, which provoked critical reactions such as the comments [...] "Dream world ruined by this vandal's romp" [...] and [...] "Miserably <b>undercast,</b> grotesquely overdesigned, sloppily directed and lacks the following: theatricality, comedy and magic" [...] which appeared as part of The Guardians interview. [...] Higgins also notes that the production [...] "is now generally known as the play that got the worst reviews of the RSC's entire history and of any theatre production for the past 20 years.|$|E
