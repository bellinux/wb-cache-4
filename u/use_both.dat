5|$|Aquatic beetles use several {{techniques}} for retaining air beneath the water's surface. Diving beetles (Dytiscidae) hold air between the abdomen and the elytra when diving. Hydrophilidae have hairs on their under surface that retain {{a layer of}} air against their bodies. Adult crawling water beetles <b>use</b> <b>both</b> their elytra and their hind coxae (the basal segment of the back legs) in air retention, while whirligig beetles simply carry an air bubble down with them whenever they dive.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from various {{sites on the}} Iberian peninsula suggest the domestication {{of plants and animals}} between 6,000 and 4,500 BC. Céide Fields in Ireland, consisting of extensive tracts of land enclosed by stone walls, date to 3,500 BC and are the oldest known field systems in the world. The horse was domesticated in the Pontic steppe around 4,000 BC. In Siberia, Cannabis was in use in China in Neolithic times and may have been domesticated there; it was in <b>use</b> <b>both</b> as a fibre for ropemaking and as a medicine in Ancient Egypt by about 2,350 BC.|$|E

5|$|Development of Revelation lasted {{more than}} three years; Ubisoft had as many as eighty {{employees}} working on the game. Musician Peter Gabriel lent his voice and a song to the game's audio; the original score was written by Exiles composer Jack Wall. Overall, reception to the game was positive; reviewers lauded the impressive visuals, sound, and puzzles. Publications such as Computer Gaming World took issue with the control scheme of the game. Revelation is the last game in the Myst series to <b>use</b> <b>both</b> prerendered backgrounds and full-motion video; the final game in the series, , is rendered in real-time throughout.|$|E
5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On these lines, express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and <b>use</b> <b>both</b> island and side platforms.|$|E

5|$|From 1980 on, {{a better}} {{understanding}} of dinosaur biomechanics, and studies by palaeontologists Andreas Christian and Holger Preuschoft on the resistance to bending of the back of Plateosaurus, led to widespread acceptance of an erect, digitigrade limb posture and a roughly horizontal position of the back. Many researchers were of the opinion that Plateosaurus could <b>use</b> <b>both</b> quadrupedal gaits (for slow speeds) and bipedal gaits (for rapid locomotion), and Wellnhofer insisted that the tail curved strongly downward, making a bipedal posture impossible. However, Moser showed that the tail was in fact straight.|$|E
5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they <b>use</b> <b>both</b> tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. They tend to bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E

Cathy Winks and Anne Semans, coauthors of The Good Vibrations Guide to Sex, recommended the Magic Wand for <b>use</b> <b>both</b> during foreplay and intercourse and noted couples could feel pleasure through the device together at the same time. Wendy Caster wrote in the 2003 edition of The Lesbian Sex Book that lesbians have enjoyed using the Magic Wand due to its ability to concentrate powerful vibration on the clitoris.|$|E

5|$|Scholars however concur {{that the}} rulers of the {{imperial}} dynasty in the 8th to 10th century made the Kannada language as important as Sanskrit. Rashtrakuta inscriptions <b>use</b> <b>both</b> Kannada and Sanskrit (historians Sheldon Pollock and Jan Houben claim they are mostly in Kannada), and the rulers encouraged literature in both languages. The earliest existing Kannada literary writings are credited to their court poets and royalty. Though these Rashtrakutas were Kannadigas, they were conversant in a northern Deccan language as well.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{cetacean}} live in rivers and lakes, but are {{more closely related}} to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can <b>use</b> <b>both</b> marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} {{transport chain}} carries both protons and electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes <b>use</b> <b>both</b> soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-soluble electron transfer protein cytochrome c. This carries only electrons, {{and these are}} transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an iron atom that the protein holds within a heme group in its structure. Cytochrome c {{is also found in}} some bacteria, where it is located within the periplasmic space.|$|E

5|$|The α-chemokine SDF-1, a ligand for CXCR4, {{suppresses}} {{replication of}} T-tropic HIV-1 isolates. It does this by down-regulating {{the expression of}} CXCR4 {{on the surface of}} these cells. HIV that use only the CCR5 receptor are termed R5; those that use only CXCR4 are termed X4, and those that <b>use</b> <b>both,</b> X4R5. However, the use of coreceptor alone does not explain viral tropism, as not all R5 viruses are able to use CCR5 on macrophages for a productive infection and HIV can also infect a subtype of myeloid dendritic cells, which probably constitute a reservoir that maintains infection when CD4+ T cell numbers have declined to extremely low levels.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Sag Harbor, NY114 {{encounters}} a modern roundabout {{at the intersection}} of Short Beach Road (County Route60 or CR60) and Tyndall Road. NY114 makes a turn through the roundabout and then travels one more mile through North Haven before reaching the first of two ferries along its route. Shelter Island's two ferries, both of which technically carry NY114, are operated by two different companies. The South Ferry (between North Haven and Shelter Island) is operated by the South Ferry Company and the North Ferry (between Shelter Island Heights and Greenport) is operated by the North Ferry Company. Since the two entities are separate, there is no incentive to <b>use</b> <b>both</b> ferries, although both companies offer discounts for round trip fares and for Shelter Island residents.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from a summer visit to Los Altos, California, Rona received a vague telegram from the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester referencing war work and polonium, but no details of an assignment. When Rona responded {{that she would be}} interested in helping with the war effort but had immigration issues, a man identifying himself as Brian O'Bryen appeared in her office and explained the nature of the confidential work for the Manhattan Project. They proposed buying her method of polonium extraction and gave specific instructions for the type of assistants she might use — someone unfamiliar with chemistry or physics. Her non-citizen status did not preclude her from working for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), to which she gave her methods without compensation. Before the Manhattan Project, polonium had been used only in small samples, but the project proposed to <b>use</b> <b>both</b> polonium and beryllium to create a reaction forcing neutrons to be ejected and ignite the fission reaction required for the atom bomb. Plutonium plants, based on her specifications for what was needed to process element, were built in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos National Laboratory, but Rona was given no details.|$|E
