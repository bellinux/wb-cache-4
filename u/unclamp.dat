25|$|One type of non-homologous based {{mechanism}} is the non-homologous end joining or micro-homology end joining mechanism. These mechanisms are {{also involved in}} repairing double stranded breaks but require no homology or limited micro-homology. When these strands are repaired, oftentimes there are small deletions or insertions added into the repaired strand. It is possible that retrotransposons are inserted into the genome through this repair system. If retrotransposons are inserted into a non-allelic position on the chromosome, meiotic recombination can drive the insertion to be recombined into the same strand as an already existing copy of the same region. Another {{mechanism is}} the break-fusion-bridge cycle which involves sister chromatids that have both lost its telomeric region due to double stranded breaks. It is proposed that these sister chromatids will fuse together to form one dicentric chromosome, and then segregate into two different nuclei. Because pulling the dicentric chromosome apart causes a double stranded break, the end regions can fuse to other double stranded breaks and repeat the cycle. The fusion of two sister chromatids can cause inverted duplication and when these events are repeated throughout the cycle, the inverted region will be repeated leading {{to an increase in}} copy number. The last mechanism that can lead to copy number variations is polymerase slippage, which is also known as template switching. During normal DNA replication, the polymerase on the lagging strand is required to <b>unclamp</b> and re-clamp the replication region continuously. When small scale repeats in the DNA sequence exist already, the polymerase can be ‘confused’ when it re-clamps to continue replication and instead of clamping to the correct base pairs, it may shift a few base pairs and replicate a portion of the repeated region again. Note that although this has been experimentally observed and is a widely accepted mechanism, the molecular interactions that led to this error remains unknown. In addition, because this type of mechanism requires the polymerase to jump around the DNA strand and {{it is unlikely that the}} polymerase can re-clamp at another locus some kilobases apart, therefore this is more applicable to short repeats such as bi-nucleotide or tri-nucleotide repeats.|$|E

5000|$|A {{radial arm}} drill press {{is a large}} geared head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a radial arm drill press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to <b>unclamp,</b> move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm drill press, but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm drill presses are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. Radial arm drills are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance.

Methods: Five arterial blood samples were taken sequentially in 34 patients from anesthesia induction (IND) until 24 h after arrival at the intensive care unit (ICU). Plasma levels of GDF- 15, follistatin-like 1 (FLST 1), myeloperoxidases (MPO), hydroperoxides and plasma antioxidant status (PAS) were measured at each time-point. Markers of cardiac (cardiac-troponin I, cTnI) and renal dysfunction (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, NGAL) and other classical biological factors and clinical data were measured. Results: Plasma GDF- 15 levels increased gradually during and after surgery, reaching nearly three times the IND levels in the ICU (3, 0756284 ng/L vs. 1, 061690 ng/L, p, 0. 001).

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The causative role of consumptive {{coagulopathy}} in {{the development}} of bleeding complications after supraceliac (SC) aortic cross-clamping (AXC) has been challenged by recent reports that ascribe this coagulopathy to primary fibrinolysis. This theory is {{made on the basis of}} evidence that tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen (Ag) levels increase after SC AXC. However, t-PA Ag levels reflect both active and inactive (bound to serum t-PA inhibitors) forms of serum t-PA, and elevations confirm the presence of fibrinolysis only in conjunction with an increase in t-PA activity. Methods: To investigate the etiology of this coagulopathy, we submitted eight pigs to SC AXC and six pigs to infrarenal (IR) AXC for 30 minutes. Blood was drawn from the portal vein, the hepatic vein, and the carotid artery before AXC, just before <b>unclamping,</b> and 5, 30, and 60 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), fibrinogen (FBG), platelets (PLT), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT), t-PA Ag, t-PA activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 (PAI- 1), and α 2 -antiplasmin (AP) activities were measured. Statistical analysis was performed by using repeated measures analysis of variance and t tests Results: The PT did not differ between the two groups at any point. After <b>unclamping,</b> in the SC group there was a drop in PLT levels (P =. 005), a decrease in FBG levels (P <. 001), and a trend toward PTT prolongation (P =. 06) compared with baseline. In contrast, there were no changes in PTT, PLT levels, or FBG levels in the IR group. TAT, a serum marker of thrombin generation, increased with SC AXC (P =. 04), remained elevated 5 minutes after <b>unclamping</b> (P =. 08), and returned to normal 30 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> In contrast, TAT levels did not change in the IR control group. In the SC AXC group, the TAT levels did not differ between the three test sites at any time. SC AXC was associated with an increase in t-PA Ag just before <b>unclamping</b> (P <. 001) and 5 minutes after <b>unclamping</b> (P =. 002), but IR AXC was not. t-PA activity levels decreased in both experimental groups 30 and 60 minutes after <b>unclamping.</b> Levels of α 2 -AP activity decreased to a similar degree in both groups after <b>unclamping</b> when compared with baseline Conclusion: Thirty minutes of SC AXC results in intravascular thrombosis that cannot be localized to the ischemic visceral circulation. This intravascular thrombosis is associated with consumption of clotting factors. Thirty minutes of SC AXC causes an activation of fibrinolytic pathways that does not result in a hyperfibrinolytic state. An increase in t-PA Ag without a rise in t-PA activity does not represent true fibrinolysis, but rather an increase in the bound, inactive forms of serum t-PA. Both IR and SC AXC result in decreased fibrinolytic activity (“fibrinolytic shutdown”) after release of the aortic clamp.  (J Vasc Surg 2002; 35 : 100 - 8. ...|$|R

We focus on two structures in the Himalayas of central Nepal: the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) and the Main Central Thrust (MCT). We use finite-element modeling to test the influence of various parameters, such as friction coefficients and surface processes, and we investigate how they affect the distribution of deformation between these two faults. We observe that reproduction of the late Quaternary kinematic pattern across the range with our model requires strict conditions on the friction coefficients, such that the MHT is very weak, whereas the MCT is significantly stronger. The most important parameter that controls slip partitioning appears to be the dip angle of the MCT, with a gentler or steeper MCT promoting or inhibiting slip, respectively. We also show that transient loading and unloading through focused glacial erosion in the higher part of the range can <b>unclamp</b> the MCT and allow a significant increase in slip rates. The results of this mechanical sensitivity investigation have important implications for the dynamics of the Himalayan wedge and point toward along-strike structural variations as a first-order control on slip partitioning. ...|$|E

Notably, these two earthquakes had a maximum slip that {{was very close to}} the surface. This contributed to the destructive tsunami that occurred during the Tohoku-Oki event and to the large amount of structural damage caused by the Chi-Chi event. The mechanism that results in such large slip near the surface is poorly understood as shallow parts of thrust faults are considered to be frictionally stable. Here we use earthquake rupture experiments to reveal the existence of a torquing mechanism of thrust fault ruptures near the free surface that causes them to <b>unclamp</b> and slip large distances. Complementary numerical modelling of the experiments confirms that the hanging-wall wedge undergoes pronounced rotation in one direction as the earthquake rupture approaches the free surface, and this torque is released as soon as the rupture breaks the free surface, resulting in the unclamping and violent ‘flapping’ of the hanging-wall wedge. Our results imply that the shallow extent of the seismogenic zone of a subducting interface is not fixed and can extend up to the trench during great earthquakes through a torquing mechanism...|$|E

Methods: Under general anesthesia, we in block recovered the distal esophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, liver, pancreas, spleen, and kidneys from donors and implanted heterotopically in the lower abdomen of recipients. Animals were divided into four groups: I-canine donor, swine recipient (n = 6); II - swine donor, canine recipient (n = 5); III-canine donor, canine recipient (n = 4); and IV-swine donor, swine recipient (n = 5). Groups I and 11 comprised experimental (xenotransplantation) and III and IV control groups (allotransplantation).

Laparo-Endoscopic-Single-Site Surgery (LESS) {{is one of}} the major advances in the evolution of minimally invasive surgery METHODS: A prospective evaluation of patients underwent LESS NSS at our institutions for a solitary, exophytic, enhancing, small (<= 4. 0 cm) renal masses and normal controlateral kidney was done. Peri-operative, pathological, hematological data together with a subjective evaluation of the pain (VAS) and the scars were collected. A comprehensive electronic literature search was conducted in May 2011 using the Medline database to identify oil publications relating to LESS NSS. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were operated by a LESS <b>unclamp</b> NSS and 6 patients by a clamp LESS NSS (mean operative time: 125 min and 137. 4 min; mean blood loss: 207 ml and 113 ml). The mean warm ischemia time in the LESS clamped NSS was 11. 1 +/- 2. 4 min using an early unclamped technique. Neither conversion to open surgery nor transfusions occurred. Three patients required conversion to standard laparoscopy. Postoperatively, we recorded 1 Clavien II (acute gastritis), 1 Clavien II la (urinary fistula after NSS) and 1 Clavien IV (cerebral stroke) complications. Pathology revealed 13 T 1 a clear cell carcinoma, 4 complex renal cysts, 2 oncocytoma and 1 angiomyolipoma (surgical margin positive). With a minimal postoperative pain (VAP: 1. 8 in POD 1) the patients were discharged after 4. 4 days without variation in eGFR. No local or distant progression was detected. Current literature suggest that LESS NSS can safely and effectively be performed in a variety of urologic settings and represent one of the major interests among the LESS procedures. Although, the quality of evidence of all available studies remains low, mostly being small case series or case control studies from selected centers. CONCLUSIONS: LESS NSS in selected renal masses is feasible, provides postoperative outcomes overlapping the standard counterpart and ensures subjective satisfaction.

The spaces consistently observed between the ends of barium columns and hyaline casts in microdissection studies and the great lengths of the hyaline casts suggest that hyaline casts obstruct the flow of tubular fluid. Clonidine treatment resulted in fewer, shorter, and thinner hyaline casts. These results indicate that tubular obstruction by hyaline casts {{plays an important role in}} early postischemic acute renal failure, and that clonidine's beneficial effect is due in part to a reduction in cast formation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the {{cerebral blood flow}} parameters assessed by transcranial Doppler during aortic cross-clamping and <b>unclamping</b> in patients undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy. METHODS: Invasive intraoperative monitoring of mean arterial pressure (MAP) and PaCO 2, and right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) monitoring of blood flow parameters (mean velocity "Vm" and pulsatility index "PI") by transcranial Doppler were performed as well as evaluation of the four parameters during these subsequent periods: pre-cross-clamping, pre-unclamping, <b>unclamping</b> and 1 - 5 - 10 - 20 minutes after abdominal aortic <b>unclamping.</b> RESULTS: No significative changes of MAP, PaCO 2, Vm and PI were noticed during the aortic cross-clamping period (77. 5 +/- 18. 5 SD minutes). During aortic <b>unclamping</b> Vm and MAP decreased (64 +/- 20 vs 52 +/- 20 cm/sec, p < 0. 05, and 101 +/- 8 vs 80 +/- 15 mmHg, p < 0. 01, respectively). At the 1 th post-unclamping minute {{there was an increase}} from pre-unclamping values of Vm (75 +/- 20 cm/sec, p < 0. 05) and PaCO 2 (42 +/- 1. 5 vs 36 +/- 2 mmHg, p < 0. 05), with persistent reduction of MAP (92 +/- mmHg, p < 0. 05), even more evident at the 5 th post-unclamping minute (Vm = 93 +/- 25 cm/sec; PaCO 2 = 46 +/- 1. 2 mmHg, p < 0. 001, and MAP returned to pre-unclamping value), in which there was also a decrease of PI (0. 65 +/- 0. 16 vs 0. 78 +/- 0. 2, p < 0. 05). At the 10 th minute Vm (83 +/- 24 cm/sec, p < 0. 02) and PaCO 2 (41 +/- 1. 5 mmHg, p < 0. 05) increments were present together with persistent reduction of PI (0. 69 +/- 0. 17, p < 0. 05), while at the 20 th post-unclamping minute also Vm, PaCO 2 and PI returned to their pre-unclamping values. CONCLUSIONS: The Vm decrease at aortic <b>unclamping</b> might correlate with the acute changes in MAP (blood steal hypovolemia) and is likely due to an inadequate cerebral autoregulatory response to abrupt MAP changes. The arterial CO 2 increase after aortic <b>unclamping</b> could lead to a dilation of cerebral arterioles and a rise of CBF (increase of Vm and decrease of PI). Transcranial Doppler is a simple and reliable technique for the monitoring of cerebral blood flow parameters and seems to be quite suitable for the recognition and the quantification of changes in these parameters induced by surgical manoeuvres able to produce hemodynamic instability...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} {{our initial}} experience with <b>unclamped</b> laparoscopic hand-assisted partial nephrectomy for predominantly endophytic renal masses {{in the setting}} of relative contraindication to warm ischemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Unclamped laparoscopic hand-assisted partial nephrectomy was performed on eight consecutive patients from June 2009 to March 2010. All patients had predominantly endophytic renal masses with a preferential enhancing rim noted on the pre-operative computed tomography. The <b>unclamped</b> hand-assisted approach was utilized for no warm ischemia, minimal blood loss, and enhanced visualization of the tumor bed with improved operative exposure. RESULTS: Mean age of the participants was 55. 8 years. All patients underwent <b>unclamped</b> hand-assisted partial nephrectomy (ie, zero ischemia). Mean estimated blood loss was 368. 8 cc (range, 100 to 800 cc) and mean operation time was 236. 9 minutes (range, 175 to 272 minutes). There were no intra-operative complications and no open conversions. There was one grade II (ileus with small pneumothorax) and one grade IV (pulmonary embolism) in the 90 -day peri-operative period. There was one positive surgical margin, which was recognized intra-operatively. CONCLUSION: While our results are preliminary, we feel this technique provides superior visualization and adequate hemostasis while preserving oncologic efficacy and renal function in this patient population...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of infrarenal aortic cross-clamping and <b>unclamping</b> on gut mucosal perfusion by gastric tonometry and on sigmoid colonic tissue blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry during abdominal aortic surgery. This was a prospective before-and-after intervention comparison study in a university hospital of 8 male patients, aged 57 - 87, undergoing elective infrarenal abdominal aortic surgery. Each patient was pretreated with ranitidine. Following general anesthesia, a nasogastric tonometer was inserted into the stomach. The balloon of the tonometer was filled with 2. 5 mL of normal saline for gas tension and pH analysis. This process was repeated before and after aortic cross-clamping and <b>unclamping.</b> Gastric mucosal pHi was calculated with the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation from the arterial Hco 3 - and the tonometrically measured mucosal Pco 2. A laser Doppler flow probe was placed in contact with the serosa of the sigmoid colon against the mesentery after the abdomen was opened. Sigmoid colonic tissue blood flow (SCBF) was assessed by the laser Doppler flowmeter. Gastric mucosal pHi by gastric tonometry and colonic tissue blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry were measured before and after aortic cross-clamping and <b>unclamping.</b> Gastric mucosal pHi decreased significantly 30 minutes after aortic cross-clampin...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAll {{coefficients}} of the <b>unclamped</b> and clamped electro-optic tensor of zirconium-doped congruent LiNbO 3 single crystals are determined as {{function of the}} dopant concentration at room temperature. With a distribution coefficient of zirconium closer to one in the considered range, the dopant concentration is in the range up to 2. 5 mol% of ZrO 2. The electro-optic coefficients are measured by direct techniques based on interferometric and Sénarmont optical arrangements at the wavelength of 633 nm. It is found that all the <b>unclamped</b> and clamped effective electro-optic coefficients are relatively constant, except for the sample grown with 2 mol% of zirconium. The electro-optic behavior of LN:Zr as function of the dopant concentration was confirmed by dielectric characterizations. The concentration equal 2 mol% of ZrO 2 can be considered to a threshold concentration for various physical and optical properties...|$|R
40|$|Background. S-(þ) -ketamine {{anaesthesia}} carries {{potential benefits}} for the cardiovascularly compromised patient. However, the use of S-(þ) -ketamine in ischaemic {{coronary artery disease is}} controversial. In a prospective, randomized, clinical trial, we have investigated whether an S-(þ) -ketamine-based anaesthetic protocol leads to increased cardiac troponin T levels (cTnT) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods. Two hundred and nine patients undergoing elective CABG were randomized to receive either i. v. anaesthesia with sufentanil–midazolam–propofol (SMP; n 108) or S-(þ) -ketamine– midazolam–propofol (KMP; n 101). Haemodynamic variables were maintained within the normal range. Invasive haemodynamic monitoring was performed using a pulmonary artery catheter. Plasma cTnT levels were sampled before induction and 1, 6, and 24 h after aortic <b>unclamping.</b> Cardiovascular adverse events, such as electrocardiographic signs of ischaemia, perioperative myocardial infarction, and death, were recorded. Results. Patient characteristics, cardiac profile, intraoperative management, and the incidence of cardiovascular adverse events were comparable between the groups. Plasma cTnT levels increased after operation in both groups. cTnT levels were significantly lower in the KMP group 6 h after aortic <b>unclamping</b> compared with the SMP group (P 0. 004), but did not differ 24 h after aortic <b>unclamping</b> [median (range) : SMP 0. 4 (0. 01 – 3. 9) vs KMP 0. 4 (0. 07 – 6. 6) mg litre 21, P 0. 338]. Conclusions. S-(þ) -ketamine does not accentuate postoperative cTNTrises in haemodynamically stable elective CABG patients...|$|R
