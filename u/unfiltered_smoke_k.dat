Because oxidative stress may mediate some of these effects, {{this study was designed to}} test the hypothesis that cannabinoids in MJ smoke contribute to cellular oxidative stress. Oxidative stress was evaluated in an endothelial cell line (ECV 304) following exposure to smoke produced from MJ cigarettes containing either 0, 1. 77, or 3. 95 % � 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (� 9 -THC). Brief exposure to smoke from 3. 95 % MJ cigarettes stimulated the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by 80 % over control levels and lowered intracellular glutathione levels by 81 %. Smoke-induced ROS generation increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, exposure to smoke from MJ containing 0 % � 9 -THC produced no increase in ROS despite a 70 % decline in glutathione levels. Smoke from MJ containing 1. 77 % � 9 -THC stimulated intermediate levels of ROS. A brief, 30 -min exposure to MJ smoke, regardless of the � 9 -THC content, also induced necrotic cell death that increased steadily up to 48 h of observation.

40|$|Cigarette {{smoking is}} {{associated}} with significant increases {{in the number of}} pulmonary mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils. A potent chemoattractant for these cells is C 5 a, a peptide generated during complement (C) activation. We, therefore, investigated the possibility that cigarette smoke could activate the complement system in vitro. Our results show that factor(s) (mol wt less than 1, 000) present in an aqueous solution of whole, <b>unfiltered</b> cigarette <b>smoke</b> can deplete the hemolytic capacity of whole human serum in a dose-dependent manner. The particle-free, filtered gas phase of cigarette smoke is inactive. The smoke factor(s) do not activate serum C 1, but do deplete serum C 4 activity. Treatment of purified human C 3 with whole smoke solution modifies the molecule such that its subsequent addition to serum (containing Mg/EGTA to block the classical pathway) results in consumption of hemolytic complement by activation of the alternative pathway. Smoke-modified C 3 shows increased anodal migration in agarose electrophoresis, but this is not due to proteolytic cleavage of the molecule as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In contrast to methylamine-treated C 3, C 3 treated with smoke is only partially susceptible to the action of the complement regulatory proteins Factors H and I. In addition, smoke-modified C 3 has diminished binding to Factor H as compared with methylamine-treated C 3. Finally, smoke-modified C 3 incorporates [14 C]methylamine which suggests that the thiolester bond may be intact. These data indicate that aqueous whole cigarette smoke solution can modify C 3 and activate the alternative pathway of complement, perhaps by a previously unrecognized mechanism. Should this occur in vivo, complement activation might partly account for the extensive pulmonary leukocyte recruitment observed in smokers...|$|R

This album is often considered as the start of the subgenre frenchcore, leading to a huge attraction for the hardcore in France, matching with a high media appearance of the free party phenomenon.|$|R
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} persistent airflow limitation and lung inflammation resulting in a progressive decline in lung function whose principle cause is cigarette <b>smoke.</b> MAP 3 <b>K</b> 19 is a novel kinase expressed predominantly by alveolar and interstitial macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells in the lung. We found that MAP 3 K 19 mRNA was overexpressed in a limited sampling of lung tissue from COPD patients, and a closer examination {{found it to be}} overexpressed in bronchoalveolar macrophages from COPD patients, as well as the bronchial epithelium and inflammatory cells in the lamina propria. We further found MAP 3 K 19 to be induced in various cell lines upon environmental stress, such as cigarette smoke, oxidative and osmotic stress. Exogenous expression of MAP 3 K 19 in cells caused an upregulation of transcriptionally active NF-κB, and secretion of the chemokines CXCL- 8, CCL- 20 and CCL- 7. Inhibition of MAP 3 K 19 activity by siRNA or small molecular weight inhibitors caused a decrease in cigarette smoke-induced inflammation in various murine models, which included a decrease in pulmonary neutrophilia and KC levels. In a chronic cigarette smoke model, inhibition of MAP 3 K 19 significantly attenuated emphysematous changes in airway parenchyma. Finally, in a viral exacerbation model, mice exposed to cigarette smoke and influenza A virus showed a decrease in pulmonary neutrophilia, pro-inflammatory cytokines and viral load upon inhibition of MAP 3 K 19. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of MAP 3 K 19 may represent a novel strategy to target COPD that promises to have a potential therapeutic benefit for patients...|$|R
