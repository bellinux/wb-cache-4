Given {{the large number of}} studies that have used uniaxial or triaxial devices, it is of interest to know whether the different devices give similar information about PA levels and patterns. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare physical activity (PA) levels and patterns obtained simultaneously by triaxial accelerometry and uniaxial accelerometry in adolescents in free-living conditions. Methods Sixty-two participants, aged 13 - 16 years, were recruited in this ancillary study, which is a part of the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence (HELENA). All participants wore a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> (ActiGraph GT 1 M ®, Pensacola, FL) and a triaxial accelerometer (RT 3 ®, Stayhealthy, Monrovia, CA) simultaneously for 7 days. The patterns were calculated by converting accelerometer data output as a percentage of time spent at sedentary, light, moderate, and vigorous PA per day. Analysis of output data from the two accelerometers were assessed by two different tests: Equivalence Test and Bland & Altman method. Results The concordance correlation coefficient between the data from the triaxial accelerometer and <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> at each intensity level was superior to 0. 95. The ANOVA test showed a significant difference for the first three lower intensities while no significant difference was found for vigorous intensity.

PURPOSE: To assess whether biomechanical and/or device limitations cause this phenomenon and the feasibility of generating oxygen uptake (. VO 2) prediction equations from the combined use of accelerometry and heart rate during walking and running. METHODS: Sixteen endurance-trained subjects completed two exercise tests on a treadmill. The first was a continuous incremental test to volitional exhaustion to determine ventilatory threshold and peak. VO 2. The second was a discontinuous incremental exercise test while walking (3, 5, and 7 km. h(- 1)) and running (8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20 km. h(- 1), or until volitional exhaustion). Subjects completed 3 min of exercise at each speed, followed by 3 - 5 min of recovery. Activity counts from uni- and triaxial accelerometers, heart rate, and gas exchange were measured throughout exercise. RESULTS: All accelerometer outputs rose linearly with speed during walking. During running, <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> outputs plateaued, whereas triaxial output rose linearly with speed {{up to and including}} 20 km. h(- 1). Prediction of. VO 2 during walking and running using heart rate (R 2 = 0. 42 and 0. 59, respectively), accelerometer counts (R 2 = 0. 48 - 0. 83 and 0. 76, respectively), the combined methodologies (R 2 = 0. 54 - 0. 85 and 0. 80, respectively), and the combined methodologies calibrated with individual data (R 2 = 0. 99 - 1. 00 and 0. 99, respectively) was completed by linear regression.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the accuracy of a new <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> for assessing TEE and physical-activity-related energy expenditure (PAEE) over a 24 h period in a respiratory chamber, and to establish activity levels based on the accelerometry ranges corresponding to the operationally defined metabolic equivalent (MET) categories. In study 1, measurement of the 24 h energy expenditure of seventy-nine Japanese subjects (40 (SD 12) years old) was performed in a large respiratory chamber. During the measurements, the subjects wore a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> (Lifecorder; Suzuken Co. Ltd, Nagoya, Japan) on their belt. Two moderate walking exercises of 30 min each were performed on a horizontal treadmill. In study 2, ten male subjects walked at six different speeds and ran at three different speeds on a treadmill for 4 min, with the same accelerometer. O 2 consumption was measured during the last minute of each stage and was expressed in MET. The measured TEE was 8447 (SD 1337) kJ/d. The accelerometer significantly underestimated TEE and PAEE (91 · 9 (SD 5 · 4) and 92 · 7 (SD 17 · 8) % chamber value respectively); however, there was a significant correlation between the two values (r 0 · 928 and 0 · 564 respectively; P< 0 · 001). There was a strong correlation between the activity levels and the measured MET while walking (r 2 0 · 93; P< 0 · 001). Although TEE and PAEE were systematically underestimated during the 24 h period, the accelerometer assessed energy expenditure well during both the exercise period and the non-structured activities.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The study {{objective}} was to quantify the association between daily physical activity measured by accelerometer and 1 -year changes in symptoms among people with knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: Participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative had knee radiographs and physical activity assessed using GT 1 M ActiGraph (Pensacola, FL) <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometers</b> at the 48 -month visit. Physical activity was calculated and categorized as tertiles of average daily minutes in light and moderate-to-vigorous activity. Outcomes were 1 -year change in symptoms measured by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities scales, including pain, stiffness, and physical function. Adjusted multivariable linear models estimated the relationship between tertiles of light or moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and changes in knee symptoms. RESULTS: Among 1059 participants (55 % were women; mean age, 66 +/- 9 years), greater time in light activity {{was associated with a}} trend toward declined physical function (P =. 01). Greater time in daily moderate-to-vigorous activity also was associated with declined physical function (P =. 01) and increased pain (P =. 08).

Focusing on a commercial off-the-shelf <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> subject to drops, results of the three-scale approach show that the micro-cracking leading to failure is confined inside a rather narrow region close to the anchor points. Outcomes of the two-scale approach correctly match this evidence, provided an appropriately defined failure criterion for the anisotropic polysilicon film is adopted. Moreover, the time to failure predicted by the two approaches well agree. Therefore, while the three-scale approach furnishes much insights on the failure mode, the overall response of the sensor appears to be correctly (from an industrial perspective) estimated by the far simpler and more economic two-scale simulations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{three-dimensional}} movement profile of the blade during a stationary slap shot, as a function of blade construction properties and player skill level. A total of fifteen subjects participated in this study; eight were classified as elite and the remaining seven were recreational. Performances were evaluated by simultaneously recording the movements of the stick's lower shaft and blade with high-speed video (1000 Hz), the time and duration of stick-ground contact with two uniaxial forceplates, and time of blade-puck contact with a <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometer</b> mounted within the puck. Data were analyzed with a two-way ANOVA for several dependent variables, including: linear kinematics, temporal phase data, and global angles. The results indicated that elite shooters tended to alter timing parameters (i. e. phase length), magnitude of linear variables (i. e. displacement, etc.), and the overall blade orientation to achieve a higher velocity slap shot. These analyses helped to identify a unique rocker phase within the execution of the slap shot in both groups. Further studies are needed to discern the precise role and function of the rocker phase, in order to advance the cause of hockey stick, specifically blade design and development...|$|E
40|$|Background: Objectively {{quantifying}} {{the motor}} symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) {{is a prerequisite}} for determining disease progression and the effects of any treatment. Our research has combined clinical rating scales and movement recording technologies to develop reliable clinical and scientifically valid measures to quantify limb tremor and postural stability. Method: The relation between resting tremor, postural tremor and postural sway was examined in 10 elderly and 8 PD subjects (on and off medication) who completed a unilateral and bilateral pointing task while standing on a force platform. Tremor was recorded from the hand and index finger segments of each arm using <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometers.</b> All PD subjects were assessed using the UPDRS by direct examination and via video examination. Results: Elderly subjects were able to dissociate the low frequency, high amplitude oscillations of whole body motion from tremor in the upper limb. Their frequency profile was characterized by a single peak between 0 - 1 Hz for postural sway and between 8 - 12 Hz for upper limb tremor. In contrast, upper limb tremor for PD subjects was between 5 - 8 Hz and there was high coherence between upper limb tremor and postural sway which increased with tremor severity. PD subjects also exhibited increased coupling between the hand and finger of a single limb and between A/P and M/L sway. These measures are being correlated with standard UPDRS assessments of limb tremor and postural stability. Conclusion: These objective measures in combination with video examination protocols will produce a systematic and objective instrument for research purposes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Altered {{postural}} {{and resting}} tremor dynamics and increased postural instability {{are just two}} characteristics associated with Parkinson’s disease. This study examined the effect postural position (sitting or standing) had on the resting and postural tremor responses of young, older and PD individuals. Any alteration in the tremor output of these groups under differing postural conditions may provide further insight as to what effect posture and Parkinson’s disease has on physiological tremor. Method: The effect of postural position on resting and postural tremor was examined in 12 young, 8 elderly and 8 PD subjects (on and off medication) who completed a unilateral pointing task. Tremor was recorded from the hand and index finger segments of each arm using <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometers.</b> Results: The postural position adopted {{had a significant effect}} on both the resting and postural tremor dynamics, but only for the elderly and PD subjects. When the PD and elderly subjects performed the task while standing, the amplitude of their tremor responses significantly increased. In contrast, no differences in tremor were seen for young subjects when they performed the task when sitting or standing. Conclusion: The increases seen in tremor dynamics when PD and elderly subjects adopted a standing position indicates that these oscillations are not wholly determined by the state of disease or the normal ageing process. Rather, the changes also reflect the fact that tremor is a highly variable feature of the motor system that can be altered {{by the nature of the}} task being performed...|$|R
40|$|The {{automobile}} seat is {{an important}} and unique device in the automobile system, which directly contacts the human body. The dynamic characteristics of the automobile seat are the key parameters for its vibration security and dynamic performance. Both experiments and finite element simulations are conducted to analyse the fore-and-aft operating modes of {{a new type of}} automobile seat system in this paper. The results and their correlation analysis between the experimental data and the computational models are given. By using finite element simulations, the computational results of the modes with the first 12 orders for the automobile seat are in the range 0 - 100 Hz, including the integral modes and the local modes of the automobile seat. An experimental method was designed to measure the seat frame mode using an impact hammer, a triaxial <b>accelerometer,</b> <b>uniaxial</b> <b>accelerometers</b> and a 24 -channel LMS vibration test system. The experimental data were analysed by estimating the frequency response function and the modal parameters and validated using LMS Test. Lab software. The experimental results for five integral modal parameters of the automobile seat between 0 Hz and 100 Hz are given. The orthogonal experimental method is used to design nine different working states of the automobile seat with variations in the positions of different adjustable devices (the headrest, the height adjuster, the recliner and the track slide). Finally, the influences of the above-mentioned adjustable devices on the fore-and-aft operating mode are analysed by the single-factor analysis method using finite element simulations...|$|R
