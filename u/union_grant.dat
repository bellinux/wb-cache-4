500|$|Control of the Mississippi River {{was the key}} {{to victory}} in the Western theater. Believing Grant was a general of [...] "dogged persistence" [...] and [...] "iron will", Major General John C. Frémont {{assigned}} Grant to command troops on the Mississippi at Cairo, Illinois at the end of August (passing over generals John Pope and Benjamin Prentiss). Frémont dismissed rumors of Grant's drunkenness years earlier in the regular army, saying there was something about Grant's manner [...] "that was sufficient to counteract the influence of what they said." [...] Cairo was a bustling Union military and naval base that was to be used to launch a joint campaign down the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers. After the Confederates moved into western Kentucky, with designs on Southern Illinois, Grant, under Frémont's authority, advanced on Paducah, Kentucky, taking it without a fight, and set up a supply station. Having understood the importance to Lincoln in keeping Kentucky in the <b>Union,</b> <b>Grant</b> assured its citizens, [...] "I have come among you not as your enemy, but as your friend." [...] On November 1, Frémont ordered Grant to [...] "make demonstrations" [...] against the Confederates {{on both sides of the}} Mississippi, but prohibited him from attacking the enemy.|$|E

[...] The collapse of Stalinism was, Taaffe counters, [...] "the end of an epoch", which led to capitalist triumphalism.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Wilderness {{battle was}} costly for the <b>Union,</b> <b>Grant</b> {{decided to move}} south and {{continue}} the fight with Lee. [...] As the Army of the Potomac moved southward from the Wilderness, Grant, on May 8, was forced into yet an even more desperate 14-day battle at Spotsylvania. Anticipating Grant's right flank move, Lee was able to position his army at Spotsylvania Court House before Grant and his army could arrive. The battle started on May 10. [...] Although Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was located in an exposed rough arc known as the [...] "Mule Shoe", his army resisted multiple assaults from Grant's Army of the Potomac {{for the first six}} days of the battle.

Rifles refused to fire due to the troops gunpowder getting wet from rainy weather and they were forced into a bloody hand-to-hand struggle similar to battles fought in ancient times.

[...] By May 21, the fighting had finally stopped; Grant had lost 18,000 men with 3,000 having been killed in the prolonged battle. [...] Many talented Confederate officers were killed in the battle with Lee's Army significantly damaged having a total of 10–13,000 casualties. [...] The popular Union Maj. Gen.
