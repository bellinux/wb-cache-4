5|$|Out of 122Croatia's {{universities}} {{and other institutions}} of higher education, Slavonia is home to one university—Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek— as well as three polytechnics in Požega, Slavonski Brod and Vukovar, {{as well as a}} college in Virovitica—all set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> by the government. The University of Osijek, has been established in 1975, but the first institution of higher education in the city was Studium Philosophicum Essekini founded in 1707, and active until 1780. Another historical institution of higher education was Academia Posegana operating in Požega between 1761 and 1776, as an extension of a gymnasium operating in the city continuously, since it opened in 1699 as the first secondary education school in Slavonia.|$|E

Its name refers to the development code name for the GameCube.|$|E

25|$|The {{game was}} opened, as now, by a kick-off. The player of 1880 might, if he chose, drive the ball {{far down the}} field. Or, {{technically}} kicking the ball by merely touching it with his toe, he might pick it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> with it. Players when tackled invariably endeavored to pass the ball back to another member of their side for a further advance, a method of play so highly developed {{that it was not}} infrequent to see a ball passed as many as five times during a single play.|$|E

The BDO refused to allow the new {{organisation}} to set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> their own tournaments, so the WDC players decided that they would no longer compete in the BDO World Championship. They founded the WDC World Darts Championship as an alternative. In the first WDC World Championship in 1994, Taylor lost to Priestley. However, Taylor would go on to dominate the event for the following decade and beyond.|$|E

25|$|Bucs quarterback Trent Dilfer's 23-yard {{completion}} to Karl Williams {{on third}} down and 1 {{set up the}} first score of the game, Michael Husted's 22-yard field goal with 5:25 {{left in the first}} quarter. The Lions received a huge scoring opportunity when Williams fumbled a punt {{at the end of the}} next drive. Lions linebacker Matt Russell got to the ball first, but instead of falling on the ball, he tried to pick it <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> with it. Instead of grabbing the ball, he accidentally batted it out of bounds, allowing the Bucs to keep possession on the Lions 11-yard line. Taking full advantage of their second chance, Tampa Bay subsequently drove 89 yards in 17 plays, taking 8:50 off the clock and converting three third downs, one from a 12-men on the field penalty against Detroit. Dilfer finished the drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Horace Copeland that put the team up 10-0. Later on, Buccaneers cornerback Anthony Parker intercepted a pass from Mitchell and returned it 19 yards to the Lions 20-yard line, setting up Husted's 43-yard field goal that gave the team a 13-0 lead at the end of the half. Tampa Bay had a chance to increase their lead even more before halftime with a drive to the Lions 43, but Ron Rice intercepted a pass from Dilfer on the last play of the second quarter.|$|E

500|$|Animals {{that live}} in groups often give alarm calls that give warning of an attack. For example, vervet monkeys give {{different}} calls depending {{on the nature of}} the attack: for an eagle, a disyllabic cough; for a leopard or other cat, a loud bark; for a python or other snake, a [...] "chutter". The monkeys hearing these calls respond defensively, but differently in each case: to the eagle call, they look <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> into cover; to the leopard call, they run up into the trees; to the snake call, they stand on two legs and look around for snakes, and on seeing the snake, they sometimes mob it. Similar calls are found in other species of monkey, while birds also give different calls that elicit different responses.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the paper's short {{articles}} were sometimes picked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> by The New York Times {{with a credit}} [...] "From The American Israelite". [...] In those years, The American Israelite became known for its very strong stance against the new Zionism movement, calling it in 1902 a [...] "pernicious agitation" [...] that would undermine the acceptance of Jews in the countries where they currently resided. [...] Rabbi David Philipson was among the editorial contributors to the paper who used it to oppose Zionism, arguing that Judaism was a religion exclusively, and thus stateless. [...] Other noted contributors to the paper in this era included Rabbi Moses Mielziner and Jewish history scholar Gotthard Deutsch, {{as well as other}} prominent rabbis and Jewish thinkers within the country. [...] The paper gave extensive coverage to the goings-on of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Hebrew Union College (and was sometimes viewed as a publication of them), as well as notices of various rabbinical conferences.|$|E

[...] She continued her exploration of Mediterranean food {{and the use of}} fresh, local ingredients in Greece in 1940. [...] When the Germans invaded Greece in April 1941, she fled to Egypt. [...] There, she and her employer engaged a Greek cook who, she wrote, produced magnificent food: [...] "The flavour of that octopus stew, the rich wine dark sauce and the aroma of mountain herbs was something not easily forgotten."

She was quickly rescued from temporary refugee accommodation, having met an old English friend who had an [...] "absurdly grandiose" [...] flat in the city and invited her to keep house for him. She and Cowan amicably went their separate ways, and she moved into the grand flat. She engaged a cook, Kyriacou, a Greek refugee, whose eccentricities (sketched in a chapter of Is There a Nutmeg in the House?) did not prevent him from producing magnificent food: [...] "The flavour of that octopus stew, the rich wine dark sauce and the aroma of mountain herbs was something not easily forgotten."

500|$|Revolution Software's {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game [...] was first released in 1996. While investigating a murder, protagonist and player character George Stobbart finds himself uncovering a dark mystery regarding the Knights Templar. A medieval manuscript which he obtained {{during the investigation}} leads him to a castle located in Lochmarne, Ireland. As he cannot enter the castle through the main entrance door, he climbs a haystack, which stops short {{of the top of}} the wall. He puts a sewer key which he obtained {{at the beginning of the}} game in a crack in the wall, which forms a step, allowing him to climb over the wall. Inside the castle, an entrance to an underground dig is located. A tied-up goat is sitting near the entrance; however, the rope to which it is tied is long enough to allow it to prevent George from reaching the entrance by butting him. An old piece of farming machinery is located at the left side of the screen, but George is unable to interact with it, as the goat continues to butt him. George must allow the goat to butt him when trying to reach the entrance, but while the goat is returning to its original position, the player must click on the farming machinery, which causes George to quickly jump <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>run</b> to the machinery and slightly reposition it. When returned to its original position, the goat again charges and butts George, but while doing so, gets its rope entangled with the machinery, due to its repositioning. This allows George to move freely and enter the dig.|$|E
