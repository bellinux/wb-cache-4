Francis William Aston had <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> partially separate isotopes of neon in 1931, and Gustav Ludwig Hertz had improved on the method to almost completely separate neon by running it through a series of stages. In the United States, William D. Harkins had <b>used</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> separate chlorine. Kistiakowsky was familiar with the work of Charles G.

5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied.
