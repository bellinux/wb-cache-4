2500|$|Francis Tumblety (c. 1833–1903) {{earned a}} small fortune posing as an [...] "Indian Herb" [...] doctor {{throughout}} the United States and Canada, and was commonly perceived as a misogynist and a quack.

In 1865, he was arrested for alleged complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but no connection was found and he was released without being charged. Tumblety was in England in 1888, and was arrested on 7 November, apparently for engaging in homosexuality, which was illegal at the time. It was reported by some of his friends that he showed off a collection of [...] "matrices" [...] (wombs) from [...] "every class of woman" [...] at around this time. Awaiting trial, he fled to France and then to the United States. Already notorious in the States for his self-promotion and previous criminal charges, his arrest was reported as connected to the Ripper murders. American reports that Scotland Yard tried to extradite him were not confirmed by the British press or the London police, and the New York City Police said, [...] "there is no proof of his complicity in the Whitechapel murders, and the crime for which he is <b>under</b> <b>bond</b> in London is not extraditable".

60|$|I {{have just}} remembered an {{incident}} that I really must not let pass. You have heard {{a great deal more}} than you wanted about our political prisoners. Well, one day, about a fortnight ago, the last of them was set free - Old Poe, whom I think I must have mentioned to you, the father-in-law of my cook, was one that I had {{had a great deal of}} trouble with. I had taken the doctor to see him, got him out on sick leave, and when he was put back again gave bail for him. I must not forget that my wife ran away with him out of the prison on the doctor's orders and with the complicity of our friend the gaoler, who really and truly got the sack for the exploit. As soon as he was finally liberated, Poe called a meeting of his fellow- prisoners. All Sunday they were debating what they were to do, and on Monday morning I got an obscure hint from Talolo that I must expect visitors during the day who were coming to consult me. These consultations I am now very well used to, and seeing first, that I generally don't know what to advise, and second that they sometimes don't take my advice - though in some notable cases they have taken it, generally to my own wonder with pretty good results - I am not very fond of these calls. They minister to a sense of dignity, but not peace of mind, and consume interminable time always in the morning too, when I can't afford it. However, this was to be a new sort of consultation. Up came Poe and some eight other chiefs, squatted in a big circle around the old dining-room floor, now the smoking-room. And the family, being represented by Lloyd, Graham, Belle, Austin and myself, proceeded to exchange the necessary courtesies. Then their talking man began. He said that they had been in prison, that I had always taken an interest in them, that they had now been set at liberty without condition, whereas some of the other chiefs who had been liberated before them were still <b>under</b> <b>bond</b> to work upon the roads, and that this had set them considering what they might do to testify their gratitude. They had therefore agreed to work upon my road as a free gift. They went on to explain that it was only to be on my road, on the branch that joins my house with the public way.|$|E

6000|$|Pinkerton's {{parents were}} from the Old Country; there, too, I {{incidentally}} gathered, he had himself been born, {{though it was a}} circumstance he seemed prone to forget. Whether he had run away, or his father had turned him out, I never fathomed; but about the age of twelve he was thrown upon his own resources. A travelling tin-type photographer picked him up, like a haw out of a hedgerow, on a wayside in New Jersey; took a fancy to the urchin; carried him on with him in his wandering life; taught him all he knew himself--to take tin-types (as well as I can make out) and doubt the Scriptures; and died at last in Ohio at the corner of a road. [...] "He was a grand specimen," [...] cried Pinkerton; [...] "I wish you could have seen him, Mr. Dodd. He had an appearance of magnanimity that used to remind me of the patriarchs." [...] On the death of this random protector, the boy inherited the plant and continued the business. [...] "It was a life I could have chosen, Mr. Dodd!" [...] he cried. [...] "I have been in all the finest scenes of that magnificent continent that we were born to be the heirs of. I wish you could see my collection of tin-types; I wish I had them here. They were taken for my own pleasure, and to be a memento: and they show Nature in her grandest as well as her gentlest moments." [...] As he tramped the Western States and Territories, taking tin-types, the boy was continually getting hold of books, good, bad, and indifferent, popular and abstruse, from the novels of Sylvanus Cobb to Euclid's Elements, both of which I found (to my almost equal wonder) he had managed to peruse: he was taking stock by the way, of the people, the products, and the country, with an eye unusually observant and a memory unusually retentive; and he was collecting for himself a body of magnanimous and semi-intellectual nonsense, which he supposed to be the natural thoughts and to contain the whole duty of the born American. To be pure-minded, to be patriotic, to get culture and money with both hands and with the same irrational fervour--these appeared to be the chief articles of his creed. In later days (not of course upon this first occasion) I would sometimes ask him why; and he had his answer pat. [...] "To build up the type!" [...] he would cry. [...] "We're all committed to that; we're all <b>under</b> <b>bond</b> to fulfil the American Type! Loudon, the hope of the world is there.
