40|$|The neural cell {{adhesion}} molecule, NCAM, is ubiquitously expressed within the CNS and has roles in development, cognition, neural plasticity and {{regulation of the}} immune system. NCAM is thus potentially an important pharmacological target for treatment of brain diseases. A {{cell adhesion}} mimetic FGL, a 15 amino-acid peptide derived from the second fibronectin type-III module of NCAM, {{has been shown to}} act as a neuroprotective agent in experimental disease and ageing models, restoring hippocampal/cognitive function and markedly alleviating deleterious changes in the CNS. However, the effects of FGL on the hippocampus of young healthy rats are unknown. The present study has examined the cellular neurobiological consequences of subcutaneous injections of FGL, on hippocampal cell morphometry in young (4 month-old) rats. We determined the effects of FGL on hippocampal volume, pyramidal neuron number/density (using <b>unbiased</b> quantitative <b>stereology),</b> and examined aspects of neurogenesis (using 2 D morphometric analyses). FGL treatment reduced total volume of the dorsal hippocampus (associated with a decrease in total pyramidal neuron numbers in CA 1 and CA 3), and elevated the number of doublecortin immunolabeled neurons in the dentate gyrus, indicating a likely influence on neurogenesis in young healthy rats. These data indicate that FGL has a specific age dependent effect on the hippocampus, differing according to the development and maturity of the CNS...|$|R

Adult male Orx Wistar rats, 2 weeks post operation, received estradiol dipropionate (E) or testosterone propionate (T) for 3 weeks. Both controls, sham-operated (So) and Orx rats, were injected with solvent, in the same regime. Changes in the volume of pars distalis, the volumes of individual FSH- and LH-labeled cells, their numerical density and number were determined by <b>unbiased</b> design-based <b>stereology.</b> The FSH and LH intracellular content was estimated by relative intensity of fluorescence (RIF). We observed that Orx caused hyperstimulation of gonadotropic cells. Their volume, volume density, number, numerical density and intracellular hormone content significantly increased in comparison to So controls. Compared to Orx controls, T caused a significant decrease in the volume and volume density of gonadotropic cells and immunoreactive FSH and LH formations in their cytoplasm. The volume of the pars distalis, the numerical density and number of gonadotropic cells were not changed as compared to Orx controls. Estradiol treatment caused a significant increase in the volume of the pars distalis, decreases in cell volume, volume and numerical density of gonadotropic cells, and FSH and LH intracellular content in comparison to Orx controls. The number of FSH-labeled cells increased. In conclusion, both T and E reversed all of the examined parameters of gonadotropic cells of Orx rats to the level of So controls, except in number.

Histomorphometric measurements are usually performed on two-dimensional sections, causing biased results when they are wrongly extrapolated to 3 D without any knowledge of <b>stereology.</b> <b>Unbiased</b> results can only be obtained using stereological principles. The aim {{of the study was}} to describe an unbiased design for evaluating boneto-mplant contact (BIC) and peri-implant bone density (BD-i) in three-dimensions. The unbiased design was based on a fixed axis vertical random sampling technique. Three bone-implant blocks were collected from 3 rabbits. Four sections were obtained from each animal using a fixed axis vertical random sampling technique. The BIC was estimated by creating a stereological method based on a systematic test line set. The BD-i was estimated using a design based on a systematic point set. The efficiency of the systematic sampling was evaluated for each sampling level: Coefficient of error CE(i w) for the systematic test line set, CESyst between the 4 rotated sections, CENoise for the reproducibility. These variances were compared to the biological variation (CV) between animals. The mean CE(i w) was 5 to 6 %; the CESyst was 7. 8 % for the BIC estimates and 5. 7 % for the BD-i estimates; the CENoise was 5. 8 % for the BIC and 7. 7 % for the BD-i. The CV was 19 % for the BIC estimates and 24 % for the BD-i estimates.

Understanding the cellular and molecular changes accompanying hormone-induced spermatogenesis in hpg mice requires detailed morphological {{analyses of the}} germ cells and Sertoli cells in the untreated hpg testis. We compared seminiferous epithelial cytology in adult hpg, immature and adult wild-type mice using <b>unbiased</b> optical disector-based <b>stereology,</b> immunolocalization of Sertoli cell microtubules (MT), espin (a component of the blood–testis barrier), markers of Sertoli cell maturity (p 27 kip 1 and WT- 1), and electron microscopy. Hpg testes had marked reductions in weight, seminiferous cord volume and length, and severe spermatogenic impairment with germ cells per testis < 1 % of adult wild-type testes. Sertoli cell nuclei expressed WT- 1 in hpg testes, but often were centrally located, similar to 9 – 14 -day-old wild-type testes, and they expressed p 27 kip 1, indicating that hpg Sertoli cells were post-mitotic. Hpg testes had significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced Sertoli cells per testis (0. 56 million) compared with 10 -day wild-type (1. 15 million) and adult wild-type testes (2. 06 million). Immunofluorescence labelling of normal adult Sertoli cells showed supranuclear MT columns and basally located espin, but these features were absent in 10 -day-old and hpg Sertoli cells. Hpg Sertoli cells showed pleomorphic nuclear ultrastructure with mature-type nucleoli, similar to normal adult-type Sertoli cells, but hpg Sertoli cells exhibited incomplete tight junctions that lacked ectoplasmic specializations. We conclude that in hpg mice, chronic gonadotrophin insufficiency restrains Sertoli cell proliferation and maturation, forming pseudo-adult-type Sertoli cells that are incapable of supporting germ cell proliferation and maturation...|$|R

To understand these associations in DLB we used pathological and biochemical analysis of the primary visual cortex to identify changes that could underpin RCVH. Alpha-synuclein or neurofibrillary tangle pathology in primary visual cortex was essentially absent. Neurone density or volume within the primary visual cortex in DLB was also unchanged using <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology.</b> Microarray analysis, however, demonstrated changes in neuropeptide gene expression and other markers, indicating altered GABAergic neuronal function.

Alterations in hypothalamic catecholamines have been suggested as the mechanistic basis of the toxicity of ATR to hormonal systems in females and the reproductive tract in males. Because multiple catecholamine systems {{are present in the}} brain, however, ATR could have far broader effects than are currently understood. Catecholaminergic systems such as the two major long-length dopaminergic tracts of the central nervous system play key roles in mediating a wide array of critical behavioral functions. In this study we examined the hypothesis that ATR would adversely affect these brain dopaminergic systems. Male rats chronically exposed to 5 or 10 mg/kg ATR in the diet for 6 months exhibited persistent hyperactivity and altered behavioral responsivity to amphetamine. Moreover, when measured 2 weeks after the end of exposure, the levels of various monoamines and the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH +) and-negative (TH –) cells measured using <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology</b> were reduced in both dopaminergic tracts.

The illness features a characteristic pattern of early injury to anterior cingulate and frontoinsular cortex. These regions, though often considered ancient in phylogeny, are the exclusive homes to the von Economo neuron (VEN), a large bipolar projection neuron found only in great apes and humans. Despite progress toward understanding the genetic and mo-lecular bases of FTD, no class of selectively vulnerable neurons has been identified. Methods: Using <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology,</b> we quantified anterior cingulate VENs and neighboring Layer 5 neurons in FTD (n 7), Alzheimer’s disease (n 5), and age-matched nonneurological control subjects (n 7). Neuronal morphology and immuno-histochemical staining patterns provided further information about VEN susceptibility. Results: FTD was associated with early, severe, and selective VEN losses, including a 74 % reduction in VENs per section compared with control subjects. VEN dropout was not attributable to general neuronal loss and was seen across FTD patho-logical subtypes. Surviving VENs were often dysmorphic, with pathological tau protein accumulation in Pick’s disease. In contrast, patients with Alzheimer’s disease showed normal VEN counts and morphology despite extensive local neurofibrillary pathology. Interpretation: VEN loss links FTD to its signature regional pattern.

Loss-of-function mutations in the DJ- 1 gene cause a rare form of familial PD with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance; however, DJ- 1 −/ − mice do not display nigrostriatal pathway degeneration, suggesting that additional factors such as inflammation may be needed to induce neurodegeneration on the background of DJ- 1 gene mutations. Neuroinflammation causes oxidative stress and, based on evidence that DJ- 1 plays a protective role against oxidative stress, we investigated whether DJ- 1 −/ − mice display increased vulnerability to inflammation-induced nigral degeneration.

The 2 ̆ 7 Developmental Origins of Health and Adult Disease 2 ̆ 7 (DOHaD) hypothesis, proposes that changes in the environment during the development of an organ or system, can have permanent deleterious effects leading to increased risk of cardiovascular and/or metabolic disease. The permanent metanephric kidney has been shown to be very vulnerable to such influences with many factors shown to alter both the permanent structure and the level of expression of important functional genes. Thus it is important to understand the precise timing of kidney development in terms of both structure and the genes involved at each stage. Such knowledge has been gained by significant advances in technology, which allow quantification of the number of nephrons by <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology,</b> detections of both levels and site of gene expression, 2 ̆ 7 knock-out 2 ̆ 7 and knock-in 2 ̆ 7 of genes in animal (mainly mouse) models and by the ability to examine nephron development, in real time, in culture systems...|$|E
40|$|There is some evidence, {{mainly from}} rodent studies, that any factor which alters the final {{total number of}} nephrons formed, during nephrogenesis, will result in {{hypertension}} in adult life. Sheep, programmed to become hypertensive by exposure to synthetic glucocorticoid (dexamethasone, 0. 48 mg h− 1, for 48 h) early in development (∼ 27 days of gestation), were killed at 7 years of age, and had nephron counting performed by <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology.</b> Mean arterial pressure was 83 ± 4 mmHg in the dexamethasone (DEX) group (n = 5), and 73 ± 5 in the control (CON; n = 7; P < 0. 05). The total nephron number, in the right kidney (249 070 ± 14 331; n = 5) was significantly lower (P < 0. 01) than that of controls (402 787 ± 30 458; n = 7). Mean glomerular volume was larger in the DEX than the CON group (P < 0. 01), {{but there was no}} significant difference in the sclerosis index between the two groups. Low nephron number was associated with grossly enlarged and dilated proximal tubules and greater accumulation of collagen type I and type III in the tubular interstitium and periadventitia of the renal cortical vessels. These data suggest that the hypertensive programming effect of glucocorticoid treatment, early in kidney development, results, at least in part, from impaired nephrogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Recently, it was {{reported}} that anesthetizing infant rats for 6 [*]h with a combination of anesthetic drugs (midazolam, nitrous oxide, isoflurane) caused widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain, followed by lifelong cognitive deficits. It has also been reported that ketamine triggers neuroapoptosis in the infant rat brain if administered repeatedly over a period of 9 [*]h. The question arises whether less extreme exposure to anesthetic drugs can also trigger neuroapoptosis in the developing brain. To address this question we administered ketamine, midazolam or ketamine plus midazolam subcutaneously at various doses to infant mice and evaluated the rate of neuroapoptosis in various brain regions following either saline or these various drug treatments. Each drug was administered as a single one-time injection in a dose range that would be considered subanesthetic, and the brains were evaluated by <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology</b> methods 5 [*]h following drug treatment. Neuroapoptosis was detected by immunohistochemical staining for activated caspase- 3. It was found that either ketamine or midazolam caused a dose-dependent, statistically significant increase in the rate of neuroapoptosis, and the two drugs combined caused a greater increase than either drug alone. The apoptotic nature of the neurodegenerative reaction was confirmed by electron microscopy. We conclude that relatively mild exposure to ketamine, midazolam or a combination of these drugs can trigger apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing mouse brain...|$|E
40|$|Objectives Diabetes {{leads to}} {{cognitive}} impairment and {{is associated with}} age‐related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, understanding diabetes‐induced alterations in brain function is important for developing early interventions for neurodegeneration. Low‐capacity runner (LCR) rats are obese and manifest metabolic risk factors resembling human “impaired glucose tolerance” or metabolic syndrome. We examined hippocampal function in aged LCR rats compared to their high‐capacity runner (HCR) rat counterparts. Methods Hippocampal function was examined using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging, <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology</b> analysis, and a Y maze. Changes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain function and levels of hyperphosphorylated tau and mitochondrial transcriptional regulators were examined. Results The levels of glutamate, myo ‐inositol, taurine, and choline‐containing compounds were significantly increased in the aged LCR rats. We observed a significant loss of hippocampal neurons and impaired cognitive function in aged LCR rats. Respiratory chain function and activity were significantly decreased in the aged LCR rats. Hyperphosphorylated tau was accumulated within mitochondria and peroxisome proliferator‐activated receptor‐gamma coactivator 1 α, the NAD + ‐dependent protein deacetylase sirtuin 1, and mitochondrial transcription factor A were downregulated in the aged LCR rat hippocampus. Interpretation These data provide evidence of a neurodegenerative process in the hippocampus of aged LCR rats, consistent with those seen in aged‐related dementing illnesses such as AD in humans. The metabolic and mitochondrial abnormalities observed in LCR rat hippocampus are similar to well‐described mechanisms that lead to diabetic neuropathy and may provide an important link between cognitive and metabolic dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|Brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) {{patients}} are characterized {{in part by}} the formation of high molecular weight aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, which interfere with neuronal function and provoke neuronal cell death. The pyroglutamate (pGlu) modification of Aβ was demonstrated to be catalyzed by the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QC) and to enhance pathogenicity and neurotoxicity. Here, we addressed the role of QC in AD pathogenesis in human cortex. Two sets of human postmortem brain tissue from a total of 13 non-demented controls and 11 AD cases were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology,</b> quantitative RT-PCR, and enzymatic activity assays for the expression level of QC in temporal and entorhinal cortex. Additionally, cortical Aβ and pGlu-Aβ concentrations were quantified by ELISA. Data on QC expression and Aβ peptide concentrations were correlated {{with each other and with}} the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of individual cases. In control cases, QC expression was higher in the more vulnerable entorhinal cortex than in temporal cortex. In AD brains, QC mRNA expression and the immunoreactivity of QC were increased in both cortical regions and frequently associated with pGlu-Aβ deposits. The analyses of individual cases revealed significant correlations between QC mRNA levels and the concentration of insoluble pGlu-Aβ aggregates, but not of unmodified Aβ peptides. Elevated pGlu-Aβ load showed a better correlation with the decline in MMSE than elevated concentration of unmodified Aβ. Our observations provide evidence for an involvement of QC in AD pathogenesis and cognitive decline by QC-catalyzed pGlu-Aβ formation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Although the {{mechanism}} of neuron loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is enigmatic, it is associated with cerebral accumulation of Aβ 42. The 5 XFAD mouse model of amyloid deposition expresses five familial AD (FAD) mutations that are additive in driving Aβ 42 overproduction. 5 XFAD mice exhibit intraneuronal Aβ 42 accumulation at 1. 5 months, amyloid deposition at 2 months, and memory deficits by 4 months of age. Results Here, we demonstrate by <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology</b> that statistically significant neuron loss occurs by 9 months of age in 5 XFAD mice. We validated two Aβ 42 -selective antibodies by immunostaining 5 XFAD; BACE 1 −/− bigenic brain sections and then used these antibodies to show that intraneuronal Aβ 42 and amyloid deposition develop in the same regions where neuron loss is observed in 5 XFAD brain. In 5 XFAD neuronal soma, intraneuronal Aβ 42 accumulates in puncta that co-label for Transferrin receptor and LAMP- 1, indicating endosomal and lysosomal localization, respectively. In addition, in young 5 XFAD brains, we observed activated Caspase- 3 in the soma and proximal dendrites of intraneuronal Aβ 42 -labeled neurons. In older 5 XFAD brains, we found activated Caspase- 3 -positive punctate accumulations that co-localize with the neuronal marker class III β-tubulin, suggesting neuron loss by apoptosis. Conclusions Together, our results indicate a temporal sequence of intraneuronal Aβ 42 accumulation, Caspase- 3 activation, and neuron loss that implies a potential apoptotic mechanism of neuron death in the 5 XFAD mouse. </p...|$|E
40|$|To compare {{morphological}} {{changes in}} the umbilical cords from chronic hypertensive and preeclamptic patients having normal or pathological umbilical artery Doppler ultrasonographic results. Umbilical cords from 34 normotensive, 31 chronic hypertensive and 70 preeclamptic women with normal and abnormal Doppler flow velocity waveforms (FVW) at 35 - 40 gestational weeks were studied. Morphological {{changes in the}} umbilical cords were examined on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. The total umbilical cord area, total vessel area, and wall thickness of umbilical vessels were measured in systematic random samples using <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology</b> methods. An ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis. In the chronic hypertensive and preeclamptic groups with normal Doppler FVW, {{the thickness of the}} umbilical cord vessels remained nearly constant, whereas both the total area and the lumen area were reduced. These changes correlate with the histopathological findings, suggesting a mainly vasoconstrictive effect. By contrast, analysis of the preeclamptic group with pathologic Doppler FVW showed a comparable reduction of all parameters of the umbilical cord. Histopathological findings were related to smaller, contracted smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall, which is suggestive of a predominant hypoplastic mechanism. As a result of reduced uteroplacental perfusion, fetal hypoxia and intrauterine growth retardation become unavoidable in preeclampsia. The histopathological changes in the umbilical cord between the chronic hypertensive and preeclamptic patients depend on the Doppler results. In conclusion, the umbilical artery Doppler FVW indices provide good values for predicting intrauterine growth retardation in preeclamptic patients. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thyroid hormones (TH) {{regulate}} {{biological processes}} implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders {{and can be}} altered with environmental exposures. Developmental exposure to the dioxin-like compound, 3, 3 ', 4, 4 '-tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB), induced a dose response deficit in serum T 4 levels with no change in 3, 5, 3 '-triiodothyronine or thyroid stimulating hormone. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were orally gavaged (corn oil, 0. 1, 1. 0, or 10 mg TCAB/kg/day) two weeks prior to cohabitation until post-partum day 3 and male offspring from post-natal day (PND) 4 – 21. At PND 21, the high dose showed a deficit in body weight gain. Conventional neuropathology detected no neuronal death, myelin disruption, or gliosis. Astrocytes displayed thinner and less complex processes at 1. 0 and 10 mg/kg/day. At 10 mg/kg/day, microglia showed less complex processes, <b>unbiased</b> <b>stereology</b> detected fewer hippocampal CA 1 pyramidal neurons and dentate granule neurons (GC) and Golgi staining of the cerebellum showed diminished Purkinje cell dendritic arbor. At PND 150, normal maturation of GC number and Purkinje cell branching area was not observed in the 1. 0 mg/kg/day dose group with a diminished number and branching suggestive of effects initiated during developmental exposure. No effects were observed on post-weaning behavioral assessments in control, 0. 1 and 1. 0 mg/kg/day dose groups. The demonstrated sensitivity of hippocampal neurons and glial cells to TCAB and T 4 deficit raises support for considering additional anatomical features of brain development in future DNT evaluations...|$|E
