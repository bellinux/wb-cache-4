2500|$|Mal Anderson named Gonzales, who [...] "was very {{difficult}} since {{if you did}} get ahead, he had a way to <b>upset</b> <b>you,</b> and he could exploit your weaknesses fast. Though over the hill, he beat Rod [...] until Rod lifted his game." [...] He added, [...] "Lew Hoad, in his day was scary, though Gonzales was best {{day in and day}} out." [...] Ashley Cooper also named Gonzales, whom [...] "I never beat on the tour. But I did beat him a couple of times on clay where his serve wasn’t as good." [...] Gonzales's frequent opponent Frank Sedgman said, [...] "I played against probably the greatest of all time, Jack Kramer. He could put his serve on a dime and had a great first volley. The second best was Gonzales. I played him a lot — a great competitor — a great athlete." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Financial Times interviewer, Emily Stokes, {{wrote in}} 2013 that Silvers viewed editing as [...] "an instinct. You must choose writers carefully, having {{read all of}} their work, rather than being swayed by 'reputations that are, shall we say, overpromoted', and then {{anticipate}} their needs, sending them books and news articles" [...] while seeking greater clarity, comprehensiveness and freshness in the writing. Stokes commented that Silvers [...] "radiates a genial warmth [...] {{it is part of}} the editor's role ... not to be swayed by friendships with authors but to let reviewers express their genuine views." [...] Silvers described some of the diplomatic aspects of the job: [...] "The act of reviewing can have a deep emotional effect. People get hurt and <b>upset.</b> <b>You</b> have to be aware of that, but you can't flinch. [...] sometimes. You say, 'No, I'm terribly sorry, I can't visualise that in the paper. I don't think it's adequate to the subject.'" [...] James Atlas wrote of a typical day for Silvers: [...] "In the late afternoon, he'd rush out to a lecture at the Council on Foreign Relations, show up at a dinner party, and then head back to the office to deal with the next breaking crisis." [...] His New York Times obituary noted: [...] "Silvers brought to [...] a self-effacing, almost priestly sense of devotion. ... loath to grant interviews. ... He arrived at the office early and left late, if at all, to the kind of heavyweight cocktail party that was, for him, a happy hunting ground for writers and ideas." ...|$|E

"I didn't tell you, dear, {{because the}} mere mention of {{smallpox}} always <b>upsets</b> <b>you</b> so much, especially just now with all this election worry going on; and I knew it because I was at the Smiths' cottage and nursing the baby when the doctor came in and said it was smallpox." ...|$|R

60|$|There {{is a wide}} {{gulf between}} the thing you cannot explain {{and the thing that}} <b>upsets</b> <b>you</b> altogether. There is hardly any {{hypothesis}} in this world which has not some fact in connection with it which has not been explained, but that is a very different affair to a fact that entirely opposes your hypothesis; in this case all you can say is, that your hypothesis is in the same position as a good many others.|$|R

5000|$|In addition, Regan {{rejects the}} idea of contractarianism, as he makes the {{argument}} that children are [...] "unable to sign contracts and lack rights". Similarly, animals {{do not have the}} capacity to sign contracts, so why should children have an advantage over animals? Furthermore, he makes the argument that if he were to approach animal rights through a contractarianism, when somebody kicks your dog, it is morally wrong because it <b>upsets</b> <b>you</b> but not the dog. Intuitively, this does not make sense, and contractarianism can be dismissed. His argument against utilitarianism is a bit more complicated.|$|R
