30|$|Despite the {{tremendous}} capacity and system enhancements implemented by LTE, cellular networks {{are known to}} be, as any kind of wireless network, vulnerable to radio jamming. Although {{it is a simple}} and well-known attack, radio jamming is the most common way to launch a localized denial of service (DoS) attack against a cellular network[4]. The impact of such attacks is very local and mainly constrained by the transmitted power of the jamming device. The attacker is only able to deny the service locally to UEs located in its vicinity. However, more sophisticated attacks have been discovered as a potentially more effective way to jam LTE networks[5, 6]. These smart jamming attacks aim to saturate specifically the main downlink broadcast channel of LTE networks in order to launch a local DoS attack that requires less power, making it stealthier. Further complex attacks, such as low-power smart jamming, identify the actual physical resource blocks (PRBs) assigned to essential <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> by capturing the unprotected broadcast messages sent from the base station (eNodeB). The interception of such unencrypted network configuration data allows the attacker to selectively saturate <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> in order to extend the range of the attack to an entire cell or sector. Note that network configuration contained in the broadcast channel can also be leveraged to deploy an effective rogue base station and other kinds of attacks.|$|R
30|$|In LTE networks, each UE {{performs}} {{random access}} (RA) procedures to transmit data during the access grant time interval (AGTI) or RA slots over a time-frequency radio resource called physical {{random access channel}} (PRACH). A UE initiates the RA mechanism in two cases [42]. Firstly, when a UE is turned on and the uplink timing synchronization is either lost or not yet achieved. Secondly, whenever a handover mechanism is performed from a serving eNB to a target eNB. In LTE, UEs perform the RA procedure for several reasons such as for establishing a communication link, re-initiating a radio link after a failure, for radio resources in case of no uplink resource grant, and scheduling requests {{in the absence of}} dedicated physical <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> (PUCCHs).|$|R
30|$|The PRB {{allocation}} of the Physical <b>Uplink</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Channel</b> (PUCCH) is known a priori {{as defined by}} the standards. The UL control signaling on this channel is transmitted in a frequency region on the edges of the system BW. In parallel, the PRB {{allocation of}} other essential UL control channels, such as the RACH, can be extracted from the SIB messages.|$|E
30|$|LTE uplink {{has adopted}} SC-FDMA[20]. The {{bandwidth}} {{is divided into}} subbands which are called physical resource blocks (PRBs). The PRB defines the resource allocation granularity in LTE. Herein, a transmission bandwidth of 10 MHz is allocated for uplink and thus there are 48 PRBs available for data transmission on the {{physical uplink shared channel}} (PUSCH) and 2 PRBs are reserved to the <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
30|$|LTE uplink {{comprises}} three physical channels: physical {{random access}} channel (PRACH), {{physical uplink shared channel}} (PUSCH), and physical <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) [27]. In particular, PUSCH is used to deliver user data and control information for active users in the uplink, which makes it an important component to be dimensioned and optimized. This section outlines how the main PUSCH features, namely the power control algorithm and the physical resource block (PRB) allocation scheme, are modeled in this work.|$|E
30|$|The {{long-term}} evolution (LTE) is {{the newly}} adopted technology to offer enhanced capacity and coverage for current mobility networks, which experience a constant traffic increase and skyrocketing bandwidth demands. This new cellular communication system, built upon a redesigned physical layer {{and based on}} an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) modulation, features robust performance in challenging multipath environments and substantially improves {{the performance of the}} wireless channel in terms of bits per second per Hertz (bps/Hz). Nevertheless, as all wireless systems, LTE is vulnerable to radio jamming attacks. Such threats have security implications {{especially in the case of}} next-generation emergency response communication systems based on LTE technologies. This proof of concept paper overviews a series of new effective attacks (smart jamming) that extend the range and effectiveness of basic radio jamming. Based on these new threats, a series of new potential security research directions are introduced, aiming to enhance the resiliency of LTE networks against such attacks. A spread-spectrum modulation of the main downlink broadcast channels is combined with a scrambling of the radio resource allocation of the <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> and an advanced system information message encryption scheme. Despite the challenging implementation on commercial networks, which would require inclusion of these solutions in future releases of the LTE standard, the security solutions could strongly enhance the security of LTE-based national emergency response communication systems.|$|R
30|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of CQI/PMI feedback mechanisms defined in the time domain: periodic and aperiodic. The RI is always a frequency nonselective type feedback and {{is associated with the}} corresponding CQI/PMI feedback. The supported time-frequency CQI/PMI feedback granularities determine the overall feedback amount, and the supported configurations depend on the physical uplink channel utilized. The aperiodic feedback—frequency selective—is supported on the uplink shared channel and is available only when the UE has downlink/uplink transmission scheduled while for the periodic feedback—frequency non/selective—both <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> and shared <b>channels</b> can be used [13].|$|R
30|$|Limited {{selectivity}} of OFDM/SC-OFDM receiver-in a {{case when}} there is no user data transmission in the <b>uplink</b> (only the <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is present), the middle part of the UL component carrier is empty, and only the resource blocks at the border convey useful data. However, the DFT operation is carried at the receiver on N consecutive incoming samples cut out from a stream of incoming samples. As such, time-domain windowing with N-length rectangular window is used. The reception filter characteristic of a single subcarrier has a sinc-like shape. If there is a DL signal (transmitted as stated above {{in the middle of the}} UL band) observed by the cell B receiver, high power sidelobes of a sinc function will cause interference on the used subcarrier (conveying control information). In order to overcome this problem, time-domain windowing or filtering should be applied at the receiver.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} target a {{specific}} LTE <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel,</b> the attacker {{would need to}} know the actual PRBs assigned to it at the PHY layer. This PRB assignment can be obtained from publicly available documentation. Nevertheless, as it will be presented in Subsection 4.4, if the actual location of this signals in the time-frequency LTE frame was randomized or scrambled, such radio resource assignment information could still be obtained from the SIB unprotected messages carried by the PBCH and PDSCH.|$|E
40|$|A {{multiuser}} {{receiver scheme}} with successive interference cancellation (SIC) is proposed to suppress multiuser interfer-ence for physical <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) in high speed train (HST) environment. In the proposed algorithm, each user’s signal is detected iteratively in a descending order {{according to the}} signal strength at eNB. During each it-eration, the strongest signal of all users ’ is detected and regenerated, and then is subtracted from the composite signal before decoding the next user. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed scheme obtains remarkable gains, e. g. 2 dB for PUCCH format 2 with 3 users in HST scenario 1. The improvement is more pronounced in the case of increasing num-ber of users, e. g. 3. 3 dB with 6 users...|$|E
30|$|ICIC is a SON function, {{which aims}} to {{minimize}} interference among cells using the same spectrum. It involves the coordination of physical resources between neighboring cells to reduce interference from one cell to another. ICIC {{can be done in}} both uplink and downlink for the data channels physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) and physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH) or <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> physical downlink control channel (PDCCH). ICIC can be static, semi-static, or dynamic. Dynamic ICIC relies on frequent adjustments of parameters, supported by signaling among cells over X 2 interface. To support proactive coordination among cells, the high interference indicator (HII) and the relative narrowband transmit power (RNTP) indicators have been defined, while to support reactive coordination, the overload indicator (OI) has been introduced [33]. Parameters that may be tuned are the transmission power, the pilot power, antenna parameters (azimuth and tilt), and the support of coordinated almost blank subframes (ABS).|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} way {{to compensate the}} rain fade effect in satellite communications {{is to increase the}} transmission power: this dynamic fade countermeasure is called <b>uplink</b> power <b>control</b> (UPC). Until more recently, <b>uplink</b> power <b>control</b> had a limited use since it required more powerful transmitters - ones that could normally run at lower levels and could be run up in power level on command (i.e. automatically). Also <b>uplink</b> power <b>control</b> could not provide very large signal margins without compressing the transmitting amplifier. Modern amplifiers coupled with advanced <b>uplink</b> power <b>control</b> systems that offer automatic controls to prevent transponder saturation make <b>uplink</b> power <b>control</b> systems an effective, affordable and easy solution to rain fade in satellite signals.|$|R

We derive optimal detectors for both the conventional method and the proposed precoding method for different cases of channel state information (CSI) and noise variance information at the receiver.

40|$|AbstractRealization of {{transmitter}} {{and receiver}} architecture for LTE is the major research work being carried out by implementation experts. There are four Control channels available in LTE for both uplink and downlink. The <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is PUCCH. The downlink control channels are PDCCH, PCFICH and PHICH. The Physical Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) Indicator Channel(PHICH) is the control channel which carries the acknowledgement (ACK/NACK), denoted as Hybrid ARQ Indicator(HI). These control channels {{play a key role}} in the correct decoding of the payload information. The HI is used to indicate the ACK for data sent using Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH), and is important for the system performance. In this paper, the realization of architecture for the PHICH are done using FPGA, where the main aim is to estimate the HI correctly in the receiver side.

40|$|In massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, {{acquisition}} of the channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT) is crucial. In this paper, a practical CSIT estimation scheme is proposed for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive MIMO systems. Specifically, each received pilot symbol is first quantized to one bit per dimension at the receiver side and then the quantized bits are fed back to the transmitter. A joint one-bit compressed sensing algorithm is implemented at the transmitter to recover the channel matrices. The algorithm leverages the hidden joint sparsity structure in the user channel matrices to minimize the training and feedback overhead, which {{is considered to be}} a major challenge for FDD systems. Moreover, the one-bit compressed sensing algorithm accurately recovers the channel directions for beamforming. The one-bit feedback mechanism can be implemented in practical systems using the <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel.</b> Simulation results show that the proposed scheme nearly achieves the maximum output signal-to-noise-ratio for beamforming based on the estimated CSIT.

30|$|We {{will start}} with {{definitions}} of the LTE uplink, the <b>uplink</b> power <b>control,</b> and the <b>uplink</b> SINR. In Section 3 we will discuss the scheduling strategies. We will consider different resource fair strategies, throughput fair strategies and QoS strategies targeting a certain bit rate. All derivations are done under the assumption of anadaptive transmission bandwidth scheduler. Performance metrics are introduced in Section 4, in particular, dissatisfaction levels due to overload, power limitation, and <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> limitation. Results with the new framework are given in Section 5, and Section 6 concludes this work.

50|$|In radio communication, a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is {{a central}} <b>channel</b> that <b>controls</b> other {{constituent}} radios by handling data streams.

30|$|When {{setting up}} a CRAHN, a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> is {{essential}} in the carrying out of functions such as spectrum sensing, sharing, decision, and mobility as all these require extensive control information exchange [1]. Several techniques have been proposed in the literature pertaining {{to the design of}} <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> for CRAHNs. Most of the proposed techniques can be divided into two categories: (1) dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> and (2) group/cluster-based <b>control</b> <b>channels.</b> Using a dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> simplifies the process of coordination among SUs. However, reliance on a dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> results in several limitations. Firstly, there is a single point of failure; for example, a dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> can result in loss of connectivity among SUs in cases of saturation or jamming. Secondly, in the case of CRAHNs, the dynamically changing availability of the spectrum in the temporal and spatial domain makes it difficult to maintain a dedicated common <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> that is globally available.|$|R
40|$|We propose {{improvements}} for {{the physical}} <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) format 2 control signaling in 3 GPP-LTE systems. These improvements can be useful for low-cost UE design and optimization planned for the future LTE releases. In the proposed method, instead of repeating a single QPSK symbol across the 12 subcarriers in each OFDM symbol of a resource block as done in the current release of the standard, we pick two QPSK symbols from two independent resource blocks and repeat them across 6 subcarriers each. The proposed method has a performance gain of about 5. 5 dB and 1. 85 dB over the conventional method with one and two receiving antennas at the base station, respectively. These gains can be achieved {{without the use of}} any additional transmission power, time-frequency resources or receiver complexity. The cell-specific QPSK sequences specified in the standard for PUCCH transmission are chosen according to the conventional repetition across the 12 subcarriers, hence we suggest new cell-specific QPSK sequences which minimize the peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) of the PUCCH signal with the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|Long Term Evolution (LTE) {{defines a}} number of {{physical}} channels to carry information blocks received from the MAC and higher layers.

40|$|Advanced Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (Advanced E-UTRA), called LTE-Advanced, {{has been}} {{standardized}} in the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) {{as a candidate}} for IMT-Advanced. LTE-Advanced supports spatial orthogonal-resource transmit diversity (SORTD) [1], [2] for ACK/NACK signals and scheduling requests (SRs), which are used to control downlink hybrid automatic repeat requests (HARQs) and manage uplink radio resources based on uplink data traffic, respectively. Both ACK/NACK signals and SRs are carried via a physical <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) [3], and a common PUCCH format is used for both ACK/NACK signals and SRs. If SORTD is used, the base station assigns mutually orthogonal resources to each antenna included in the user equipment (UE) for ACK/NACK signals and SRs; hence, the number of required resources increases with the number of transmitting antennas in the UE. In this paper, we study the resource reduction method for ACK/NACK signal and SR in case of SORTD using the concept of common resource. In addition, we investigate a phase rotation scheme for common resources to improve the SR detection performance...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{constantly}} available <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> facilitates <b>control</b> message {{exchange and}} spectrum coordination in cognitive radio (CR) ad hoc networks.

This heuristic and distributed design approach is essentially based on the observed spectrum homogeneity in a neighborhood. By adaptively updating a list of channels commonly available to neighbors, each secondary user is able to efficiently establish new <b>control</b> <b>channels</b> among neighbors in response to PU activity changes. Therefore, a virtually “always on ” <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> robust to PU activity can be realized by the proposed method.

30|$|The {{protocols}} (Song and Lin 2009 a, b; Zhang and Su 2011; Chao et al. 2011) in {{this category}} do not delve into a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> setup mechanism and simply assume that a <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> has already been established prior to any data transmission.

30|$|In this article, {{we present}} a low-rate {{feedback}} method for co-layer interference mitigation and cell balancing in the downlink of a closed-access femtocell. Using a combination of practical TBF methods and simple channel-aware inter-cell scheduling algorithms, we show that resources (i.e., degrees of freedom in the spatial and temporal domains) can be transferred from a cell operating in high SINR regime to a cell that is operating with low SINR. In other words, the proposed method is able to effectively balance the downlink data rate that is achieved at each cell, requiring only {{the presence of a}} low-rate <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> between the interfering femto access point (FAP) and the victim femto user equipment (FUE). We note that a similar method, known as enhanced codebook-based transmission, was presented in [20] and references therein as one potential solution for performance enhancements in single- and multi-cell LTE-Advanced networks. Nevertheless, the main difference with our proposal {{lies in the fact that}} in a FAP, the number of associated FUEs is expected to be much lower than the number of potential candidates to be served in a macro base station. This limitation precludes the possibility of finding a best companion (for user pairing) and worst companion (for interference coordination) to be served simultaneously at each transmission time instant.|$|E
30|$|In case of more bursty data traffic, like web-browsing, the {{feedback}} {{information can be}} sent between the different data bursts only on the Physical <b>Uplink</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Channel</b> (PUCCH). Because of the limited capacity of the PUCCH, {{the feedback}} information can be sent typcially every 20, 40 or even 80 ms only, depending {{on the number of}} mobile stations in a radio cell. Therefore, inaccurate or even outdated feedback information {{at the start of a}} data burst—especially in combination with the so-called ‘TCP slow start’ effect—can result in a reduced user throughput [11]. In order to mitigate these effects in case of a high number of mobile stations like in machine-to-machine scenarios, the feedback information is sent automatically less frequently, e.g. only every 80 ms, in case of a low mobility environment. Otherwise, the capacity of the PUCCH has to be increased automatically, which results in a reduced capacity of the PUSCH in turn. Alternatively, part of the traffic can be offloaded either in a micro or pico cell of a heterogeneous network or in a macro cell of another frequency layer. Only for fast-moving mobile stations like trains the transmission has to be downgraded to the more robust transmisson modes like TM 3 or even TM 2.|$|E
40|$|The {{autocorrelation}} of a Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequence with a non-zero cyclically shifted {{version of}} itself is zero. Due to the interesting property, ZC sequences {{are widely used}} in the LTE air interface in the primary synchronization signal (PSS), random access preamble (PRACH), <b>uplink</b> <b>control</b> <b>channel</b> (PUCCH) etc. However, this interesting property of ZC sequence is not useful in the random access initial uplink synchronization problem due to some specific structures of the underlying problem. In particular, {{the state of the}} art uplink synchronization algorithms do not perform equally for all ZC sequences. In this work, we show a systematic procedure to choose the ZC sequences that yield the optimum performance of the uplink synchronization algorithms. At first, we show that the uplink synchronization is a sparse signal recovery problem on an overcomplete basis. Next, we use the theory of sparse recovery algorithms and identify a factor that controls performance of the algorithms. We then suggest a ZC sequence design procedure to optimally choose this factor. The simulation results show that the performance of most of {{the state of the art}} uplink synchronization algorithms improve significantly when the ZC sequences are chosen by using the proposed technique.
