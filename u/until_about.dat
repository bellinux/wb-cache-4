5|$|During {{the last}} glacial period, and up <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 12,000 years ago, most of Ireland was {{periodically}} covered in ice. Sea levels were lower and Ireland, like Great Britain, formed part of continental Europe. By 16,000 BC, rising sea levels due to ice melting caused Ireland to become separated from Great Britain. Later, around 6000 BC, Great Britain itself became separated from continental Europe. The earliest evidence of human presence in Ireland is dated at 10,500 BC, demonstrated by a butchered bear bone {{found in a}} cave in County Clare. It is not <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 8000 BC, however, that more sustained occupation of the island has been shown, with evidence for Mesolithic communities around the island. These Mesolithic communities lived as hunter-gatherers across the island <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 4000 BC.|$|E

5|$|At times, {{the entire}} Kitkehahki band {{abandoned}} the Republican {{and moved to}} the Platte. Generally, this took place in times of war, when the bands sought protection in numbers.

5|$|Because of {{seasonal}} changes, the cloud bands {{in the southern}} hemisphere of Neptune have been observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980 {{and is expected to}} last <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 2020. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty years.|$|E

5|$|On 7 January 1783, Concorde was {{in company}} with Nymphe. They sighted HMS Raven, which {{initially}} sailed towards them until {{she realized that}} they were not British frigates. An all-day chase ensued <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 9p.m. when one of the frigates got within pistol-shot and fired a broadside that took away Ravens main topgallant-mast. The chase continued <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 10:30p.m. when one of the frigates was again in range, with the other coming up rapidly. At this point, Raven, which was under the command of Commander John Wells, struck. The French Navy took Raven into service under the name Cérès, which she had born when under French colours between 1778 and 1782.|$|E

5|$|A papal bull of 11 July 1265 {{reveals that}} Paisley Abbey built {{only a small}} oratory served by Paisley monks. Twenty years after the bishop's ruling Paisley complained to the papacy, which led Pope Clement IV to issue two bulls, dated 11 June 1265 and 6 February 1266, {{appointing}} mandatories to settle the dispute; {{the results of their}} deliberations are unknown. Crossraguel was not finally founded <b>until</b> <b>about</b> two decades after Donnchadh's death, probably by 1270; its first abbot, Abbot Patrick, is attested between 1274 and 1292.|$|E
5|$|After Longchamp's exile Coutances {{was named}} {{head of a}} council of regency, which is {{sometimes}} equated to the post of Chief Justiciar, although he never referred to himself as such nor is he titled that in any official document.

5|$|After {{dinner on}} 8 September, the guests at Tranby Croft listened to music from Ethel Lycett Green <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 11pm, when the prince {{suggested}} {{a game of}} baccarat. Although the Wilsons {{did not have a}} suitably-sized table, Stanley Wilson improvised, putting two card tables alongside the smoking room table—all of which were of differing sizes—and covered them with a tapestry cloth. Among the evening's players were the prince, who acted as dealer; Sassoon, who took the part of banker; and Gordon-Cumming. Sitting next to the last-named was Stanley Wilson, who was on Levett's left.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} human settlements. Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E
5|$|Although writing first {{appeared}} during the very late 4th millennium BC, it was only used to convey short names and labels; connected strings of text did not appear <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 2600 BC, {{at the beginning of}} the Old Kingdom. This development marked the beginning of the first known phase of the Egyptian language: Old Egyptian. Old Egyptian remained a spoken language <b>until</b> <b>about</b> 2100 BC, when, during the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, it evolved into Middle Egyptian. While Middle Egyptian was closely related to Old Egyptian, Late Egyptian was significantly different in grammatical structure. Late Egyptian possibly appeared as a vernacular language as early as 1600 BC, but was not used as a written language until c. 1300 BC during the Amarna Period of the New Kingdom. Late Egyptian evolved into Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.|$|E
