References to the game are commonly brought up in other articles about software packages that are not yet in production even though the announced delivery date has long passed (see vaporware). Having a low Slashdot <b>user</b> <b>identifier</b> (user ID) is highly valued since they are assigned sequentially; having one is a sign that someone has an older account and has contributed to the site longer. For Slashdot's 10-year anniversary in 2007, one of the items auctioned off in the charity auction for the Electronic Frontier Foundation was a 3-digit Slashdot user ID.|$|E

Content is stored in a per-site Oracle schema, while <b>user</b> <b>identifiers</b> are defined in a per-server schema.

50|$|Once {{the user}} has logged on, the {{operating}} system will often use an identifier such as an integer to refer to them, rather than their username, through {{a process known as}} identity correlation.

40|$|The Self-certifying File System (SFS) {{currently}} exports Unix filesystems. Consequently, file owners on SFS servers {{who want}} to give other users access to their files can do so only through the coarse-grained Unix access control mechanisms, {{which are based on}} locally de ned <b>user</b> <b>identifiers</b> and group identifiers. Therefore, despite the fact that SFS was designed to be a global filesystem, it is impossible for a file owner to grant access permissions to a remote SFS user who does not maintain a Unix account on the local machine. Moreover, creating new <b>user</b> <b>identifiers</b> or group identifiers for the purpose of access control requires the involvement of the local machine's administrator, a limitation that runs counter to the egalitarian spirit of SFS.

50|$|Network Access Identifiers were {{originally}} defined in RFC 2486, which was superseded by RFC 4282, {{which has been}} superseded by RFC 7542. The latter RFC is the current standard for the NAI. NAIs are commonly found as <b>user</b> <b>identifiers</b> in the RADIUS and Diameter network access protocols and the EAP authentication protocol.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the context}} of a {{financial}} transaction, usually both a private [...] "PIN code" [...] and public <b>user</b> <b>identifier</b> is required to authenticate a user to the system. In these situations, typically the user is required to provide a non-confidential <b>user</b> <b>identifier</b> or token (the user ID) and a confidential PIN {{to gain access to the}} system. Upon receiving the user ID and PIN, the system looks up the PIN based upon the user ID and compares the looked-up PIN with the received PIN. The user is granted access only when the number entered matches with the number stored in the system. Hence, despite the name, a PIN does not personally identify the user. The PIN is not printed or embedded on the card but is manually entered by the cardholder during automated teller machine (ATM) and point of sale (POS) transactions (such as those that comply with EMV), and in card not present transactions, such as over the Internet or for phone banking.|$|E
50|$|Process {{identification}} data always include a unique identifier {{for the process}} (almost invariably an integer number) and, in a multiuser-multitasking system, data like the identifier of the parent process, <b>user</b> <b>identifier,</b> user group identifier, etc. The process id is particularly relevant, since it {{is often used to}} cross-reference the OS tables defined above, e.g. allowing to identify which process is using which I/O devices, or memory areas.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} method {{shows how}} to use the Cache object to retrieve data from the cache. In this example, a <b>user</b> <b>identifier</b> (userid) is the key for the associated user information object. The code first attempts to get this user information from the cache using the userid key. If that does not succeed, the code retrieves the information with a database query and then stores the returned user data in the cache. The next time the same code is run, the user information will be returned from the cache rather than the database. This assumes that the cached data has not been expired or evicted.|$|E
5000|$|Data {{types are}} defined to {{represent}} the main data of the modelled system. Each type definition introduces a new type name and gives a representation {{in terms of the}} basic types or in terms of types already introduced.

50|$|Multiple <b>user</b> <b>identifiers</b> - Employees can be {{recorded}} in an ECRS {{so that they}} may have an unlimited number of identifiers that are used with third-party systems to associate them with transactions and/or types of transactions. Identifiers may include telephone extensions, photocopy IDs, cell phone numbers, calling card codes, service account codes, login IDs, and credit card numbers.|$|R
30|$|Digital {{identities in}} CardSpace are {{represented}} as claims made by one digital subject (e.g., an Internet user) about itself or another digital subject. A claim is an assertion that certain identifying information (e.g., given name, SSN, credit card number, etc.) {{belongs to a}} given digital subject [5, 6]. Under this definition, <b>user</b> <b>identifiers</b> (e.g., a username) and user attributes (e.g., user gender) are both treated as claims within the identity metasystem.|$|R
5000|$|Unix-like {{operating}} systems identify a user within the kernel by a value called a <b>user</b> <b>identifier,</b> often abbreviated to user ID or UID. The UID, {{along with the}} group identifier (GID) and other access control criteria, is used to determine which system resources a user can access. The password file maps textual user names to UIDs, but in the kernel, only UIDs are used. UIDs are stored in the inodes of the Unix file system, running processes, tar archives, and the now-obsolete Network Information Service. In POSIX-compliant environments, the command-line command [...] gives the current user's UID, {{as well as more}} information such as the user name, primary user group and group identifier (GID).|$|E
50|$|In computing, the {{superuser}} is {{a special}} user account used for system administration. Depending on the operating system (OS), the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a <b>user</b> <b>identifier</b> (UID) of zero is the superuser, regardless {{of the name of}} that account; and in systems which implement a role based security model, any user with the role of superuser (or its synonyms) can carry out all actions of the superuser account.The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.|$|E
50|$|Swish is {{a payment}} system between bank {{accounts}} in Sweden. It {{is designed for}} small transactions between people, instead of using cash (cash has largely dropped in use in Sweden since 2010), but is also used by small businesses such as sports clubs that don't {{want to deal with}} the cost of a credit card reader. A cell phone number is used as a unique <b>user</b> <b>identifier,</b> and must have been registered at a Swedish bank. A smartphone app is used to send money, but any cell phone {{can be used as a}} receiver. The lowest permitted payment is 1 SEK (around €0.11) and the highest is 10,000 (around €1,100), although 150,000 SEK can be transferred if the transaction is preregistered in the internet bank. The fee is generally zero, but the banks have hinted a future fee of 1 SEK. It has become popular, with 50 % of the Swedish population registered as users in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Developer Don Park {{introduced}} the identicon library {{for making a}} visual icon from a hashof a data identifier. This initial public implementation has spawned a large numberof implementations for various environments. In particular, identicons arenow being used as default visual <b>user</b> <b>identifiers</b> (avatars) for several widely used systems. They are also used as a complement to Gravatars, which are pre-existing avatar images created or chosen by users, instead of automatically generated images.(see #External links).|$|R
50|$|The first {{implementation}} of identity-based signatures and an email-address based public-key infrastructure (PKI) {{was developed by}} Adi Shamir in 1984, which allowed users to verify digital signatures using only public information such as the <b>user's</b> <b>identifier.</b> Under Shamir's scheme, a trusted third party would deliver the private key to the user after verification of the user's identity, with verification {{essentially the same as}} that required for issuing a certificate in a typical PKI.|$|R
40|$|Just as {{errors in}} {{sequential}} programs {{can lead to}} security exploits, errors in concurrent programs can lead to concurrency attacks. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of concurrency attacks and how they may affect existing defenses. Our study yields several interesting findings. For instance, we find that concurrency attacks can corrupt non-pointer data, such as <b>user</b> <b>identifiers,</b> which existing memory-safety defenses cannot handle. Inspired by our findings, we propose new defense directions and fixes to existing defenses. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{apply the}} {{two-stage}} reliable and scalable SIP server architecture proposed in [1] for presence. The first stage proxies the requests {{to one of}} second stage server groups {{based on the event}} header and destination <b>user</b> <b>identifier.</b> The destination <b>user</b> <b>identifier</b> is based on presentity’s URI. Such a system achieves uniform load sharing on the servers on an average. However, in certain cases the load may not be uniformly distributed on all the servers. We propose to use load metric based static allocation algorithm to distribute the load uniformly. The load metric determination and performance evaluation of such a strategy is identified as future work. Additionally, we explain load sharing architecture for XCAP server, which is based on HTTP request redirection which is similar to load sharing in web servers...|$|E
50|$|This is {{most often}} done by using a prefix, often one or more underscores. C and C++ are notable in this respect: C99 {{reserves}} identifiers that start with two underscores or an underscore followed by an uppercase letter, and further reserves identifiers that start with a single underscore (in the ordinary and tag spaces) for use in file scope; with C++03 further reserves identifiers that contain a double underscore anywhere - this allows {{the use of a}} double underscore as a separator (to connect <b>user</b> <b>identifiers),</b> for instance.|$|R
