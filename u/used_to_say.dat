5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stop}} is District 11, {{the home of}} Katniss' {{deceased}} friend and Hunger Games ally, Rue. During the ceremony, Katniss delivers an impromptu, heartfelt speech expressing her feelings toward Rue and also Thresh, who spared her life. When she finishes, an old man whistles the tune that Rue used in the arena to tell Katniss that she was safe. Everyone else salutes Katniss, using the same gesture that she <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> farewell to Rue. To Katniss's horror, the old man is quickly executed before her eyes.|$|E

25|$|The best theologian he ever met, he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{was the old}} Edinburgh fishwife who, having {{recognized}} him as Hume the atheist, refused to pull {{him out of the}} bog into which he had fallen until he declared he was a Christian and repeated the Lord's prayer.|$|E
25|$|The French {{seaside resort}} of Cancale in Brittany is {{noted for its}} oysters, which also date from Roman times. Sergius Orata of the Roman Republic is {{considered}} the first major merchant and cultivator of oysters. Using his considerable knowledge of hydraulics, he built a sophisticated cultivation system, including channels and locks, to control the tides. He was so famous for this, the Romans <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> he could breed oysters {{on the roof of}} his house.|$|E

60|$|I {{told him}} {{such a thing}} was more {{rational}} than the other; but as {{this was the first}} time that ever I could imagine him weak enough to be in earnest in this affair, I did not <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Yes at first asking; I would consider of it.|$|R

But {{as it was}} of no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} more upon this subject, he ordered the sailing-master to send to him, first, Ben Greenway, and then to summon to him, {{no matter where they}} might be or what they might be doing, the whole crew.|$|R
25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, and <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{of him that}} {{when he was in his}} best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had anything to say to him.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Microsoft {{released}} Windows 98 Second Edition, {{an interim}} release whose notable features were {{the addition of}} Internet Connection Sharing and improved WDM audio and modem support. Internet Connection Sharing {{is a form of}} network address translation, allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single Internet connection. Windows 98 Second Edition has certain improvements over the original release. Hardware support through device drivers was increased. Many minor problems present in the original Windows 98 were found and fixed which make it, according to many, the most stable release of Windows 9x family—to the extent that commentators <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Windows 98's beta version was more stable than Windows 95's final (gamma) version.|$|E

Rivers, and in after years he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that he counted it his chief claim to fame that he had {{diverted}} Dr. Rivers from psychology to anthropology. In April 1898, the expedition arrived at its field of work and spent over {{a year in the}} Torres Strait Islands, and Borneo, and brought home a large collection of ethnographical specimens, some of which are now in the British Museum, but the bulk of them for one of the glories of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge. The University of Cambridge later passed the wax cylinder recordings to the British Library. The main results of the expedition are published in The Reports of the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits.|$|E

25|$|It is affectionate {{with its}} family, and gentle with the {{children}} {{and friends of the}} family. Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is meant, but is instinctively very protective of its family, home and possessions. The Komondor is very good with other family pets, often very protective over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, {{keeping an eye on the}} surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around the whole area. The dogs usually knock down intruders and keep them down until the owner arrives. Hungarian Komondor breeders <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that an intruder may be allowed to enter the property guarded by a Komondor, but he will not be allowed to come out again.|$|E

It was of no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything, and he {{contented}} himself with a sigh as he went to the rack to put up his gun.

500|$|... <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> {{that there}} were two kinds of exercise: that, namely, of the mind and that of the body; and that the latter of these created in the mind such quick and agile {{impressions}} {{at the time of its}} performance, as very much facilitated the practice of virtue; but that one was imperfect without the other, since the health and vigour necessary for the practice of what is good, depend equally on both mind and body.|$|E
500|$|His contemporaries <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Lasker used a [...] "psychological" [...] {{approach}} to the game, and even that he sometimes deliberately played inferior moves to confuse opponents. Recent analysis, however, indicates that he was {{ahead of his time}} and used a more flexible approach than his contemporaries, which mystified many of them. Lasker knew contemporary analyses of openings well but disagreed with many of them. He published chess magazines and five chess books, but later players and commentators found it difficult to draw lessons from his methods.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Paul Nelson wrote: [...] "Red Headed Stranger is {{extraordinarily}} ambitious, cool, tightly controlled.... Hemingway, who perfected {{an art of}} sharp outlines and clipped phrases, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the full power of his composition was accessible only between the lines; and Nelson, on this LP, ties precise, evocative lyrics to not quite remembered, never really forgotten folk melodies to create a similar effect, haunting yet utterly unsentimental. That he did not write much of the material makes his accomplishment no less singular." [...] Meanwhile, critic Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "Some of the individual pieces are quite nice, but the gestalt is the concept album at its most counterproductive—the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts unnecessarily ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{it was of}} no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{anything}} like that to Rectus.

500|$|The Guardians Dave Simpson {{noted that}} [...] "the songs are catchy, with melodies {{good enough to}} tempt non-Spanish {{speakers}} to sing along". Jon Pareles of The New York Times described the album as [...] "blissfully pan-American", elaborating that [...] "for Shakira it's all pop, taut structures for volatile passion". Barry Walters of Rolling Stone said that executive producer Rick Rubin helped [...] "restore Shakira's artistic integrity by keeping the industry at bay". [...] Yahoo! Music's Tom Townsend praised Shakira for being [...] "wide awake and, as they <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in Smash Hits, back, back, BACK!" [...] Pastes Mark Kemp gave it a mixed review, saying that the record was [...] "stronger overall than Laundry Service but not as warm as Dónde Están los Ladrones?" ...|$|E
500|$|In 1965, at age 90 {{and with}} no heirs, Calment signed a deal to sell her {{apartment}} to lawyer André-François Raffray, retaining a life estate. Raffray, then aged 47 years, agreed to pay her a monthly sum of 2,500 francs (€381.12) until she died. Raffray ended up paying Calment the equivalent of more than €140,000 which was {{more than double the}} apartment's value. After Raffray's death from cancer at the age of 77, in 1995, his family continued the payments until Calment's death. Calment's comment on this situation was reported to be, [...] "In life, one sometimes makes bad deals." [...] During all these years, Calment <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to them that she [...] "competed with Methuselah". In 1985, she moved into a nursing home, having lived on her own until age 110.|$|E
500|$|This {{study of}} nature {{translated}} into {{his use of}} ruled geometrical forms such as the hyperbolic paraboloid, the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the cone, which reflect the forms Gaudí found in nature. Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the generatrix, as it moves over one or several lines known as directrices. Gaudí found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in rushes, reeds and bones; he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{that there is no}} better structure than the trunk of a tree or a human skeleton. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaudí discovered how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture. He used to equate the helicoid form to movement and the hyperboloid to light. Concerning ruled surfaces, he said: ...|$|E
