5000|$|A {{more modern}} (and more expensive) {{version of the}} {{conventional}} telescopic fork is the inverted or [...] "USD" [...] (<b>upside-down)</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Yamaha MT-09 (FZ-09 in North America) is a Yamaha naked or {{standard}} motorcycle with an [...] inline three crossplane engine, {{a lightweight}} cast alloy frame, and an <b>upside-down</b> <b>fork.</b>|$|E
50|$|The chassis {{consists}} of a tubular steel frame with load-bearing engine. A hydraulic 50 mm diameter <b>upside-down</b> <b>fork</b> by Marzocchi with 170 mm of travel guides the front. The rear wheel is held by a single-sided swingarm with progressive linkage, which is damped by a Sachs-Boge monoshock with a progressively-acting lever system and 155 mm of travel. Power is transferred to the rear wheel via a shaft integrated into the single-sided swingarm with two joints and an anti-torque reaction support.|$|E
5000|$|Front suspension: Paioli 46 mm TiN {{upside down}} forks // Evo: Öhlins 43 mm TiN <b>upside-down</b> <b>forks</b> ...|$|R
50|$|For a {{piece of}} art, the bike handled very well with its tubular steel {{single-sided}} swing arm and mono-shock in the rear, <b>upside-down</b> <b>forks</b> up front, 5 spoke wheels and Brembo's triple-disc brake system. Together with the engine, the rider was ensured an exciting ride.|$|R
5000|$|The Ducati GT1000 used {{a similar}} steel tubular trellis frame to the Paul Smart and the Sport1000, {{and the same}} Desmodue [...] engine. It was {{designed}} with comfort in mind and intended for sport-touring riders. The frame differed from the Sport1000 in the addition of mounting points for twin shocks and side panels. The GT1000 had touring handlebars, mounted on the same front forks as the Sport has clip-ons: non-adjustable 43 mm Marzocchi <b>upside-down</b> <b>forks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Honda CB600F Hornet was {{introduced}} for Europe in 1998, It {{was based on}} the CB250F that was restricted to 250 cc at its home-market (Japan) because of local laws (this bike was released only in Japan from 1996 or 1997 until 2015 when it was succeeded by the CB300F). The bike has a six-speed transmission. Its suspension consists of a single shock in the rear and a conventional telescopic fork in the front until it was succeeded by a <b>upside-down</b> <b>fork</b> in 2005. Its brakes are dual-disc, Nissin twin piston in the front and single-disc, Nissin single piston in the rear. It was given the 16 in diameter front wheel and 17 in, 180 section rear wheel setup from the Fireblade.|$|E
5000|$|Conventionally, {{the fork}} {{stanchions}} {{are at the}} top, clamped to a triple tree (also called a triple clamp or a yoke), and the sliders are at the bottom, attached to the front wheel spindle. On some modern sport bikes and most off-road bikes, this system is inverted, with [...] "sliders" [...] (complete with the spring/damper unit) at the top, clamped to the yoke, while the stanchions are at the bottom. This is done (i) to reduce unsprung weight by having the heavier components suspended, and (ii) to improve the strength and rigidity of the assembly by having the strong large-diameter [...] "sliders" [...] clamped in the yokes. The inverted system {{is referred to as}} an <b>upside-down</b> <b>fork,</b> or [...] "USD" [...] for short. A disadvantage of this USD design is that the entire reservoir of damping oil is above the slider seal so that, if the slider seal were to leak, the oil could drain out, rendering any damping ineffective.|$|E
5000|$|Conventional {{telescopic}} forks invariably have {{a pair of}} fork tubes, or [...] "stanchions", at the top, clamped to {{a triple}} tree (also called a triple clamp or a yoke), and the sliders are at the bottom, attached to the front wheel spindle.

50|$|The Ariel Ace {{comes with}} a choice of two {{alternative}} front suspensions; either a conventional <b>upside-down</b> telescopic <b>fork,</b> or Ariel's own girder fork. Rear suspension uses a single-sided swingarm. Final drive is shaft drive.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} a split-backbone tubular steel frame. Front forks are Sachs 46 mm <b>upside-down</b> {{telescopic}} <b>forks</b> while the rear is a dual swing arm made of pentagonal steel tubing {{with a single}} rear shock and progressive linkage, also supplied by Sachs.|$|R
50|$|The chassis {{consists}} of a tubular steel trellis. For the suspension, an Öhlins 43 mm <b>upside-down</b> fully adjustable <b>fork</b> {{is used for the}} front while a fully adjustable monoshock also from Ohlins is mounted {{on the left side of}} the rear wheel. Total wheelbase is 1425 mm (56.1 in).|$|R
5000|$|For {{cosmetic}} reasons, {{the bike}} has <b>upside-down</b> (USD) telescopic <b>forks</b> (rather than the BMW [...] "Telelever items). For the same reasons, it uses an air-cooled [...] "oilhead" [...] engine, {{which has the}} inlet manifold {{at the rear of}} the cylinders and the exhaust at the front. The oilhead is arguably more suitable for customisation as it has a more [...] "conventional" [...] appearance than the new water-cooled engine.|$|R
50|$|The Ducati ST2 {{was made}} between 1997 and 2003. For touring, the ST2 had seating for two, and wind {{protection}} from its full fairing. As a sport touring motorcycle the ST2 has hard luggage, relaxed ergonomics compared with sport bikes, and powerful engine {{in comparison to}} typical touring motorcycles.The frame is a tubular trellis frame, similar to the 916 frame in torsional rigidity and lightness.The Ducati ST2 has an engine derived from the 907 Ducati Paso, which had Ducati's signature 90° V-twin (or L-twin), SOHC, 2-valve desmodromic heads, Remus exhausts, 10.2:1 compression and Webber-Marelli electronic fuel injection with one injector and one spark plug per cylinder. It has an increased bore to 944cc and a heavier flywheel appropriate to its touring function.The suspension in fully adjustable for the early production series, featuring <b>upside-down</b> Showa <b>forks</b> at the front and Sachs rear shock, {{the same as the}} Ducati 916 Superbike but with softer damper ratings. The ST2 front brakes have twin 320mm floating Brembo discs and four-piston calipers, while the rear uses Brembo single 245mm disc with a twin-piston caliper. The OE tyres are Michelin Macadam or Metzeler's MEZ4 sport radials in 120/70 ZR17 for the front and 170/60 ZR17 for the rear, on Brembo rims.|$|R
