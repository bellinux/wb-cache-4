50|$|DrayTek (Traditional Chinese: 居易科技) is a {{manufacturer}} of broadband CPE (Customer Premises Equipment), including firewalls, VPN devices, routers and wireless LAN devices. The company was founded in 1997 {{by a team of}} experienced engineers who decided to form their own company and create what they feel are superior network products. Their earliest products included ISDN based solutions, the first being the ISDN Vigor128, a <b>USB</b> <b>terminal</b> adaptor for Windows and Mac OS. This was followed by the ISDN Vigor204 ISDN terminal adaptor/PBX and Vigor2000, their first router. Their head office is in Hsinchu, Taiwan with regional offices and distributors worldwide.|$|E
40|$|In this article, a novel antenna {{for a small}} {{universal}} {{serial bus}} (USB) dongle is proposed. A new feeding structure consisting of a feeding loop and resonant loop makes the whole USB dongle body radiate to fully cover Wi-Fi service. The proposed antenna has a bandwidth of 160 MHz, from 2376 to 2536 MHz with a voltage standing wave ratio of two. The proposed antenna consists of a feeding line, a capacitor (C), an inductor (L), and a ground plane. The basis for the radiating USB dongle is to form a resonating structure on a thin ground line of the <b>USB</b> <b>terminal</b> where current is strong {{and to use the}} ground plane of the USB dongle as a radiator. A new feeding structure was designed on a thin line which is the USB ground port of a USB terminal; it does not require additional clearance area. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30|$|Our {{goal was}} to achieve a {{hardware}} implementation that stays {{as close as possible}} to the reference platform shown in Figure 4. Our aim was to show the feasibility of the idea through the development of a concept demonstrator. Given the time to develop, integrate and test the hardware and software systems, it was decided very early in the project to base the implementation on an existing embedded hardware platform. We investigated various embedded systems using the following criteria: good support for a version of the Linux operating system; development tools that allow easy development; a USB form factor and a significant community of users and developers. These criteria lead us to the select of the Gumstix Overo Earth Computer-on-Module (COM) [42]. The development kit associated with this product features a motherboard that carries the Gumstix Overo Earth COM as a daughterboard, and offers a rich variety of interfaces: a USB OTG port, two mini <b>USB</b> serial (<b>terminal)</b> ports, control and status ports and some forty general purpose input/output ports that can used for a variety of uses, including interfacing to the TPM chip and providing clock and data input and output.|$|R
