40|$|Steel wires {{coated with}} {{thermoplastics}} {{have found a}} wider range of application in the field of science and engineering. However, steel-polymer interfaces frequently suffer from poor adhesion strength that is undermining their long-term stability under external stress because of weak interaction between the steel and polymer surfaces. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the influence of adhesive (Chemlok 213 and Cilbond 49 SF) on the adhesion strength of galvanized and <b>ungalvanized</b> <b>steel</b> wire coating with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Surface treatments including grinding with sandpaper, thermal oxidation and degreasing with alkaline solution were done on the steel wire substrate prior to coating by compression molding and extrusion process. The adhesion was characterized with a single wire pullout test and field emission scanning microscopy (FESEM). The experimental results confirmed that Cilbond 49 SF adhesive with sandpaper grinding treated wire outperformed all other surface treatments tested. In comparison of the processes, compression molding process has an upper hand over the extrusion process because it provide an avenue for sufficient control of curing time required for optimum setting of the adhesive...|$|E
40|$|Ring-shank nails {{are used}} in {{engineered}} structures with lateral connection design values based on theoretically derived equations which were validated only for common nails. The goal {{of this study was}} to quantify the input parameters and lateral connection strength of several types of ring-shank nails in Southern Pine lumber and critically evaluate the applicability of the theoretical equations for ring-shank nails. Two sizes of galvanized and <b>ungalvanized,</b> hardened <b>steel</b> ring-shank nails from two manufacturers were studied. The hardened, ring-shank nails carried significantly higher loads than the common wire nails studied. Because the current method of determining yield load does not give adequate credit to hardened, ring-shank nails, an alternate method is proposed...|$|R
