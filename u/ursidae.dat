5|$|Bears are carnivoran mammals of {{the family}} <b>Ursidae.</b> They are {{classified}} as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing {{in a wide variety}} of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{members of}} <b>Ursidae</b> {{belong to the}} extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis (late Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30 Mya), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, and diets perhaps more {{similar to that of}} a badger. Parictis does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene. It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the Bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene. European genera morphologically are very similar to Allocyon, and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about 18 Mya), are known from the Oligocene, including Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon.|$|E
25|$|A bear {{attack is}} an attack by any mammal of the family <b>Ursidae,</b> on another animal, {{although}} it usually refers to bears attacking humans or domestic pets. Bear attacks are of particular concern {{for those who are}} in bear habitats. Bear attacks can be fatal and often hikers, hunters, fisherman, and others in bear country take precautions against bear attacks.|$|E
25|$|For many decades, {{the precise}} taxonomic {{classification}} {{of the giant}} panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons. However, molecular studies indicate the giant panda is a true bear, {{part of the family}} <b>Ursidae.</b> These studies show it differentiated early (about 19 million years ago) from the main ursine stock; since it is the most basal member of the group, it is equidistant from all other extant ursids. The giant panda has been referred to as a living fossil.|$|E
500|$|The taxonomic {{classification}} {{of the red}} panda has been controversial since it was discovered. French zoologist Frédéric Cuvier initially described the red panda in 1825, and classified it as a close relative of the raccoon (Procyonidae), though he gave it the genus name Ailurus, (from Ancient Greek αἴλουρος, [...] "cat"), based on superficial similarities with domestic cats. The specific epithet is the Latin adjective fulgens, [...] "shining". At various times, it has been placed in the Procyonidae, <b>Ursidae,</b> with Ailuropoda (giant panda) in the Ailuropodinae (until this family was moved into the <b>Ursidae),</b> and into its own family, the Ailuridae. This uncertainty comes from difficulty in determining whether certain characteristics of Ailurus are phylogenetically conservative or are derived and convergent with species of similar ecological habits.|$|E
500|$|The family <b>Ursidae</b> {{is one of}} nine {{families}} in the suborder Caniformia, or [...] "doglike" [...] carnivorans, within the order Carnivora. Bears' closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids. Modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: Ailuropodinae (monotypic with the giant panda), Tremarctinae (monotypic with the spectacled bear), and Ursinae (containing six species divided into one to three genera, depending on the authority). Nuclear chromosome analysis show that the karyotype of the six ursine bears is nearly identical, with each having 74 chromosomes, whereas the giant panda has 42 chromosomes and the spectacled bear 52. These smaller numbers {{can be explained by}} the fusing of some chromosomes, and the banding patterns on these match those of the ursine species, but differ from those of procyonids, which supports the inclusion of these two species in <b>Ursidae</b> rather than in Procyonidae, where they had been placed by some earlier authorities.|$|E
500|$|Bear taxon {{names such}} as <b>Ursidae</b> and Ursus come from Latin Ursus/Ursa, he-bear/she-bear. The female first name [...] "Ursula", {{originally}} derived from a Christian saint's name, means [...] "little she-bear" [...] (diminutive of Latin ursa). In Switzerland, the male first name [...] "Urs" [...] is especially popular, while {{the name of the}} canton and city of Bern is derived from Bär, German for bear. The Germanic name Bernard (including Bernhardt and similar forms) means [...] "bear-brave", [...] "bear-hardy", or [...] "bold bear". The Old English name Beowulf is a kenning, [...] "bee-wolf", [...] for bear, in turn meaning a brave warrior.|$|E

60|$|Among {{the fossils}} of Pikermi, Gaudry found the {{successive}} stages {{by which the}} ancient civets passed into the more modern hyænas; through the Tertiary deposits of Western America, Marsh tracked the successive forms by which the ancient stock of the horse has passed into its present form; and innumerable less complete indications of the mode of evolution of other groups of the higher mammalia have been obtained. In the remarkable memoir on the phosphorites of Quercy, to which I have referred, M. Filhol describes no fewer than seventeen varieties of the genus Cynodictis, which fill up all the interval between the viverine animals and the bear-like dog Amphicyon; nor do I know any solid ground of objection to the supposition that, in this Cynodictis-Amphicyon group, we have the stock whence all the Viveridæ, Felidæ, Hyænidæ, Canidæ, and perhaps the Procyonidæ and <b>Ursidæ,</b> of the present fauna have been evolved. On the contrary, {{there is a great}} deal to be said in favour.|$|E

50|$|Carnivora are {{generally}} divided into the suborders Feliformia (cat-like) and Caniformia (dog-like), {{the latter of}} which includes the pinnipeds. The pinnipeds {{are part of a}} clade, known as the Arctoidea, which also includes the <b>Ursidae</b> (bears) and the superfamily Musteloidea. The Musteloidea in turn consists of the Mustelidae (mustelids: weasels), Procyonidae (procyonids: raccoons), Mephitidae (skunks) and Ailurus (red panda). The oldest caniforms are the Miacis species Miacis cognitus, the Amphicyonidae (bear-dogs) such as Daphoenus, and Hesperocyon (of the family Canidae, subfamily Hesperocyoninae). Hesperocyonine canids first appeared in North America, and the earliest species is currently dated at 39.74 mya, but they were not represented in Europe until well into the Miocene, and not into Asia and Africa until the Pliocene. Miacis and Amphicyonidae were the first of the caniforms to split from the others and are sometimes considered to be sister groups to <b>Ursidae,</b> but the exact closeness of Amphicyonidae and <b>Ursidae,</b> as well as Arctoidae to <b>Ursidae,</b> is still uncertain. The Canidae (wolves, coyotes, jackals, foxes and dogs) {{are generally}} considered to be the sister group to Arctoidea. The <b>Ursidae</b> first occur in North America in the Late Eocene (ca. 38 mya) as the very small and graceful Parictis that had a skull only 7 cm long. Like the canids, this family does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene. The other caniform families Amphicyonidae, Mustelidae and Procyonidae occur in both the Old World and the New World by the Late Eocene and Early Oligocene.|$|E
