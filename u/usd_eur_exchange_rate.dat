They were analyzed also the evolution of certain indicators such as the RON/ <b>EUR</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and that of some regional currencies (PLN, CZK, HUF).

40|$|On Jan. 1, 1999 the European Union {{introduced}} a common currency Euro (EUR), {{to become the}} legal currency in all eleven countries which form the EUR. In order to test the EUR behavior and understand various features, the <b>EUR</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> is artificially extrapolated back to 1993 by a linear superposition of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of the 11 currencies composing EUR with respect to several currencies not belonging to the EUR, i. e. Swiss Franc (CHF), Danish Kroner (DKK), British Pound (GBP), Japanese Yen (JPY) and U. S. Dollar (USD) of interest for reasons given in the text. The distribution of fluctuations of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> is shown to be Gaussian for {{the central part of}} the distribution, and having fat tails for the large size fluctuations. Within the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) statistical method we have obtained the power law behavior describing the root-mean-square deviation of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations as a function of time. For the period between Jan. 1995 and Jan. 1999 we have compared the time-dependent exponent of these <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> fluctuations for <b>EUR</b> and that of the 11 currencies which form the EUR. The German Mark (DEM) and the French Franc (FRF) have been the currencies primarily leading the fluctuations of the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> while Italian Lira (ITL) and (PTE) Portuguese Escudo are the less relevant currencies from this point of view.

We extend the existing literature on foreign exchange market microstructure by considering a small open transition economy. We find that the intradaily <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depends on both, news announcements and order flow. We conclude that news on the HUF/EUR market are transmitted directly via immediate reactions to news announcements as well as indirectly via order flow. We decompose the news’ total effect on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and find that order flow accounts for approximately three quarters, compared to one quarter for direct news impact. Although the HUF is pegged to the <b>EUR,</b> the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> shows similar characteristics as reported in the literature for major currencies. It does, however, differ in quantitative terms: the importance of indirect news transmission is remarkably higher on the HUF/EUR market. Furthermore, we extend the commonly used set of news by communication of central bankers and significantly improve the explanatory power of the estimates. Thus, central bank communication can be regarded as an important determinant for the HUF/EUR rate. microstructure, order flow, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> macroeconomic news, central bank communication, Hungary...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} USD and <b>EUR</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> on the Swedish stock market performance for different economic sectors over a time period of ten years (2003 - 2013). The growing integration between foreign exchange markets and stock markets with the wide spread use of hedging and diversification policies made it necessary to test the degree of impact these two distinct markets share between each other. Number of studies, were done studying {{the relationship between the}} <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> and stock performance combining and comparing different economies and currencies. Nevertheless, research gap prevailed when it came at the point of the studying the relationship on Swedish stock and foreign exchange market. The research was conducted with the quantitative method. Initially we have tested how the performance of Swedish stock market is correlated with the return of the USD and EUR in different economic sectors over different time periods. Later, we try to investigate if there is any spillover effect flows from the exchange market to the Swedish stock market. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient and GARCH (1, 1) model were applied to study the correlation and spillover effect between the exchange and stock return respectively. Our empirical study showed that there is very low correlation which is statistically insignificant between the two different markets. Correlations were found to be significantly varied across the different economic sectors in different time periods. Moreover empirical study supported that the spillover effect exists and showed that movement of <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> will affect the future performance of stock market. The significant conclusions were that USD and EUR can be used as portfolio diversification and during the volatile exchange market, investors should diversify or hedge their risk domestically and vice versa. The implications of this finding is particularly very important for the portfolio managers when devising their hedging policies and diversifying their portfolios in order to minimize their unsystematic risk...|$|R

We extend the existing literature on foreign exchange market microstructure by considering a small open transition economy. We find that the intraday <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> - independent from whether we focus on the mean or the volatility - depends on both news announcements and order flow. We conclude that news on the EUR/HUF market are transmitted directly via immediate reactions to news announcements as well as indirectly via order flow. We decompose the news' total effect on <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and find that order flow accounts for approximately three quarters, compared to one quarter for direct news impact. Although the HUF has been pegged to the <b>EUR,</b> the <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> reacts qualitatively very similarly to <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> of major currencies as reported in the literature, but quantitatively we observe a remarkable difference: the share of the indirect channel is higher on the EUR/HUF market.

40|$|The study {{presents}} the results of an analysis of credit risk factors of the Slovenian banking system. The objective of the empirical analysis is to establish which macroeconomic factors influence the systematic credit risk of the Slovenian banking loan portfolio. The research results have confirmed the main hypothesis that certain macroeconomic factors have a major influence on the examined credit risk. We could conclude that the credit risk of the loan portfolio depends on the employment or unemployment rate in Slovenia, on short and long-term interest rates of Slovenian banks and the Bank of Slovenia, and on the value of the Slovenian stock exchange index. We cannot claim that the examined credit risk depends on the inflation rate in Slovenia, the growth of gdp (industrial production), <b>eur</b> and <b>usd</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> or the growth of Slovenian import and export.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} contagion {{between the}} sovereign bond markets of six Eurozone countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and Portugal) {{in the period}} from January 2000 to August 2011. A multinomial logistic model is applied to analyze contagion based on measuring joint occurrences of large yield changes (i. e., co-exceedances), while controlling for developments in common and regional factors th at affect all sovereign bond markets simultaneously. I found that the Eurozoneʼs stock markets (EUROSTOXX 50) returns, United Statesʼ Treasury note yields, and the Euro - U.

Conditional volatility in the Eurozone stock markets and the money market interest rate do not significantly impact the probability of extreme yield increases in the Eurozoneʼs sovereign bond markets. Furthermore, the probability of observing exceedance across Eurozone sovereign bond markets increased dramatically during the Eurozone debt crisis compared to the pre-crisis period. This studyʼs results also indicate less synchronous extreme yield dynamics across the Eurozone sovereign bond markets during the global financial crisis, especially during the Eurozone debt crisis compared to the pre-crisis period...|$|R

40|$|Using recent {{advances}} in the classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, this paper finds no support for the popular bipolar view that countries will tend over time {{to move to the}} polar extremes of free float or rigid peg. Rather, intermediate regimes have shown remarkable durability. The analysis suggests that as economies mature, the value of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility rises. For countries at a relatively early stage of financial development and integration, fixed or relatively rigid regimes appear to offer some anti-inflation credibility gain without compromising growth objectives. As countries develop economically and institutionally, there appear to be considerable benefits to more flexible regimes. For developed countries that are not in a currency union, relatively flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes appear to offer higher growth without any cost in credibility. <b>Exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes;Economic conditions;exchange <b>rate,</b> inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> flexibility, inflation performance, terms of trade, foreign exchange, lower inflation, monetary policy, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, macroeconomic performance, real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation targeting, money growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> high inflation, annual inflation, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> markets, dual <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> markets, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classification, inflation <b>rates,</b> real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> foreign currency, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policy, <b>exchange</b> arrangements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> rigidity, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pegs, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, terms of trade shocks, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> currency unions, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> movements, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements, rigid <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation <b>rate,</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> reserves, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> systems, market <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> variability, multiple <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> inflationary expectations, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> policies, <b>exchange</b> reserves, money supply, classification of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> natural <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> rate of inflation, real interest <b>rates,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> depreciation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, currency values, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> change, post-crisis period, currency boards, official <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, <b>exchange</b> restrictions, variable inflation, de facto <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, average inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> stability, monetary economics, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> changes, stable <b>exchange</b> <b>rates,</b> black market, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, parallel <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> price inflation, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> behavior, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> band, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> system, currency areas, currency convertibility, effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> low inflation, fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, alternative <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> path, floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, inflation growth, flexible <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime classifications, macroeconomic stability, explicit <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> controls, inflation target, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choice, freely floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> real rates, independent central bank, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> unification, average inflation <b>rate,</b> intermediate <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> annual inflation <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangement, bilateral <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> history of <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> information, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> pass, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> guarantee, real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> crises, basket of currencies, <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> choices...|$|R

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{creating}} a new currency union is setting the rates to convert national currencies into the new union currency. Planned unions in the Gulf region and Africa are seeking methods to set the conversion rates when their new currencies are created. We propose a forward-looking econometric methodology to determine conversion rates by calculating the degree of misalignment in the real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> {{and apply it to}} the GCC currency union. For each GCC currency, we identify the year at which the economy is the closest to its internal and external equilibrium, and then estimate the degree of misalignment in the bilateral real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> vis-Ã -vis the U. S. dollar based on WEO forecasts until 2013. Application of the methodology to other regions is also considered.

40|$|Consensus {{estimates}} put the half-life of {{deviations from}} purchasing power parity (PPP) at {{about four years}} (Rogoff, 1996). However, conventional least squares estimates of half-lives are biased downward. Accordingly, as a preferred measure of the persistence of real <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> shocks, this study uses median-unbiased estimators of the half-life of deviations from parity, which correct for the downward bias of conventional estimators. The paper tests for PPP using real effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data for 90 developed and developing countries in the post-Bretton Woods period. Support for PPP is found, as the majority of countries experience finite deviations of real <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> from parity. The speed of parity reversion {{is found to be}} typically much faster for developed countries than for developing countries, and to be considerably faster for countries with flexible nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes in comparison with countries having fixed nominal <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes.
