5|$|Saint Anselm College RECYCLES was a {{greening}} movement {{which started}} on campus in 2009. Up to that time, recycling was limited on campus, and {{students had to}} resort to their own methods of recycling containers and other recyclables in dorms. An impromptu recycling program—Saint Anselm College RECYCLES—was started through the Knights of Columbus and the Club Soccer organization that served the <b>Uppers</b> section of campus, every Saturday, averaging around 650 pounds of material per week. In the 2010 spring semester, this plan funded by Club Soccer and the Knights of Columbus provided over fifty recycle bins, purchased from the city of Providence, Rhode Island. In the spring of 2010, the New Hampshire Institute of Politics installed seven recycling bins throughout its facilities. Inspired by this student-led activity, the college's physical plant purchased 120 bins for all of the apartments in the <b>Uppers,</b> Lowers and Falvey and Collins Houses. In the fall of 2010, Physical Plant installed five Waste Management recycling dumpsters throughout campus. Campus-wide recycling is planned by 2013.|$|E
5|$|Buses for routes 37, 47 and X47 between Edinburgh and Penicuik were branded as Penicuik City Link, {{with blue}} <b>uppers</b> and roofline, and the {{positions}} of the red and madder on the skirting transposed. In 2011, one of these buses was repainted into madder and white, with no roof colour. However, the other vehicles in Penicuik City Link colours were repainted into the new madder and white livery with a turquoise mint coloured roof and the name Pen-Y-Cog. This is to celebrate the history of the area as Pen-Y-Cog is the original name for Penicuik. These buses were de-branded in 2014 due to high fuel consumption of the B7TL's used and the 37/47/X37 is now worked by standards liveries Volvo B9TL's.|$|E

5|$|The Pondicherry shark has {{a robust}} build and a {{moderately}} long, pointed snout. The large and circular eyes {{are equipped with}} nictitating membranes. Each nostril is broad with a small, narrow nipple-shaped lobe on the anterior rim. The arched mouth lacks conspicuous furrows or enlarged pores at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain 14–15 and 12–14 tooth rows on either side respectively; in addition, there are one or two rows of small teeth at {{the upper and lower}} symphyses (jaw midpoints). The upper teeth have a single narrow, smooth-edged central cusp, flanked on both sides by very large serrations. The lower teeth are narrower and more upright than the <b>uppers,</b> and may be smooth to finely serrated. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly long.|$|E
5|$|The large upper incisors are orthodont, {{with their}} cutting edge {{at about a}} right angle to the upper molars, and heavily {{pigmented}} with orange.

The orthodont upper incisors suffice to distinguish T.ucucha from all {{other members of the}} genus but T.australis and T.daphne, which have much shorter and narrower incisors. The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more hypsodont (high-crowned) than in other Thomasomys. The anterocone, the cusp {{at the front of the}} first upper molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an anteromedian flexus. The accessory ridges on the upper molars, the anterolophs and mesolophs, are less well-developed than in T.hylophilus. The third upper molar is reduced relative to the second, much more so than in T.hylophilus. The lower molars are generally similar to the <b>uppers,</b> but the anteroconid (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced.|$|E

Because of their thin, pliable leather <b>uppers</b> and split soles, acro shoes have excellent flexibility, thus enabling dancers to attain both good dance form and acrobatic control. The sole is made of soft, composite rubber so as to provide both high traction and cushioning, and it provides excellent protection from skin abrasion as it covers the entire bottom of the foot.|$|E

In contrast to the low Ballroom heel, which evenly distributes weight across the foot, Latin American shoes have higher heels designed to shift weight onto the toes. Latin shoes are also more flexible than ballroom shoes. Men's Latin shoes typically have 1.5- to 2-inch high, shaped heels, while Ladies' Latin shoes have 2,5-inch to 3-inch heels.
