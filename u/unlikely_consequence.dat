40|$|If {{there is}} a sparse set hard for P under bounded truth table {{reductions}} computable in LOGSPACE or NC 2, then P = NC 2. We give {{the details of the}} proof to this theorem. 1 Introduction Recently a 1978 conjecture by Hartmanis [Har 78] was resolved [CS 95 a], following a breakthrough by [Ogi 95]. It was shown that there is no sparse set that is hard for P under logspace many-one reductions, unless P = LOGSPACE. Bounded truth table reductions are a natural extension of many-one reductions and it is natural to ask what consequences can be drawn assuming {{there is a}} sparse set hard for P under bounded truth table reductions computable in LOGSPACE. In this note we give the details of the proof of the theorem that if such a sparse set exists, then a very <b>unlikely</b> <b>consequence</b> follows, namely P = NC 2. This theorem is even valid for bounded truth table reductions computable in NC 2. The proof for the case of 1 -truth table reductions, which already generalizes the manyone reductions, has [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The decarbonised future European {{electricity}} {{system must}} remain secure: reliable electricity supply {{is a prerequisite}} for the functioning of modern society. Scenarios like Desertec, which partially rely on solar power imports from the Middle East and North Africa, may be attractive for decarbonisation, but raise concerns about terrorists interrupting supply by attacking the long, unprotected transmission lines in the Sahara. In this paper, I develop new methods and assess the European vulnerability to terrorist attacks in the Desertec scenario. I compare this to the vulnerability of today's system and a decarbonisation scenario in which Europe relies on gas imports for electricity generation. I show that the vulnerability of both gas and electricity imports is low, but electricity imports are more vulnerable than gas imports, due to their technical characteristics. Gas outages (and, potentially, resulting blackouts) are the very <b>unlikely</b> <b>consequence</b> even of very high-number attacks against the gas import system, whereas short blackouts are the potential consequence of a few attacks against the import electricity lines. As the impacts of all except extreme attacks are limited, terrorists cannot attack energy infrastructure and cause spectacular, fear-creating outages. Both gas and electricity import infrastructure are thus unattractive and unlikely terrorist targets...|$|E

He defines a resource-bounded measure in exponential time and space classes that generalizes Lebesgue measure, a powerful mathematical tool. We investigate here the possibility of extending this resource-bounded measure to other classes, mainly PSPACE.

Our main results are as follows. We establish that {{the existence}} of a polynomially dense hard set for P under (randomized) logspace bounded truth-table reductions implies that P ` (R) L, and that the collapse goes down to P ` (R) NC 1 in case of reductions computable in (R) NC 1.

40|$|AbstractWe obtain {{some results}} of the form: If certain {{complexity}} classes satisfy a non-uniform condition, then some <b>unlikely</b> <b>consequences</b> follow. More precisely: 1. (1) If the ‘non-uniform polynomial-time hierarchy’ collapses at level i> 0, i. e., Σipoly = Πipoly, then the Meyer-Stockmeyer hierarchy collapses at level i + 2, i. e., Σi+ 2 = Πi+ 2. This strengthens a generalization of a result of Karp and Lipton (1980). 2. (2) If co-NP is conjunctively reducible to a sparse set, then P = NP. This generalizes a theorem of Fortune (1979). 3. (3) If NP is conjunctively and disjunctively reducible to a sparse NP-complete set, then P = NP. This is a partial generalization of a result of Mahaney (1980). Conjuctive and disjunctive reducibility were introduced by Ladner, Lynch and Selman (1975). 4.

To investigate the automatic influences of attitudes, this study explores {{the accessibility of}} modally salient beliefs about physical activity outcomes using response latency measures. Design. Response latencies for modally salient beliefs for physically activity outcomes were compared with latencies for non-salient, hygiene outcomes. Possible relationships between self-report and response latency was assessed between- and within-subjects. Method. Regularly active participants (N= 148) completed a computer-based response latency task in which they indicated whether an outcome, for example more fit, was a likely or <b>unlikely</b> <b>consequence</b> of six different physical activities, for example go running. Self-reports of the likelihood of these outcomes, their importance, intentions {{to participate in the}} physical activities and frequency of participation were obtained. Results. As expected, the physical activity outcomes were more accessible than control outcomes. In addition, the outcome strong heart was less accessible than the outcomes more fit and have fun. There was only weak evidence, however, of any relationship between self-reports and the accessibility of the physical activity outcomes. Conclusion. Response latency data may represent a source of between-subject variation that differs from self-report. Discussion focuses on the possible origins of such a discrepancy...|$|E

Since the region, where the change of the integrated spectral weight is not compensated, extends well above 2. 5 eV, this transfer is caused by the transfer of spectral weight from interband to intraband region and only partially by the narrowing of the intraband peak.

40|$|Helioseismology has {{revealed}} many details of solar differential rotation and also its time variation, known as torsional oscillations. So far {{there is no}} generally accepted theoretical explanation for torsional oscillations, even though a close relation to the solar activity cycle is evident. On the theoretical side non-kinematic dynamo models (including the Lorentz force feedback on differential rotation) {{have been used to}} explain torsional oscillations. In this paper we use a slightly different approach by forcing torsional oscillations in a mean field differential rotation model. Our aim is not a fully self-consistent model but rather to point out a few general properties of torsional oscillations and their possible origin that are independent from a particular dynamo model. We find that the poleward propagating high latitude branch of the torsional oscillations can be explained as a response of the coupled differential rotation / meridional flow system to periodic forcing in mid-latitudes, of either mechanical (Lorentz force) or thermal nature. The speed of the poleward propagation sets constraints on the value of the turbulent viscosity in the solar convection zone to be less than 3 × 10 8 m 2 s − 1.

Because the phenotype is <b>unlikely</b> a direct <b>consequence</b> of IGF-I deficiency, {{the present study}} was designed to explore possible activation of proislet factors in PID mice by using a whole genome DNA microarray. As a result, multiple members of the Reg family genes (Reg 2, - 3 alpha, and - 3 beta, previously not known to promote islet cell growth) were significantly upregulated in the pancreas. This finding was subsequently confirmed by Northern blot and/or real-time PCR, which exhibited 2 - to 8 -fold increases in the levels of these mRNAs. Interestingly, these Reg family genes were also activated after streptozotocin-induced beta-cell damage and diabetes (wild-type T 1 D mice) when islet cells were undergoing regeneration. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased Reg proteins in exocrine as well as endocrine pancreas and suggested their potential role in beta-cell neogenesis in PID or T 1 D mice. Previously, other Reg proteins (Reg 1 and islet neogenesis-associated protein) have been shown to promote islet cell replication and neogenesis.

In a similar spirit to BosonSampling, the ability to sample classically from the probability distribution induced by time evolution under this Hamiltonian would imply <b>unlikely</b> complexity theoretic <b>consequences,</b> suggesting that the dynamics of such a spin model cannot be efficiently simulated with a classical computer. Physical Ising spin systems capable of achieving problem-size instances (i. e. qubit numbers) large enough so that classical sampling of the output distribution is classically difficult in practice may be achievable in the near future.

Instead, they suggest that sea ice kinematics play a fundamental role in the albedo feedback loop and sea ice decline: increasing deformation means stronger fracturing, hence more lead opening, and therefore a decreasing albedo. This accelerates sea ice thinning in summer and delays refreezing in early winter, therefore decreasing the mechanical strength of the cover and allowing even more fracturing, larger drifting speed and deformation, and possibly a faster export of sea ice through the Fram Strait.

From here, all Panamax ship market information was filtered (number of ships, age profile, flag, conversions and many more). Next to this, important drivers of grain demand and grain supply were filtered from web-sources and matched with the drivers of Panamax ships to seek correlations. Surprisingly, no correlations were found between these drivers. On the other hand, the Panamax ship information was structured in such a way that graphs and tables could be made that led to the following conclusions. Future growth prospects are almost none existing and a recovery of the market in the short term (within one to two years) is highly <b>unlikely.</b> The <b>consequence</b> is a sharp decrease of new building orders of Panamax ships and shipyards are struggling for work.

40|$|The role of insulin-like {{growth factor}} I (IGF-I) in {{pancreatic}} islet cell {{growth and development}} has been debated in recent years. The dogma that IGF-I stimulates pancreatic islet growth has been challenged by combinational targeting of IGF or IGF-IR genes, as well as beta-cell-specific IGF-IR gene deficiency. In order to assess the physiological role of locally produced IGF-I, we have developed pancreatic-specific IGF-I gene deficiency (PID) by crossing Pdx 1 -Cre and IGF-I/loxP mice. PID mice were normal except for decreased blood glucose level and a 2. 3 -fold enlarged islet cell mass. When challenged with low doses of streptozotocin, control mice developed hyperglycemia after 6 days that was maintained at high levels for at least 2 months. In contrast, PID mice only exhibited marginal hyperglycemia after 12 days, maintained throughout the experiment. Furthermore, streptozotocin-induced beta-cell apoptosis (TUNEL assay) was significantly prevented in PID mice. PID mice also exhibited a delayed onset of type 2 diabetes induced by a high-fat diet, accompanied by super enlarged pancreatic islets and preserved sensitivity to insulin. As the phenotype is <b>unlikely</b> a direct <b>consequence</b> of IGF-I deficiency, we used oligonucleotide DNA microarray to explore possible activation of pro-islet genes in PID mice, which revealed upregulation of multiple new members of the Reg family genes (Reg 2, 3 alpha and 3 beta) in the pancreas.

40|$|The risk of {{endocrine}} disrupters {{to humans}} and wildlife is to date poorly understood, although evidence of effects is now widespread. In understanding the risk, {{an important step}} is {{the determination of the}} partitioning, as well as chemical and biochemical transformation, of compounds in the environment, the water cycle and the food chain. This is a complex task and this paper is a first step towards estimating some of these factors from a largely theoretical approach. A chemical fate model is used to predict the fate of the contraceptive drug 17 a-ethinylestradiol (EE 2). The example of the contraceptive pill is chosen to follow the journey of the drug from human ingestion and excretion to treatment in a sewage treatment plant (STP) using fugacity-based fate models, followed by discharge into a receiving river and eventually into the estuary/sea. The model predicts how EE 2 will partition into the different compartments during each stage of this journey and thereby infiltrate into the food chain. The results suggest that a person would have to ingest more than 30, 000 portions of fish to consume an equivalent to a single average dose of the contraceptive pill. While this scenario is highly <b>unlikely,</b> the biochemical <b>consequence</b> of the contraceptive pill is greatly significant. Furthermore, there are many identified similarly estrogenic compounds in the environment while this study only considers one. Cumulative effects of such compounds as well as degradation into other potent compounds may be anticipated.

Nitroglycerin (GTN) is an organic nitrate used for the management of angina pectoris, hypertension and congestive heart failure, it is converted to NO or closely related moleculesin the vasculature resulting in vasodilatation. It has been demonstrated that chronic administration of GTN leads to nitrate tolerance, which is associated with increased arginase activity and reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. Supplement of L-arginine appears to reduce nitrate tolerance, however, the bioavailability of L-arginine is limited. It has been reported that L-citrulline supplement in human results in elevated plasma level of L-arginine. This study was designed to investigate the effect of long-term GTN treatment on the expressions and activities of arginase I, arginase II and eNOS, and on the production of cGMP inhuman umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Moreover, the effect of L-citrulline on nitrate tolerance due to GTN treatment was examined. HUVECs were treated with GTN (10 µM), thrombin, L-arginine, L-citrulline and L-norvaline, alone or in combinations, for 1 hour (short-term treatment) or 24 hours(long-term treatment) followed by 30 minutes stimulation by GTN (100 µM). Western immunoblotting was used to measure the protein expression levelsof eNOS, arginase I and arginase II. Enzyme immunoassay and colorimetric assay were performed to determine the cGMP level and the arginase activities, respectively. Our results suggested that the amount of cGMP release in response to acute (30 minutes) GTN stimulation (100 µM) was reduced in HUVECs that were pre-treated with 24 hour GTN(10 µM), and this is associated with an increased arginase activity. L-arginine,L-citrullineor L-norvaline alone was not able to prevent this reduction in cGMP release (nitrate tolerance), although L-arginine and L-norvaline, but not L-citrulline, prevented the increase in arginase activity. The combination of L-arginine or L-citrulline with L-norvaline is effective to protect HUVECs against nitrate tolerance. On the other hand, thrombin (a stimulator of eNOS, 1 U/ml) pre-treatment for 24 hours also reduced cGMP production toacute GTN stimulation. Similar to long-term GTN-induced nitrate tolerance, long-term thrombin-induced nitrate tolerance was not prevented by concomitant presence of L-arginine, L-citrulline or L-norvaline. Long-term thrombinpre-treatment also increased arginase activity and this effect was inhibited by L-arginine, L-citrulline and L-norvaline. The increased arginase activity by long-term GTN or thrombin pre-treatment was not associated with increased arginase protein expression. In conclusion, the present data suggested that prolonged pre-exposure to exogenous GTN or endogenous increase NO by thrombin induced nitrate tolerance in HUVECs, and this is <b>unlikely</b> the <b>consequence</b> of the increased arginase activity. In addition, neither L-arginine nor L-citrulline were effective in protecting HUVECs against nitrate tolerance, and only the combination of L-citrulline and L-norvaline or L-arginine and L-norvaline were effective. published_or_final_versionPharmacology and PharmacyMasterMaster of Medical Science...|$|R
50|$|With {{the safety}} of {{legislative}} districts prior to 2012, any negative consequences of voter dissatisfaction were highly <b>unlikely</b> while the <b>consequences</b> of breaking with party stances (especially for Republicans) could be severe. In 2004, of the four Republicans who broke with party discipline, two retired and two were defeated in Republican primary contests, while in 2008 a Democratic member of the Assembly was reassigned to a much smaller office remote from the Capitol building, as punishment for her abstention from a vote during the 2008 budget impasse. In February, 2009, the Senate Minority leader was removed from his position by the Republican caucus after brokering a deal to settle the budget issue but failing to deliver the one additional Republican vote needed. It was not until February 20, 2009, that a budget agreement was signed by the governor, under a plan that combines spending reductions, additional taxes, and borrowing against state lottery revenues and removing funds from certain mandated programs, {{with the price of}} the bargain being various enabling proposals to be presented to the electorate in a May 2009 special election and in 2010. All of the May 2009 propositions (other than one intended to punish the legislators) were overwhelmingly defeated, throwing the budget crisis back to the legislature, with the Governor continuing to oppose any tax or fee increase (fees may be increased by a simple majority vote). The budget again went substantially past its deadline in June 2009 and the Governor proposed the closure of two hundred state parks. Closure of state parks would save little or no money and the proposal was widely believed to be a ploy to cause pain to California's middle class in order to bring constituent pressure upon the Legislature. Park closure is (as of Fall 2009) now seen as unlikely, but a substantial reduction in admission hours for many parks is now probable. Budget deficits are expected continue in 2010, estimated in January at $20 million, with the resolution under the current political structure expected to have severe impacts upon public education, public transport, corrections, and health and welfare.|$|R
