5|$|Carlos Sainz {{was cleared}} to race albeit not setting {{a time in}} qualifying, being allowed to start {{from the back of}} the grid. At the start, Nico Rosberg led away from Lewis Hamilton, while further back, Nico Hülkenberg spun into turn two, tagging Max Verstappen and Marcus Ericsson. Verstappen had a {{puncture}} while Hülkenberg and Ericsson retired on the spot, causing the safety car to be deployed. Meanwhile, Räikkönen and Kvyat experienced good starts, gaining two and four places respectively. Racing resumed on the end of lap 3, with Rosberg retaining his race lead. However, further back Bottas overtook Räikkönen to take third. By lap 7, Sainz had moved up into 14th place, while Felipe Massa was up into ninth place from 15th on the grid. Race leader Nico Rosberg needed to retire at the end of the seventh lap due to a locked throttle, handing the race lead to championship leader Lewis Hamilton. On lap 10, Pastor Maldonado moved ahead of Jenson Button to take tenth, while Hamilton was extending his lead over second placed Bottas. A second safety car phase occurred on lap 12, when Romain Grosjean lost the back of his Lotus in turn 3 and crashed into the barriers. While Grosjean escaped uninjured, his car was heavily damaged. With a lot of debris on track, the safety car stayed out until lap 17. At the restart, Vettel attacked teammate Räikkönen for third. While the Finn was able to stay ahead by going wide into turn 2, he subsequently gave <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> to Vettel. One lap later, Ricciardo and Sainz fought for tenth place, with Daniel Ricciardo coming out on top and retaining the position.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{she became}} one of four judges for the current hot show in Vietnam The Voice of Vietnam. Thu Minh truly found her {{explosive}} fame and success through her talented mentoring, a sane judgment and a sensible art instinct. Through each round, she proved strongly to be more brilliant with her mentoring position since Thu Minh's team is still anticipated {{to be at the}} top {{at the end of this}} year. She is claimed to be the most favourite judge by contestants and audiences due to her strong voice and notable experiences throughout the show. The reality show presented another aspects of Thu Minh in terms of bold multi-talent, being sensitive, loving, sincere, skillful and witty without aggressiveness. With tactful sanity from setting <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> – at the castle of Khai Silk – to directly mentoring and inviting selectively elite support from musician Nguyen Hai Phong and Vietnam's diva Hồng Nhung in order to fulfill all students with skillful and advantageous performance and tutorials, Thu Minh's team was expected to be a prosperous package of surprises and marvellous creativity each night.|$|E

500|$|In 1958, American {{physicist}} William Higinbotham {{worked in}} the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York {{as the head of}} the instrumentation division. Higinbotham had a bachelor's degree in physics from Williams College, and had previously worked as a technician in the physics department at Cornell University while unsuccessfully pursuing a Ph.D. there. He served {{as the head of the}} electronics division of the Manhattan Project from 1943 to 1945, and began working at Brookhaven in 1947, which focused on researching peaceful uses of atomic power. Once a year, the government research facility held an exhibition for the public, with one day each for high school students, college students, and the general public. The exhibition largely consisted of tours and static displays, with some attempts at making displays with [...] "action", so for the 1958 exhibition Higinbotham decided to make an interactive display to entertain the visitors. While reading the instruction manual for one of Brookhaven's computers, a Donner Model 30 analog computer, he learned that the computer could calculate ballistic missile trajectories or a bouncing ball with wind resistance, and he decided to use this ability to form the foundation of a game. He later recalled his intentions were that [...] "it might liven <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> to have a game that people could play, and which could convey the message that our scientific endeavors have relevance for society." ...|$|E

In her recap, she favored the Belle-centric storyline by giving it a B+: [...] "The upside, though, is a strong episode for Belle; Gaston is downright dishy (although still evil); and a Belle plot means more Rumple time, always welcome." [...] However, the other plotline garnered a C-: [...] "The main plot fared even better compared to the dumb B-plot, with Emma, Hook and Snow Scooby-ing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place,</b> with an enchanted elevator, a dream sequence, and what {{looks to be a}} wild goose chase that results in the discovery of Red/Ruby. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the culmination of the Ruby/Mulan relationship, but did we really need a whole episode just to discover the wolf?" ...|$|E

He remained at Eton until December 1921, when he left midway between his 18th and 19th birthday. Wellington was [...] "beastly", Orwell told his childhood friend Jacintha Buddicom, {{but he said he}} was [...] "interested and happy" [...] at Eton. His principal tutor was A. S. F. Gow, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, who also gave him advice later in his career. Blair was briefly taught French by Aldous Huxley. Steven Runciman, who was at Eton with Blair, noted that he and his contemporaries appreciated Huxley's linguistic flair. Cyril Connolly followed Blair to Eton, but because they were in separate years, they did not associate with each other.|$|E

2500|$|After {{his death}} {{a number of}} writers {{questioned}} the accuracy of van der Post's claims about his life. It was revealed that in 1952 he had fathered {{a child with a}} 14-year-old girl, the actress Evadne Baker, who had been under his care during a sea voyage to England from South Africa. He was her guardian and trusted escort to London, where her parents were sending her to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> she had won at The Royal Ballet School. [...] Her pregnancy prevented her from pursuing her dream to become a ballerina. [...] His reputation as a [...] "modern sage" [...] and [...] "guru" [...] was questioned, and journalists published examples of van der Post's embellishing the truth in his memoirs and travel books. These and other facts were brought together in J.D.F. Jones's Storyteller: The Many Lives of Laurens van der Post (2001). A rebuttal was published by Christopher Booker (van der Post's ODNB biographer and friend), followed by a counter-rebuttal by Jones.|$|E
2500|$|During the Duke's {{long career}} {{he helped to}} further the career {{progress}} of Douglas Haig, a talented and able young officer, who succeeded through Staff College to gain promotion. [...] As Commander-in-Chief, the Duke was able to admit any candidate to the College {{so long as they}} passed three out of eight of the tests. Haig, who was also acquainted with Sir Evelyn Wood, left for India in 1893 knowing that the Duke had also made a friend of Henrietta (Haig) Jameson, his older sister. [...] The Duke's nomination was made in 1894 and 1895, but Haig did not take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> until 15 January 1896 under Army Regulations Order 72 (1896). [...] The Duke, who was replaced by Lord Wolseley, after 32 years was not the only patron of preferment. [...] The Staff College was not intended to educate a General Staff until much later in its historical development. [...] However the traditional system of informal patronage was gradually giving way to more than gifted amateurs.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to England, he {{was head}} of the history {{department}} at Kelly College in Tavistock for five years, followed by fourteen years at Culham College of Education as principal lecturer and head of the history department. He was able to combine his love of cricket with his college duties by instituting the biannual cricket matches between the History Department and his village cricket team of North Moreton for whom he was wicketkeeper and captain. One regularly told story was that he conducted an interview out on the cricket square when one potential teaching student applied who was already on the books of Yorkshire Cricket Club! Unfortunately for Howat, the student did not take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> which was presumably offered to him, but did go on to have a reasonably successful cricket career. He had an abrupt tutoring technique and once (at least) locked the door when the time of his tutor group was due to start which left only one student in the room (at the magnificent mansion of Nuneham) to enjoy his didactic and engaging teaching style. Meanwhile, he undertook a research degree on [...] "the place of history in education" [...] for Exeter College, Oxford. He also turned his hand to the world of publishing, for a time being general editor of the Historical Division of Pergamon Press.|$|E

2500|$|Rav and Samuel offered {{different}} {{explanations of}} the words in [...] "And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made He a woman." [...] One said that this [...] "rib" [...] was a face, the other {{that it was a}} tail. In support of the one who said it was a face, [...] says, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me." [...] The one who said it was a tail explained the words, [...] "Behind and before have You formed me," [...] as Rabbi Ammi said, that humankind was [...] "behind," [...] that is, later, in the work of creation, and [...] "before" [...] in punishment. The Gemara conceded that humankind was last in the work of creation, for God created humankind {{on the eve of the}} Sabbath. But if when saying that humankind was first for punishment, one means the punishment in connection with the serpent, Rabbi taught that, in conferring honor the Bible commences with the greatest, in cursing with the least important. Thus, in cursing, God began with the least, cursing first the serpent, then the people. The punishment of the Flood must therefore be meant, as [...] says, [...] "And He blotted out every living substance which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle," [...] starting with the people. In support of the one who said that Eve was created from a face, in [...] the word , wa-yitzer is written with two yuds. But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the word , wa-yitzer as Rabbi Simeon ben Pazzi said, [...] "Woe is me because of my Creator (yotzri), woe is me because of my evil inclination (yitzri)!" [...] In support of the one who said that Eve was created from a face, [...] says, [...] "male and female created He them." [...] But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the words, [...] "male and female created He them," [...] as Rabbi Abbahu explained when he contrasted the words, [...] "male and female created He them," [...] in [...] with the words, [...] "in the image of God made He man," [...] in [...] Rabbi Abbahu reconciled these statements by teaching that at first God intended to create two, but in the end created only one. In support of the one who said that Eve was created from a face, [...] says, [...] "He closed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> with flesh instead thereof." [...] But the one who said Eve was created from a tail explained the words, [...] "He closed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> with flesh instead thereof," [...] as Rabbi Jeremiah (or as some say Rav Zebid, or others say Rav Nahman bar Isaac) said, that these words applied only to the place where God made the cut. In support of the one who said that Eve was created from a tail, [...] says, [...] "God built." [...] But the one who said that Eve was created from a face explained the words [...] "God built" [...] as explained by Rabbi Simeon ben Menasia, who interpreted the words, [...] "and the Lord built the rib," [...] to teach that God braided Eve's hair and brought her to Adam, for in the seacoast towns braiding (keli'ata) is called building (binyata). Alternatively, Rav Hisda said (or some say it was taught in a Baraita) that the words, [...] "and the Lord built the rib," [...] teach that God built Eve after the fashion of a storehouse, narrow at the top and broad at the bottom so as to hold the produce safely. So Rav Hisda taught that a woman is narrower above and broader below so as better to carry children.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the moments}} after Regina {{encouraged}} Zelena {{to pursue a}} relationship with Hades, the move has the outsiders, especially Hook, unhappy with this new development. But before tensions start to reach a boiling point, Hades appears and informs them that Zelena had been kidnapped by Gold and Peter Pan. A note Hades produces makes clear Gold and Pan are using Zelena as leverage in a trade deal for the contract on Gold's unborn child. Hades asks Emma for help by arranging a deal in which she will help him get Zelena back in exchange for Hades erasing the outsiders' names from their gravestones so they can leave the Underworld. At the diner, Hades closes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> so he can meet with Gold and Pan. Zelena, who has been cuffed and prevented from using magic, is with them. Hades agrees to Gold's demands and rips up the contract, only to have Pan add that he will take Zelena's heart {{as part of his}} plan to return to the living. As Pan attempts to rip out Zelena's heart, Emma breaks in through the back door and blasts him with Light Magic, stopping Pan. Gold and Pan leave separately during the confrontation, and without complete satisfaction. As Hades and Zelena are reunited, Hades frees Zelena by removing the cuff, and the two share a kiss. Suddenly Hades' heart begins to beat once again, resulting in a new level of fulfillment in Hades' vision for a [...] "normal" [...] life and leaving the Underworld with Zelena. As part of the arranged deal with Emma along with Hades' new freedom, a portal to Storybrooke can open which will close at sunset. As promised, Hades wipes the outsiders' names off the gravestones. Before the portal opens, Emma attempts to give half her heart to Hook so he can live again and travel through the portal safely, but the process doesn't work. Hades explains that Hook's soul {{might not be able to}} return to a decaying body, because he has been in the Underworld too long. Emma's insistence on a way to bring Hook back leads to Hades telling of a rumor of the only time when someone was able to bring the dead back to life from the Underworld: the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. According to what worked in that tale, Hook must acquire Ambrosia, the food of the gods, to restore his body and be reunited safely with his body; but in order to get to the Ambrosia, Emma has to go deep into the Underworld, and face a test to determine whether her love for Hook is true, by testing her heart. Before Emma and Hook go on their quest, Hades removes Emma's heart so that she can bring it with her for the test that she and Hook will face. The others promise her that they will wait for their return, but must leave by sunset in case Emma and Hook do not succeed.|$|E
