5|$|USB Battery Charging {{defines a}} new port type, the {{charging}} port, {{as opposed to}} the standard downstream port (SDP) of the base specification. Charging ports are divided into 2 further types: the charging downstream port (CDP), which has data signals, and the dedicated charging port (DCP), which does not. Dedicated charging ports can be found on USB power adapters that convert <b>utility</b> <b>power</b> or another power source (e.g., a car's electrical system) to run attached devices and battery packs. On a host (such as a laptop computer) with both standard and charging USB ports, the charging ports should be labeled as such.|$|E

25|$|While a MOV is {{designed}} to conduct significant power for very short durations (about 8 to 20 microseconds), such as caused by lightning strikes, it typically {{does not have the}} capacity to conduct sustained energy. Under normal utility voltage conditions, this is not a problem. However, certain types of faults on the <b>utility</b> <b>power</b> grid can result in sustained over-voltage conditions. Examples include a loss of a neutral conductor or shorted lines on the high voltage system. Application of sustained over-voltage to a MOV can cause high dissipation, potentially resulting in the MOV device catching fire. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has documented many cases of catastrophic fires that have been caused by MOV devices in surge suppressors, and has issued bulletins on the issue.|$|E

2500|$|Commercial {{electric}} <b>utility</b> <b>power</b> {{stations are}} usually constructed {{on a large}} scale and designed for continuous operation. Virtually all Electric power stations use three-phase [...] electrical generators to produce alternating current (AC) electric power at a frequency of 50Hz or 60 Hz. Large companies or institutions may have their own power stations to supply heating or electricity to their facilities, especially if steam is created anyway for other purposes. [...] Steam-driven power stations have been used to drive most ships in most of the 20th century until recently. Steam power stations are now only used in large nuclear naval ships. Shipboard power stations usually directly couple the turbine to the ship's propellers through gearboxes. Power stations in such ships also provide steam to smaller turbines driving electric generators to supply electricity. [...] Nuclear marine propulsion is, with few exceptions, used only in naval vessels. [...] There have been many turbo-electric ships in which a steam-driven turbine drives an electric generator which powers an electric motor for propulsion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{technology}} for pre-combustion is widely applied in fertilizer, chemical, gaseous fuel (H2, CH4), and power production.

The resulting [...] can be captured from a relatively pure exhaust stream. The H2 can now be used as fuel; the carbon dioxide is removed before combustion takes place. There are several advantages and disadvantages when compared to conventional post combustion carbon dioxide capture. The [...] is removed after combustion of fossil fuels, but before the flue gas is expanded to atmospheric pressure. This scheme is applied to new fossil fuel burning power plants, or to existing plants where re-powering is an option.

[...] The program was designed with a payback period of 13 years based upon projected electricity and water savings. The university also completed a study to install a cogeneration unit, which utilizes the heat given off by the natural gas power unit to heat the steam that is piped into campus buildings for climate control.
