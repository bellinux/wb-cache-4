25|$|A rivet is {{essentially}} a two-headed and <b>unthreaded</b> bolt which holds two other pieces of metal together. Holes are drilled or punched through the two pieces of metal to be joined. The holes being aligned, a rivet is passed through the holes and permanent heads are formed onto {{the ends of the}} rivet utilizing hammers and forming dies (by either coldworking or hotworking).|$|E
25|$|The {{bottom bracket}} shell is a short and large {{diameter}} tube, relative to the other tubes in the frame, that runs side to side and holds the bottom bracket. It is usually threaded, often left-hand threaded on the right (drive) side of the bike to prevent loosening by fretting induced precession, and right-hand threaded on the left (non-drive) side. There are many variations, such as an eccentric bottom bracket, which allows for adjustment in tension of the bicycle's chain. It is typically larger, <b>unthreaded,</b> and sometimes split. The chain stays, seat tube, and down tube all typically connect to the {{bottom bracket shell}}.|$|E

25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to <b>unthreaded</b> shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E
50|$|Old USS and SAE {{standards}} defined {{cap screws}} as fasteners with shanks that were threaded {{to the head}} and bolts as fasteners with shanks that were partially <b>unthreaded.</b> The relationship of this rule {{to the idea that}} a bolt by definition takes a nut is clear (because the <b>unthreaded</b> section of the shank, which is called the grip, was expected to pass through the substrate without threading into it). This is now an obsolete distinction, although large bolts still often have <b>unthreaded</b> sections of shank.|$|E

50|$|Bolts in a {{bolted joint}} often have an {{important}} function as a dowel, resisting shear forces. For this reason, many bolts have a plain <b>unthreaded</b> section to their shank.

2500|$|A rotaxane is a {{mechanically}} interlocked molecular architecture {{consisting of}} a [...] "dumbbell shaped molecule" [...] which is threaded through a [...] "macrocycle" [...] (see graphical representation).

40|$|In {{much of her}} writing, Cora Diamond {{stresses}} {{the role of the}} imagination in awakening the sense of our humanity.

Borrowing the notion of 'deflection' from Cavell, Diamond sees ethical understanding 'present only in a diminished and distorted way in philosophical argumentation' (2008, 57). She does, however, herself make a philosophical, if idiosyncratic, use of the imagination in her appeal to it for a 'transitional' understanding of nonsensical Tractarian remarks.

40|$|Transcription {{machinery}} from {{a variety}} of organisms shows striking mechanistic similarity. Both multi- and single subunit RNA polymerases have evolved an 8 – 10 -base pair RNA-DNA hybrid {{as a part of a}} stably transcribing elongation complex. Through characterization of halted complexes that can readily carry out homopolymeric slippage synthesis, this study reveals that T 7 RNA polymerase elongation complexes containing only a 4 -base pair hybrid can nevertheless be more stable than those with the normal 8 -base pair hybrid. We propose that a key feature of this stability is the topological threading of RNA through the complex and/or around the DNA template strand. The data are consistent with forward translocation as a mechanism to allow <b>unthreading</b> of the topological lock, as can occur during programmed termination of transcription...|$|R

40|$|Binuclear {{ruthenium}} complexes {{that bind}} DNA by threading intercalation {{have recently been}} found to exhibit an exceptional kinetic selectivity for long polymeric adenine?thymine (AT) DNA. A series of oligonucleotide hairpin duplexes containing a central tract of 6 ? 44 alternating AT base pairs have here been used to investigate {{the nature of the}} recognition mechanism. We find that, above a threshold AT tract length corresponding to one helix turn of B-DNA, a dramatic increase in threading intercalation rate occurs. In contrast, such length dependence is not observed for rates of <b>unthreading.</b> Intercalation by any mechanism that depends on the open end of the hairpin was found not to be important in the series of oligonucleotides used, as verified by including in the study a hairpin duplex cyclized by a copper-catalyzed “click” reaction. Our observations are interpreted in terms of a conformational pre-equilibrium, determined by the length of the AT tract. We finally find that mismatches or loops in the oligonucleotide facilitate the threading process, of interest for the development of mismatch-recognizing probes...|$|R
40|$|A new {{synthetic}} {{strategy for}} the preparation of cyclodextrin-based rotaxanes is described. The method is essentially based on the formation of stable inclusion complexes between a-CD and aliphatic chains. The interaction in aqueous media of compounds containing a long alkyl chain terminated in a bulky (ferrocenylmethyl) dimethylammonium group with a-CD leads to inclusion complexes in which the cyclodextrh is threaded by the alkyl chain. Functionalization of the other chain terminus with a wboxylic acid group allows trapping of the chain-threaded CD receptor via amidation reactions of the carboxylic functional group with bulky amines. The rotaxane products are asymmetric since the two terminal groups are different. This feature allows, for the first time, the detection of isomeric rotaxanes exhibiting the two possible orientations of the trapped CD. Rotaxanes are interesting supramolecular structures in which a cyclic component (the so-called bead) is threaded by a linear subunit (ref. 1). In order to prevent dissociation between the cyclic and linear components, the latter bears bulky tenninal groups that act as stoppers for the cyclic bead, sterically preventing its dissociation or <b>unthreading.</b> A schematic representation of a rotaxane is shown below. Formally, the bead is bound to the linear thread and the equilibrium associatio...|$|R
40|$|Hydrophobic {{self-assembly}} {{has been}} used to direct the synthesis of conjugated [2] and [3]rotaxanes (20 and 21) in aqueous solution, by Glaser coupling a water-soluble alkyne 3 {{in the presence of a}} cyclophane 6. No rotaxanes were formed when cyclodextrins were used instead of the cyclophane. NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry were used to probe the binding properties of the stopper unit 3. NMR ring current shifts and NOEs show that the cyclophane 6 binds mainly to the terminal phenylene unit of 3. In solution cyclodextrins bind less strongly than the cyclophane, whereas in the gas-phase cyclodextrins bind more strongly. The water-soluble rotaxanes are fully characterised by electrospray mass spectrometry, NMR and UV-VIS emission/absorption. Both rotaxanes tend to fragment, by <b>unthreading</b> and by dumbbell-cleavage, during electrospray ionisation, particularly at high cone voltages. The insulation of the conjugated dumbbell inside the [3]rotaxane results in increased fluorescence efficiency. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements show that these rotaxanes decompose during photolysis to give products with longer fluorescence lifetimes; the rate of this photodecomposition is slower for the [3]rotaxane than for the naked dumbbell. The extension of this synthetic approach to larger polyrotaxanes was explored by coupling alkyne 3 and diethynylbenzene 2 in the presence of cyclophane 6; this gives some longer [2] and [3]rotaxanes but higher polyrotaxanes are not formed...|$|R
