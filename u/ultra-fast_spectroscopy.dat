A goal of this is that energetically deep levels of atoms and molecules can be probed without the need for a very strong IR field. The specifications of the new beamline required that it be entirely housed in a vacuum of pressures on the order of 1 × 10 − 6 mbar. As all of the optics and experimental controls were also in vacuum, electronic feed-throughs were implemented and sophisticated data acquistion software was developed. As the nature of the data collected for these experiments is large in volume, significant time was also spent creating an analysis script to handle the data automatically. This enabled the data to be transmitted amongst experimenters with ease and accuracy. Preliminary experimental results are shown from the beamline, with some possible theoretical explanations investigated. Further theoretical work is required in order to fully interpret the experimental results. Open Acces...|$|E

Some of these experiments can only be carried out if three orthogonal gradients are available, while others can also be implemented using a single gradient, albeit at some expense of performance. This paper discusses some of the advantages of triple- with respect to single-gradient probes. By way of examples we discuss (i) the measurement of small diffusion coefficients making use of the long spin-lattice relaxation times of nuclei with low gyromagnetic ratios γ such as nitrogen- 15, and (ii) the elimination of zero-quantum coherences in Exchange or Nuclear Overhauser Spectroscopy (EXSY or NOESY) experiments, as well as in methods relying on long-lived (singlet) states to study very slow exchange or diffusion processes...|$|E

As a potential glue for superconductivity, spin fluctuations in Mott insulators are of particular interest. A theoretical description of the coupled spin and charge degrees of freedom is challenging, because magnetic order is often only short-lived and short-ranged. In this work we theoretically investigate how the spin-charge interactions influence the relaxation of a two-dimensional Mott-Hubbard insulator after photo-excitation. We use a nonequilibrium variant of the dynamical cluster approximation, which, in contrast to single-site dynamical mean-field theory, captures the effect of short-range correlations. The relaxation time is found to scale with {{the strength of the}} nearest-neighbor spin correlations, and can be 10 – 20 [*]fs in the cuprates. Increasing the temperature or excitation density decreases the spin correlations and thus implies longer relaxation times.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{functionalised}} 1, 3 -dithiole derived donor-π-acceptor systems linked by an alkenic bridge have been synthesised, the acceptor units being dicyanomethylene and cyanoimine. They exhibit intramolecular electron transfer from the electron donor moiety to the electron acceptor moiety. The presence of electron donating substituents on the 1, 3 -dithiole ring increases {{the degree of}} overall charge transfer; this process has been studied by UV-VIS spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. The latter technique indicates {{a significant amount of}} intramolecular electron transfer in the ground state. A selection of functionalised donor-π-acceptor systems linked by an anthracene spacer unit have been prepared which possess greater donor-Ti-acceptor characteristics; however, the degree of electron transfer measured by X-ray crystallography of one derivative appears to be less. The 1, 3 -diselenole donor unit has also been utilised as an electron donor unit in donor-π-acceptor systems however, for all derivatives the diselenole unit is inferior to the 1, 3 - dithiole unit.

40|$|We {{address the}} issue of the {{validity}} of linear response theory for a closed quantum system subject to a periodic external driving. Linear response theory (LRT) predicts energy absorption at frequencies of the external driving where the imaginary part of the appropriate response function is different from zero. Here we show that, for a fairly general non-linear many-body system on a lattice subject to an extensive perturbation, this approximation should be expected to be valid only up to a time t^* depending on the strength of the driving, beyond which the true coherent Schrödinger evolution departs from the linear response prediction and the system stops absorbing energy form the driving. We exemplify this phenomenon in detail with the example of a quantum Ising chain subject to a time-periodic modulation of the transverse field, by comparing an exact Floquet analysis with the standard results of LRT. In this context, we also show that if the perturbation is just local, the system is expected in the thermodynamic limit to keep absorbing energy, and LRT works at all times. We finally argue more generally the validity of the scenario presented for closed quantum many-body lattice systems with a bound on the energy-per-site spectrum, discussing the experimental relevance of our findings in the context of cold atoms in optical lattices and <b>ultra-fast</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> experiments.

TralleroUltra-fast {{spectroscopy}} {{has become}} a common tool for understanding the structure and dynamics of atoms and molecules, {{as evidenced by the}} award of the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Ahmed H. Zewail for his pioneering work in femtochemistry. The use of shorter and more energetic laser pulses have given rise to high intensity table-top light sources in the visible and infrared which have pushed spectroscopic measurements of atomic and molecular systems into the strong-field limit. Within this limit, there are unique phenomena that are still not well understood. Many of such phenomena involve a photoionization step. For three decades, there has been a steady investigation of the single ionization of atomic systems in the strong-field regime both experimentally and theoretically. The investigation of the ionization of more complex molecular systems is of great interest presently and will help with the understanding of <b>ultra-fast</b> <b>spectroscopy</b> as a whole. In this thesis, we explore the single ionization of molecules {{in the presence of a}} strong electric field. In particular, we study molecular isomer pairs, molecules that are the same elementally, but different structurally. The main goal of this work is to compare the ionization yields of these similar molecular pairs as a function of intensity and gain some insight into what differences caused by their structure contribute to how they ionize in the strong-field limit. Through our studies we explore a wavelength dependence of the photoionization yield in order to move from the multi-photon regime of ionization to the tunneling regime with increasing wavelength. Also, in contrast to our strong-field studies, we investigate isomeric molecules in the weak-field limit through single photon absorption by measuring the total ionization yield as a function of photon energy.

Therefore, in selecting new materials for improved light harvesting or higher photovoltage, {{it is essential to}} understand the effect of chemical structure on molecular interactions in order to find ways to control the final blend microstructure. In this thesis, we first address the influence of the number of side chains attached to the fullerene on the microstructure of a regioregular poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) :fullerene blend using transmission electron microscopy, steady-state and <b>ultra-fast</b> photoluminescence <b>spectroscopy</b> and grazing incidence X-Ray diffraction (GIXRD). We investigate the influence of fullerene side chains on the P 3 HT:fullerene binary phase behaviour using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). We relate our findings to the observed optoelectronic properties of the same binary systems. This study highlights the importance of miscibility and crystallisation in microstructure development. Secondly, we seek a spectroscopic probe of the onset of aggregation (or solubility limit) of fullerenes in polymer. We study regiorandom P 3 HT:fullerene blend filmsas a function of fullerene type and content using steady-state and <b>ultra-fast</b> photoluminescence <b>spectroscopy.</b> We relate the onset of fullerene aggregation with the appearance of charge transfer (CT) state emission.

The magnetic field enhancement of the emitted average power in different polarisations and experimental geometries has been studied and is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of a Drude-Lorentz model for the radiation emitted by surface photocurrents. The dependence of the emitted radiation on the sample temperature, the sample doping density and type and the power density of the excitation beam has been studied. The emitted average power was found to decrease rapidly with increasing n-type doping, particularly above doping densities of #approx# 10 " 1 " 8 cm"-" 3. A calibrated Golay cell was used to measure the absolute average power emitted under the different conditions, and the peak average power was measured to be 30 #mu#W for an excitation beam of 1 #centre dot# 2 W average power at 765 nm, and for a sample with a carrier density of 1 #centre dot# 7 x 10 " 1 " 5 cm"-" 3 at 10 K and under the influence of a magnetic field of 5 T. A report of InAs having been used as a source of coherent THz radiation for <b>ultra-fast</b> <b>spectroscopy,</b> to probe optically excited cyclotron resonance in high resistivity silicon is presented.

The temperature dependence of the cyclotron resonance was measured over the range 5 K to 80 K, and a peak is found at #approx# 30 K which can be explained in terms of ionised and neutral impurity scattering at temperatures below 30 K and by phonon scattering above 30 K. The measurement of small amplitude ferromagnetic resonance oscillations in the time domain in thin films of permalloy (78), iron and cobalt has been achieved by using the time resolved magneto-optic Kerr effect.

Mixing and crystallization affect device performance in different ways. These phenomena {{are not easy to}} screen using traditional methods such as imaging. In this paper, the amorphous regiorandom poly(3 -hexylthiophene) is blended with the potentially crystalline fullerene [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester PCBM and the amorphous bis-adduct. First, the degree of mixing of polymer: fullerene blends is evaluated using UV–Vis absorption, steady-state and <b>ultra-fast</b> photoluminescence <b>spectroscopy.</b> The blue-shift of the polymer emission and absorption onset are used in combination with the saturation of the polymer emission decay time upon fullerene addition in order to infer the onset of aggregation of the blends. Second, the crystallinity of the fullerene is probed using variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), electroluminescence and photoluminescence spectroscopy. It is shown that the red-shift of charge transfer emission in the case of PCBM based blends cannot be explained solely by a variation of optical dielectric constant as probed by VASE.

40|$|We {{consider}} continuum dielectric {{models as}} minimal models {{to understand the}} effect of a surrounding globular protein and solvent on the quantum dynamics of electronic excitations in a biological chromophore. We derive expressions for the frequency dependent spectral density which describes the coupling of the electronic levels in the chromophore to its environment. The magnitude and frequency dependence of the spectral density determines whether or not the quantum dynamics is coherent or incoherent, and thus whether on not one can observe quantum interference effects such as Rabi oscillations. We find the contributions to the spectral density from each component of the chromophore environment: the bulk solvent, protein, and water bound to the protein. The relative importance of each component to the quantum dynamics of the chromophore is determined by the dynamics' time scale. Our results provide a natural explanation and model for the different time scales observed in the spectral density extracted from the solvation dynamics probed by <b>ultra-fast</b> laser <b>spectroscopy</b> techniques such as the dynamic Stokes shift and three pulse photon echo spectroscopy. Our results are used to define under what conditions the dynamics of the excited chromophore is dominated by the surrounding protein and when it is dominated by dielectric fluctuations in the solvent. We show that even when the chromophore is shielded from the solvent by the protein ultra-fast solvation can be dominated by the solvent. We suggest that the ultra-fast solvation recently seen in some biological chromophores should not necessarily be assigned to ultra-fast protein dynamics. Spectral densities estimated from our continuum models and extracted from experiment suggest that most quantum dynamics of electronic excitations is incoherent. Comment: 22 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

On the experimental side, <b>ultra-fast</b> pump-probe <b>spectroscopies</b> enable studies of excitation and relaxation phenomena in correlated electron systems, while ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices provide a new way to control and measure the time-evolution of interacting lattice systems with a vastly different characteristic timescale compared to electron systems. A theoretical description of these phenomena is challenging because, firstly, we have to compute the quantum-mechanical time-evolution of many-body systems out of equilibrium, and secondly, deal with strong-correlation effects which can be of nonperturbative nature. In this review, we discuss the nonequilibrium extension of the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), which treats quantum fluctuations in the time domain and works directly in the thermodynamic limit. The method reduces the complexity of the calculation via a mapping to a self-consistent impurity problem. Particular emphasis is placed on a detailed derivation of the formalism, and on a discussion of numerical techniques, which enable solutions of the effective nonequilibrium DMFT impurity problem. We summarize the insights gained into the properties of the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model under strong non-equilibrium conditions.

Despite the high bulk {{electron mobility}}, near-infrared absorption band and compatible energy levels, bulk heterojunction devices fabricated with poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) as the electron donor exhibit power conversion efficiencies of only 0. 2 %. In order to understand this disappointing photovoltaic performance, systematic investigations of the photophysics, device physics and morphology of this system are performed. <b>Ultra-fast</b> transient absorption <b>spectroscopy</b> reveals a two-stage decay process with an initial rapid loss of photoinduced polarons, followed by a second slower decay. This second slower decay is similar to what is observed for efficient P 3 HT:PCBM ([6, 6]-phenyl C 61 -butyric acid methyl ester) blends, however the initial fast decay that is absent in P 3 HT:PCBM blends suggests rapid, geminate recombination of charge pairs shortly after charge transfer. X-ray microscopy reveals coarse phase separation of P 3 HT:P(NDI 2 OD-T 2) blends with domains of size 0. 2 to 1 micrometer.

40|$|The {{ability to}} detect {{infrared}} radiation is vital {{for a host of}} applications that include optical communication, medical diagnosis, thermal imaging, atmospheric monitoring, and space science. The need to actively cool infrared photon detectors increases their operation cost and weight, and the focus of much recent research has been to limit the dark current and create room-temperature infrared photodetectors appropriate for mid-to-long-wave infrared detection. Quantum dot infrared photodetectors (QDIPs) provide electron quantum confinement in three dimensions and have been shown to demonstrate high temperature operation (T> 150 K) due to lower dark currents. However, these inorganic devices have not achieved sensitivity comparable to state-of-the-art photon detectors, {{due in large part to}} the inability to control the uniformity (size and shape) of QDs during strained-layer epitaxy. The purpose of this dissertation research was to investigate the feasibility of room-temperature infrared photodetection that could overcome the shortfalls of QDIPs by using chemically synthesized inorganic colloidal quantum dots (CQDs). CQDs are coated with organic molecules known as surface ligands that prevent the agglomeration of dots while in solution. When CQDs are suspended in a semiconducting organic polymer, these materials are known as organic/inorganic hybrid nanocomposites. The novel approach investigated in this work was to use intraband transitions in the conduction band of the polymer-embedded CQD for room-temperature photodetection in the mid-wave, and possibly long-wave, infrared ranges. Hybrid nanocomposite materials promise room-temperature operation due to: (i) large bandgaps of the inorganic CQDs and the semiconducting polymer that reduce thermionic emission; and (ii) low dark current due to the three-dimensional electron confinement in the CQD and low carrier mobility in the semiconducting polymer. The primary material system investigated in this research was CdSe CQDs embedded in the conjugated polymer poly[2 -methoxy- 5 -(2 '-ethylhexyloxy) - 1, 4 -(1 -cyanovinylene) phenylene] (MEH-CN-PPV). Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of MEH-CN-PPV thin films was conducted to determine the dependence of polymer morphology on deposition method in order to identify a reliable device fabrication technique. Three different deposition methods were investigated: drop-casting and spin-casting, which are solution-based; and matrix-assisted pulsed laser evaporation (MAPLE), which is a vacuum-based method that gently evaporates polymers (or hybrid nanocomposites) and limits substrate exposure to solvents. It was found that MAPLE deposition provides repeatable control of the thin film morphology and thickness, which is important for nanocomposite device optimization. <b>Ultra-fast</b> PL <b>spectroscopy</b> of MEH-CN-PPV/CdSe thin films was investigated to determine the charge generation and relaxation dynamics in the hybrid nanocomposite thin films. The mathematical fitting of time-integrated and time-resolved PL provided a rigorous and unique model of the charge dynamics, which enabled calculation of the radiative and non-radiative decay lifetimes in the polymer and CQD. These results imply that long-lived electrons exist in the conduction band of the CQD, which demonstrate that it should be possible to generate a mid- to long-wave infrared photocurrent based on intraband transitions. In fact, room-temperature, intraband, mid-infrared absorption was measured in thin films of MEH-CN-PPV/CdSe hybrid nanocomposites by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorbance spectroscopy. In addition, the hybrid nanocomposite confined energy levels and corresponding oscillator strengths were calculated in order to model the absorption spectrum. The calculated absorption peaks agree well with the measured peaks, demonstrating that the developed computer model provides a useful design tool for determining the impact of important materials system properties, such as CQD size, organic surface ligand material choice, and conduction band offset due to differences in CQD and polymer electron affinities. Finally, a room-temperature, two terminal, hybrid nanocomposite mid-infrared photoconductor based on intraband transitions was demonstrated by FTIR spectral response measurements, measuring a spectral responsivity peak of 4. 32 µA/W at 5. 5 µm (5 volts), and calibrated blackbody spectral photocurrent measurements, measuring a spectral responsivity peak of 4. 79 µA/W at 5. 7 µm (22 volts). This device characterization demonstrated that while the novel approach of intraband infrared photodetection in hybrid nanocomposites is feasible, significant challenges exist related to device fabrication and operation. Future work is proposed that could address some of these important issues. Dissertatio...|$|R
