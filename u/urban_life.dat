5|$|In the North, {{urbanization}} and {{an unprecedented}} influx {{of immigrants from}} Southern and Eastern Europe supplied a surplus of labor for the country's industrialization and transformed its culture.

5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted {{the demands of}} the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as <b>urban</b> <b>life</b> in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited self-sufficiency of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E

5|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>life</b> is {{concentrated}} in the capital, whose population is mostly engaged in commerce. The other major towns are Sarh, Moundou, Abéché and Doba, which are considerably smaller but growing rapidly in population and economic activity.

5|$|Bashō was {{introduced}} to poetry at a young age, and after integrating himself into the intellectual scene of Edo (modern Tokyo) he quickly became well known throughout Japan. He made {{a living as a}} teacher; but then renounced the social, <b>urban</b> <b>life</b> of the literary circles and was inclined to wander throughout the country, heading west, east, and far into the northern wilderness to gain inspiration for his writing. His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Dooley {{was invented}} by Dunne to replace a similar {{character}} whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained a freedom of expression he often did not have in standard English. The first four years of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, painting a portrait of ethnic <b>urban</b> <b>life</b> unparalleled in 19th-century American literature.|$|E

5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained <b>urban</b> <b>life</b> and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as peas and cabbage to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular writing was also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on <b>urban</b> <b>life,</b> grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E
5|$|Russian {{persecution}} of Sunni Muslim Circassians and Chechens {{led to their}} immigration into the region in 1867, where today they form {{a small part of}} the country's ethnic fabric. Overall population however declined due to oppression and neglect. Urban settlements with small populations included: Al-Salt, Irbid, Jerash and Al-Karak. The under-development of <b>urban</b> <b>life</b> in Jordan was exacerbated by the settlements being sometimes raided. Ottoman oppression provoked the region's both non-Bedouin and Bedouin tribes to revolt, Bedouin tribes like: Adwan, Bani Hassan, Bani Sakhr and the Howeitat. The most notable revolts were the Shoubak Revolt (1905) and the Karak Revolt (1910), which were brutally suppressed. Jordan's location lies on a pilgrimage route taken by Muslims going to Mecca, which helped the population economically when the Ottomans constructed the Hejaz Railway linking Mecca with Istanbul in 1908. Before the construction of the railway, the Ottomans built fortresses along the Hajj route to secure pilgrims' caravans.|$|E

40|$|<b>Urban</b> {{quality of}} <b>life</b> is {{a notion that}} has been {{discussed}} recently in various studies {{as a response to}} many problems facing the new towns all over the world as well as in Egypt. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to decompose the term <b>urban</b> quality of <b>life</b> into other more precise terms such as quality, quality of life and urban/urban planning. The paper also aims to address the notion of sustainable development and tries to understand its relationship with the notion of quality of life. Further, it deduces <b>urban</b> quality of <b>life</b> definition and dimensions. On the other hand this paper discusses contemporary urban planning theories and approaches raised in the late of twentieth century in order to provide a high and sustainable quality of life and protect the natural environment. Finally, a matrix concluding the relationship between the principles of these contemporary urban planning theories and approaches and <b>urban</b> quality of <b>life</b> dimensions is developed, in order to achieve a set of principles that address environmental, physical, mobility, social, psychological, economical and political concerns called <b>urban</b> quality of <b>life</b> principles. These principles represent a guide useful for participants of the design process and for policy makers...|$|R
