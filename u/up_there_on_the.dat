25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on 17 July 2009 {{that the movie}} would be live action, with computer animated effects, and David Frankel as director and Rob Lieber to adapt Magyk. As of 2009, a re-write of the script was being done with screenwriter Mulroney while Warner Brothers were working with a studio to create some early conceptual design/look development. Sage commented: [...] "It is very exciting to know that others are putting their creative input into my work—quite amazing really. [...] I'm {{really looking forward to}} seeing the whole Septimus world <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> big screen coming to life." ...|$|E
500|$|Rivette {{worked with}} scriptwriters Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent using an {{automatic}} writing approach that involved writing the script day by day; {{the actors and}} filmmakers {{did not know the}} direction of the story in advance of each day's filming. Eurimages provided €420,000 of funding in July 2002, and the film was shot that autumn and winter. Rivette immediately thought of Béart, who starred in La Belle Noiseuse, to play the carnal Marie. Béart has said that [...] "Of all the films I've made, this was the one which most disturbed people very close to me. They said: 'It's almost as though the Emmanuelle we know was <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen.'." [...] Béart's image in the media at the time was characterised by the near hysteria seen when she appeared naked on the cover of Elle in May 2003 after filming ended.|$|E
50|$|Down <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eckbach {{floodplain}} lay the municipality’s beginnings. It {{was here}} that the seeds were sown that grew into <b>the</b> village <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Eckbach’s right (south) bank, spreading <b>up</b> from <b>there.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> other hand, archaeological finds {{make it clear that}} this place was settled as early as the Bronze Age.|$|R
6000|$|The {{moment the}} negro had {{departed}} Olive said: [...] "Pick <b>up</b> that air-gun. <b>There,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper step." [...] Then {{she went to}} her uncle and sat down by him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You didn't go <b>on</b> past <b>the</b> melon patch where I {{tried to}} turn Wanderer. It's all burned <b>up</b> from <b>there</b> <b>on</b> to <b>the</b> desert. His other water-wheel has broken down, too," [...] the Inspector replied.|$|R
2500|$|Here's {{one about}} the first horseless {{carriage}} to come to town. ... That Model T got to Melville the way most things did, by steamboat. Papa was at the landing the day it arrived. ... The crew just left her setting <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> levee. Nothing else they could do. The man who had bought her couldn't drive her. He couldn't even start her. Didn't know how to turn the engine over! And {{he was the only}} man in town who had ever even seen a motorcar. ...|$|E
2500|$|... "You get to {{contribute}} so {{significantly in the}} editing room because you shape the movie and the performances," [...] she says. [...] "You help the director bring {{all the hard work}} of those who made the film to fruition. You give their work rhythm and pace and sometimes adjust the structure to make the film work – to make it start to flow <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen. And then it's very rewarding after a year's work to see people react to what you've done in the theater." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ireland {{captain and}} scorer of Ireland's {{goal in the}} {{controversial}} match Robbie Keane criticised the presidents of FIFA and UEFA following the result, claiming they would be 'delighted' that France had gone through. He told BBC Radio Five Live, [...] "They're all probably clapping hands, Platini sitting <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone to Sepp Blatter, probably texting each other, delighted with the result." [...] After Henry's statement, Keane concurred with his call for a replay {{in the interest of}} fair play, stating [...] "On behalf of the Republic of Ireland players, I would like to thank Thierry Henry... As captain of the French team, to make such a statement took courage and honour, and all of us recognise that".|$|E
40|$|The late Sarah Whitecalf {{was born}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moosomin Reserve in Western Saskatchewan in 1919 and grew <b>up</b> <b>there</b> and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nearby Sweet Grass Reserve. Raised {{by her mother}} and grandparents, she was never sent to school and {{remained}} a monolingual speaker of Plains Cree throughout her life. Her last twenty years were spent at Saskatoon, where she became a valued informant for scholars and educators attempting to study or revive Cree traditions...|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in Alexandria, Ontario, the son of Duncan McMillan, and grew <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> McMillan served <b>on</b> <b>the</b> town council for Alexandria. He was an agent for a {{furniture}} and appliance manufacturer. In 1906, he married Flora McDonald.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Black Sheep Boy is a fantastical {{character}} that crops <b>up</b> here and <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album. In the lyrics pretty much anything in quotes {{is the voice}} of the Black Sheep Boy. I {{think a lot of the}} dirtier, rougher, more obtuse songs are the product of the Black Sheep Boy." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. <b>Up</b> <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
6000|$|... 'What's that darned thing <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ceiling? It {{looks like}} a hornet. How on earth do these things get into the house?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I {{know your}} name," [...] she answered. [...] "Could that house be <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{hillside}} {{for more than}} a year without my knowing who lived in it?" [...] With this she went indoors.|$|E
5000|$|... "King of Pain" [...] {{was written}} by Sting, while {{production}} was done by The Police and Hugh Padgham. The song was inspired by his then-recent separation from his first wife. He remarked, [...] "I conjured up symbols of pain and related them to my soul. A black spot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sun struck me as being a very painful image, and I felt that was my soul <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sun. It's just projecting your state {{into the world of}} symbolism, which is what poetry's all about, really." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ye know I've {{got a nice}} spring o' {{cold water}} up by my cabin. Well, some days ago Ham Spink an' thet Dudder boy came <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> an' <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sly caved <b>the</b> spring in <b>on</b> me. I caught 'em coming away. I had my shotgun with me, an' I was mad, good an' proper. I said they must fix the spring or somebuddy'd git shot. They got scart, I kin tell ye, an' they got on their hands an' knees in the sand an' rocks an' mud and worked like beavers till they had the spring fixed. It jest about ruined their clothes, an' when they went off they was as mad as hops. Spink said he would square up, but he's a blower an' I ain't afraid o' him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Avon Vale paid-off at Devonport, and {{was laid}} up in reserve at Plymouth on 10 December 1945. The {{destroyer}} {{was transferred to}} the Sheerness Reserve Fleet after a refit at HM Dockyard Sheerness in 1949. When Sheerness Division was closed, Avon Vale was transferred to Hartlepool and laid <b>up</b> <b>there</b> until placed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Disposal List. [...] The destroyer was sold to BISCO in 1958 for demolition by TA Young at Sunderland. Avon Vale arrived in tow at <b>the</b> breaker's yard <b>on</b> 15 May of that year.|$|R
6000|$|... 'This is {{the street}} of the Golden Lion. This, {{the outside of}} the Golden Lion. The {{interesting}} window <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first Piano, where the pane of glass is broken, is the window of the gentleman's chamber!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'And {{now look}} <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> porch, gents,' says Smoke-'em-out, 'at them disconsolate {{specimens}} of their fair sex {{waiting for the}} arrival of the Duke and the Lieutenant. The house is packed from rafters to cellar with hero worshippers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, go on back an' enjoy yourself," [...] Billy commended. [...] "I'll {{take the}} girls <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side hill {{where we can}} look on. But I won't give much for your good looks if some of them Micks lands on you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Children of that age, Miss Covington, {{have often}} a fancy for hiding themselves; and this child may have hidden somewhere close {{until he saw}} his nurse pass by, and then made off in the {{opposite}} direction. The spot where the child's body was found {{is little more than}} a quarter of a mile from the corner where he was missed. He might have wandered <b>up</b> <b>there,</b> found himself <b>on</b> <b>the</b> canal bank, and childlike, have begun to play, and so slipped into the water." ...|$|R
60|$|The troop, {{joined by}} many of their comrades, who had been at {{different}} times sent down sick and wounded to Madras, formed <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> parade for <b>the</b> last time. They responded with three hearty cheers to the address which Charlie gave them, thanking them for their services, bidding them farewell, and hoping that they would long enjoy the prize money which they had gallantly won. Then they delivered over their horses to the authorities, drew their prize money from the treasury, and started for their respective homes, the English portion taking up their quarters in barracks, until the next ship should sail for England.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think," [...] said M. de La Tour d'Azyr, slowly, [...] "that {{we are at}} cross-purposes. I {{asked you}} to come here because the Chateau de Gavrillac was hardly a {{suitable}} {{place in which to}} carry our discussion further, and because I hesitated to incommode you by suggesting that you should come all the way to Azyr. But my object is connected with certain expressions that you let fall <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> It is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of those expressions, monsieur, that I would hear you further--if you will honour me." ...|$|R
60|$|Skrebensky wandered dazed, {{not knowing}} where he was or {{what he was doing}} with her. All her passion seemed to be to wander <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> downs, and when she must descend to earth, she was heavy. Up there she was exhilarated and free.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{sporting}} proposition all right, all right," [...] Billy considered. [...] "But, just the same, let's turn off an' {{go around the}} block. There's some fellows I know, standin' <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next corner, an' I don't want to knock THEIR blocks off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's Victor, and my mine is <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north-west side. You {{can just}} see the chimney. I've got another year on it, and I'm goin' to raise dirt to beat hell durin' all the time there is left, and then I'm goin' to Denver." ...|$|E
60|$|Now Suzanne {{was left}} alone upon the great veldt, and fear took hold of her, for she was broken in body and mind, and the place was very desolate; also she dreaded lest lions should take her, for she could hear them roaring in the distance, or Swart Piet, who was worse than any lion. Still she was so weary that after washing her face and hands in a spring close by, {{presently}} she fell asleep. When she awoke the east was tinged with the first grey light of the coming dawn, {{and it seemed to}} her as though some cold hand of fear had gripped her heart of a sudden and aroused her from heavy sleep. A sound caused her to look <b>up,</b> and <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crest of the rise before her, some three hundred yards away, she saw dark forms moving, and caught sight of spears that glimmered in the moonlight.|$|R
60|$|It {{was open}} for Maurice {{to join them}} if he chose, {{but he did not}} choose. He had come there ever so much earlier than he need have done, {{dragging}} his aunt with him, because Marian had told him that his services would be specially required by her. And now as soon as she saw him she went away with the two officers!--went away without vouchsafing him a word. He made <b>up</b> his mind, <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> spot, that he would never think of her again--never speak to her otherwise than he might speak to the most indifferent of mortals.|$|R
6000|$|For {{a moment}} the {{attention}} of the telephone clerk was held by the activities of Mr. Tashingford, the chemist, who, regardless of everyone else, was rushing across the road hurling fire grenades into the fire station and running back for more, and then her eyes lifted to the slanting outhouse roof that went up to a ridge behind the parapet of Mantell and Throbson's. An expression of incredulity came into the telephone operator's eyes and gave place to hard activity. She flung up the window and screamed out: [...] "Two people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof <b>up</b> <b>there!</b> Two people <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I kissed her, and she dozed off, whispering, 'It is good.' At the end, that near gone my ear {{was at her}} lips, she roused for {{the last}} time. 'Remember, Tommy; {{remember}} my feather bed.' Then she died, in childbirth, <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Chilcat Station." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I reckon they didn't dare, {{for fear}} somebody'd catch 'em. They was settin' <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fence, an' {{if one of}} the clerks had showed his nose they could have jumped over on the other side mighty quick. I tell you them fellers are up to some mischief." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now supposing, Wilkins," [...] Daylight went on, [...] "supposing you-all knew it {{was going}} to rain soup. What'd you-all do? Buy spoons, of course. Well, I'm sure buying spoons.

50|$|Levels 1, 2 and 4 {{consist of}} {{different}} platforms {{that the mother}} kangaroo must jump onto or climb onto via a ladder. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> third level, the cage in which the kid kangaroo is imprisoned is held up by an entire troop of monkeys {{and there is a}} horde of apples that the monkey will unleash if five of them climb <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> <b>On</b> this level, <b>the</b> mother kangaroo must punch each monkey in the stack several times until the cage is lowered and when the cage has been lowered enough, the mother kangaroo must climb to the next floor to get to the kid kangaroo before the cage is raised again or before the monkeys have an avalanche of apple cores unleashed.|$|R
5000|$|Rancho Paguai, {{named by}} the Mexicans after a local Kumeyaay village, was located {{in what is now}} the valley of Poway Creek and Poway Valley. It was a Mexican land grant rancho, granted by Governor Juan Alvarado Sept. 7, 1839, and {{confirmed}} May 22, 1840, to Rosario E. Aguilar a former Corporal of the San Diego Mission guard and the Majordomo of the Mission in 1838. However Aguilar did not occupy or improve it and so forfeited the grant. He, having received an appointment as Juez de paz in 1841, afterward moved to San Juan Capistrano and took <b>up</b> land <b>there.</b> Details <b>on</b> <b>the</b> extent of the rancho are unknown.|$|R
60|$|We {{reached the}} spot; {{even in that}} light I could see where the iron-stone had been split and fused by the thunderbolts. While I was staring about me, I {{suddenly}} heard the chief, who was on my right, give a low moan, and saw the people cluster round him. I went <b>up</b> and looked. <b>There,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, lay the body of his son. It was a dreadful sight. The hair was burnt off his head, the copper rings upon his arms were fused, the assegai handle which lay near was literally shivered into threads, and, when I took hold of his arm, {{it seemed to me}} that every bone of it was broken.|$|R
