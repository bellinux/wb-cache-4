50|$|A hunting license, {{along with}} a special hunting permit issued by the region of residence, allows to carry hunting weapons only during the hunting season and only within game preserves. When {{transporting}} them outside game reserves, the shotguns must be kept <b>unloaded</b> and <b>locked</b> in their case.|$|R
5000|$|LTC-B: This license allows purchase/possession of {{all high}} {{capacity}} rifles/shotguns and standard (not high) capacity handguns. One may only purchase/possess handguns {{that are not}} on the Large Capacity Weapons Roster, nor {{in the presence of a}} magazine with a capacity of greater than 10 rounds. Handguns must transported <b>unloaded</b> and <b>locked</b> in a case at all times with this license; no ccw is permitted. This license is no longer being issued as of 2015.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concealed}} carry of {{a handgun}} for personal defense purposes is instead illegal unless {{the individual is}} granted a specific license (Porto d'armi per difesa personale, [...] "Self-Defense firearms carry license") which is extremely hard to obtain and is released {{only to those who}} can demonstrate to have a justified reason, and a factual and unarguable need, to carry a concealed firearm for self-defense; such license has to be renewed yearly, whereas all other gun licenses, which allow the purchase, ownership and transport, yet not the carry, of handguns, have a 5-years or 6-years expiry date. Owners of handguns under any other license than a concealed carry license are allowed to detain the firearm at home or in any of their premises for property defense, or to transport it <b>unloaded,</b> <b>locked</b> in a container and possibly partially stripped, to a shooting range or to any other location where target practice or recreational shooting can be safely practiced, but are not allowed to carry their firearm for self-defense, either open or concealed, nor to keep it loaded for any reason in any place other than their home or any of their premises, or outside of an authorized shooting range.|$|R
5000|$|The {{state of}} New York is of {{particular}} concern to interstate motorists who travel with firearms because it separates all six New England states {{from the rest of}} the United States. This means that under the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA), all people traveling through the state with firearms are protected by federal law, however they must have their firearms <b>unloaded</b> and <b>locked</b> in a hard case where they are not readily accessible (e.g. in the trunk of a vehicle).|$|R
5|$|Falls can {{be avoided}} by {{installing}} grab bars in bathrooms and handrails on stairways; removing tripping hazards such as throw rugs; or installing window guards and safety gates {{at the top and}} bottom of stairs around young children. Playgrounds with shock-absorbing surfaces such as mulch or sand also prevent head injuries. Child abuse prevention is another tactic; programs exist to prevent shaken baby syndrome by educating about the dangers of shaking children. Gun safety, including keeping guns <b>unloaded</b> and <b>locked,</b> is another preventative measure. Studies on the effect of laws that aim to control access to guns in the United States have been insufficient to determine their effectiveness preventing number of deaths or injuries.|$|R
5000|$|Whether {{programs}} like Eddie Eagle are effective {{has not been}} conclusively determined. Some studies published in peer-reviewed journals have shown {{that it is very}} difficult for young children to control their curiosity even when they have been taught not to touch firearms. Gun access is also a major risk factor for youth suicide.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advises that keeping a gun in the home, especially a handgun increases the risk of injury and death for children and youth in the home. [...] If families do keep a gun in the home, the AAP advises keeping it <b>unloaded</b> and <b>locked</b> up, with the ammunition locked in a separate location, and the keys to the locked boxes hidden.|$|R
40|$|THE PRESENCE OF A HOUSEHOLDfirearm is associatedwith an in-creased risk {{of suicide}} amongadults and adolescents. 1 - 6 In {{a study of}} suicide attempters and com-pleters, {{investigators}} found that 75 % of the guns were stored in the residence of the victim, friend, or relative. 7 The public health importance of house-hold firearms is a function both of the relative risk of exposure and the preva-lence of firearms in the environment of children and adolescents. 8 Schuster et al 9 estimated from the National Health Interview Survey that 35 % of homes in theUnited Stateswith children younger than 18 years reported owning at least 1 firearm, and that 43 % of these homes had at least 1 unlocked firearm.

40|$|A white-box {{friction}} {{draft gear}} {{model has been}} developed with all components of the draft gear and their geometries considered. The conventional two-stage (loading and unloading) working process of the friction draft gear was detailed as a four-stage process. A preliminary work called the ‘base model’ was improved with regard to force–displacement characteristics, friction modelling and transitional characteristics. A set of impact test data were analysed; five types of draft gear behaviour were identified and modelled: hysteresis, stiffening, change of stage, <b>locked</b> <b>unloading</b> and softening. Simulated comparisons of three draft gear models were presented: a look-up table model, the base model and the advanced model...|$|R
40|$|Although safe firearm {{storage is}} a {{promising}} injury prevention strategy, many {{parents do not}} keep their firearms <b>unloaded</b> and <b>locked</b> up. Using the theory of planned behavior as a guiding conceptual framework, this study examines factors associated with safe storage among married women with children and who have firearms in their homes. Data come from a national telephone survey (n[*]=[*] 185). We examined beliefs about defensive firearm use, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and firearm storage practices. A Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test was conducted to assess associations between psychosocial factors and firearm storage practices. Women were highly motivated to keep firearms stored safely. Those reporting safe storage practices had more favorable attitudes, more supportive subjective norms and higher perceptions of behavioral control than those without safe storage. One-fourth believed a firearm would prevent a family member from being hurt {{in case of a}} break-in, 58 % believed a firearm could scare off a burglar. Some 63 % said they leave decisions about firearm storage to their husbands. Women were highly motivated to store firearms safely as evidenced by favorable attitudes, supportive subjective norms and high perceptions of behavioral control. This was especially true for those reporting safer storage practices...|$|R
5000|$|Cook County {{has banned}} the {{possession}} of certain semi-automatic firearms that it has defined as assault weapons. [...] Residents must report to the county sheriff within 48 hours any firearms that are stolen, lost, destroyed, or sold or otherwise transferred. The sheriff may share this information with other law enforcement agencies. Licensed firearms dealers must provide information to the county regarding purchasers and the guns they purchase, and receive approval before conducting sales. An individual may not purchase more than one firearm in a 30-day period. In a home where a person younger than 21 is present, all guns must be secured with a trigger <b>lock,</b> or stored <b>unloaded</b> in a <b>locked</b> container separate from the ammunition, or secured {{to the body of}} the legal owner. [...] In Cook County, local laws, such as those of Chicago, take precedence over county laws that regulate similar matters. [...] Cook County imposes a twenty-five dollar tax on the sale of any firearm by a retail dealer, in addition to the usual county sales tax. The county also has a tax on the sale of ammunition — five cents per round for centerfire ammunition and one cent per round for rimfire ammunition.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{determined}} the prevalence and storage patterns of firearms in US homes with children. METHODS: We analyzed {{data from the}} 1994 National Health Interview Survey and Year 2000 objectives supplement. A multistage sample design was used to represent the civilian noninstitutionalized US population. RESULTS: Respondents from 35 % of the homes with children younger than 18 years (representing more than 22 million children in more than 11 million homes) reported having at least 1 firearm. Among homes with children and firearms, 43 % had at least 1 unlocked firearm (i. e., not in a locked place and not locked with a trigger lock or other locking mechanism). Overall, 9 % kept firearms unlocked and loaded, and 4 % kept them unlocked, unloaded, and stored with ammunition; thus, a total of 13 % of the homes with children and firearms [...] 1. 4 million homes with 2. 6 million children [...] stored firearms in a manner most accessible to children. In contrast, 39 % of these families kept firearms <b>locked,</b> <b>unloaded,</b> and separate from ammunition. CONCLUSIONS: Many children live in homes with firearms that are stored in an accessible manner. Efforts to prevent children's access to firearms are needed...|$|R
