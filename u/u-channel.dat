Magnetostratigraphy from <b>u-channel</b> samples are compared with shipboard data that were based on blanket demagnetization at peak AF fields of 20 mT. <b>U-channel</b> measurements add more detail to the magnetostratigraphic record and allow identification of thin polarity zones especially in {{the upper part of the}} section were the sedimentation rates are very low (~ 2 m/Myr). The component magnetization directions determined from <b>u-channel</b> measurements also gave more reliable and precise estimates of inclination (paleolatitude).
