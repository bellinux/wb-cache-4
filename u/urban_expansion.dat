5|$|Many of the fortifications {{built by}} the Romans in England survived into the Middle Ages, {{including}} the walls surrounding their military forts and cities. These defences were often reused during the unstable post-Roman period. The Anglo-Saxon kings undertook significant planned <b>urban</b> <b>expansion</b> in the 8th and 9th centuries, creating burhs, often protected with earth and wood ramparts. Burh walls sometimes utilised older Roman fortifications, both for practical reasons and to bolster their owners' reputations through the symbolism of former Roman power.|$|E

This paper investigates integrated urbanization trends in Kabul city since {{the formation of the}} basic structure of the present city using GIS and remote sensing. This study explores the spatial and temporal difference of <b>urban</b> land <b>expansion</b> and land use categories among different time intervals, 1964 - 1978 and 1978 - 2008 from 1964 to 2008 in Kabul city.

40|$|Urban {{development}} in China has attracted considerable scholarly attention. However, more work is {{still needed to}} examine and understand the mechanisms of <b>urban</b> land <b>expansion,</b> especially {{within the context of}} globalization/marketization, decentralization and urbanization. This paper analyzes <b>urban</b> land <b>expansion</b> and structural changes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). We find that cities in the YRD are experiencing <b>urban</b> land <b>expansion</b> mainly characterized by the growth of residential and industrial land. The dominant characteristics of <b>urban</b> land <b>expansion</b> in cities have also varied within different development and administrative levels. Based on our conceptual framework, we have used multi-models to investigate the driving forces of <b>urban</b> land <b>expansion</b> and structural changes in the YRD. The results reveal that six influencing factors—foreign direct investment (FDI), labor, government competition, institution, population, and job-housing relations—facilitate land use change in the economic transition process. However, their impacts differ in cities in different geographical locations, as well as with different administrative levels. Finally, this paper discusses policies to promote sustainable urban land use in the YRD...|$|R

5|$|Bedford Castle {{was a large}} medieval {{castle in}} Bedford, England. Built after 1100 by Henry I, the castle played a {{prominent}} part in both the civil war of the Anarchy and the First Barons' War. The castle was significantly extended in stone, although the final plan of the castle remains uncertain. Henry III of England besieged the castle in 1224 following a disagreement with Falkes de Breauté; the siege lasted eight weeks and involved an army {{of as many as}} 2,700 soldiers with equipment drawn from across England. After the surrender of the castle, the king ordered its destruction. Although partially refortified in the 17th century during the English Civil War, the castle remained a ruin until the <b>urban</b> <b>expansion</b> in Bedford during the 19th century, when houses were built across much of the property. Today only part of the motte still stands, forming part of an archaeological park built on the site between 2007 and 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{urban area}} has a {{population}} density of 3035/km2 (7,864/mi²), while the rural and suburban areas have a density of 355.5/km2 (920/mi²). The rural areas {{away from the city}} tend to be scarcely populated, becoming denser near it. During the summer the resident population in the city triples; this seasonal movement from neighbouring cities is due to the draw of the beach and 29.9% of homes had seasonal use in 2001, the highest in Greater Porto. Póvoa de Varzim is the youngest city in the region with a birth rate of 13.665 and mortality rate of 8.330. Unlike other urban areas of greater Porto, it is not a satellite city.

5|$|The {{museum is}} housed in the Louvre Palace, {{originally}} built as a fortress in the late 12thcentury under PhilipII. Remnants of the fortress are visible {{in the basement of}} the museum. Due to the <b>urban</b> <b>expansion</b> of the city, the fortress eventually lost its defensive function and, in 1546, was converted by Francis I into the main residence of the French Kings. The building was extended many times to form the present Louvre Palace. In 1682, Louis XIV chose the Palace of Versailles for his household, leaving the Louvre primarily as a place to display the royal collection, including, from 1692, a collection of ancient Greek and Roman sculpture. In 1692, the building was occupied by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres and the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture, which in 1699 held the first of a series of salons. The Académie remained at the Louvre for 100 years. During the French Revolution, the National Assembly decreed that the Louvre should be used as a museum to display the nation's masterpieces.|$|E

This paper examines the 100 -year history of <b>urban</b> spatial <b>expansion</b> of Xiamen Island, China. The island's <b>urban</b> spatial <b>expansion</b> was analyzed by a land use changes matrix and a land use intensity index (LUII) with special {{focus on the}} last 30 years. The impacts of <b>urban</b> spatial <b>expansion</b> on the island ecosystem, in terms of ecosystem service and landscape pattern, were quantitatively studied. The results reveal that <b>urban</b> spatial <b>expansion</b> of Xiamen Island has utilized large areas of woodland, farmland, water area and coastal wetland, which caused continuous increase of LUII, the decrease in ecosystem service value, and significant fragmentation in the landscape pattern. Our study suggests landscape pattern analysis and ecosystem service valuation are two powerful tools that can ensure a holistic and integrative decision making in regulating spatial coastal urbanization.

40|$|Studies {{about changes}} between land uses and land covers {{have been a}} growing field of {{research}} in recent decades, as they help the planning {{and management of the}} territory, serving as a basis for planning future actions. This paper aims to locate the <b>urban</b> <b>expansions</b> in relief, using three temporal scenarios (Landsat TM 5 images dated from 1985, 1994 and 2011) and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from SRTM. The studied area corresponds to the city of Petrópolis, in the highlands of the state of Rio de Janeiro, an area that historically suffers from disordered occupations and mass movements. Thematic maps were generated by remote sensing techniques, with an object-oriented classification, fuzzy modeling and hierarchy between classes. The urbanizations were mapped using geoprocessing tools for the intersection of these data. Subsequently, these trajectories were analyzed for their location in the relief, with the support of a DEM clipped to the studied area. 2628 hectares of changes were detected, being 1221 hectares corresponding to <b>urban</b> <b>expansions</b> (412 hectares between 1985 and 1994 and 799 hectares between 1994 and 2011).

40|$|Urban {{growth is}} a process that imposes {{profound}} physical and socioeconomic restructuring on cities. <b>Urban</b> land <b>expansion</b> as an immediate physical manifestation of urban growth has been extensively studied using a variety of remote sensing methods. However, little research addresses the interactions between <b>urban</b> land <b>expansion</b> and corresponding activity changes, especially at local scales. We propose an innovative analytical framework that integrates Landsat and nighttime light data to capture the parcel-level relationships between <b>urban</b> land <b>expansion</b> and activity changes. The urban land data are acquired based on the classification of Landsat images, whereas the activity changes are approximated by the nighttime light data. Using the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) (local Moran’s I) approach, four types of local relationships between land expansion and activity changes are defined at the parcel level. The proposed analytical framework is applied in Guangzhou, China, as a case study. The results reveal the mismatched growth between urban land and activity intensity at the parcel level, where the increase in urban land area outpaces the increase of activity intensity. Such results are expected to provide a more comprehensive understanding of urban growth, and can be used to assist urban planning and related decision-making...|$|R
