5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an <b>unidentified</b> <b>police</b> <b>officer</b> investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being the informant by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being the informant by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being the informant.|$|E

A total of 34 rounds were fired during the shooting spree: eleven at the administrative office, nine at the motor pool building, five at the medical building, and nine from inside his car.

40|$|Despite {{gains in}} the {{percentage}} of female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> over past decades, female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> are vastly underrepresented in modern <b>policing.</b> Female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> face barriers to integration into policing and the surrounding culture that male <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> do not face, including unbalanced physical testing, double standards for success, and others. One explanation for the different experiences of female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> compared to male <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> is the token status of women in policing. Instead of taking the token status of female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> for granted, this study explored the utility of the theory of tokenism (Kanter, 1977) in explaining the experiences of female <b>police</b> <b>officers</b> in Midwestern <b>police</b> agencies.
