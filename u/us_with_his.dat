He moved to the <b>US</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> parents in 1855, {{at the age of}} two. He grew up in the mining towns of Murphy's Camp, California and Virginia City, Nevada, where his father was a merchant.

He spent his high school years in San Francisco in the home of his aunt, Henriette Levy (née Michelson), who was the mother of author Harriet Lane Levy.|$|E

25|$|In DuPont's Central Research and Development Department, Arduengo {{began his}} career in the Chemical Sciences Section (1977 & on return in 1984). In 1988 he was {{appointed}} Research Leader. A move into the Polymer Science section of CR in 1991 was accompanied by promotion to Group Leader. His final position with DuPont was as Research Fellow which he attained in 1995. The award of an Alexander von Humboldt Senior Research Prize in 1996 began Arduengo's transition back into academe. The one year Humboldt award was spent in Braunschweig, Germany at the Technical University. On return to DuPont, Arduengo maintained a guest Professor appointment in Braunschweig, and in 1999 also made the transition to academe in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> assumption of the Saxon Chair in Chemistry at The University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Don Azpiazú had {{the first}} million-selling record of Cuban music: The Peanut Vendor (El Manisero), with Antonio Machín as the singer. This number had been orchestrated and {{included}} in N.Y. theatre by Azpiazú before recording, which no doubt helped with the publicity. The Lecuona Cuban Boys became the best-known Cuban touring ensemble: {{they were the ones}} who first used the conga drum in their conjunto, and popularized the conga as a dance. Xavier Cugat at the Waldorf Astoria was highly influential. In 1941 Desi Arnaz popularized the comparsa drum (similar to the conga) in the <b>U.S</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> performances of Babalú. There was a real 'rumba craze' at the time. Later, Mario Bauza and Machito set up in New York and Miguelito Valdés also arrived there.|$|E

Sunny Kurishingal, Kory's chief adviser, {{is running out of}} ideas to ensure Kory's victory. Sunny asks Francis Kunjappan, a Public Works Department minister in Kerala and his friend, for advice on hiring a political consultant. Kunjappan, recommends his friend (and political rival) Jagannathan, hoping to rid himself of a threat to his ministerial position. Jagannathan, a young politician and sports enthusiast, knows no English but has a talent for solving serious problems prudently (as Kunjappan knows firsthand). However, Kunjappan thinks that Jaganathan’s unorthodox ideas will fail in the United States. Kunjappan meets Jagannathan and offers him the job for 30 crore (300 million), enough to realize Jagannathan's dream project of a sports academy. Jagannathan accepts the assignment and flies to the <b>US</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> assistants, Pottakuzhi Jabbar and Vayalar Varkey.|$|E

25|$|In 1940, as the European {{political}} situation worsened after {{the outbreak of}} World War II, Bartók was increasingly tempted to flee Hungary. He was strongly opposed to the Nazis and Hungary's siding with Germany. After the Nazis {{came to power in}} the early 1930s, Bartók refused to give concerts in Germany and broke away from his publisher there. His anti-fascist political views caused him a great deal of trouble with the establishment in Hungary. Having first sent his manuscripts out of the country, Bartók reluctantly emigrated to the <b>U.S.</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> wife Ditta in October that year. They settled in New York City after arriving on the night of October 29–30, 1940 via a steamer from Lisbon. After joining them in 1942, their son, Péter Bartók, enlisted in the United States Navy where he served in the Pacific during the remainder of the war and later settled in Florida where he became a recording and sound engineer. His oldest son, Béla Bartók III, remained in Hungary where he survived the war and later worked as a railroad official until his retirement in the early 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Frank Dekum (November 5, 1829 – [...] October 19, 1894) was a {{prominent}} 19thcentury fruit merchant, banker, and real-estate investor in Portland, Oregon. [...] Born in Germany, Dekum emigrated to the north-central <b>U.S.</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> family and {{as a young man}} went west in search of gold before starting a successful fresh-fruit business in Portland. Prospering as a merchant, Dekum invested in real-estate, banking, and an early railroad, was a president or board member of many of the city's companies, and was one of 15men named to Portland's first municipal water committee.|$|E

500|$|George Hertzberg, a University of Southern California {{graduate}} {{with experience in}} sitcoms and commercials, was chosen based on one of Adam's monologues he was given to read for the audition. Hertzberg counted luck and being {{in the right place}} at the right time in helping him get the role. Many recurring characters on Buffy start with one or two episodes, and when the writers or producers like their chemistry with other actors, they often make them a regular part of the cast. Hertzberg, however, understood at his reading that Adam was to be a major part of the fourth season. Casting Director Amy Britt needed someone physically imposing for the part, with the [...] Hertzberg fitting the bill. Britt stated, [...] "this is a guy we're going to want eventually to have some affinity for. We can't just see him as an evil being. He is evil to the core [...] should scare <b>us</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> actions; but there's also innocence. Like the Frankenstein monster, you realize that they're only doing what they know. Or what they've been programmed to do. These aren't born creatures, these are creations." ...|$|E
500|$|Skelton's {{contract}} {{called for}} MGM's approval {{prior to his}} radio shows and other appearances. When he renegotiated his long-term contract with MGM, he wanted a clause that permitted him to remain working in radio {{and to be able}} to work on television, which was then largely experimental. [...] At the time, the major work in the medium was centered in New York; Skelton had worked there for some time and was able to determine that he would find success with his physical comedy through the medium. By 1947, Skelton's work interests were focused not on films, but on radio and television. His MGM contract was rigid enough to require the studio's written consent for his weekly radio shows, as well as any benefit or similar appearances he made; radio offered fewer restrictions, more creative control and a higher salary. Skelton asked for a release from MGM after learning he could not raise the $750,000 needed to buy out the remainder of his contract. He also voiced frustration with the film scripts he was offered while on the set of The Fuller Brush Man, saying, [...] "Movies are not my field. Radio and television are." [...] He did not receive the desired television clause nor a release from his MGM contract. [...] In 1948, columnist Sheilah Graham printed that Skelton's wishes were to make only one film a year, spending the rest of the time traveling the <b>U.S.</b> <b>with</b> <b>his</b> radio show.|$|E
