[...] Jeanie summarizes everyone's romantic entanglements: [...] "I'm hung up on Claude, Sheila's hung up on Berger, Berger is hung <b>up</b> <b>everywhere.</b> Claude is hung up on a cross over Sheila and Berger." [...] The tribe runs out to the audience with fliers inviting them to a Be-In.

[...] After young and innocent Crissy describes [...] "Frank Mills", a boy she's looking for, the tribe participates in the [...] "Be-In". [...] The men of the tribe burn their draft cards. [...] Claude puts his card in the fire, then changes his mind and pulls it out. [...] He asks, [...] "where is the something, where is the someone, that tells me why I live and die?" [...] ("Where Do I Go"). [...] The tribe emerges naked, intoning [...] "beads, flowers, freedom, happiness." ...|$|E

As the guards slept, the Rebbe passed the word around: [...] "Everyone should dig beneath himself. God's salvation comes {{in the blink of an}} eye." [...] Each prisoner began to dig with his fingers, spoons, or pieces of wood. Remarkably, each found water, and small springs began to pop <b>up</b> <b>everywhere,</b> quenching everyone's thirst and giving them new life. [...] Many years later, the Rebbe explained why he himself didn't drink from the water because the date was 9th Av, a traditional day of fasting to commemorate the destruction of the temple.|$|E

[...] The newspaper wrote that [...] "Ultimately the JIDF also wants to propagate ‘Jewish values on the Internet’. This leads to the self-appointed warriors against online-hatred to link their own homepage to a dubious site named ‘thereligionofpeace.com’. The JIDF website itself says [...] "Mohammed was a genocidal pedophile who murdered people who didn't think like he did, or believe the things he believed.

[...] The website says that Mohammad was a [...] "false prophet" [...] and that the [...] "Islamic ideology itself is clearly one of hatred and violence, which is declaring war against the entire non-Islamic world... it is determined to dominate the world, just as Nazism was." [...] The website came out against plans to build an Islamic cultural center near Ground Zero in New York, and said this was the reason why. [...] "Because Islam is a hateful and violent ideology which preaches hate and violence against ALL non-Muslims (especially Jews, as it is obsessed with us, and dehumanizes us as apes and pigs), we are against ALL mosques.

2500|$|The Confederacy {{started its}} {{existence}} as an agrarian economy with exports, {{to a world}} market, of cotton, and, to a lesser extent, tobacco and sugarcane. Local food production included grains, hogs, cattle, and gardens. The cash came from exports but the Southern people spontaneously stopped exports in early 1861 to hasten the impact of [...] "King Cotton". When the blockade was announced, commercial shipping practically ended (the ships could not get insurance), and only a trickle of supplies came via blockade runners. The cutoff of exports was an economic disaster for the South, rendering useless its most valuable properties, its plantations and their enslaved workers. Many planters kept growing cotton, which piled <b>up</b> <b>everywhere,</b> but most turned to food production.

Joachim, {{the father of the}} Virgin Mary, was portrayed on the coin along with the Bohemian lion. Similar coins began to be minted in neighbouring valleys rich in silver deposits, each named after the particular 'thal' or valley from which the silver was extracted. There were soon so many of them that these silver coins began to be known more widely as 'thaler' in German and 'tolar' in the Czech language.|$|E

The {{death toll}} {{was considered to}} be between 10,000 and 30,000the exact number of casualties is difficult to determine as there was no reliable census data, especially about shanty towns and small communities that were completely wiped out; moreover, only some 1,000 bodies were recovered, with the rest swept to sea by the mud or buried in the landslides. More than 8,000 homes and 700 apartment buildings were destroyed in Vargas displacing up to 75,000 people. The mudslides significantly altered more than [...] of the coastline in Vargas. Over 70% {{of the population of the}} state of Vargas was affected by the disaster.

2500|$|Avilla fended off {{and avoided}} {{destruction}} during the Civil War, {{and was an}} overnight boom town during the Reconstruction Era at war's end. [...] Merchandise and construction materials were hauled by wagon train from Sedalia, Missouri, the closest railroad shipping point to Avilla. [...] Much of Jasper County lay in ruins, and local merchants and businessmen grew wealthy during the rebuilding of Carthage, Sarcoxie, and other nearby war-damaged communities. [...] Many old time residents later claimed that Avilla had actually been the largest operating town in Jasper County after hostilities ended, for a short time. [...] Commerce even came {{from as far away}} as Kansas, by farmers traveling to Avilla to buy seed, building supplies and provisions. [...] Captain Thomas Jefferson Stemmons, a Union commander and son of the late Dr. J.M. Stemmons, returned home to Avilla and started a mercantile with partner D. B. Rives, which was the first new business established after the Civil War. [...] The first hotel was called The Avilla House and was erected two years later in 1868 by Justice Hall. [...] Through the 1870s and 1880s there were two general stores (dry goods & clothing), two grocery stores, one or more doctor's offices, one [...] "notion" [...] (sewing) store, two boot & shoe stores, one livery & feed stable, three churches, a drug store, a Grand Army of the Republic post (GAR) and two [...] "secret societies": the Freemasons Lodge and the Independent Order of Odd Fellows Lodge (IOOF) and houses sprang <b>up</b> <b>everywhere.</b> [...] Located at what is now named [...] "School Street", the first Avilla school in town was built in the 1880s and taught grades 1–12 (called lower, upper and high school). Sources disagree, but some documents cite the town's population at over five hundred during these years, not including families on the farms encircling just beyond the town limits. [...] Despite the initial spurt after the Civil War, growth of the town was stunted because the railroad was not built through Avilla. [...] Farmland was the primary natural resource and without industry the population never increased after this time, and regular stage lines were eventually discontinued.|$|E
