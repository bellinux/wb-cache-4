2500|$|We cannot {{live without}} you, nor you without us. Then believe that {{separation}} has shown to <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot stand without {{the brain and}} {{the philosophy of the}} Brahman , nor we without your heart. This separation between the Buddhist and the Brahman [...] is the cause of the downfall of India. That is why India has been the slave of conquerors for the past 1000 years. Let us then join the wonderful intellect of the Brahman [...] with the heart, the noble soul, the wonderful humanising power of the Great Master.|$|E
2500|$|In Australia, {{the effects}} of the war on the economy were no less severe. The Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes, wrote to the British prime minister, Lloyd George, [...] "You have assured <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot get better terms. I much regret it, and hope even now that some way may be found of {{securing}} agreement for demanding reparation commensurate with the tremendous sacrifices made by the British Empire and her Allies." [...] Australia received ₤5,571,720 war reparations, but the direct cost of the war to Australia had been ₤376,993,052, and, by the mid-1930s, repatriation pensions, war gratuities, interest and sinking fund charges were ₤831,280,947. Of about 416,000 Australians who served, about 60,000 were killed and another 152,000 were wounded.|$|E
2500|$|On 20 December Mitchel made {{an appeal}} to the Protestants of Ireland to join their fellow countrymen. In the article [...] "The Protestant Interest" [...] he pointed to the efforts of the Whig leaders to win support in Ireland by the promise of {{gratuity}} and places. [...] "But, Protestants of Ireland, shall it be so? Is it not time for all to rise above such vile influences as these? Does not our national interest, our national honour (for, after all, we are a nation), demand that we spurn the mean practice of both these foreign factions! that we shuffle off the coil of filthy place-hunting politics, that has kept us so long grovelling in the dust!... Ah! if you would hearken to us – and a hope dawns upon <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will – if the Protestant magnates of the land would even now place themselves at the head of our national Confederacy, and, in this inter-regnum of foreign rule, would meet us as brothers." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. LUNN [to Mrs. Juno] I hope you'll {{come and}} stay with <b>us</b> now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and Gregory are such friends, Mrs. Juno.|$|R
60|$|Pala. Us! the devil's in me for mistaking:--me, I meant. Or <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>you</b> are me, or I you, {{as we are}} friends: <b>That's</b> <b>us.</b>|$|R
6000|$|CONRAD. Aha! What {{consolation}} {{will it be}} for <b>us</b> then <b>that</b> <b>you</b> two {{are able}} to tell off one another's defects so cleverly in your afternoon chat? ...|$|R
2500|$|The Washington Herald {{published}} {{an interview with}} Kellogg where she supported women's suffrage, emphasizing Iroquois women's equality of civic powers with the men. Female leaders among the Oneida were not uncommon. [...] "It is a cause of astonishment to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> white women are only now, in this twentieth century, claiming {{what has been the}} Indian woman's privilege as far back as history traces." [...] The Iroquois had a communal system of land distribution and the tribe gave tracts to clans for further distribution among households for cultivation. Clan Mothers decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used. Since land tracts were the concern of the women, it was the women's job to cultivate food and not the men, [...] The Clan Mothers' Council also reserved certain areas of land to be worked by the women of all the different clans. Food from such lands, called kěndiǔ"gwǎ'ge' hodi'yěn'tho, would be used at festivals and large council gatherings.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have only}} told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> didn't find the train-wreckers, {{and you know}} we are just dying with curiosity," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "We were {{watching}} you, dear," [...] Lenora said quietly. [...] "Somehow it didn't seem to <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were particularly {{anxious to get}} away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Therefore, Florence, pray let <b>us</b> see <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have some}} {{strength}} of mind, {{and do not}} selfishly aggravate the distress in which your poor Papa is plunged.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've had {{visits from}} lady clients before," [...] he replied. [...] "Let <b>us</b> assume <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have come to}} consult me about an eight-roomed villa at Cropstone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it wasn't a fat man, anyhow. We don't {{need your}} deductions, Mr. Holmes, to tell <b>us</b> <b>that.</b> But <b>you</b> or I could squeeze through all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Masouda, {{the lady}} Rosamund's waiting woman, warned <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you,</b> lord, and we, {{were to be}} murdered tonight by eight men, so we made ready." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{had always}} been very good to us, and that you had been our {{guardian}} ever since we lost our mother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> took a boy, {{and when}} he looked in a magic mirror, he saw things which he could not {{possibly}} have known.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you ever}} tell <b>us</b> before <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could sing?" [...] he asked one day, as Old Mr. Toad {{looked up at}} him from the Smiling Pool.|$|R
60|$|But, again, {{there is}} this mountain-range between <b>us</b> - <b>THAT</b> <b>YOU</b> DO NOT BELIEVE ME. It is not flattering, but the fault is {{probably}} in my literary art.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. You've told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> once <b>you</b> were a {{prisoner}} among the Fung and thrown to these holy lions, but got out. Now just explain what happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear {{it will be}} a {{very great}} confusion--this general election," [...] she said. [...] "Papa was telling <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think of being a candidate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt, Sir Griffin. And so is {{the other}} nonsense. Do {{you mean to tell}} <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> believe that Lady Eustace stole her own diamonds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Duke, this I'd say: [...] Events {{suggest to}} <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> come up [...] With all your force, behind the village here, [...] And act as our reserve.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. It {{was ridiculous}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should be {{compelled}} to walk, perfectly ridiculous. It was grossly careless of my nephew not to let <b>us</b> know <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were coming. My wife told him so in the car." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{way or the}} other," [...] they said, {{in their}} blunt country fashion. [...] "Let <b>us</b> hear <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are betrothed to Marie, or let us never see your face again." ...|$|R
5000|$|... Australia {{supported}} the campaign. Prime Minister John Howard stated that, [...] "history has told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> sit by and do nothing, {{you pay a}} much greater price later on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Nelson tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were unwise {{enough to}} express an opinion {{as to the}} honesty of the Portuguese escort that he {{proposed}} to send with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} that you English were flatterers," [...] she said. [...] "They told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were uncouth islanders, but I see that they have calumniated you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mean! I {{more than}} mean! Didn't you tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{had been to}} see the old party on business, and had spied the hackles walking about in his yard?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Joan, <b>you</b> told <b>us</b> {{yourself}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{were going}} to Uncle Laxart's to nurse his wife, but you didn't say you were going further, yet you did go on to Vaucouleurs. There!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it {{was much}} better for <b>us</b> both <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should sleep," [...] he said, [...] "and it is the horse <b>that</b> is {{carrying}} <b>you,</b> not I. I have been very comfortable, I can assure you.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let <b>us</b> hope <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are, my boy," [...] said Uncle Chris gravely. [...] "For in {{that case}} I should be forced into {{a course of action}} from which I confess that I shrink." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{are taking}} {{advantage}} of Mr. Winslow's goodness,' said the old Rector. 'He assured <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would be kind enough to receive those who would only be an encumbrance.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{that would}} have been worse. I hate being put anywhere,--as if I were a sheep. It seems so odd to <b>us,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> here should be all so tame." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is time to}} start, Macumazahn, and I {{think you}} told <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would prefer to do so on your feet," [...] said Goza, looking suggestively at his spear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, on yours. When we {{told him}} of your kind language, he at once assured <b>us</b> all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had the power, and, if you had promised, would have the inclination, to procure Henry's pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear husband," [...] {{she said}} almost cheerfully, [...] "I {{have come to}} nurse you. You see {{when you get into}} trouble it is <b>us</b> women <b>that</b> <b>you</b> men fall back upon after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will tell}} us who has betrayed us," [...] said the German. [...] "But that shall not save you--oh, no! You shall tell <b>us</b> all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> know. Boris, here, knows pretty ways of making people speak!" ...|$|R
