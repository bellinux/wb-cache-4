40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} microenterprise credit programs on class structure mobility in developing countries. The paper develops a model that endogenously generates an eight-fold class structure. Class membership is determined by optimal choice of labour activity, which {{is a function of}} access to credit and human capital endowments. Predictions from the model suggest that better access to credit will foster <b>upward</b> class <b>mobility</b> among self-employed entrepreneurs, and that this <b>upward</b> class <b>mobility</b> will be accentuated among entrepreneurs with high levels of human capital. Theoretical predictions from the model are compared with data on class structure mobility collected first-hand in western Guatemala. Empirical results show that <b>upward</b> class structure <b>mobility</b> increases substantially with access to credit, and also suggest that the combined effect of innate entrepreneurial ability and credit access has a greater impact on <b>upward</b> class structure <b>mobility</b> than the interaction between formal schooling and credit access...|$|R

25|$|The main {{causes of}} human {{trafficking}} in Southeast Asia are universal {{factors such as}} poverty and globalization. According to Betz, poverty is not the root of human trafficking {{and that there are}} other factors such as the desire to have access to <b>upward</b> <b>mobility</b> and knowledge on the wealth that can be gained from working in urban cities, that ultimately attracts impoverished individuals to human traffickers. Betz claims the industrialization of the region in the mid 20th century led to a clear division between growing economies and stagnant ones. This industrialization of booming economies, like that of Thailand and Singapore created a draw for poor migrants seeking <b>upward</b> <b>mobility</b> and individuals wanting to leave war torn countries. These migrants were an untapped resource in growing economies that had already exhausted the cheap labor from within its borders. A high supply of migrant workers seeking employment and high demand from an economy seeking cheap labor creates a perfect combination for human traffickers to thrive. Still in the new millennium the market for forced labor is profitable; class-divisions and the economies' need for unskilled labor keep traffickers in the market.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{examines the}} capacity of sport-based intervention programmes to facilitate <b>upward</b> social <b>mobility</b> for disadvantaged young people.

Where social mobility does take place it is at an individual and relative level rather than at a collective or absolute level.

25|$|The {{collectivization}} {{of agriculture}} was essentially completed {{with the establishment}} of the people's communes in 1958. Communes were large, embracing scores of villages.

25|$|Statistical {{discrimination}} in the workplace is unintentional discrimination based on the presumed probability that a worker will or will not remain with the company {{for a long period}} of time. Specific to women, since employers believe that women are more likely to drop out of the labor force to have kids, or work part-time while they are raising kids, this tends to hurt their chances for job advancement. They are passed up for promotions because of the possibility that they may leave, and are in some cases placed in positions with little opportunity for <b>upward</b> <b>mobility</b> to begin with based on these same stereotypes.|$|E

30|$|While the {{relevance}} of these individual characteristics has also been found in previous studies, {{the main focus of}} our analysis has been to check whether there exist firms and/or occupations that prove to be dead ends for low-wage workers. We have shown that the characteristics of the employing firm indeed matter for low-wage earners' probability of escaping low-paid work. In particular, plants with a high share of low-wage earners seem to be dead ends for individual low-wage earners since there, the chance of <b>upward</b> wage <b>mobility</b> is significantly lower. In contrast, plants with high shares of women or of foreigners do not reduce the <b>upward</b> wage <b>mobility</b> of women and foreigners, respectively. Another dead end for low-wage earners seems to be small plants, which offer significantly lower chances of <b>upward</b> wage <b>mobility</b> than larger plants. The likelihood of leaving the low-wage sector is also particularly low when staying in unskilled and skilled service occupations and in unskilled commercial and administrative occupations. Consequently, leaving these dead-end plants and occupations appears to be an important instrument for achieving wages above the low-wage threshold.|$|R

25|$|Multiple factors {{affect the}} {{likelihood}} of downward assimilation, including race, location, and absence of mobility ladders. Generally, immigrants enter the sectors {{of the labor force}} that experience low pay, commonly through jobs in the service sector and manufacturing. Such jobs seldom offer chances for <b>upward</b> <b>mobility.</b> The lack of good pay and resources available to immigrant parents affects {{the likelihood of}} their U.S.-born children being able to rise out of poverty. Children born to low skilled immigrants may experience assimilation into the impoverished groups of the United States. Instead of adapting to the mainstream values and expectations of U.S. society, they take on the adversarial stance of the poor, entering the vicious cycle of poverty. According to the theory of segmented assimilation, second-generation immigrants are less likely to experience downward assimilation when their race does not align with groups that experience prejudice and discrimination, such as African Americans. Also, immigrant families can enter well established ethnic groups in the United States to increase their pool of resources, lowering the possibility of downward assimilation for their children.|$|E
25|$|In the 1872 census, the Kammas made up 40 {{per cent}} of the {{agricultural}} population of the Krishna district (which included the present Guntur district until 1904). Along with Brahmins, they formed the domininant community of the district. By 1921, their population in the district increased to 47 per cent, representing a large in-migration. The literate Kammas learned the Vedas, wore the sacred threads, taught Sanskrit and performed priestly functions for the lower-caste members, which {{are said to have}} generated controversies. Despite this attachment to Brahminical orthodoxy, the Kammas related to the Kapus (cultivators) and their Shudra identity. The <b>upward</b> <b>mobility</b> of the community was noted in N. G. Ranga's study in the 1920s. The Kammas were also politically active, associating themselves with the Indian National Congress almost from its inception, and agitated for farmers' interests. They formed the Kamma Mahajana Sabha, a caste association, in 1910, which received encouragement from the political leaders. Ranga also started a Madras Kamma Association in 1919 and founded a journal Kamma Patrika, later renamed to Ryot Patrika. The Kammas constituted 6 per {{cent of the}} population in the Telugu-speaking of the Madras Presidency in 1921, a figure slightly higher than Brahmins, but lagging far behind 'Kapur or Reddi'.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{abolitionist}} pressure {{produced a}} series of small steps towards emancipation. After the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves went into effect on January 1, 1808, the importation of slaves into the United States was prohibited, but not the internal slave trade, nor involvement in the international slave trade externally. Legal slavery persisted; and those slaves already in the U.S. were legally emancipated only in 1863. Many American abolitionists took an active role in opposing slavery by supporting the Underground Railroad. Violent clashes between anti-slavery and pro-slavery Americans included Bleeding Kansas, {{a series of}} political and armed disputes in 1854–1861 as to whether Kansas would join the United States as a slave or free state. By 1860, the total number of slaves reached almost four million, and the American Civil War, beginning in 1861, led to the end of slavery in the United States. In 1863, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves held in the Confederate States; the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution prohibited most forms of slavery throughout the country. In the case of freed slaves of the United States, many became sharecroppers and indentured servants. In this manner, some became tied to the very parcel of land into which they had been born a slave having little freedom or economic opportunity due to Jim Crow laws which perpetuated discrimination, limited education, promoted persecution without due process and resulted in continued poverty. Fear of reprisals such as unjust incarcerations and lynchings deterred <b>upward</b> <b>mobility</b> further.|$|E

25|$|The steady {{expansion}} and {{rapid population growth}} of the United States after 1815 contrasted sharply with static European societies, as visitors described the rough, sometimes violent, {{but on the whole}} hugely optimistic and forward-looking attitude of most Americans. While land ownership was something most Europeans could only dream of, contemporary accounts show that the average American farmer owned his land and fed his family far more than European peasants, and could make provisions for land for his children. Europeans commonly talked of the egalitarianism of American society, which had no landed nobility and which theoretically allowed anyone regardless of birth to become successful. For example, in Germany, the universities, the bureaucracy and the army officers required high family status; in Britain rich families purchased commissions in the army for their sons {{for tens of thousands of}} pounds. Rich merchants and factory owners did emerge in Europe, but they seldom had social prestige or political power. By contrast the U.S. had more millionaires than any country in Europe by 1850. Most rich Americans had well-to-do fathers, but their grandfathers were of average wealth. Poor boys of the 1850s like Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller were two of the richest men in the world by 1900. Historians have emphasized that upward social mobility came in small steps over time, and over generations, with the Carnegie-like rags-to-riches scenario a rare one. Some ethnic groups (like Yankees, Irish and Jews) prized <b>upward</b> <b>mobility,</b> and emphasized education as the fastest route; other groups (such as Germans, Poles and Italians) emphasized family stability and home ownership more. Stagnant cities offered less mobility opportunities, leading the more ambitious young men to head to growth centers, often out west.|$|E

Eventually, he joined Fiorello La Guardia and Luigi Antonini, of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, in founding an anti-Fascist New York State chapter of OSIA, the Sons of Italy Grand Lodge. Nevertheless, Cotillo was a staunch supporter of the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935.|$|E
500|$|Frank Norris's novel {{belongs to}} the {{literary}} school of naturalism founded by French author Émile Zola.

McTeague was first published in 1899 and was inspired by an October 1893 murder case in which Patrick Collins, a poor husband with a history of beating his wife Sarah, finally stole her money and stabbed her to death at her San Francisco workplace.
