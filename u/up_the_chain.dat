5|$|A death {{sentence}} {{had to be}} passed unanimously, and confirmed in writing by various officers as the verdict passed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of command. A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals {{tended to be more}} concerned with the type of offence and the state of discipline in that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation (or otherwise) by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre.|$|E
5|$|In the {{subsequent}} Battle of Finschhafen, {{it soon became}} clear that the strength of the Japanese forces there had been seriously underestimated, and the 9th Division needed to be resupplied and reinforced, and its casualties evacuated. Herring strove to get the necessary amphibious lift from the navy but the commander of the United States Seventh Fleet, Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender, was reluctant to expose his ships to the Japanese air threat. The matter went <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of command to Mackay, to Blamey, and ultimately to MacArthur, who could do little, given that he had no real authority over the U.S. Navy.|$|E

5|$|Montagu {{selected}} the code name Mincemeat {{from a list}} of centrally held available possibilities. On 4 February 1943 Montagu and Cholmondeley filed their plan for the operation with the Twenty Committee; it was a re-working of Cholmondeley's Trojan Horse plan. The Mincemeat plan was to place documents on the corpse, and then float it off the coast of Spain, whose nominally neutral government was known to cooperate with the , the German military intelligence organisation. The plan was passed by the committee, who passed it <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of command to the senior Allied strategists; Montagu and Cholmondeley were ordered to continue with their preparations for the operation.|$|E
5|$|At Quantico, someone slips a {{newspaper}} article under Scully's door enabling her to identify the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship. Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and {{they look at the}} strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that this would have been an X-File had they still been open. Mulder raises his discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of command.|$|E
5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are related to their investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E

5|$|Rupert {{then finally}} made a {{successful}} crossing into the Caribbean, landing first at Saint Lucia, before continuing <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of the Antilles to the Virgin Islands. There the fleet {{was hit by}} a terrible hurricane, which scattered the ships and sank the Defiance, this time with Prince Maurice on board. It was a while before Maurice's death became certain, which came as a terrible blow to Rupert. He was forced to return to Europe, arriving in France in March 1653 with a fleet of five ships. It became clear, as the profits and losses of the piracy campaign were calculated, that the venture had not been as profitable as hoped. This complicated tensions in the Royalist court, and Charles II and Rupert eventually split the spoils, after which Rupert, tired and a little bitter, returned to France to recuperate from the long campaign.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an interservice {{political}} struggle {{took place in}} the headquarters at Hue/Phu Bai, Saigon, and the Pentagon over who should control aviation assets supporting the entire American effort in Southeast Asia. Westmoreland had given his deputy commander for air operations, Air Force General William W. Momyer, the responsibility for coordinating all air assets during the operation to support KSCB. This caused problems for the Marine command, which possessed its own aviation squadrons that operated under their own close air support doctrine. The Marines were extremely reluctant to relinquish authority over their aircraft to an Air Force General. The command and control arrangement then in place in Southeast Asia went against Air Force doctrine, which was predicated on the single air manager concept. One headquarters would allocate and coordinate all air assets, distributing them wherever they were considered most necessary, and then transferring them as the situation required. The Marines, whose aircraft and doctrine were integral to their operations, were under no such centralized control. On 18 January Westmoreland passed his request for Air Force control <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of command to CINCPAC in Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|The Arab fleet under Sulayman (often {{confused}} with the Caliph himself in the medieval sources) arrived on 1 September, anchoring at first near the Hebdomon. Two days later, Sulayman led his fleet into the Bosphorus and the various squadrons began anchoring by the European and Asian suburbs of the city: one part sailed south of Chalcedon to the harbours of Eutropios and Anthemios to watch over the southern entrance of the Bosporus, {{while the rest of}} the fleet sailed into the strait, passed by Constantinople and began making landfall on the coasts between Galata and Kleidion, cutting the Byzantine capital's communication with the Black Sea. But as the Arab fleet's rearguard, twenty heavy ships with 2,000 marines, was passing the city, the southerly wind stopped and then reversed, drifting them towards the city walls, where a Byzantine squadron attacked them with Greek fire. Theophanes reported that some went down with all hands, while others, burning, sailed down to the Princes' Islands of Oxeia and Plateia. The victory encouraged the Byzantines and dejected the Arabs, who, according to Theophanes, had originally intended to sail to the sea walls during the night and try to scale them using the ships' steering paddles. The same night, Leo drew <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> between the city and Galata, closing the entrance to the Golden Horn. The Arab fleet became reluctant to engage the Byzantines, and withdrew to the safe harbour of Sosthenion further north on the European shore of the Bosporus.|$|E

25|$|The {{ecological}} cycle at Cordell Bank can {{be divided}} into three oceanographic seasons. During the spring, strong northwestern winds push the water southward along the California coast. Gale winds and the Earth's rotation drive surface water away from the shore, only to be replaced by an upwelling of more nutrient-rich waters from offshore. this contributes to the growth in numbers of phytoplankton, which are the foundation of the marine food web, in turn leading to a rise in the food supply, and thus numbers, of the organisms higher <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain.</b>|$|E

Major General Millikin, {{commanding}} officer of III Corps, ordered that the 47th Infantry Regiment be motorized and dispatched to Remagen as soon as possible. Millikin attached the 7th Armored Division to III Corps so they could relieve the 9th Infantry Division who were already crossing the Rhine. He also ordered the 2nd Infantry Division to relieve the 78th Infantry Division so it too could cross the Rhine and defend the bridgehead. First Army commander Courtney Hodges confirmed Millikin's decision to continue to enlarge the bridgehead.|$|E
25|$|Attack {{criteria}} and approval: The political {{dimensions of the}} attack were carefully considered, such as the timing of an election in the enemy camp, or the appointment of certain government officials.

Proposals for an operation were first sent <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of command. Depending {{on the scale of}} the planned operation, an idea to attack a certain village post might float up from Provincial, to Zone, to Interzone levels. Great stress was placed on a successful outcome that would be beneficial in terms of actual military results or propaganda. Numerical superiority was deemed essential.|$|E

25|$|Between 1985 and 1986 the CIA lost every spy {{it had in}} Eastern Europe. The {{details of}} the {{investigation}} into the cause were obscured from the new Director, and the investigation had little success, and has been widely criticized. In June 1987, Major Florentino Aspillaga Lombard, the chief of Cuban Intelligence in Czechoslovakia drove into Vienna, and walked into the American Embassy to defect. He revealed that every single Cuban spy on the CIA payroll was a double agent, pretending to work for the CIA, but secretly still being loyal to Castro. On February 21, 1994, FBI agents pulled Aldrich Ames out of his Jaguar. In the investigation that ensued, the CIA discovered that many of the sources for its most important analyses of the USSR were based on Soviet disinformation fed to the CIA by controlled agents. On top of that, it was discovered that, in some cases, the CIA suspected {{at the time that the}} sources were compromised, but the information was sent <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> as genuine.|$|E
25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>chain</b> of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E
