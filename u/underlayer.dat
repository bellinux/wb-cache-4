As with most cold-weather pony breeds, the Exmoor grows a winter coat consisting of a highly insulating woolly <b>underlayer</b> and a topcoat of longer, oily hairs that prevent the undercoat from becoming waterlogged by diverting water down the sides of the animal to fall from just a few drip areas. The mane and tail are thick and long, and the dock of the tail is of a type common in cold-weather ponies, having coarse hairs, called a [...] "frost cap," [...] "snow chute," [...] or [...] "ice tail" [...] that deflects rainwater away from the groin and underbelly areas to fall from the long hairs {{on the back of the}} hind legs.|$|E

Feathers provide 80–90% of its insulation, and it has a layer of sub-dermal fat which may be up to [...] thick before breeding. This resultant blubber layer impedes the mobility of emperor penguins on land compared to their less fat-insulated cousins, the Magellanic penguins. While the density of contour feathers is approximately 9 per square centimetre, a combination of dense afterfeathers and down feathers (plumules) likely play a critical role for insulation. Muscles allow the feathers to be held erect on land, reducing heat loss by trapping a layer of air next to the skin. Conversely, the plumage is flattened in water, thus waterproofing the skin and the downy <b>underlayer.</b> Preening is vital in facilitating insulation and in keeping the plumage oily and water-repellent.|$|E

40|$|Pronounced {{effect of}} under layers on the {{squareness}} and slope T of the perpendicular loops of very thin CoCr films was observed. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that, {{depending on the}} film microstructure, there are two origins on the anomalous shearing of perpendicular loops of Cc-based perpendicular films: the columnar shape anisotropy and the wall-motion-like magnetization reversal process. For films with larger intercolumnar separation, {{the contribution of the}} columnar shape anisotropy to the total demagnetizing factor is mainly responsible for the deshearing of the loops. For continuous perpendicular films, the intergranular exchange coupling controls the magnetization reversal process and the wall-motion-like reversal explains the anomalous shearing of the hysteresis loop. The square and desheared perpendicular loops of very thin CoCr films originated from their strong perpendicular anisotropy and large intergranular nonmagnetic separation. Study of the orientation relationship between the Co-based films and their <b>underlayers</b> suggested that the texture of the very thin CoCr and CoCrTa films is determined by the thermodynamic nature of hcp Co crystal itself {{and the nature of the}} <b>underlayers</b> or substrates on which it grows. Amorphous <b>underlayers</b> provide "neutral" substrate surfaces for. the [0002] self-oriented growth of hcp Co-based films. Hcp Ti and [111] textural fee Pt, Au <b>underlayers</b> favour the [0002] oriented epitaxial growth. [100] or [110] textural bee Cr <b>underlayers</b> favour the [1010] oriented growth. The perpendicular coercivity of a Co-based medium is determined by its crystalline anisotropy and intergranular exchange coupling, and can be largely affected by the morphology of its <b>underlayers.</b> The larger perpendicular coercivity of the CoCrTa films on Ti <b>underlayers</b> was mainly due to the large grain diameter which results in a reduction in the intergranular exchange coupling constant. The difference between the surface and bulk coercivity of the CoCrTa films on Ti <b>underlayers</b> was attributed to the improvement of the crystallographic orientation of the hcp Co crystals and the development of large grains as the film grows thicker, which causes the reduction in the surface intergranular exchange coupling due to large grains as well as large intergranular separation. Co 84 Nb 12 Fe 4 amorphous films were investigated as back-layers for double layer media. Very low coercivity down to 0. 0125 Oe was achieved for films of 10000 Å-thick with a saturation magnetic induction of 11 kG. The thickness dependence of coercivity follows the Neel formula for films thicker than 400 Å. A D 5 o density of 160 KFRPI was achieved for the 2000 Å-thick medium on Pt <b>underlayers</b> using MIG heads of gap length 0. 15 µm.

Though a thinner recording layer {{is required for}} low noise media, perpendicular anisotropy of Co-Ni ferrite single-layer films of 50 nm in thickness is weak due to worse crystallinity in the initial growth region. Their reproduced waveforms were single pulses, as observed in the longitudinal recording media. Thus, the <b>underlayers</b> of a spinel type of Zn ferrite were used to improve the crystallinity in the Co-Ni ferrite layers, in particular, in the initial growth region. The thickness of the Co-Ni ferrite layer t CoNi was 50 nm, {{and that of the}} Zn ferrite <b>underlayers</b> t Zn was in the range of 25 - 110 nm.
