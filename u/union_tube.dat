40|$|Let T be {{a set of}} {{cylindrical}} {{tubes in}} R^ 3 of length N and radius 1. If the <b>union</b> of the <b>tubes</b> has volume N^ 3 - σ, and each point in the <b>union</b> lies in <b>tubes</b> pointing in three quantitatively different directions, and if a technical assumption holds, then at scale N^σ, the tubes are clustered into rectangular slabs of dimension 1 × N^σ× N^σ. This estimate generalizes the graininess estimate proven by Katz-Laba-Tao. The proof is based on modeling the <b>union</b> of <b>tubes</b> with a high-degree polynomial. Comment: 40 page...|$|R
50|$|Following {{agreement}} of new terms by TfL and the <b>unions,</b> Night <b>Tube</b> operations were confirmed {{to start in}} the second half of 2016. The Central and Victoria line services started on 19 August 2016. The Jubilee line services started on 7 October 2016, the Northern line on 18 November 2016 and the Piccadilly line on 16 December 2016. Charing Cross on the Northern line was served by Night Tube services, from 29 June 2017.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} used as a {{location}} in the 2008 film The Escapist, as a fictional London Underground station called [...] "Union Street", which was said to be on the Northern line between Elephant & Castle and Borough. Remains of the film props, such as a fake tube map and a <b>Union</b> Street <b>tube</b> roundel, can still be seen pasted to the walls of the station. The props date from 2008, and {{are not part of the}} original station.|$|R
40|$|We {{prove that}} any Besicovitch set in R^ 3 must have Hausdorff {{dimension}} at least 5 / 2 +ϵ_ 0 for some small constant ϵ_ 0 > 0. This follows {{from a more}} general result about the volume of <b>unions</b> of <b>tubes</b> that satisfy the Wolff axioms. Our proof grapples with a new "almost counter example" to the Kakeya conjecture, which we call the SL_ 2 example; this object resembles a Besicovitch set that has Minkowski dimension 3 but Hausdorff dimension 5 / 2. We believe this example may be an interesting object for future study. Comment: 62 pages, 11 figures. v 2 : Incorporates referee suggestion...|$|R
40|$|We give a {{complete}} classification of the infinite dimensional tilting modules over a tame hereditary algebra R. We start our investigations by considering tilting modules {{of the form}} T=R_U⊕ R_U /R where U is a <b>union</b> of <b>tubes,</b> and R_U denotes the universal localization of R at U {{in the sense of}} Schofield and Crawley-Boevey. Here R_U/R is a direct sum of the Prüfer modules corresponding to the tubes in U. Over the Kronecker algebra, large tilting modules are of this form in all but one case, the exception being the Lukas tilting module L whose tilting class Gen L consists of all modules without indecomposable preprojective summands. Over an arbitrary tame hereditary algebra, T can have finite dimensional summands, but the infinite dimensional part of T is still built up from universal localizations, Prüfer modules and (localizations of) the Lukas tilting module. We also recover the classification of the infinite dimensional cotilting R-modules due to Buan and Krause. Comment: 44 page...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} new linear and trilinear bounds for {{collections of}} tubes in R^ 4 that satisfy the polynomial Wolff axioms. In brief, {{a collection of}} δ-tubes satisfies the Wolff axioms if not too many tubes can be contained in the δ-neighborhood of a plane. A collection of tubes satisfies the polynomial Wolff axioms if not too many tubes can be contained in the δ-neighborhood of a low degree algebraic variety. First, we prove that if a set of δ^- 3 tubes in R^ 4 satisfies the polynomial Wolff axioms, then the <b>union</b> of the <b>tubes</b> must have volume at least δ^ 1 - 1 / 28. We also prove a more technical statement which is analogous to a maximal function estimate at dimension 3 + 1 / 28. Second, we prove that if a collection of δ^- 3 tubes in R^ 4 satisfies the polynomial Wolff axioms, and if most triples of intersecting tubes point in three linearly independent directions, then the <b>union</b> of the <b>tubes</b> must have volume at least δ^ 3 / 4. Again, we also prove a slightly more technical statement which is analogous to a maximal function estimate at dimension 3 + 1 / 4. We conjecture that every Kakeya set satisfies the polynomial Wolff axioms, but {{we are unable to}} prove this. If our conjecture is correct, it implies a Kakeya maximal function estimate at dimension 3 + 1 / 28, and in particular this implies that every Kakeya set in R^ 4 must have Hausdorff dimension at least 3 + 1 / 28. This would be an improvement over the current best bound of 3, which was established by Wolff in 1995. Comment: 29 pages, 0 figures. v 2 : minor updates based on referee suggestion...|$|R
40|$|As descobertas de novas jazidas de petrÃleo com Ãndices de acidez cada vez maiores fizeram com que as unidades de refino de Ãleos crus utilizassem instalaÃÃes modificadas e adaptadas para essa condiÃÃo. Visando aumentar a resistÃncia Ã corrosÃo e a reduzir o risco de falha durante a operaÃÃo sÃo empregados os aÃos liga do tipo Cr-Mo, A- 213 T- 9 (9 %Cr e 1 %Mo) nos tubos de fornos nas usinas de refino configurando os tubos ASTM A 335 GR P 9, {{conforme}} API RP- 530, projetados para serviÃo contÃnuo em meios contendo sulfeto e elevada temperatura. Esses tubos sÃo revestidos internamente com alumÃnio e soldados atravÃs do processo de soldagem TIG, tendo como passe raiz liga de nÃquel, Inconel 625, vareta ER-NiCrMo- 3 e preenchimento com eletrodo E 505. Dessa forma, estudou-se o comportamento da liga de nÃquel depositada na uniÃo dos tubos, suas propriedades e realizou-se a caracterizaÃÃo de fases presentes {{no material}} apÃs o envelhecimento. Para isto, utilizou-se amostras de 02 tubos A- 213 T- 9 revestidos com alumÃnio e unidos por solda nas mesmas condiÃÃes dos tubos dos fornos das unidades de refino de petrÃleo. As amostras foram expostas as temperaturas no intervalo de operaÃÃo (500 ÂC Ã 700 ÂC) por perÃodos de 10 h, 100 h, 500 h e 1000 h. The discoveries of new oil deposits with right rates acidity caused the refining units of crudes use facilities modified and adapted to this condition. In {{order to increase}} the corrosion resistance and {{reduce the risk of}} failure during the operation are used alloy steels of type Cr-Mo, A- 213 T- 9 (9 %Cr e 1 %Mo) in the tubes in refining plants configuring tubes ASTM A 335 GR P 9, as API RP- 530, designed for continuous service in media containing sulfide and high temperature. These tubes are coated with aluminum and welded by TIG welding process, with the root password nickel alloy, Inconel 625, welding rod ER-NiCrMo- 3 and fill electrode E 505. Thus, it studied the behavior of nickel alloy deposited on the <b>union</b> of the <b>tubes,</b> their properties and has been the characterization of phases present in the material after aging. For this, we used samples from 02 tubes A- 213 T- 9 coated with aluminum and welded together under the same conditions of the tubes of the furnaces of the units of petroleum refining. The samples were exposed to temperatures in the range of operation (500 Â C to 700 Â C) for periods of 10 h, 100 h, 500 h e 1000 h...|$|R
