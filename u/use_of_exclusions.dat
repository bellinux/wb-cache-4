40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 seeks to maximize the collection {{of billions of dollars}} of nontax delinquent debt owed to the federal government. The act requires agencies to refer eligible debts delinquent more than 180 days to the Department of the Treasury for payment offset and to Treasury or a Treasury-designated debt collection center for cross-servicing. The Treasury Offset Program includes the offset of benefit payments, vendor payments, and tax refunds. Cross-servicing involves locating debtors, issuing demand letters, and referring debts to private collection agencies. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) has initiatives to ensure the timely referral of all delinquent debt. However, the agency's failure to make the act a priority has left key provisions of the legislation unimplemented and has severely reduced opportunities for collection. FSA lacks effective procedures and controls to identify and promptly refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury for collection action. GAO identified several obstacles to FSA's establishment and implementation of an effective and complete debt-referral process. In the four states with the highest dollar amounts of federal debt excluded from the Treasury Offset Program, GAO reviewed FSA's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusions</b> from referral requirements because of bankruptcy, forbearance/appeals, foreclosure and Department of Justice litigation. GAO found that about half of the exclusions in these states were inconsistent with established criteria. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} analyzing the distorting {{effects of the}} income tax greatly underestimates its total deadweight loss {{as well as the}} incremental deadweight loss of an increase in income tax rates. Deadweight losses are substantially greater than these conventional estimates because the traditional framework ignores the effect of higher income tax rates on tax avoidance through changes in the form of compensation (e. g., employer paid health insurance) and through changes in the patterns of consumption (e. g., owner occupied housing). The deadweight loss due to the increased <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusions</b> and deductions is easily calculated. Because the relative prices of leisure, excludable income, and deductible consumption are fixed, all of these can be treated as a single Hicksian composite good. The compensated change in taxable income induced by changes in tax rates therefore provides all of the information that is needed to evaluate the deadweight loss of the income tax. These estimates using TAXSIM calibrated to 1994 imply that the deadweight loss per dollar of revenue of using the income tax rather than a lump sum tax is more than twelve times as large as Harberger's classic estimate. A marginal increase in tax revenue achieved by a proportional rise in all personal income tax rates involves a deadweight loss of nearly two dollars per incremental dollar of revenue. Repealing the 1993 increase in tax rates for high income taxpayers would reduce the deadweight loss of the tax system by $ 24 billion while actually increasing tax revenue. ...|$|E

Concurrently, an economic viability study on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> netting was undertaken. The trial site was a 0. 6 -ha block of low chill stone fruit at Nambour, south-east Queensland, Australia. In this area, populations of Queensland fruit fly (Bactrocera tryoni) {{are known to be}} substantial, particularly in spring and summer.

Additional treatments included AIP on green buds (AIP G) and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> bags for the OSP and AIP methods. Inter-specific hybrids (CT × CCV, CT × CH and CT × CCC) were successfully created using all three pollination methods. The AIP Y treatment provided the highest seed yields and achieved time savings of > 41 % over the conventional and OSP methods, resulting in up to five-fold increases in operator productivity. However, the AIP Y treatment also had the highest C. torelliana contamination levels (9. 3 – 13. 2 %). The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> bags with the AIP method had minimal effect on contamination rates, indicating {{a high proportion of}} selfpollen contamination.

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-four patients with recent-onset arthritis of less than 1 year's duration were included prospectively between 1995 and 1997. The diagnosis of RA was defined as having a diagnosis of RA made by the office-based rheumatologist 10 years after enrolment. We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the criteria sets at baseline. RESULTS: At baseline, 60 of the 164 patients had alternative diagnoses better explaining the arthritis and 13 had erosions typical for RA; of the 91 remaining patients, 33 had at least 6 ACR/EULAR points (indicating definite RA), and 58 had fewer than 6 points. The ACR/EULAR criteria had a quite similar sensitivity than the 1987 ACR criteria (33 / 57 [57. 9 %] for ACR/EULAR criteria vs 34 / 57 [59. 6 %] for the 1987 ACR criteria), but higher specificity, PPV, and NPV (95 / 107 [88. 8 %], 34 / 46 [73. 9 %], and 95 / 118 [80. 5 %], respectively) than the 1987 ACR criteria (80 / 107 [74. 8 %], 33 / 63 [52. 4 %], and 80 / 104 [76. 9 %], respectively). CONCLUSION: ACR/EULAR criteria performed substantially better than ACR 1987 criteria for predicting a diagnosis of RA after 10 years. Much of the improvement was ascribable to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> criteria.

Several previous works have explored the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> different {{features such as}} spectral, spatial and energy for overlap detection. This paper proposes a method to estimate probabilities of speech and overlap classes at a segment level which are later incorporated into an HMM/GMM baseline sys-tem. The estimation is motivated by the observation that sig-nificant portion of overlaps in spontaneous conversations take place where the amount of silence is less, e. g., during speaker changes. Experiments on the AMI corpus reveal that the proba-bility of occurrence of overlap in a segment is inversely propor-tional {{to the amount of}} silence in it. Whenever this information is combined with acoustic information from MFCC features in an HMM/GMM overlap detector, improvements are verified in terms of F-measure. Furthermore the paper investigates the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> and labelling strategies based on such detector for handling overlap in diarization reporting F-measure improve-ments from 0. 29 to 0. 43 in case <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> and from 0. 15 to 0. 22 in case of labelling.

SUMMARY: Fissile-material transportation packages are required, by regulation, to be subcritical with fresh (i. e., unborated) water inside the containment system. Packages based on "moderator exclusion " would not meet this requirement, because the criticality safety of the package relies on fresh water not getting into the containment system. Moderator exclusion is allowed only as {{an exception to the}} regulations, and has not previously been used as a basis for approval of a spent fuel transportation package design. Applicants have indicated that they wish to submit applications for spent fuel transportation package designs based on moderator exclusion.

40|$|Sign {{restrictions}} on the responses generated by structural vector autoregressive models have been proposed as an alternative approach to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>exclusion</b> {{restrictions on}} the impact multiplier matrix. In recent years such models have been increasingly used to identify demand and supply shocks {{in the market for}} crude oil. We demonstrate that sign restrictions alone are insufficient to infer the responses of the real price of oil to such shocks. Moreover, the conventional assumption that all admissible models are equally likely is routinely violated in oil market models, calling into question the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> median responses to characterize the responses to structural shocks. When combining sign restrictions with additional empirically plausible bounds on the magnitude of the short-run oil supply elasticity and on the impact response of real activity, however, it is possible to reduce the set of admissible model solutions to a small number of qualitatively similar estimates. The resulting model estimates are broadly consistent with earlier results regarding the relative importance of demand and supply shocks for the real price of oil based on structural VAR models identified by exclusion restrictions, but imply very different dynamics from the median responses in VAR models based on sign restrictions only.
