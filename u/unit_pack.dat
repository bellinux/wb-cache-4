50|$|An annular blowout {{preventer}} uses {{the principle of}} a wedge to shut in the wellbore. It has a donut-like rubber seal, known as an elastomeric <b>packing</b> <b>unit,</b> reinforced with steel ribs. The <b>packing</b> <b>unit</b> is situated in the BOP housing between the head and hydraulic piston. When the piston is actuated, its upward thrust forces the <b>packing</b> <b>unit</b> to constrict, like a sphincter, sealing the annulus or openhole. Annular preventers have only two moving parts, piston and <b>packing</b> <b>unit,</b> making them simple and easy to maintain relative to ram preventers.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, a {{great number}} of U.S. and Canadian-built {{vehicles}} - most notably light and heavy trucks like Willys MB/Ford GPW/GPA, GMC-353/CCKW and vehicles from the CMP family - were crated and shipped overseas in KD form, in various degrees of completeness, to Allied countries, in order to sustain their war effort. Assembly lines were preferably set up in local automotive factories where appropriate tooling and equipment could be easily found but, where needed, other types of buildings could be used, especially in on-the-field situations, and on occasion even open-air rebuilding camps were set up, managed by military personnel. Owing to male mobilization, sometimes a female workforce was employed. CKD military vehicles could be stored for shipment in one-vehicle-per-crate form (or SUP, Single <b>Unit</b> <b>Pack),</b> or as several vehicles (usually two to three) divided in two or more crates. Vehicles shipped to certain countries could be lacking some items, such as cabs, beds or tires, that were built and provided locally.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{research}} around {{marketing mix}} recommendations, granular analysis on product <b>unit</b> <b>pack</b> size in emerging markets {{has not been}} extensively researched. Furthermore, the impact of modern-day retailers on the distribution and sales of product <b>unit</b> <b>pack</b> sizes has received limited attention. Research {{has focused on the}} broader role that product variety plays in the marketing mix and its impact on firm performance (Ford, Moodie & Hastings, 2012; Jaiswal & Gupta, 2015; Kumar, Fan, Gulati & Venkat, 2009). However, little work has been done on how product variety impacts firm performance in emerging markets and specifically in terms of product <b>unit</b> <b>pack</b> size (Wan, Dresner & Evers, 2014) which this current study aims to address. A second aspect of the current study is the influence of modern-day retailers and the impact that distance between them and emerging market spaza shops has on the distribution and sales of product <b>unit</b> <b>pack</b> sizes. Secondary quantitative data from Clover was used to conduct exploratory research on different products in three geographical clusters. Both the availability of product unit size and the sales thereof were found to be influenced by the distance between the spaza shops and the modern-day retailers.

Therefore, the basic evaluation tool of this study was the computer program that matches <b>unit</b> <b>pack</b> dimensions and their arrangement inside box together with transport box dimensions and their stacking pattern on the pallet. After computer analyzes, most acceptable solutions were selected according to the specified demands, and in line with selected solutions a group of new transport boxes for optimization was singled out.

40|$|Introduction & Objective:: PCNL is the {{treatment}} of choice for renal calculi larger than 20 - 3 o millimeter, staghorn stones and stones that are multiple or resistant to ESWL. The {{aim of this study}} was the evaluating of the impact of spinal anesthesia on intraoperative and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing PCNL. Material & Methods: The intraoperative and postoperative anesthetic and surgical variables were evaluated for hundred and twenty consecutive patients underwent PCNL. Anesthetic and surgical variables during and after operation in patient undergoing PCNL under spinal anesthesia were recorded and collected data were analyzed by SPSS software using chi square test. Results: Mean time of operation from the beginning of anesthesia to the end of operation was 98 ± 45 minutes. Mean stone size was 3. 1 ± 1. 8 cm. Mean time for return of sensory and motor activity were 135 ± 22. 7 and 112 ± 35. 7 minutes respectively. Major intraoperative or postoperative complications such as visceral or vascular injury and unusual bleeding did not occur in any of patients. Five patients needed transfusion of 1 <b>unit</b> <b>pack</b> cell and four patients complain from mild to moderate headache and dizziness and also mild low back pain for 2 - 4 days after operation that improved with analgesics and bed rest.

30|$|Following the {{occurrence}} of bovine spongiform encephalopathy cases in cattle, Japan established a traceability system for beef (Food Rink News 2003). Compared with cattle, eels are small and cannot be sold separately, {{making it difficult to}} establish traceability for every individual fish. However, it is possible to attach a traceable RFID chip to every <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> of eel. Each <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> of eel exported to the Japanese market weighs 20  kg, and every 20  kg package carries a traceable RFID chip. The cost of a piece of RFID chip is 20 NT$. The price of eel is unstable and keeps changing. It can range from 200 NT$ to 600 NT$ per kg. The price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> (20  kg) can range from 4, 000 NT$ to 12, 000 NT$. If an RFID chip is attached to every <b>packed</b> <b>unit,</b> the cost will increase by about 0.5 % when the price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> is 4, 000 NT$, and the cost will increase by about 0.17 % when the price of a <b>packed</b> <b>unit</b> is 12, 000 NT$. For eel farmers and exporters, costs will slightly increase, but this extra cost is justified by the ease of traceability. RFID aside, eel farmers should keep records of their production process and the materials they use during production, as these are helpful in setting up a proper traceability system.|$|R
