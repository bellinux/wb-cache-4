40|$|Abstract. Yi River is {{the second}} longest river in Shandong Province and the largest river in the Yimeng {{mountain}} area. The quality of the water has been improved due to the measure taken by the local government. In this study, five water samples of random sites along Yi River in Yishui City were monitored by using the micronuclei in Vicia faba root tip test technique (VNMs). The {{results showed that the}} micronuclei frequencies (MCN‰) of all the five samples were approximately equivalent to the control sample. In addition, five samples, respectively 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 5 m and 20 m from an illegal <b>sewage</b> <b>outlet</b> along the flow direction, were taken for VNMs. The MCN ‰ dates were 17. 982 ‰, 13. 261 ‰, 10. 346 ‰, 4. 074 ‰, 2. 475 ‰, which indicated that the pollution was severe near the <b>sewage</b> <b>outlet</b> while at the distance of 20 m from the <b>sewage</b> <b>outlet</b> the water turned good quality.

40|$|The {{impact of}} sewage {{disposal}} on water quality in Hafnafjordur was assessed in December 2003 using sewage pollution markers. Feacal coliforms {{were used as}} indicators of bacterial pollution while phosphate, nitrate, silicate and oxygen were used as indicators of possibe nutrient enrichment in the bay. Also monitored were salinity, temperature and depth. Measurements were done on surface waters. Sea-surface temperatures ranged from 2. 2 to 9. 7 ºC increasing towards the <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets.</b> Oxygen values ranged from 6. 23 to 9. 66 mg/l. Salinlity measurements were generally low and ranged from 15. 59 to 32. 79 PSU. The counts of feacal coliform were generally high with the counts ranging between 170 to> 16, 000 MPN/ 100 ml. The bacterial counts were higher close to the <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets</b> and decreased with distance from the <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets.</b> Feacal coliform counts were above the limits recommended by European Community Bathing Water Directive (1976) for drinking and bathing and Icelandic regulation for several water uses and may present potential risk to human health. However, it should be mentioned that this monitoring was undertaken when most adverse effects would be expected regarding feacal coliforms since it was the darkest period {{of the year when}} bacteria die-off time is longest and during the low tide close to spring tide when influence of freshwater and sewage is high...|$|R

40|$|We {{compared}} {{the structure of}} a seagrass fish assemblage near a <b>sewage</b> <b>outlet</b> before and after improvements to wastewater treatment. To determine whether responses by the fish assemblage were due to changes in water quality or to other factors, comparisons were made with {{the structure of a}} fish assemblage from a nearby site unaffected by sewage effluent. Total species richness, density and biomass of fish, decreased at both sites over the 30 -year period. An increase in mean trophic level near the <b>sewage</b> <b>outlet</b> following improvements in water quality indicated that wastewater treatment had another important effect. This result is consistent with the reductions in food webs supporting pelagic and benthic fishes that typically accompany decreases in nutrient inputs.

40|$|Photosynthetic {{pigments}} {{have proved}} to be useful biomarkers of the abundance, composition and physiological status of the phytoplankton biomass in the marine environment. Using HPLC pigment analysis, we determined phytoplankton community structure in three different marine environments: in the area of a fish farm, in the area of <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets,</b> and in the mucilaginous aggregates. At the reference site we observed seasonal changes with prevalence of fucoxanthin-containing phytoplankton (i. e. diatoms) during winter/spring and autumn. In the fish farm area the concentration of chlorophyll a degradation products was higher, whereas in the locally enriched environment of <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets</b> we observed only small changes in taxonomic composition and phytoplankton biomass. The impact of season is more expressed than the impact of sewage discharge. With the use of HPLC pigment analysis we determined the development of phytoplankton community in different stages of mucilage aggregates. Phytoplankton biomass was composed primarily of diatoms, and as the aggregates aged, diatoms increased in the relative biomass. Our examples have proven the usefulness and suitability of HPLC pigment analysis in marine ecology studies...|$|R

40|$|Municipal and {{industrial}} wastewater is often discharged {{into the environment}} without appropriate treatment, especially in developing countries. As a result, many rivers and oceans are contaminated. It is urgent to control and administer treatments to these contaminated rivers and oceans. However, most mechanisms of bacterial colonization in contaminated rivers and oceans were unknown, especially in <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets.</b> We found Shewanella putrefaciens {{to be the primary}} bacteria in the terrestrial <b>sewage</b> wastewater <b>outlets</b> around Ningbo City, China. Therefore, in this study, we applied a combination of differential proteomics, metabolomics, and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR techniques to identify bacteria intracellular metabolites. We found S. putrefaciens had 12 different proteins differentially expressed in freshwater culture than when grown in wastewater, referring to the formation of biological membranes (Omp 35, OmpW), energy metabolism (SOD, deoxyribose-phosphate pyrophosphokinase), fatty acid metabolism (beta-ketoacyl synthase), secondary metabolism, TCA cycle, lysine degradation (2 -oxoglutarate reductase), and propionic acid metabolism (succinyl coenzyme A synthetase). The sequences of these 12 differentially expressed proteins were aligned with sequences downloaded from NCBI. There are also 27 differentially concentrated metabolites detected by NMR, including alcohols (ethanol, isopropanol), amines (dimethylamine, ethanolamine), amino acids (alanine, leucine), amine compounds (bilinerurine), nucleic acid compounds (nucleosides, inosines), organic acids (formate, acetate). Formate and ethanolamine show significant difference between the two environments and are possibly involved in energy metabolism, glycerophospholipid and ether lipids metabolism to provide energy supply and material basis for engraftment in sewage. Because understanding S. putrefaciens’s biological mechanism of colonization (protein, gene express and metabolites) in terrestrial <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets</b> is so important to administering and improving contaminated river and to predicting and steering performance, we delved into the biological mechanism that sheds light on the effect of environmental conditions on metabolic pathways...|$|R

40|$|Five {{intertidal}} sites {{along the}} coast of the Yangtze Estuary, China were examined for concentrations of heavy metals including Cu, Zn, Pb, Ni, Mn and Fe in bulk surficial and core sediments. Differences in heavy metal concentrations are apparent between the sites, which are dependent on site-specific metal inputs and sediment grain size. With the exception of site A (Shidongkou), where the highest concentrations of Cu, Zn, Pb occur due to direct pollutant input from the nearby <b>sewage</b> <b>outlet,</b> heavy metal concentrations at other sites are largely determined by particle size characteristics. Clay-rich sediments, together with a downstream location relative to the <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets,</b> result in elevated concentrations of heavy metals at site C (Donghai). Within the intertidal zone at site C, the vegetated, upper marsh zone exhibits higher heavy metal concentrations in comparison with the bare mudflat. Monthly sampling (May to September) in the Scirpus marsh at site C records a temporal variation in heavy metal concentrations. Both of them can be related to the spatial and temporal variability of sediment grain size. A geomorphic understanding of the heterogeneity of sediment grain size is, therefore, vital to the assessment of sediment pollution in intertidal sediments. The present study reveals that the levels of heavy metals found in the Yangtze Estuary are relatively moderate compared with other estuaries in Asia and Europe. This is related to both the diluting effects of the huge volume of water and sediment in the estuary and a shorter period of industrialisation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSince {{pollutant}} {{total amount}} control {{was introduced in}} China in the 1980 s, many researches have focused on water environmental capacity, the allocation of pollutant load, and the pollution discharge right trading. The allocation of water pollution load is the core as well as difficult point in total amount control system of water pollutants discharge. There {{are a series of}} objects for water pollutions load allocation, including water basin, the water function zoning, administrative units, <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets</b> and pollutant discharging points. For different objects of allocation, a distribution planning must be able to meet both the regional requirements and the benefits of pollutant discharging enterprises. However, it is difficult to meet the interests of various levels by one kind method of load allocation. This paper intends to establish a new multi-level load allocation system for Xi’an-Xianyang Section, Weihe River. With large population, concentrated industrial discharging, and poor water quality, the approach needs to consider both regional development requirements and pollutant discharging point's economic interests. At the same time, for different objects at various levels, there is proper different distribution method according to the principles of efficiency and fairness in allocation. For regional water function zoning to administrative units, the environmental Gini coefficient analysis for regional allocation is applied in economic sphere to set up an appropriate allocation model for the optimal allocation. For administrative units to <b>sewage</b> <b>outlets,</b> optimal generation performance standard (GPS) method for enterprises allocation is used to improve the emission performance. The model's objective will be changed from minimum cost to greatest value. The results showed that Xi’an and Xianyang City has four counties needed to reduce the pollution load largely, respectively, because they have some prominent contradiction with the social and economic developments and the natural environment. In addition, in the key reduction region the discharge units should be cut the distribution in accordance with the ratio of distribution model. While in the maintaining present conditions regions, discharge units will have some “surplus capacity” for future emission control. This new approach for water total amount load is effective and may provide the foundation for the pollutant total amount control of Weihe River...|$|R
