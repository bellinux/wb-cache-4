40|$|This paper {{presents}} an Improved Bagging Algorithm (IBA) to recognize ultra-high-frequency (<b>UHF)</b> <b>signals</b> of partial discharges (PDs). This approach establishes the sample information entropy for each sample and the re-sampling {{process of the}} traditional Bagging algorithm is optimized. Four typical discharge models were designed in the laboratory to simulate the internal insulation faults of power transformers. The optimized third order Peano fractal antenna was applied to capture the PD <b>UHF</b> <b>signals.</b> Multi-scale fractal dimensions as well as energy parameters extracted from the decomposed signals by wavelet packet transform were used as the characteristic parameters for pattern recognition. In order to verify {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithm, the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and the support vector machine (SVM) based on the IBA were adopted in this paper to carry out the pattern recognition for PD <b>UHF</b> <b>signals.</b> Experimental results show that the proposed approach of IBA can effectively enhance the generalization capability and also improve the accuracy of the recognition for PD <b>UHF</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} and localisation of Partial Discharge (PD) activities is gaining importance in maintaining operational transformers and diagnosing {{those which are}} faulty. Ultra-high-frequency (UHF) techniques have been applied successfully to detection of PD activities in HV transformers because of their sensitivity to fast transient pulses. When an UHF PD monitoring system is applied, one of the crucial pieces of information {{that need to be}} preserved is the arrival time which allows the Triangulation algorithm to be applied for localisation of PD source(s). Unfortunately, the presence of noise in the <b>UHF</b> <b>signals</b> can complicate the application. This paper presents the results of a study which has been carried out as a joint effort between Glasgow Caledonian University and University of Strathclyde to investigate the efficacy of applying Discrete Wavelets Transform (DWT) to the extraction of PD pulses from noisy environments and the determination of their arrival times in <b>UHF</b> <b>signals.</b> Studies on practically acquired <b>UHF</b> <b>signals</b> from an in-service power transformer prove that DWT is effective in locating the arrival times of PD pulses when the standard deviation (SD) of added noise is no greater than the maximum magnitude of the PD pulses frequency domain [4]. However, the method is more complicated than the conventional filter technique, and requires expertise and experience to be applied to produce its best effect. In this paper, an effective DWTbased denoising algorithm is proposed to remove noise in <b>UHF</b> <b>signals</b> while preserving the arrival time in order to locate the PD source accurately. The paper firstly introduces the application of UHF method to the measurement of PD pulses in transformers and gives typical UHF responses to PD activities. Then a DWT based algorithm is proposed to extract the UHF pulses associated with PD activities from noisy data, including the selection of mother wavelet, the thresholding algorithm and the reconstruction of the signals. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated for various levels of noise presence prior to discussions of the shortcomings and limitation of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{reliability}} of electrical energy networks depends on quality {{and availability of}} the electrical equipment like power transformers. Local failures inside their insulation may lead to catastrophic breakdowns and may cause high outage and penalty costs. To prevent these destroying events power transformers are e. g. tested on partial discharge (PD) activity before commissioning and during service. The current work deals with the electromagnetic method, also known as UHF-Method. The UHF-Method with a bandwidth from 300 MHz to 3 GHz bases on the fact, that PD inside oil filled transformers emits electromagnetic waves measurable with oil valve probes inside the transformer tank. The characteristics of low attenuation of electromagnetic waves travelling through different insulating materials and structures like pressboard, oil and windings are investigated on power transformers in field. A still unanswered question to the sensitivity is, if <b>UHF</b> PD <b>signals</b> {{can be measured in}} case the PD source is buried deep in the winding, e. g. directly located at the iron core. The paper presents an investigation of that “winding-depend ” attenuation of <b>UHF</b> <b>signals.</b> An important step for risk evaluation in case of PD is locating the PD source geometrical within the transformer. The paper presents finally the possibility of locating PD sources by using runtimes of <b>UHF</b> <b>signals.</b> 1...|$|R
