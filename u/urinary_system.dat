5|$|A UTI affects {{parts of}} the <b>urinary</b> <b>system</b> {{including}} the urethra, bladder, and kidneys. There is about a one percent risk of UTIs in boys under two years of age, {{and the majority of}} incidents occur {{in the first year of}} life. There is good but not ideal evidence that circumcision of babies reduces the incidence of UTIs in boys under two years of age, and there is fair evidence that the reduction in incidence is by a factor of 310 times (100 circumcisions prevents one UTI). Prevention of UTIs does not justify routine use of the procedure, however. Circumcision is most likely to benefit boys who have a high risk of UTIs due to anatomical defects, and may be used to treat recurrent UTIs.|$|E

25|$|Most {{animals have}} {{excretory}} systems for elimination of soluble toxic wastes. In humans, soluble wastes are excreted {{primarily by the}} <b>urinary</b> <b>system</b> and, {{to a lesser extent}} in terms of urea, removed by perspiration. The <b>urinary</b> <b>system</b> consists of the kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. The system produces urine by a process of filtration, reabsorption, and tubular secretion. The kidneys extract the soluble wastes from the bloodstream, as well as excess water, sugars, {{and a variety of other}} compounds. The resulting urine contains high concentrations of urea and other substances, including toxins. Urine flows from the kidney through the ureter, bladder, and finally the urethra before passing from the body.|$|E

30|$|Without proper treatment, {{heavy metals}} at high {{concentrations}} can significantly impact {{the environment and}} human health, causing damage to the colon, kidneys, skin, and nervous, reproductive, and <b>urinary</b> <b>systems,</b> yet {{the impact of a}} heavy metal is contingent on the type and concentration (Ogunfowokan et al. 2008).

Nevertheless, oxidation ponds can be utilized to treat wastewater with heavy metals by reducing its concentration prior to discharge.|$|R
25|$|Complications of {{analgesic}} nephropathy include pyelonephritis and end-stage kidney disease.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} <b>urinary</b> collecting <b>system</b> invasion as a prognostic parameter of renal cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A {{total of}} 1, 124 patients who underwent nephrectomy for a renal tumor at 5 European centers {{were included in}} this retrospective study. Several variables were analyzed including <b>urinary</b> collecting <b>system</b> invasion, age, sex, TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, histological subtype, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and cancer specific survival. RESULTS: There were 771 males (68. 6 %) and 353 females (31. 4 %) in this study, and median age was 61 years (range 14 to 88). Median tumor size was 6 cm (range 1 to 24). Tumors were organ confined and Fuhrman grade was recorded as 1 or 2 in 67. 1 % and 62. 3 % of cases, respectively. Symptoms were present at diagnosis, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1 or more in 50. 3 % and 16. 1 % of the cases, respectively. Median followup was 43 months (range 1 to 299). At the end of followup 246 patients (21. 9 %) died of cancer. In 132 cases (11. 7 %) <b>urinary</b> collecting <b>system</b> invasion was noted. <b>Urinary</b> collecting <b>system</b> invasion was associated with symptoms, TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, tumor size (p < 0. 001) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (p = 0. 003), but not with histological subtype (p = 0. 7). On univariate analysis TNM stage, Fuhrman grade, symptoms, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor size and <b>urinary</b> collecting <b>system</b> invasion (p = 0. 0001) were significant predictors of cancer specific survival. <b>Urinary</b> collecting <b>system</b> invasion was an independent prognostic parameter only {{in the setting of}} pT 1 -T 2 tumors. When the <b>urinary</b> collecting <b>system</b> was invaded the 5 and 10 -year probabilities of survival were 43 % and 41 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Urinary</b> collecting <b>system</b> invasion appears to be an independent prognostic parameter of organ confined renal cell carcinoma. Our data support the need to integrate this parameter in further TNM revisions...|$|R
25|$|The {{ectodermal}} dysplasia associated with EEC syndrome arises from abnormalities in the embryonic ectoderm, as described above. Very early in embryonic development, the {{embryonic stem cells}} differentiate into three types of cells: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. It is from these three types of cells that all body organs originate. In general terms, ectodermal cells generate the skin, spinal cord, and teeth (as well as the numerous derivatives mentioned above). Mesodermal cells generate blood vessels, muscle and bone, and endodermal cells generate the lungs, the digestive system and the <b>urinary</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
25|$|The vagina {{has been}} studied in humans more {{than it has been}} in other animals. Its {{location}} and structure varies among species, and may vary in size within the same species. Female mammals usually have the opening of the urethra of the <b>urinary</b> <b>system</b> separate to the vaginal opening of the genital tract. This is different to male mammals, who usually have a single opening, the external urethral opening for both urination and reproduction. The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the labia in humans. In amphibians, birds, reptiles and monotremes, the cloaca is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract and the urinary and reproductive tracts.|$|E
25|$|Xerostomia, {{also known}} as dry mouth syndrome, can {{precipitate}} dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the pons, thalamus, and midbrain, all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors. In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed. Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, {{it has been observed}} that the areas responsible for <b>urinary</b> <b>system</b> and taste in the pons and cerebral cortex in the brain are close in proximity.|$|E
