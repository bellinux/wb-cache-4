5|$|Archibald Ashmore ("Archie") McKellar {{was born}} in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland on the 10 April 1912, the son of John and Margaret McKellar, of Bearsden, Dunbartonshire and was then educated at Shawlands Academy in the Southside of Glasgow. Upon leaving school he joined a local stockbroker's firm. This did not suit McKellar, who {{preferred}} an open–air life style. Keen to leave, but <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> direction to take in life, he joined his father's general contractor and construction business as a plasterer. He spent five years as an apprentice plasterer. During {{this time he was}} given no special privileges despite being the boss' son.|$|E
5|$|As {{darkness}} fell, {{both sides}} took stock and made tentative plans for continuing the action. Admiral Fletcher, obliged {{to abandon the}} derelict Yorktown and feeling he could not adequately command from a cruiser, ceded operational command to Spruance. Spruance knew the United States had won a great victory, {{but he was still}} <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Japanese forces remained and was determined to safeguard both Midway and his carriers. To aid his aviators, who had launched at extreme range, he had continued to close with Nagumo during the day and persisted as night fell.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Shogun is {{targeting}} him, {{he tries}} {{to distance himself from}} having witnessed the murder scene and avoid getting involved in New Gen, which draws the attention of the police. Between him being suspected, more New Gen murders occurring, and Shogun supposedly targeting him, Takumi finds himself experiencing hallucinations and paranoia, and is <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is real and who he can trust. In one of his delusions, Shogun appears as an old man in a wheelchair and tells him that more people will die unless he wakes up.|$|E

5|$|The band's {{record deal}} was {{relatively}} poor for the time: a £5,000 advance over five years, low royalties and no free studio time. However, it did include album development, and EMI, <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> exactly <b>what</b> kind <b>of</b> band they had signed, gave them free rein to record whatever they wanted.|$|R
5000|$|Chatting with Bob and Linda on the phone, Teddy {{realizes that}} Tina {{has gone to}} the {{lighthouse}} to meet Jonas. Teddy is able to negotiate with the officer, explaining that Tina is a good kid. Tina apologizes to Teddy and thanks him, calling him [...] "Uncle Teddy." [...] They see Jonas sneaking back to get his moped, but Teddy is furious that Jonas had only been using Tina all this time and abandoned her. He throws Jonas's moped into the sea, as Bob and Linda spot them in their car as they pass by, <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what's</b> going on. Teddy quickly tells the kids that it's bedtime, and the kids happily oblige.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{featured}} alien time traveller the Doctor (Matt Smith) and {{his companions}} Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) visiting the Wild West, where they encounter a town which is {{cut off from the}} rest of the frontier until they hand over Kahler-Jex, an alien doctor, to a cyborg called the Gunslinger. However, the Gunslinger is a product of experiments by Jex to win a civil war on his planet, and the Doctor is <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is the right thing to do.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Sanchez entered the eighth grade, he had {{developed}} an interest in football but was <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> position to play. His father consulted coaches Bill Cunerty, who formerly coached at Saddleback College, and Bob Johnson, the head coach at Mission Viejo High School. Both coaches stated Mark could be a quarterback if he applied himself and was open to learning {{the intricacies of the}} position. Nick Sr. trained Mark during sessions in their backyard or at the park. Mark, who was attending Santa Margarita High School, joined the football team. During his first pass attempt as a sophomore, Mark threw a 55-yard touchdown.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 200X, robots {{developed}} to assist mankind are commonplace {{thanks to the}} efforts of renowned robot designer Dr. Light. However, one day these robots go out of control and start attacking the populace, among them six advanced humanoid robots made by Dr. Light for industrial purposes: Cut Man, Guts Man, Ice Man, Bomb Man, Fire Man, and Elec Man. He realizes the culprit is his old rival Dr. Wily (who plots to take over the world), but is <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do. His helper robot Rock, having a strong sense of justice, offers to be converted into a fighting robot to stop Dr. Wily's plan, becoming Mega Man. In time, he defeats the six robots and recovers their central cores, then confronts Dr. Wily within his Pacific-based robot factory (which happens to be mass-producing Light's robots). After a final showdown, Wily is defeated and Mega Man returns to his family.|$|E
50|$|A {{generally}} acknowledged {{advantage of}} fieldcraft exercises {{is that it}} forces cadets to use their initiative. A relatively junior member of the squadron could {{find themselves in a}} decision-making position. For this reason, fieldcraft is often used by squadrons as a method of assessing cadets' leadership qualities, as it forces cadets to make quick decisions and perhaps to effectively lead a team, even when they're <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> exactly <b>what's</b> going on or what they're supposed to be doing. For this reason, fieldcraft forms the core of the ATC's Junior Leaders course.|$|R
50|$|A third form of esotericism in Late Antiquity was Neoplatonism, {{a school}} of thought {{influenced}} by {{the ideas of the}} philosopher Plato. Advocated by such figures as Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus, Neoplatonism held that the human soul had fallen from its divine origins into the material world, but that it could progress, through a number of hierarchical spheres of being, to return to its divine origins once more. The later Neoplatonists performed theurgy, a ritual practice attested in such sources as the Chaldean Oracles. Scholars are still <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> precisely <b>what</b> theurgy involved, although it is known that it involved a practice designed to make gods appear, who could then raise the theurgist's mind to the reality of the divine.|$|R

5|$|Leon obtains {{two tickets}} to a music festival in France {{and plans to}} take ZsaZsa, but he tells Fatboy he slept with Glenda Mitchell (Glynis Barber), leaving Fatboy <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do as {{he does not want}} to hurt ZsaZsa. He tells Mercy, who then tells ZsaZsa, who dumps Leon and takes Fatboy's van to France. Leon decides to go to France anyway, leaving Fatboy sad at the loss of two of his best friends, however, Leon and Fatboy stay in contact. He joins the local church choir but fears he will be unable to perform at their event as he felt {{pressured}} into joining by Dot and cannot sing very well. Mercy tells him he should just mime, but then Dot and the choir leader Edward Bishop (Frank Barrie) decide to give Fatboy a solo. Fatboy is unable to go through with it and walks out of the performance, so Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) takes over. At a New Year's Eve party, Fatboy kisses Mercy to put Kim off flirting with him.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} was launched {{during one of}} the stormiest winters of the 18th century, with the French fleet unprepared for such severe conditions. Patrolling British frigates observed the departure of the fleet and notified the British Channel Fleet, most of which was sheltering at Spithead for the winter. The French fleet was subject to confused orders as it left port and was scattered across the approaches to Brest: one ship was wrecked with heavy loss of life and the others widely dispersed. Separated, most of the French fleet managed to reach Bantry Bay late in December, but its commanders were driven miles off course and without them the fleet was <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> action to take, with amphibious landings impossible due to the weather conditions, which were the worst recorded since 1708. Within a week the fleet had broken up, small squadrons and individual ships making their way back to Brest through storms, fog and British patrols.|$|E
5|$|While Susan {{manages to}} keep her {{relationship}} with Jackson a secret from her friends and her son, nicknamed M.J., Jackson seeks a deeper connection with her. Soon enough, Mike and M.J. learn about the relationship. Jackson makes the sudden announcement that he is moving to nearby Riverton for work and asks Susan to come with him. After much consideration, Susan decides that she is <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> she wants and turns down Jackson's offer. Also, Mike moves {{across the street from}} Susan and begins dating her close friend and neighbor, Katherine Mayfair (Dana Delany). Realizing she cannot keep Mike from being happy, she gives the couple her blessing, despite still feeling uncomfortable. Susan and Mike decide to enroll M.J. in private school, and Susan takes a job as an assistant art teacher at the school {{to help pay for the}} tuition. With both Susan and Mike employed, M.J. spends more time under Katherine's care, which makes Susan uneasy. She is heartbroken to learn that Mike and Katherine have decided to move in with one another and become engaged.|$|E
40|$|Personalization {{efforts to}} date have centred on {{presenting}} web users with novel items by predicting what they may find relevant. This approach has utility where the user is <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> exactly <b>what</b> they are looking for, but not {{where they have a}} particular information need to satisfy or a particular item to locate. Furthermore, by operating purely on a predefined database of users and items, systems using this approach represent closed worlds and offer poor scalability to new data sets. To address these limitations we propose a technique for personalizing relevance in information seeking activities, based on an understanding of how people seek information and recommendations from their social network. We then describe technical work in progress, based on Semantic Web technologies, that aims to realize this perspective...|$|R
40|$|Practitioners are {{typically}} aware that organisational complexity {{is important to}} IT project performance however they are <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> exactly <b>what</b> it comprises and how they should take it into account in their decision-making. This paper contributes to addressing the ‘what’ question by taking a multi-level conflict approach to understanding the relationship between individuals, groups and IT project complexity-an area in the literature so far unexplored and thus {{the basis of this}} literature survey and theory development. We first assess existing studies of conflict using semantic analysis to identify the basic components of conflict. We consequently examine the relationship between these components. Lastly we formulate a multilevel model of the phenomena to relate conflict to IT Systems Development Project (ISDP) complexity. The resulting model of conflict in ISDPs suggests that conflicts can occur at three different the levels: individual; intra-group; and inter-group. And that the following can be the objects of conflict: tasks...|$|R

25|$|During a {{national}} broadcast debate on TV2, Sponheim said that, if the Progress Party won the minority government position, he would propose a motion of {{no confidence in}} the new cabinet. If that did not work, the Liberal Party would support a minority government led by Stoltenberg and the Labour Party. The Norwegian media criticised Sponheim for being very vague and unclear {{when it came to the}} Progress Party, and the Red-Green Coalition were <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> side he was actually on.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, {{after two}} decades of owning and {{operating}} Barefoot Contessa, Garten again found herself seeking a change and sold the store to two employees, Amy Forst and Parker Hodges, while retaining ownership of the building itself. <b>Unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> career step to take after selling the store, she took a six-month sabbatical from the culinary scene and built offices above the shop. There, she studied the stock market and attempted to sketch out plans for potential business ventures. Her website, Barefoot Contessa, became high-profile at this time as she began offering her coffees and a few other items for purchase online.|$|E
25|$|One notable {{change in}} {{plotting}} {{is that in}} the film Théoden is possessed by Saruman, whereas in the book he is simply depressed and deluded by Wormtongue. Afterwards, in the film, Théoden is still <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do, and flees to Helm's Deep. In the book he rides out to war, only ending up besieged when he considers helping Erkenbrand. Erkenbrand does not exist in the films: his character is combined with Éomer as the Rohirrim general who arrives with Gandalf at the film's end. Éomer himself is present during the entire battle in the book.|$|E

25|$|Another unique {{building}} is the Voorhees Computing Center (VCC). Originally the St.Joseph's Seminary chapel, built in 1933, {{the building was}} acquired by Rensselaer in 1958, and after renovation served as the institute's library from 1960 until {{the completion of the}} new Folsom Library, in 1976. The Folsom Library, located adjacent to the computing center, has a concrete exterior that was designed to harmonize with the light gray brick of the chapel; architecturally, it is an excellent example of the modern brutalist style. Subsequently, the university was <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> to do with the chapel, or whether to keep it at all, but in 1979 decided to preserve it and renovate it to house computer labs and facilities to support the institute's computing initiatives. Today the VCC serves as the backbone for the institute's data and telephony infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Mussolini {{was very}} <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> date to invade, as {{he changed his}} mind many times, even five times in one segment of fifteen minutes. Eventually he decided on 28 October, the anniversary of the March on Rome, though staff {{headquarters}} was not aware until they heard the date on London radio. In about two weeks, the Italian army was already retreating back into Albania, for conditions {{at this time of year}} were very detrimental to mountain warfare and general organization problems continued throughout the military. Franco of the recently victorious Fascist side in the Spanish Civil War was pondering entrance into World War II, but Italy's failure in Greece put him off of the idea. Hitler then came in to rescue Mussolini's troops, gaining him the upper hand in all politics and military operations for the rest of the war.|$|E
25|$|Artemus {{is held by}} {{officials}} of an unnamed government (the nation had an arsenal of Cruise Missiles and Minutemen, though the United States is not directly named) who fear his powers yet want to use them militarily. As part of this plan, they persuade him to construct the Zone, and they present him to the people as an inspiring nationalistic symbol. Once the Zone is completed, the government launches a first strike nuclear attack against an unnamed foe. From that point on, life for the survivors in the Zone becomes distinctly Orwellian, revolving around {{the will of the}} omnipresent Artemus, who is accepted by the people as a benevolent messianic figure. The boy can read the thoughts of anyone in the Zone, and the people find that comforting. He has absolute power, though he is influenced by flattery to enforce the will of the government officials. Throughout much of the story, Artemus is confused and <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he should do, which adds to his vulnerability to official leadership.|$|E

5000|$|In 2009, Lombardi et al. {{reported}} in the journal Science that they had detected XMRV DNA in 68 of 101 (67%) CFS patients, versus 8 of 218 (3.7%) healthy control subjects. Co-authors included Mikovits, her former mentor Ruscetti at the NCI, and Bob Silverman of the Cleveland Clinic. The WPI study was followed by worldwide media coverage, including reports by the BBC, National Public Radio, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Discover Magazine listed {{it as one of}} the top 100 stories of 2009. Many CFS patients greeted the report enthusiastically, feeling that XMRV granted legitimacy to their condition and hoping that XMRV would be established as a treatable cause of CFS; some, assuming causation, even [...] "hurry(ied) to doctors for tests and antiretroviral drugs". Others urged the need for more research before drawing conclusions. In the scientific community, initial reactions were mixed. Immediately after the Science paper publication, Patrick Moore and Masahiro Shuda wrote a highly critical F1000 dissent pointing out basic errors in the paper's methods, results and conclusions, [...] "...this manuscript has flaws that leave the reader <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> knowing precisely <b>what</b> was measured". Others noted the long history of proposed retrovirus-disease connections that were later debunked. John Coffin and Jonathan Stoye in a Science commentary accompanying the WPI publication were cautiously optimistic.|$|R

25|$|La Nausée allows Sartre {{to explain}} his {{philosophy}} in simplified terms. Roquentin is the classic existentialist hero whose attempts to pierce the veil of perception lead him to a strange combination of disgust and wonder. For {{the first part of}} the novel, Roquentin has flashes of nausea that emanate from mundane objects. These flashes appear seemingly randomly, from staring at a crumpled piece of paper in the gutter to picking up a rock on the beach. The feeling he perceives is pure disgust: a contempt so refined that it almost shatters his mind each time it occurs. As the novel progresses, the nausea appears more and more frequently, though he is still <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it actually signifies. However, at the base of a chestnut tree in a park, he receives a piercingly clear vision of what the nausea actually is. Existence itself, the property of existence to be something rather than nothing was what was slowly driving him mad. He no longer sees objects as having qualities such as color or shape. Instead, all words are separated from the thing itself, and he is confronted with pure being.|$|E
25|$|Filming for Scream 3 {{began on}} July 6, 1999 {{in and around}} Hollywood, Los Angeles, {{in the areas of}} San Fernando Valley, Macarthur Park, Beverly Hills, Hollywood Hills and Silverlake, with a $40 million budget and wrapped on September 29, 1999. The {{isolated}} home of Campbell's character is situated in Topanga Canyon and Cox's character is introduced in a classroom at UCLA. A scene where Campbell's character is pursued through movie set replicas of locations from Scream was not scripted but the sets were built because Craven knew he wanted to revisit the original film in some way, after which they wrote the scene around the set. Due to the constantly changing script used for the film, which would often be usable on the day of filming, the production filmed large amounts of footage of different variations of the same scenes in order that, should the script again change, they would ideally have a scene they could use without having to film new ones at a later date. In particular, the opening scene had three variants and the three-minute scene featuring the character of Randy Meeks had two-hours of filmed footage. The ending too was refilmed in January 2000, three months after principal photography finished, adding in the character of Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) and having Campbell's character beaten and then shot by Ghostface after it was decided she defeated him too easily. So in flux was the script that the final scene of the movie was filmed with three variants of Dempsey's character, one with him absent, one with his arm in bandages and one with him in a normal condition as they were <b>unsure</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> his fate would be.|$|E
