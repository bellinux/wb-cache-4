5000|$|For audits {{performed}} by an outside audit firm, risk assessment {{is a crucial}} stage before accepting an audit engagement. According to ISA315 Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement, [...] "the auditor should perform risk assessment procedures to obtain {{an understanding of the}} entity and its environment, including its internal control". Evidence relating to the auditor’s risk assessment of a material misstatement in the client’s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client’s internal controls. Audit risk is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean <b>unmodified</b> <b>opinion</b> regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean <b>unmodified</b> <b>opinion.</b> As a formula, audit risk is the product of two other risks: Risk of Material Misstatement and Detection risk. This formula can be further broken down as follows: inherent risk × control risk × detection risk.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the issue of}} audit failure and attempts {{to answer the question}} why some bankrupt firms receive <b>unmodified</b> <b>opinions</b> while others do not. Specifically, we examine the impact of debt-related events on auditors’ decisions to issue going-concern opinions. We find that, in general, the occurrence of debt-related events does not prompt the issuance of going-concern opinions. The results suggest that audit failures may be attributed to the auditors’ downplay or negligence of the importance of debt-related events. The findings also suggest that managers who try to bring the company out of financial distress should avoid taking debt financing activities that prompt auditors to make going-concern qualifications...|$|R

40|$|From the {{bankruptcy}} filing of Enron on December 2, 2001 {{for the next}} 12 months, an unprecedented string of large bankruptcies and corporate scandals emerged. Six of the ten largest corporate bankruptcies occurred in this 12 -month period. Of these six, all received <b>unmodified</b> <b>opinions</b> and {{four of the six}} (WorldCom, Enron, Global Crossing, and UAL Corp) were clients of Arthur Andersen. As it is very clear external auditors play vital role in our society, on the other words  Financial statement users must believe that external auditors are free from others control, or users will doubt the verity of auditors' representa¬tions. Auditor independence provides investors confidence in audited financial statements. Further, auditor independence is the cornerstone of the public accounting profession (Mednick, 1990). Any threat to audit independence may undermine this confidence. The impairment or lack of auditor independence is a main cause of many corporate collapses and corporate scandals across the world.   Without independence the audit quality and audit detection duty is questionable. The results of this study shows that specialization of IACPA strongly affects on fraud detection, in addition the competency of IACPA member affects on detecting important fraud...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the great}} {{majority}} of auditors are not willing to jeopardize their profession and reputation for guaranteed audit fees, there are some that will issue opinions solely based on obtaining or maintaining audit engagements. This includes auditors who knowingly emit <b>unmodified</b> unqualified <b>opinions</b> for auditees who are engaged in illegal activities, auditees who have caused a material limitation of scope, auditees that have a lack of going concern, or auditees who present fraudulent financial statements (e.g. Enron and Arthur Andersen). This situation is a clear conflict of interest which should hinder an auditor's independence and the ability to audit (AICPA Code of Ethics), but some auditors willingly ignore this statute.|$|R
25|$|During Billington's {{tenure at}} the Library of Congress, he raised {{more than half a}} billion dollars of private support to {{supplement}} Congressional appropriations. These private funds were used to increase Library collections, programs, and digital outreach. Billington created the Library's first development office for private fundraising in 1987, and, in 1990, established the James Madison Council, the Library's first national private sector donor-support group. Billington also asked the GAO to conduct the first Library-wide audit in 1987. This precedent led to regular annual financial audits, which produced <b>unmodified</b> ("clean") <b>opinions</b> from 1995 onwards.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether auditors bear {{any negative}} {{consequence of the}} failures of finance companies in New Zealand. More than 60 finance companies failed since 2006 and these failures imposed massive financial loss on the investors. There is a wide perception of audit failure {{in the case of}} these failed finance companies. Therefore, it is important to examine whether there is evidence of poor audit quality in the case of failed finance companies. It is also important to investigate, from the perspective of audit theory and public policy, whether the auditors of these failed finance companies were punished after the failures. The study examines two consequences for the auditors – disciplinary actions against the auditors by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and client loss. The paper also examines whether the auditor has been sued after the failure of any finance company. The sample is comprised of 37 failed finance companies for which annual reports were available on the website of Companies Office New Zealand. The study finds that auditors who gave <b>unmodified</b> audit <b>opinions</b> are not more likely to face disciplinary actions than those who gave <b>unmodified</b> audit <b>opinions</b> with going concern explanation paragraphs and modified audit opinions. Furthermore, the study utilizes auditor turnover of public listed companies in New Zealand to test another consequence of finance company failures for the auditors – client loss. While there is no significant relationship between disciplinary actions and auditor turnover, a statistically significant relationship is observed between finance company failure and auditor turnover. The study also analyses litigation effect on auditors who involved with finance company failures. Under the primary liability rule – joint and several liability – in New Zealand, auditor is held liable for the loss of the client. The results of this study will be of interest to practitioners, standard setters and law makers, and will fill the literature gap on the impacts of corporate failures on auditors...|$|R
40|$|This report {{highlights}} {{some key}} financial challenges and risks for water entities in Victoria, including repaying growing debt {{and continuing to}} meet ongoing financial obligations to the state, such as taxes and levies. Overview This report covers {{the results of our}} financial audits of 20 entities, comprising 19 water entities and one controlled entity. The report informs Parliament about significant issues arising from the audits of financial and performance reports and augments the assurance provided through audit opinions included in the respective entities’ annual reports. Parliament can have confidence in the water entities financial reports and performance reports as all were given <b>unmodified</b> audit <b>opinions</b> for 2013 – 14. It is pleasing to note that both financial reports and performance reports met the legislated time frames and improvement has occurred in the quality of performance reporting during 2013 – 14. The sector generated a net profit before income tax of $ 318. 2 million, an increase of $ 234. 5 million. The increase is largely due to two metropolitan water entities reporting significantly higher profits as a result of higher water consumption and increased water, sewerage and other prices, as approved under the regulatory price setting model. This report highlights some key financial challenges and risks for the water entities, including repaying growing debt and continuing to meet ongoing financial obligations to the state, such as taxes and levies. It also highlights significant increases in total water and sewerage charges by the three metropolitan water retailers in 2013 – 14...|$|R
40|$|The {{reasons for}} audit changes are {{typically}} poorly documented {{and at times}} speculated {{to be due to}} management’s desire to engage in opportunistic earnings management. This study examines the occurrence of earnings management around audit changes in small Norwegian limited firms (AS). Our dataset of firm characteristics and financial records is gathered from the SNF Database. Discretionary accruals are estimated for firms in our sample and are used as a proxy for earnings management. We present evidence that suggests there is no significant occurrence of income increasing earnings management surrounding audit changes, but we do find evidence for audit changes that may be initiated due to the incumbent auditor’s conservatism. We also find evidence that firms with small auditors that later switch to conservative big auditors are subject to larger negative discretionary accruals. Finally, we find evidence that audit changes in which the firm received a modified audit opinion in the year prior to the change are also subjected to larger negative discretionary accruals when compared to audit change firms that received an <b>unmodified</b> audit <b>opinion.</b> Our findings suggest that for private Norwegian firms the motivation for audit changes is not management’s desire to find a more lenient auditor in order to manipulate earnings. I identified essential papers by searching Oria (NHH’s library search interface for all available literature) for academic papers containing the following keywords in both Norwegian and English: auditor changes, audit change, auditor switching, auditor rotation, earnings management, discretionary accruals, total accruals, audit quality, opinion shopping, audit shopping, audit-qualifications, earnings management and private firms, Norwegian earnings management, total accrual...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your {{prompting}} {{to go to}} your nearest friends,--to remain {{where all}} the ties of your life have been formed,--is a true prompting, to which the Church in its original constitution and discipline responds, opening its arms to the penitent, watching over its children to the last; never abandoning them until they are hopelessly reprobate. And the Church ought to represent the feeling of the community, so that every parish should be a family knit together by Christian brotherhood under a spiritual father. But the ideas of discipline and Christian fraternity are entirely relaxed,--they can hardly be said to exist in the public mind; they hardly survive except in the partial, contradictory form they have taken in the narrow communities of schismatics; and if I were not supported by the firm faith that the Church must ultimately recover the full force of that constitution which is alone fitted to human needs, I should often lose heart at observing the want of fellowship and sense of mutual responsibility among my own flock. At present everything seems tending toward the relaxation of ties,--toward the substitution of wayward choice for the adherence to obligation, which {{has its roots in the}} past. Your conscience and your heart have given you true light on this point, Miss Tulliver; and I have said all this that you may know what my wish about you--what my advice to you--would be, if they sprang from my own feeling and <b>opinion</b> <b>unmodified</b> by counteracting circumstances." ...|$|R
