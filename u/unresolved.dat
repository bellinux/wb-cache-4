5|$|Main and Hesse {{found that}} most of the mothers of these {{children}} had suffered major losses or other trauma shortly before or after the birth of the infant and had reacted by becoming severely depressed. In fact, 56% of mothers who had lost a parent by death before they completed high school subsequently had children with disorganized attachments. Subsequent studies, whilst emphasising the potential importance of <b>unresolved</b> loss, have qualified these findings. For example, Solomon and George found that <b>unresolved</b> loss in the mother tended to be associated with disorganized attachment in their infant primarily when they had also experienced an <b>unresolved</b> trauma in their life prior to the loss.|$|E

30|$|Thoracic {{actinomycosis}} may {{range from}} subclinical illness to a progressively fatal disease. The prognosis is excellent with low mortality when {{the disease is}} recognised early and appropriate treatment is given. Thus, actinomycosis {{should be considered as}} part of the differential diagnosis when confronted with chronic <b>unresolving</b> pneumonia that extends across anatomic barriers or manifests as an endobronchial lesion. Early diagnosis may prevent serious complications or unwarranted surgery.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained <b>unresolved.</b> One of the major <b>unresolved</b> problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate DNA repair in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run. (See also Evolution of sexual reproduction).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{document}} whether {{elements of}} a structured history and examination predict adverse outcome of acute sore throat. DESIGN: Prospective clinical cohort. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: 14, 610 adults with acute sore throat (≤ 2 weeks' duration). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Common suppurative complications (quinsy or peritonsillar abscess, otitis media, sinusitis, impetigo or cellulitis) and reconsultation with new or <b>unresolving</b> symptoms within one month. RESULTS: Complications were assessed reliably (inter-rater κ= 0. 95). 1. 3 % (177 / 13, 445) of participants developed complications overall and 14. 2 % (1889 / 13, 288) reconsulted with new or <b>unresolving</b> symptoms. Independent predictors of complications were severe tonsillar inflammation (documented among 13. 0 % (1652 / 12, 717); odds ratio 1. 92, 95 % confidence interval 1. 28 to 2. 89) and severe earache (5 % (667 / 13, 323); 3. 02, 1. 91 to 4. 76), but the model including both variables had modest prognostic utility (bootstrapped area under the receiver operator curve 0. 61, 0. 57 to 0. 65), and 70 % of complications (124 / 177) occurred when neither was present. Clinical prediction rules for bacterial infection (Centor criteria and FeverPAIN) also predicted complications, but predictive values were also poor and most complications occurred with low scores (67 % (118 / 175) scoring ≤ 2 for Centor; 126 / 173 (73 %) scoring ≤ 2 for FeverPAIN). Previous medical problems, sex, temperature, and muscle aches were independently but weakly associated with reconsultation with new or <b>unresolving</b> symptoms. CONCLUSION: Important suppurative complications after an episode of acute sore throat in primary care are uncommon. History and examination and scores to predict bacterial infection cannot usefully identify those who will develop complications. Clinicians will need to rely on strategies such as safety netting or delayed prescription in managing the uncertainty and low risk of complications...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Grisel’s {{syndrome}} {{is an unusual}} but important cause of torticollis which may be encountered in a pediatric plastic surgery practice, where craniofacial and oropharyngeal surgeries are commonly performed. Grisel’s {{syndrome is}} characterized by painful torticollis and limited cervical rotation, and the diagnosis is confirmed via radiologic imaging. Initial management of Grisel’s syndrome is with anti-inflammatories {{and in some cases}} antibiotics. In <b>unresolving</b> or recurrent cases, more invasive treatments, such as cervical collar, halo, or surgical arthrodesis, may be considered...|$|R
5|$|During the 1930s, {{and again}} during the 1950s, the {{relationship}} between the loanable funds doctrine and the liquidity preference theory were discussed at length. Some authors considered the two approaches as largely equivalent but this issue is still <b>unresolved.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view that the goal of {{mathematics}} is to classify and characterize, the representation theory of the Lorentz group is since 1947 a finished chapter.

5|$|Paleontologists today {{agree on}} the overall {{structure}} of the ceratopsian family tree, although there are differences on individual taxa.

40|$|The MRI data {{of seven}} {{patients}} with clinically definite multiple sclerosis who developed epileptic seizures are presented. Six {{of these cases}} demonstrated new or enhancing lesions. Cerebral biopsy {{in one of these}} lesions confirmed inflammation with myelin breakdown products. Lesions implicated in the causation of seizures involved the cortex or subcortical area. In one patient, a new lesion was associated with EEG abnormalities which resolved as the lesion reduced in size. In three patients epileptic activity was the only clinical manifestation of disease. Large, <b>unresolving</b> lesions tended to be associated with continuing seizures...|$|R
50|$|Not all {{geographic}} subsets of taxonomic groups {{follow this}} broad pattern, in contrast, Northwest European land snails exhibit a normal distribution (Hausdorf, 2006). Additionally, the terrestrial mammals {{of the islands}} of Madagascar, New Guinea and Australia do not show a right skewed body size-species richness distribution (Maurer et al. 1992). Given the limited amount of non-conforming data {{it is not possible}} to determine if this phenomenon is universal or is simply novel in certain environments. Underreporting of taxonomic and geographic subsets that do not conform to this pattern may be partially responsible for this <b>unresolve.</b>|$|R
40|$|Infection complicating {{pancreatic}} necrosis {{leads to}} persisting sepsis, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and {{accounts for about}} half the deaths that occur following acute pancreatitis. Severe cases due to gallstones require urgent endoscopic sphincterotomy. Patients with pancreatic necrosis should be followed with serial contrast enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) and if infection is suspected fine needle aspiration of the necrotic area for bacteriology (FNAB) should be undertaken. Treatment of sterile necrosis should initially be non-operative. In the presence of infection necrosectomy is indicated. Although traditionally this has been by open surgery, minimally invasive procedures are a promising new alternative. There are many <b>unresolve...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fractures of the capitate bone are {{the second}} most common injury to a child's wrist but are rarely {{encountered}} in isolation. This is reflected in the paucity of described cases in the literature. Their true incidence is unknown as they often do not appear on plain radiographs and may heal without immobilisation. The easiest way to detect these fractures is with an MRI scan. The authors present a rare case of isolated capitate fracture that was initially missed on plain films. This case is important as it highlights the need for a high index of suspicion in paediatric patients with <b>unresolving</b> wrist pain...|$|R
40|$|Filariasis, a mosquito-borne disease, is wide {{spread in}} India. While {{laboratory}} diagnosis has been conventionally done by demonstrating microfilaria in peripheral blood smears, occasionally they {{are reported in}} various body fluids including pericardial fluid. We report the case of 33 -year-old man with severe dyspnoea and chest pain, referred from a private nursing home with a provisional diagnosis of <b>unresolving</b> pericarditis. Pericardial tap revealed massive pericardial effusion with actively motile microfilariae. No microfilariae (Mf) were seen in the peripheral blood. Haemorrhagic effusion resolved completely with DEC.

40|$|Benign {{laryngeal}} disorders {{result in}} dysphonia because of effects on glottic closure and the vibratory {{characteristics of the}} true vocal fold. Treatment is initially directed at reversing medical conditions and patterns of abuse with surgery reserved for <b>unresolving</b> lesions resulting in troublesome dysphonia. Benign lesions that require surgery are excised as precisely as possible sparing overlying mucosa and the underlying vocal ligament. Vocal fold scarring is currently best treated by augmentation procedures, and atrophy may be compensated for by medialization thyroplasty or by adding bulk to the affected folds. Application of current knowledge of laryngeal histology and physiology is prerequisite to endoscopic surgical intervention...|$|R

40|$|In 28 {{patients}} with acute myocardial infarction, the release pattern of 2, 3 -butanediol (BD), {{a product of}} intermediary metabolism, and creatine kinase activity (CK) in blood were compared. Whereas CKat entry was low in all patients, the BD level was elevated in 18 (64 %). However, BD returned to normal levels during the next 24 h whereas CK increased. The BD level at entry did not allow differentiation between {{patients with}} transmural or non-transmural infarction; it was independent of clinical findings and biochemical parameters. We suggest that, in patients with acute myocardial infarction, elevated levels of BD originates from myo-cardial metabolism. Whether it reflects ongoing ischaemia or reperfusion of the infarcted area remains <b>unresolve...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} design of parsing grammars for automatic surface-syntactic analysis of unconstrained English text. It consists of a summary and three articles. Morphological disambiguation documents a grammar for morphological (or part-ofspeech) disambiguation of English, done within the Constraint Grammar framework proposed by Fred Karlsson. The disambiguator seeks to discard those of the alternative morphological analyses proposed by the lexical analyser that are contextually illegitimate. The 1, 100 constraints express some 23 general, essentially syntactic statements as restrictions on the linear order of morphological tags. The error rate of the morphological disambiguator is about ten times smaller than that of another state-of-the-art probabilistic disambiguator, given that both are allowed to leave some of the hardest ambiguities <b>unresolve</b> [...] ...|$|R
