With complete embedding the detector and electrical connection are both in the ground, with nothing exposed. This eliminates the problems mentioned.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} two decades, {{significant}} advances {{in the field of}} laser generated ultrasounds have been made. In the conventional pulse echo technique, a discontinuity in the specimen can be detected only if an <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>detector</b> is properly oriented to the discontinuity. The 2 -D Scanning Laser Source (SLS) technique allows detection of surface-breaking cracks of arbitrary orientation with respect to the direction. This technique also makes detection possible on rough and curved surfaces by scanning changes in ultrasonic amplitude and frequency when the laser source scans over flaws. Conventional ultrasonic scanning technique requires immersion of specimen or water jet for transferring ultrasonic wave between transducer and specimen. However, this SLS technique does not need contacting and couplant to generate surface wave and to get flaw images. Therefore, this SLS technique has several advantages, for complicated production inspection, high speed scanning, non-contact, remote from specimen, and high resolution. In this study, ultrasonic SLS images of fatigue cracks on turbine blade of aircraft and steel plates were obtained to describe shapes of defects by SLS technique...|$|E
40|$|Electro- {{magnetic}} acoustic transducers (EMATs) generate ultrasonic {{waves in}} metals through an electromagnetic coupling mechanism. A concept for EMAT generation, using a coil alone without a permanent magnet, {{but with a}} pulse generator and a sample, is introduced. A simplified equivalent coil circuit is given, and has been validated by experimental measurements. Such an equivalent circuit is useful for excitation current calculations, which have often been neglected in previous publications in this area but {{have proved to be}} of great importance in considering the efficiency and frequency characteristics of ultrasonic generation. Due to the coil sample coupling, the equivalent coil inductance is dependent on the electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability of the metal sample, the lift-off, the coil orientation relative to the metal sample and the coil configuration. The use of a coil alone to generate ultrasound has limited applications as a suitable <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>detector</b> must also be used, but where appropriate this type of generation source provides a robust, non- contact and inexpensive means of ultrasonic generation without worrying the permanent magnet attracting ferromagnetic particles that can prevent from practical on- line application of EMATs.
