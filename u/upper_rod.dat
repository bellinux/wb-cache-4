When load is applied in top-down direction trying to bend girder force is acting on <b>upper</b> <b>rod</b> of any girder as compression stress, and on lower part as tension. This stress tends to decrease girder width making it less rigid (Girder of zero width has zero flexural strength). In {{order to prevent}} this upper and lower rod {{has to be kept}} apart. In classical framework girder this is ensured by triangular framework. In tensairity girder gas pressure in air bag is used instead. Lower rod loaded in pure tension can be replaced by rope or the airbag membrane itself. This leads to much better strength-to-weight ratio ...|$|E
50|$|Three-point locking is a {{locking system}} {{installed}} in cabinet or locker doors to enable more secure locking. Whereas in single-point locking, {{the door on}} a cabinet locks only {{at the point where}} the key is turned, halfway up the edge of the door, three-point locking enables the top and bottom of the door to be simultaneously secured. This is accomplished by attaching two long steel rods to the lock on the inside of the door, which extend vertically upwards and downwards: when the lock is turned, the rotary movement of the latch on the inside of the door translates to vertical movement in these rods, with the result that the <b>upper</b> <b>rod</b> moves upwards by an inch or so, and the lower rod moves downwards similarly. This causes the ends of the rods to move through small holes in the flanges at the top and bottom of the door, resulting from the metal of the door being turned inwards, and the rods then move a short distance into holes in the metal surrounding the door. This effectively immobilizes the top and bottom of the door, and greatly increases the security of the door-locking compared to a door with only single-point locking.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{effects of}} oxygen flow speed and {{pressure}} on the iron and mild steel combustion are investigated experimentally and theoretically. The studied specimens are vertical cylindrical rods subjected to an axial oxygen flow and ignited at the upper end by laser irradiation.

5000|$|Also {{known as}} {{ballistic}} well drilling and sometimes called [...] "spudders", these rigs raise and drop a drill string {{with a heavy}} carbide tipped drilling bit that chisels through the rock by finely pulverizing the subsurface materials. The drill string is composed of the <b>upper</b> drill <b>rods,</b> a set of [...] "jars" [...] (inter-locking [...] "sliders" [...] that help transmit additional energy to the drill bit and assist in removing the bit if it is stuck) and the drill bit. During the drilling process, the drill string is periodically removed from the borehole and a bailer is lowered to collect the drill cuttings (rock fragments, soil, etc.). The bailer is a bucket-like tool with a trapdoor in the base. If the borehole is dry, water is added so that the drill cuttings will flow into the bailer. When lifted, the trapdoor closes and the cuttings are then raised and removed. Since the drill string must be raised and lowered to advance the boring, the casing (larger diameter outer piping) is typically used to hold back upper soil materials and stabilize the borehole.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{polymerization}} shrinkage stress of composite resins (microfilled, microhybrid and hybrid) photoactivated by quartz-tungsten halogen light (QTH) and light-emitting diode (LED). Glass rods (5. 0 mm x 5. 0 cm) were fabricated and had one of the surfaces air-abraded with aluminum oxide and coated with a layer of an adhesive system, which was photoactivated with the QTH unit. The glass rods were vertically assembled, in pairs, to a universal testing machine and the composites were applied to the lower rod. The <b>upper</b> <b>rod</b> was placed closer, at 2 mm, and an extensometer was attached to the rods. The 20 composites were polymerized by either QTH (n= 10) or LED (n= 10) curing units. Polymerization was carried out using 2 devices positioned in opposite sides, which were simultaneously activated for 40 s. Shrinkage stress was analyzed twice: shortly after polymerization (t 40 s) and 10 min later (t 10 min). Data were analyzed statistically by 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey's test (a= 5 %). The shrinkage stress for all composites was higher at t 10 min than at t 40 s, regardless of the activation source. Microfilled composite resins showed lower shrinkage stress values compared to the other composite resins. For the hybrid and microhybrid composite resins, the light source had no influence on the shrinkage stress, except for microfilled composite at t 10 min. It may be concluded that the composition of composite resins is the factor with the strongest influence on shrinkage stress...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The beam string structure，a new self-balancing {{system is}} a {{combination}} of a string (Cable), pole and beam-column (beam, arch). Because the beam string structure make full use of tensile properties of high-strength cord, force became more reasonable, transportation became more convenient and construction became more simple for the new self-balancing system. The beam string structure became a new structure with a good value and prospects. In this paper the effects of the static performance of the single truss string structure are researched through analyzing the influence of prestressed cable, pole pitch, blow-span ratio of cable and cross-sectional area of cable using of finite element theory. The results of the reasonable selection of string truss design parameters a valuable reference. The string structure and characteristic The string structure has two basic forms of the beam string structure and the string truss structure. The beam string structure (referred to as the BSS) can be defined as "connected with the pole bending and tension member elements formed from the balance system.

40|$|We analyse {{the effect}} of a {{continuous}} spread of particle lengths on the phase behavior of rodlike particles, using the Onsager theory of hard rods. Our aim is to establish whether ``unusual'' effects such as isotropic-nematic-nematic (I-N-N) phase separation can occur even for length distributions with a single peak. We focus on the onset of I-N coexistence. For a log-normal distribution we find that a finite <b>upper</b> cutoff on <b>rod</b> lengths is required to make this problem well-posed. The cloud curve, which tracks the density at the onset of I-N coexistence {{as a function of the}} width of the length distribution, exhibits a kink; this demonstrates that the phase diagram must contain a three-phase I-N-N region. Theoretical analysis shows that in the limit of large cutoff the cloud point density actually converges to zero, so that phase separation results at any nonzero density; this conclusion applies to all length distributions with fatter-than-exponentail tails. Finally we consider the case of a Schulz distribution, with its exponential tail. Surprisingly, even here the long rods (and hence the cutoff) can dominate the phase behaviour, and a kink in the cloud curve and I-N-N coexistence again result. Theory establishes that there is a nonzero threshold for the width of the length distribution above which these long rod effects occur, and shows that the cloud and shadow curves approach nonzero limits for large cutoff, both in good agreement with the numerical results.

40|$|UnrestrictedNearly all sensory systems {{must find}} a way to {{represent}} a wide range of input signals and translate them into meaningful neural responses. The human visual system is able to operate effectively from starlight to bright sunlight, a range that spans about twelve orders of magnitude of light intensity. To reliably transmit changes in light stimuli over this range the mammalian retina has evolved several specializations to report changes in the light environment that include: 1) the evolution of two photoreceptor types, the rods and cones, that operate at different light levels, 2) several neural pathways with which to encode the output of these photoreceptors, and 3) adaptive mechanisms at all levels of retinal processing to modulate light sensitivity based on light history. To address questions regarding the sensitivity and the operating range of rod pathways in the mammalian retina, I will present data from two projects designed to investigate how rod-generated signals traverse the retinal circuitry under various lighting conditions.; In the first study titled “OFF cone bipolar cells do not contribute to OFF signals near visual threshold”, I examined how signals traverse the retinal circuitry under fully dark-adapted conditions. Under these conditions a specialized retinal pathway conserved across mammalian species, called the Rod Bipolar Pathway, carries visual signals near absolute threshold. In this pathway rod signals converge downstream on depolarizing (AII) amacrine cells, but the route for signal flow from AII amacrine cells to OFF ganglion cells near visual threshold remains unclear; signals can be relayed directly to OFF ganglion cells, or to OFF ganglion cells through OFF cone bipolar cell synaptic terminals. I show in physiological recordings from dark-adapted retinas that glycinergic synapses between AII amacrine cells and OFF ganglion cells conveyed sensitive rod signals, whose response thresholds were elevated by strychnine. Strychnine, surprisingly, did not affect response threshold in any subtype of OFF cone bipolar cell, but produced a mild depolarization of the resting membrane potential, indicating a tonic glycinergic inhibition under dark-adapted conditions. These studies indicate that near visual threshold that rod signals are conveyed to OFF ganglion cells from AII amacrine cells, without contributions from OFF cone bipolar cells. This argues against the notion that the rod pathways must ultimately impinge on traditional cone pathways before reaching ganglion cells.; In the second study, titled ”Bleached rod photoresponses persist and traverse the retina”, alongside Dr. Kiyoharu Joshua Miyagishima, I examined the mechanism by which rods remain responsive despite the bleaching of a majority of their visual pigment. Exposure to bright bleaching light results in adaptation in a manner similar to exposures to background light that desensitize the cell. In rods, which are more sensitive, this adaptation is long-lasting since they are slow to regain their sensitivity. The loss in sensitivity can be explained by two phenomena; the first resulting from the loss in available photopigment for photon absorption, and the second resulting from residual catalytic activity of the photoproducts of bleaching. We measured the steady-state sensitivity following defined extents of pigment bleaching in the mouse retina. In single cell recordings from bleached retina we show that alternative rod pathways preserve and pool rod signals to improve overall sensitivity in the mesopic range.; The experiments described in this dissertation focus on the functional properties of rod vision by using transgenic mice where cone photoreceptors are unable to generate light activated responses (Gnat 2 -/-). These mice allow the study of the lower and <b>upper</b> limits of <b>rod</b> vision. Studying scotopic signaling in dark-adapted retinas from Gnat 2 -/- mice has implications for understanding specific forms of nyctalopia, such as: congenital stationary night blindness and retinitis pigmentosa (RP), which are classified as deficiencies in seeing under dim lighting conditions. The experiments described in Chapter 2 have contributed to our understanding how visual signals generated by the rod photoreceptors traverse the retinal pathways en route to more central structures within the brain. These pathways are likely to be the therapeutic targets for nyctalopic diseases.; Conversely studying the functional properties of light-adapted retinas using the same animal models can give insight into hemeralopia, which is defined as any deficiency in seeing under very bright lighting conditions. Hemeralopic individuals typically present with achromatopsia and an inability to form visual signals interpretable by the nervous system under bright lighting conditions. The experiments in Chapter 3 have contributed to our understanding of how individuals with no functional cones (rod monochromats) are able functionally navigate under bright lighting conditions...|$|R
