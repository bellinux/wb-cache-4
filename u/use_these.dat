5|$|Lexical {{variation}} between BASL {{and other}} dialects of ASL was first {{noted in the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language. In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black signers {{were found to have}} 28 signs that White signers did not know. Older signers are more likely to use variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to <b>use</b> <b>these</b> variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and <b>use</b> <b>these</b> innovative signs.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} models for {{simulation}} of Boolean circuits by Networks of Evolutionary Processors with Splicing Rules and Permitting/Forbidding Context. We first show how to simulate basic 2 -input logical gates namely AND, OR and XOR gate <b>using</b> <b>these</b> models. We then show how to simulate multiple input AND and OR gate <b>using</b> <b>these</b> models. Since, combination of AND, OR and XOR gate is universal, we can thus simulate any Boolean circuits <b>using</b> <b>these</b> models...|$|R

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of The Land of Gorch, Henson and his team had {{learned a great deal}} from being involved with the production.

However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.|$|E
