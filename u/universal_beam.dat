40|$|Precast {{concrete}} {{hollow core}} floor units are frequently used in multistorey steel- framed buildings where they bear {{on to the}} top flanges of <b>universal</b> <b>beams.</b> The steel beam is normally designed in bending in isolation from the concrete slab and no account is taken of the composite beam action available with the precast units. Although some commercial data are avail- able, there is no general design guidance to cover {{the wide range of}} material and geometric variables found in this form of construction. This paper summarizes research carried out at the University of Nottingham on this form of construction and presents the results of three full-scale bending tests of steel beams acting com- positely with proprietary precast hollow core slabs. The 150 mm deep units were attached to the <b>universal</b> <b>beams</b> through 19 mm diameter headed shear studs, and tested in four-point bending over a span of 6 m. For typical geometry and serial sizes the composite beams were found to be twice as strong and nearly three times as sti as the equivalent isolated steel beams. The failure mode was ductile, and may be controlled by the correct use of small quantities of tie steel and in situ infill concrete placed between the precast units. To generalize the findings, isolated push- off tests and eccentric compression tests were used to study the horizontal interface shear resistance of the headed studs and the strength of the slab, respectively...|$|R

It {{is intended to}} gain the advantages of both I-sections and hollow sections with additional desired performances due to its orientation. HFSPGs can meet the increased demand of an effective member for long span applications. Further, the introduced HFSPG will be an innovative, efficient and cost effective replacement for conventionally used <b>universal</b> <b>beams</b> (UB) and welded beams (WB). Although the HFSPG provides favorable properties, it is vulnerable to buckling failures which can limit its flexural capacity. Therefore, an investigation was conducted to study the section moment capacities of HFSPGs using both experiments and finite element analyses.

40|$|Concrete filled square hollow {{sections}} (CFSHS), comprising a square hollow section infilled with concrete {{have been used}} as a column in many structural applications in the USA, Europe, Japan and China. The CFSHS are not commonly used in Australia despite having many structural and constructional advantages. This is because it is perceived to be difficult/expensive to develop moment connections between open beams to the CFSHS. Welded connections are common in other countries but not common in Australia where shop welding and field bolting are the norm. The use of double-T blind bolted connections is proposed here as a structurally viable moment connection that satisfies the requirement for shop welding/field bolting and is easy to install. A detailed 3 D finite element model has been developed of a sub-assemblage that consists of a concrete filled steel tube as the column, <b>universal</b> <b>beams</b> on opposite side of the column which are composite with a concrete slab and that are connected to the column with moment resisting blind-bolted connections.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of web openings in existing steel floor beams {{is a common}} occurrence in practice. Such modifications are often necessary to accommodate additional services driven by a change of building use, thus {{extending the service life}} of the structure. Depending on their size and location, openings in the web can present a major challenge to the strength and stiffness of the beam. Strengthening around an opening is often necessary to maintain the required performance of the floor beam, traditionally this is affected via application of additional steel plate, either bolted or welded. This paper focusses on the novel application of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) to the problem of strengthening web openings, taking advantage of the material's ease of handling, superior strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance. An experimental study involving 4 full scale <b>universal</b> <b>beams</b> was conducted in order to investigate the ability of CFRP to recover the strength and stiffness of beams following the {{introduction of}} web openings. All the specimens were tested under 6 -point bending in the experiments.

40|$|The main {{function}} of a column is to transfer loads by means of compressive action. The response of the column to a nominally applied load depends upon a number of factors. The most important are its length and cross-sectional shape, the strength of material, the conditions of support provided at its ends and the method of restrained to its axis. This paper presents the performance of cruciform column under axial compression load. Cruciform column, which {{is also known as}} compound members, consists of two universal beams section where one <b>universal</b> <b>beam</b> section is cut into two at the mid section of the beam and welded to the other beam section.

40|$|Abstract: In hard {{collisions}} at a hadron collider {{the most}} appropriate description of the initial state depends on what is measured in the final state. Parton distribution functions (PDFs) evolved to the hard collision scale Q are appropriate for inclusive observables, but not for measurements with a specific number of hard jets, leptons, and photons.

40|$|This thesis reports work on {{two aspects}} of framed structures: part I is {{concerned}} with sway frames and part II with the ductility of composite flush end plate connections. Part I has investigated the effect of adopting standardised end plate connections as the method of providing the load path between the structural members of a steelwork sway frame. Practical low to medium rise multi-storey frame geometries have been designed in accordance with limit state principles {{in conjunction with the}} Wind-Moment Method. Each frame was analysed by undertaking a second-order elastic-plastic computer analysis to ascertain their structural performance, with particular emphasis directed towards problems associated with stability and sway deflections. The computer simulation necessitated the formulation of a prediction equation that modeled the initial stiffness characteristics of the standard connections. This model has been verified by comparison with full scale experimental test results, mainly taken from the literature. The investigation confirms that standardised end plate connections provide levels of stiffness and resistance which enable unbraced steel frames to be safely designed by the Wind-Moment method. There are however certain frame geometries where serviceability considerations dictate that stiffening to the frame would be necessary, if the standardised end plate connections were used. Part II has investigated the ductility of five major axis composite flush end plate connections that incorporate nominally identical amounts of reinforcement in conjunction with either 457 or 533 serial size <b>Universal</b> <b>Beams.</b> Other variable parameters include end plate thickness and horizontal spacing of the rebars.

The design optimisation {{takes into account}} ultimate as well as serviceability limit states, adopting deflection limits recommended by the Steel Construction Institute (SCI). Results for three benchmark frames demonstrate {{the efficiency of the}} optimisation methodology. A genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimise the dimensions of the plates used for the columns, rafters and haunches. Discrete decision variables were adopted for the thickness of the steel plates and continuous variables for the breadth and depth of the plates. Strategies were developed to enhance the performance of the GA including solution space reduction and a hybrid initial population half of which is derived using Latin hypercube sampling. The results show that the proposed GA-based optimisation model generates optimal and near-optimal solutions consistently. A parametric study is then conducted on frames of different spans. A significant variation in weight between fabricated and conventional hot-rolled steel portal frames is shown; for a 50 m span frame, a 14 – 19 % saving in weight was achieved.

40|$|A beam {{structure}} subjected to different loading conditions {{is likely to}} have localised stress concentrations when loaded. High magnitudes of stress and repeated loading may lead to the development of cracks. Given the wide use of steel beams, the presence of cracks is a source of serious concern as cracks decrease the structural integrity of the structure. This can have catastrophic consequences in terms of human life, property damage, and economic losses. In order to eliminate or reduce the chances of structural failure due to a crack, it is desirable that any crack is detected in its early stages of development, before it becomes structurally significant. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate a crack on a simple structure using a vibration technique. This investigation presents a method of non-destructively assessing a structure to detect a crack from vibration measurements taken at a single point on the structure. Finite element analysis (FEA) software was used to model and understand the effects of crack severity and varying crack position {{along the length of the}} beam. This analysis determined how these crack characteristics affect the resonant frequencies of the structure’s mode of vibration. An impact test was used to obtain vibration measurements for a non-cracked and cracked beam. A saw-cut of various percentage reductions in cross-sectional area was used to resemble the crack.

40|$|The {{advantage}} of having no unstiffened elements coupled with material {{located away from}} the neutral axis makes hollow flange channel (HFC) beam sections structurally efficient in bending when compared with other commonly used open cold-formed steel sections. This concept is similar to hot-rolled steel sections such as the <b>universal</b> <b>beam</b> and channel beam sections, which are very efficient in bending. However, the hot-rolled sections are heavier, torsionally weak, and have low resistance to flexural-torsional buckling. The two hollow flanges in HFC beams make them torsionally strong and also eliminate the occurrence of distortional and local flange buckling modes in most cases. However, HFC beams have slender webs, making them vulnerable to web crippling failure modes. To understand the web crippling behaviour of HFC beams and develop accurate design rules, finite element models of HFC beams were developed and validated using available experimental results under End One Flange (EOF) and Interior One Flange (IOF) load cases. Using the validated finite element models, a detailed parametric study was conducted for many HFC sections. Finite element analyses provided the required elastic buckling and ultimate loads of HFC beams in web crippling (EOF and IOF load cases). New predictive equations were proposed to determine the elastic buckling coefficients of HFC beams, followed by Direct Strength Method (DSM) based design rules using the test, elastic buckling and nonlinear analysis results from finite element analyses.
