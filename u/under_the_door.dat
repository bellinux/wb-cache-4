5|$|The first flames {{were spotted}} at 6:00pm, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of the House of Lords, by {{the wife of}} one of the doorkeepers; she entered the chamber to see Black Rod's box alight, and flames burning the {{curtains}} and wood panels, and raised the alarm. For 25 minutes the staff inside the palace initially panicked and then tried to deal with the blaze, but they did not call for assistance, or alert staff at the House of Commons, {{at the other end of}} the palace complex.|$|E
5|$|The next day, {{a general}} store {{delivery}} boy named Jimmy (Jack Parker) listens to a radio {{report about the}} Creeper's murders. The cantankerous store owner Mr. Haskins (Oscar O'Shea) arrives with a handwritten letter slipped <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> requesting groceries be delivered to a nearby dock. Jimmy brings the groceries to the dock and leaves them at a door, where the Creeper takes them into his hideout. But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J. Donelly (Donald MacBride) and Lieutenant Gates (Peter Whitney) receive complaints from the mayor's office about their failure to arrest the Creeper, but they deflect the blame. The two officers then get a call about the missing delivery boy and head to the dock to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Burke and Hare's next {{victim was}} a {{familiar}} figure {{in the streets of}} Edinburgh, James Wilson, an 18-year-old man with a limp caused by deformed feet. He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> As Wilson did not like whisky—he preferred snuff—he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.|$|E

50|$|To protect houses, the lamassu were {{engraved}} in clay tablets, {{which were}} then buried <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>door's</b> threshold. They were often placed as a pair {{at the entrance of}} palaces. At the entrance of cities, they were sculpted in colossal size, and placed as a pair, one at each side of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> city, that generally had <b>doors</b> in <b>the</b> surrounding wall, each one looking towards one of the cardinal points.|$|R

Also, the twin chrome and rubber strips running <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> 220a were replaced with solid chrome strips. The most obvious difference is {{the addition of a}} chrome strip running along the front fenders and <b>doors</b> of <b>the</b> 220S.|$|R

25|$|On November 12, 1853, President Antonio López de Santa Anna {{announced}} a competition {{to write a}} national anthem for Mexico. The competition offered a prize for the best poetic composition representing patriotic ideals. Francisco González Bocanegra, a talented poet, {{was not interested in}} participating in the competition. He argued that writing love poems involved very different skills from the ones required to write a national anthem. His fiancée, Guadalupe González del Pino (or Pili), had undaunted faith in her fiancé's poetic skills and was displeased with his constant refusal to participate in spite of her constant prodding and requests from their friends. Under false pretenses, she lured him to a secluded bedroom in her parents' house, locked him into the room, and refused to let him out until he produced an entry for the competition. Inside the room in which he was temporarily imprisoned were pictures depicting various events in Mexican history which helped to inspire his work. After four hours of fluent (albeit forced) inspiration, Francisco regained his freedom by slipping all ten verses of his creation <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> After Francisco received approval from his fiancée and her father, he submitted the poem and won the competition by unanimous vote. González was announced the winner in the publication Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) on February 3, 1854.|$|E
500|$|While Hurley {{had been}} able to command Friday's respect, {{it soon became clear that}} Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday {{appeared}} one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. [...] "He still called me boss", Hurley recalled. [...] "I can't play for that little bastard", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. [...] "You're the one who seems to be able to get me right. Can I come back to you?" [...] Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the £28,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, [...] "Tickets, please!", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. A player standing near the forward started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched the laughing player in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards.|$|E

She questions the morality of his financial scheme, and the two split up. Peter then discovers that a bug in Michael's code has caused their virus to steal over $300,000 {{in only a few}} days, which is far more conspicuous. Meanwhile, Joanna has finally stood up to her boss at Chotchkie's and quit, and Peter has discovered that she slept with a different [...] "Lumbergh." [...] Peter admits to her that the scheme was a bad idea and that he plans to accept responsibility for the crime, and they reconcile. He writes a letter confessing everything and slips it and traveler's cheques for the stolen money <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> of Lumbergh's office late at night.|$|E
2500|$|Rooms one and two, also {{prisoner}} housing, were in two one-story buildings {{closer to}} the river and where until October 1933, the prisoners had no beds and slept directly on the ground, with just a bit of straw underneath them. Room one led to the [...] "bunker", a concrete former coke storage room adjacent to the boiler unit, and the infirmary. The heating equipment was non-functional; a battlefield forge stood in the unit. The bunker was , with one small opening and an iron door leading to room one. New prisoners were made to live there for days, even weeks. As many as 50 men at a time were made to live there in stifling air and heat; one witness said, [...] "The exhaled breath of those locked up was so great that water condensed and ran <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> as if poured from a bucket." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{invention}} came {{in response}} to the increasingly severe violent crime situation in South Africa, which in 1998 had already made the country (particularly Johannesburg) the per capita murder, assault, rape and carjacking capital of the world.

Fourie claims it is unlikely to kill but would [...] "definitely blind" [...] the assailant. In South Africa, it is legal to use lethal force in self-defence if in fear of one's life, and ownership of flamethrowers is unrestricted.|$|R
