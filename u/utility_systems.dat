40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{issue of}} energy {{has emerged as}} one of the {{greatest}} challenges facing the mankind. In the industrial perspective, the development of site <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> (generally CHP systems) for the generation and management of utilities provide a great potential source for energy savings. However, a master/slave relationship usually governs this kind of system; the management of such type of industrial units is carried out in three sequential steps: scheduling of the production plant, estimation of the utility needs and finally scheduling of the CHP based <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> are three tasks performed. To improve the decision-making process, this contribution proposes an integrated approach which carries out simultaneous and consistent scheduling of batch production plant and site <b>utility</b> <b>system.</b> The proposed methodology relies on discrete time modelling and uses Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). Moreover, to permit an efficient and generic formulation of various kinds of industrial problems, an extension of the existing framework RTN is developed: the ERTN (Extended Resource Task Network (ERTN). The results show that the integrated approach leads to better synchronization between production plant and site <b>utility</b> <b>system.</b> Hence, the integrated approach leads to significant reduction in energy costs and decrease in harmful gas emissions.

2500|$|The Manitoba Power Commission and Manitoba Hydro Electric Board merged in 1961 to form Manitoba Hydro. One of {{the earlier}} {{wholesale}} accounts {{to be transferred to}} Manitoba Hydro in 1956 was the village of Emerson, which had been served up to that point by a cross-border tie to the Otter Tail Power system at Noyes. The last of the private mine-owned <b>utility</b> <b>systems</b> at Flin Flon was purchased by Manitoba Hydro in 1973. [...] The early 1970s also marked the installation of tie lines between Manitoba Hydro and utilities in Ontario, Saskatchewan and Minnesota. The interconnection with the American utilities (Otter Tail Power, Northern States Power, and Minkota Power Cooperative) were used to obtain firm power of 90 MW for the winter of 1970; and since that time these interconnections have also been used for export of energy.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} North Louisiana Telephone Company had been sold, Couch was already {{exploring}} {{the possibilities of}} developing a similar interconnected electric utility system. [...] Both Malvern and Arkadelphia had awarded franchises for citywide electric utilities, and in both cities, the utility companies were in decline, and only provided night-time service. [...] Couch proposed a partnership with Arkansas Land & Lumber Company, a large sawmill operation in Malvern, whereby sawdust and waste material purchased from the sawmill {{would be used to}} fuel boilers, producing steam for two 550-kilowatt turbines to generate electric power. [...] The new system, a predecessor of Arkansas Power and Light Company (AP), became operational on 18 December 1914, providing Malvern and Arkadelphia with 24-hour electric service for the first time. [...] In 1916, AP's second generating plant opened in Russellville, seat of Pope County in north-central Arkansas. The plant was adjacent to a coal field which provided a steady supply of fuel. Under leadership of Couch, AP continued purchasing city <b>utility</b> <b>systems</b> and building electric transmission lines throughout Arkansas.|$|E

40|$|Kashima-Kita Electric Power Corporation (KKEPC) is {{a utility}} supplier, which serves {{the eastern part}} of the Kashima Industrial Area in Japan. The <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> of KKEPC {{involves}} many steam and electricity generating equipment units. Although a large number of equipment units provide the system flexibility, it induces lots of complicated internal interactions. In order to handle the trade-off between the flexibility and the interactions, all units in the <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> should be managed simultaneously. This eventually creates a large-scale site-wide optimisation problem. A powerful optimisation tool, site-model, has been therefore introduced to KKEPC for solving the complicated problem. The site-model is a linear mathematical programming model with considerations on all site-wide information of utility and material balances. It is noted that the flexibility and the efficiency of the KKEPC <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> has been enhanced after adopting the site-model. The site-model can also explore further opportunities for the future plan. In this paper, several case studies of the KKEPC <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> optimisation will be presented to demonstrate the capabilities of the site-model. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the usage of fossil fuels in {{industrial}} sectors by meeting the requirements of production processes, new heat integration and heat recovery approaches are developed. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop an approach to increase energy efficiency of an industrial zone by recovering and reusing waste heat via indirect heat integration. Industrial zones usually consist of multiple independent plants, where each plant is supplied by an independent <b>utility</b> <b>system,</b> as a decentralized system. In this study, a new approach is developed to target minimum energy requirements where an industrial zone would be supplied by a centralized <b>utility</b> <b>system</b> instead of decentralized <b>utility</b> <b>system.</b> The approach assumes that all process plants in an industrial zone are linked through the central <b>utility</b> <b>system.</b> This method is formulated as a linear programming problem (LP). Moreover, the proposed method may be used for decision making related to energy integration strategy of an industrial zone. In addition, the proposed method was applied on a case study.
