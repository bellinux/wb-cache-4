40|$|The airline {{industry}} has undergone an unprecedented {{crisis in the}} aftermath of the events of September 11 th, 2001 in the United States. At that time, the U. S. federal government rapidly moved to create and implement an important rescue package to ensure the sustainability of the U. S. airlines. Contrarily, the European Commission decided to keep the existing legislations and policies regarding state aid, allowing limited support from the Member States to their national carriers. For the Commission, the U. S. state-involvement in the air industry, as well as similar developments in other countries, was bound to create distortions of competition. This situation led the EU to submit a proposal to the Council and the European Parliament for a Regulation with aims to protect the Community airlines from the <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> of state-aided non-Community air carriers. The text, modeled after the legislation applicable in the field of trade of goods, would fill a "legal void" and be a new efficient legislative tool for the Commission. Questions did arise, however, about its political legitimacy as well as its legal basis...|$|R

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of contract farming {{in the cotton}} industry of Zimbabwe implies {{that it has become}} the dominant marketing system. Even the independently produced cotton is eventually sold to the contracting cotton companies owing to enacted regulations which compel all prospective cotton buyers to finance production through contract farming to be licensed to purchase seed cotton from farmers. However, the prevailing seed cotton marketing system is riddled with challenges characterised by price negotiation impasses that recur every marketing season, prompting Government intervention in a supposedly free market system. While peasant farmers accuse cotton companies of colluding in undertaking <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>practices,</b> the cotton buying companies on the other hand blame it all on the peasant farmers for failure to increase yield levels to expected national and international standards, and also failure to be reliable in loan payments. This study seeks to assess the role of cotton contract farming in the Jiri communal lands of Gokwe, Zimbabwe in addressing peasantry socio-economic livelihoods. Results of this study show that the contract farming system in the area under study has failed to address the welfare of the peasants in the area, and there is need for consorted effort to come up with other alternatives besides relying on cotton production. Alternative options, though few, are available for the peasant farmers to reduce reliance on the cotton cash crop. However, contracted farmers have guaranteed markets and less hassles in inputs sourcing. All things being equal, it would be advisable for farmers to produce their cotton independently and realise higher return...|$|R
40|$|Negotiations on {{agriculture}} were successfully {{launched in the}} WTO early in 2000. In the initial phase, negotiating proposals have been submitted by member countries and are being discussed in special sessions of the WTO Committee on Agriculture. A stock-taking exercise {{will be held in}} March 2001 to establish the next steps in the process. Many developments will influence the shape and dynamics of the negotiations, particularly the possibility of a comprehensive trade round. The first part of this paper examines the policy setting for the negotiations. The ongoing integration of economies and accompanying agricultural policy reforms provide an environment for further trade liberalization. Expansion of regional trade agreements and EU enlargement negotiations add urgency to the multilateral negotiating process. Newer trade issues and nontrade concerns, often connected to the food business, focus attention on the agricultural talks but may also retard them. A further factor that will add urgency is the anticipated expiry of the Peace Clause in 2003. The paper reviews the main agricultural issues for negotiation and the initial negotiating positions. Substantial progress in improving access is essential for the negotiations to succeed. The issues of export subsidies, other forms of export competition, <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>practices,</b> and dumping are receiving much attention. There are pressures to reduce or eliminate all forms of trade-distorting domestic support. Many non-trade concerns are being introduced, and legitimate trade issues will need to be addressed. The developing countries are determined to extract a better deal for their agriculture. The paper concludes that the elements for progress in further agricultural trade liberalization are coming to the negotiating table but much uncertainty remains both within and outside agriculture. agricultural negotiations, peace clause, non-trade concerns, subsidies, WTO, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R
40|$|China, like {{a number}} of other {{antitrust}} jurisdictions, has a law concerning <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing.</b> This article develops an economic framework for applying the <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> law in China. The framework draws on the experience of courts and competition authorities in other jurisdictions and the writings of various commentators, particularly economists, on <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> in those jurisdictions. It shows that virtually all jurisdictions have decided to consider <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> claims only in exceptional circumstances, and rarely, if ever, in innovation-intensive industries. For those cases that pass this screen and receive consideration, the courts and competition authorities then, under the leading test, insist on substantial evidence that the price is significantly higher than cost and is unfair given the value provided to the buyer. This article shows that the exceptional circumstances screen and the rigorous <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> test are motivated by a recognition, supported by substantial empirical evidence, that successful firms must have the assurance of receiving significant rewards to induce them to invest time and capital in highly risky innovation that is the source of economic growth and welfare. It concludes by showing that this approach is consistent with modern Chinese economic policy...|$|R

40|$|When and why can parties {{escape from}} a {{contract}} {{on the ground}} that the <b>price</b> is <b>unfair?</b> This question is considered in a comparative and historical perspective in English and French law. The general rule in both systems is that the parties are free to determine the price and they are then bound by their contract. One well known exception in French law, which derives from Roman law, is Article 1674 of the Code civil which allows a vendor to rescind a contract for the sale of land if the price agreed in the contract is less than five-twelfths of the fair price. It is generally thought that there are no analogous rules in English law. However, the law on this subject is in fact considerably more complex and more colourful than this simple contrast would suggest. Numerous rules on <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> in contracts were created in French law by the legislature and the courts since the promulgation of the Code civil in 1804. In English law, courts intervened in contracts on the ground of an <b>unfair</b> <b>price</b> in a few instances in the nineteenth century. However, only the rule on <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> in salvage contracts has survived until today. In both systems, the policies of preserving family wealth, protecting weak parties and giving special treatment to certain parties for economic, political, social or cultural reasons underpin these rules. There are two principal conclusions. First, freedom of contract is much less extensive in French law than in English law. This is evident in the numerous rules on <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> in contracts in French law and in the primacy of the remedy of altering the price rather than rescission. Secondly, while in theory, French courts play a much less significant role than English courts in the development of law, the creation and abolition of certain rules on <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> in contracts by French courts shows that judicial creativity in French law can be much less constrained in practice than in English law.

40|$|ABSTRACTLower pricing for new customers: {{consequences}} of perceived pricing unfairness among current customersThis study examines the relations {{that result from}} perceptions of pricing unfairness triggered by comparisons with the lower price paid by new clients in promotional situations. An experiment was conducted with a sample that consisted of 200 undergraduate students. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that the perception of <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> is positively succeeded by negative emotions, and by the intent to switch immediately or in the future. Moreover, trust {{is affected by the}} perception of <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing,</b> since this perception may violate a client’s trust in the company. Supporting the distinction of immediate and future switching intentions, the study found that negative emotions and trust have different impacts on these two types of switching intentions. Negative word-of-mouth intention was also found to be an important consequence of the emotions that stem from the perceived injustice and from trust feelings, indicating that strong negative emotions and lower levels of trust are related to higher levels of negative word-of-mouth. This study also discusses the managerial and academic contributions of these results and the implications for future studies...|$|R

Wheat produced in Canada and the United States competes in a globalized economy. This has caused much worry by farmers {{on both sides of the}} border. Wheat has been a source of contention between the two countries for a number of years. This has been apparent over the last decade with accusations of <b>unfair</b> trading and <b>pricing</b> <b>practices</b> being exchanged across the border. In this sort of environment, producers, as well as politicians, want to know if there is any truth to the accusations. They want to know if farmers on either side of the border are better able to compete in a global economy than their counterparts. The purpose of this study was to determine the competitiveness of farmers in Canada and the United States. There have been several studies to date done on this same subject, however none of them yielded any clear-cut results. Using cost of production as a means of comparison, this study attempted to measure the competitiveness of farmers in the two countries. Panels of farmers were used to develop representative farms, which were then used to make comparisons. This study had an advantage over studies done in the past because all the data was gathered by the same group using the same process. In many cases, researchers must rely on data available from sources within the respective countries. This study used primary data gathered by researchers in the Agricultural and Food Policy Center rather than secondary data. The study found that farmers on both sides of the border are competitive. While the lowest cost producer was found to be in the United States, the Canadian farms followed very closely. No single representative farm was signifcantly outperforming any of the other farms...|$|R
