40|$|The Hong Kong {{cadastral}} {{system is}} designed for efficient transactions which has remained unchanged since {{the enactment of the}} Land Registration Ordinance in 1844. In this British designed cadastral system, various land-right records are kept by different government departments. The current computerized register gives good protection of ownership rights to practically all land properties. Land use rights have been taken up by the Town Planning Ordinance and the individual detailed land rights criteria are contained in land leases or land grant documents. Land boundary rights, property management arrangement and other land rights are to be traced from the deeds. The design usage and the first alienation of land is managed by government whereas the subsequent development and the subdivision of property units in the mode of <b>undivided</b> <b>shares</b> of land are largely private deals.

40|$|Condominium {{enables the}} {{subdivision}} of buildings into multiple private titles. It does so by combining individual titles with an <b>undivided</b> <b>share</b> of common property, {{a right to}} participate in governing the property, and an obligation to contribute to its maintenance. The dissolution of condominium breaks apart this package of rights and responsibilities, and results in the termination of the individual titles. Some common law jurisdictions require the unanimous consent of title holders to dissolve condominium, others permit it with a supermajority vote. All jurisdictions allow for non-consensual dissolution, and thus the termination of titles without consent, with a court order. This paper reviews dissolution rules and reform efforts in several common law jurisdictions and then uses the condominium legislation and case law from British Columbia to argue that non-consensual dissolution of condominium, whether by supermajority vote or court order, should be understood as private takings. However, {{the purpose of this}} characterization is not to advocate for a unanimity or a supermajority rule. Instead, this paper uses the takings literature to reveal that the legislative choice between dissolution rules, and the judicial choice between ordering or declining to order the dissolution of condominium, is also a choice between different conceptions of property and of what property is for. Finally, the paper argues that the growing prevalence of condominium as a form of ownership, and its capacity to reflect broader tensions in ownership regimes between individual and community, suggest that the nature of property within condominium is increasingly important in constructing the nature of property in land...|$|R

The West has had significant success in linking the End-Investor (Excess Capital) with the most optimal user of this Excess Capital; be it the Stock Market, Debt Market or the Securitization structures, they all serve the purpose of linking Capital with its most optimal (on a risk-adjusted basis) user. It must be kept in mind, that even though the West has had more success than the Muslim world in implementation of a financial system, it has been plagued with constant cycles of boom and bust. The most recent financial markets crisis has again opened the discussion for the need of structural changes to the current financial models/instruments in place.
