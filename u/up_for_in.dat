The inspiration for this came during his second pilgrimage to Mecca in 1926. What he lacked in scholarly learning, presence, charisma or speaking ability, he made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> zeal. He initially tried to establish a network of mosque-based religious schools to educate the Mewati Muslims about Islamic beliefs and practices. Shortly afterwards, he was disappointed with the reality that these institutions were producing religious functionaries, but not preachers.|$|E

25|$|Allied armies {{began using}} {{combined}} arms formations and deep penetration strategies that Germany had {{used in the}} opening years of the war. Many Allied operations in the Western Desert and on the Eastern Front, relied on firepower to establish breakthroughs by fast-moving armoured units. These artillery-based tactics were also decisive in Western Front operations after Operation Overlord and the British Commonwealth and American armies developed flexible and powerful systems for using artillery support. What the Soviets lacked in flexibility, they made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> number of rocket launchers, guns and mortars.

Over the course of the battle roughly 1,000 Chinese soldiers were shot dead by other members of their own army for attempting to retreat, and on Yuhuatai Japanese soldiers noticed that many Chinese pillboxes were chained from the outside to prevent their occupants from fleeing.|$|E

She {{admitted}} that before the show, she had never sat through a theatrical musical. She was not a strong singer, but found the offer irresistible and, as Berg puts it, [...] "what she lacked in euphony she made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> guts". The actress took vocal lessons six times a week in preparation for the show. She was nervous about every performance, and recalled [...] "wondering what the hell I was doing there." [...] Reviews for the production were mediocre, but Hepburn herself was praised and Coco was popular with the public—with its run twice extended. She later said Coco marked the first time she accepted that the public was not against her, but actually seemed to love her. Her work earned a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical.|$|E

In Cloak of Deception, James Luceno {{writes that}} Palpatine {{carefully}} guards his privacy and [...] "others found his reclusiveness intriguing, {{as if he}} led a secret life". Despite this, he has many allies in the government. Luceno writes, [...] "What Palpatine lacked in charisma, he made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> candor, {{and it was that}} directness that had led to his widespread appeal in the senate. ... For in his heart he judged the universe on his own terms, with a clear sense of right and wrong." [...] In Terry Brooks' , Palpatine claims to embrace democratic principles. He tells Queen Amidala, [...] "I promise, Your Majesty, if I am elected , I will restore democracy to the Republic. I will {{put an end to the}} corruption that has plagued the Senate." [...] A Visual Dictionary states that he is a self-proclaimed savior.|$|E
500|$|Portal {{received}} critical acclaim, often {{earning more}} praise than either Half-Life 2: Episode Two or Team Fortress 2, two titles {{also included in}} The Orange Box. It was praised for its unique gameplay and dark, deadpan humor. Eurogamer cited that [...] "the way the game progresses from being a simple set of perfunctory tasks to a full-on part of the Half-Life story is absolute genius", while GameSpy noted that [...] "What Portal lacks in length, it more than makes <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> exhilaration." [...] The game was criticized for sparse environments, and both criticized and praised for its short length. Aggregate reviews for the stand-alone PC version of Portal gave the game a 90/100 through 28reviews on Metacritic. In 2011, Valve stated that Portal had sold more than four million copies through the retail versions, including the standalone game and The Orange Box, and from the Xbox Live Arcade version.|$|E

[...] Eureka! TV, which released The Mitchell and Webb Situation on DVD in 2005, said that the show [...] "gushes forth an hilarious stream of surreal and quirkily inventive sketches", as well as calling it a [...] "cult success". In the interview with Wessex Scene, Mitchell stated that he was [...] "more proud of the way it turned out than annoyed that it was only aired on a small channel." ...|$|E
500|$|Erotica {{remains the}} most rampantly {{misrepresented}} Madonna album with the biggest backlash of her career. Taraborrelli commented that {{it is unfortunate that}} Erotica has to be historically linked to other less memorable ventures in Madonna's career at this time. However, he quipped that the album should be considered on its own merits, not only as one linked to the other two adult-oriented projects, because it has true value. When asked to name her biggest professional disappointment, Madonna answered, [...] "The fact that my Erotica album was overlooked because of the whole thing with the Sex book. It just got lost in all that. I think there's some brilliant songs on it and people didn't give it a chance." [...] Brian McNair observed that Madonna took a financial risk with the album and it was not until Ray of Light (1998) that her record sales recovered to pre-Erotica levels. He further asserted that [...] "what she lost in royalty payments, however, Madonna more than made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> iconic status and cultural influence." ...|$|E

English reviews of the game were typically favorable, with critics such as Electronic Gaming Monthly remarking that Lunars [...] "plot, writing and voice acting are about the best you'll find", awarding the game an editor's choice gold award. The game's translation was equally applauded by , calling it [...] "spotless", and remarking that Working Designs' unique humor was applied to every bit of text in the game, including weapon descriptions.

[...] The New York Post gave the film three and a half stars out of four praising the film's originality, comparing it to the work of directors Dario Argento and Guy Maddin. indieWire included [...] House in their list of [...] "Haunted House films worth discussing" [...] calling it [...] "the cheeriest, most infectious blood bath in cinematic history."

500|$|Word that Lakes had {{notified}} Cope of his finds galvanized Marsh into action. When Marsh {{heard from}} Union Pacific Railroad workers W.E. Carlin and W.H. Reed about a vast boneyard northwest of Laramie in Como Bluff, Marsh sent his agent, Samuel Wendell Williston, {{to take charge}} of the digging. Cope, in response, learned of Carlin and Reed's discoveries and sent his own men to find bones in the area. The two scientists attempted to sabotage each other's progress. Cope was described as a genius and what Marsh lacked in intelligence, he easily made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> connections—Marsh's uncle was George Peabody, a rich banker who supported Marsh with money, and a secure position at the Peabody Museum. Marsh lobbied John Wesley Powell to act against Cope and attempted to persuade Hayden to [...] "muzzle" [...] Cope's publishing. Both men tried to spy on the other's whereabouts and attempted to offer their collectors more money in the hopes of recruiting them to their own side. Cope was able to recruit David Baldwin in New Mexico and Frank Williston in Wyoming from Marsh. Cope and Marsh were extremely secretive as to the source of their fossils. When Henry Fairfield Osborn, at the time a student at Princeton, visited Cope to ask where to travel to look for fossils in the West, Cope politely refused to answer.|$|E

[...] In the November 1993 issue of Dragon, Sandy Petersen gave it an [...] "Excellent" [...] rating. He criticized the [...] "stylized" [...] combat system and the graphics as [...] "inferior" [...] to Zelda, but praised how every [...] "spell has a different on-screen effect" [...] and the difficulty for being [...] "just about right" [...] where bosses [...] "nearly beat you every time" [...] unlike other RPG's such as Ultima where [...] enough [...] "adventuring" [...] {{makes it possible to}} [...] "trash" [...] enemies [...] "with ease."

[...] He praised the story in particular, noting that, in a departure from other RPGs where the party always [...] "sticks together through thick and thin," [...] the characters have their own motives for joining and leaving the group, with one that [...] "even betrays" [...] them. He stated that it is like [...] "following the storyline of a fantasy novel," [...] comparing it to The Lord of the Rings and Man in the Iron Mask, concluding that, because [...] "the characters often spoke up for themselves," [...] he [...] "got much more attached" [...] to the party [...] "than in any other computer game." ...|$|E

500|$|Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror {{believed}} the [...] "setting and the gangsterish plot are both reminiscent of that great British movie Sexy Beast, and this first instalment of the four-part series presses {{all the right}} buttons," [...] adding [...] "it has naturalistic performances, an effortless blend of comedy and sinister undertones plus rather more shots of Marc Warren's bum cheeks than might be considered absolutely necessary." [...] Ben Walsh of The Independent rated the series three stars out of five, having written [...] "there's far too much exposition, a very daft plot, some risible dialogue and yet Sky's ripe four-parter is horribly compelling," [...] and added [...] "it's extremely silly, but Simm and Glenister are always compelling and they make this gamey tale of gangsters, police corruption and 'friendship' work." [...] Reviewing the first two episode, The Stage {{believed the}} first was [...] "a slow-burning exploration" [...] and [...] "all very intriguing and disturbing, with a great performance by Chaplin as the smilingly psychotic host." [...] The reviewer criticised the death of Alvo, as he was considered the most [...] "compelling character" [...] and since [...] "sent the plot line spinning off into less original territory," [...] adding the producers took ideas from crime capers such as Sexy Beast and Shallow Grave. The reviewer added [...] "what Mad Dogs lacks in originality it makes <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> energy, verve and humour. The dialogue positively crackles with great lines." [...] In the end, the reviewer stated that Mad Dogs [...] "may be an unapologetic crowd pleaser, {{but it is a}} finely made one, with excellent performances from a dream cast. It also offers the only opportunity I have of seeing blue skies, azure waters and sunshine in February, so I am in for the duration." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Our Father" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; some {{thought that it}} was dull, though Smits' performance received widespread critical acclaim. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that he was [...] "frustrated" [...] by the episode despite not finding any faults with it, writing, [...] "I can't help thinking that I've seen as much of Dexter Morgan's world as I need to." [...] Matt Fowler, writing for IGN, thought that the revelation of Rita's pregnancy was [...] "an interesting development, but not necessarily something that instantly catapults me to the edge of my seat" [...] but that Smits as Miguel could improve [...] "even [...] great [...] like Dexter". The Australians Stephen Romei felt that, with the beginning of the third season, [...] "Dexter has gone from an eight to a six" [...] {{on a scale of one}} to ten, saying that the show [...] "has lost its edge" [...] with the hypocrisy of Dexter being a supposed sociopath despite holding several relationships. Los Angeles Times critic Claire Zulkey was [...] "not sure yet whether [...] good". Ray Ellis of Blogcritics felt that [...] "the series has settled into a state of complacency" [...] and could not [...] "escape the feeling I've seen this before". On the other hand, the San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman wrote that [...] "the whiff of normalcy for Dexter" [...] gives viewers [...] "a magnificent tease" [...] and likened the fast-moving plot to [...] "the urgency of brilliance". TV Squad critic Debra McDuffee was [...] "pleasantly surprised by Smits" [...] and said that, thus far, [...] "season three is a good one". TV Guides Paula Paige, who was [...] "thrilled" [...] to see Smits join the cast, said, [...] "What the Dexter season three opener lacked in explosive excitement, it certainly made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> Jimmy Smits."

500|$|An {{aggressive}} right-handed all-rounder, Loxton {{tended to}} bat in the middle-order, and bowled {{after the new}} ball pacemen. As well as being a belligerent batsman, he was a right-arm fast-medium swing bowler known {{for his ability to}} move the ball, and a powerful outfielder. He had a strong arm and exploited his power frequently, {{to the extent that the}} Australian wicket-keeper Don Tallon complained about the jarring impact of his unnecessarily strong throws when the batsmen were already home and no run out was possible. Loxton was known for his energetic and aggressive approach to cricket, and liked to attack and intimidate opposition batsmen. In one match in the late-1950s, he bowled an eight-ball over at New South Welshman Norm O'Neill consisting entirely of bouncers aimed at the upper body. Loxton was not afraid of opposition bowlers doing the same to him; he had a penchant for trying to hook bouncers out of the ground. He was a predominantly back-foot player whose initial foot-movement tended to be back and towards and then across the stumps. When he committed to a back foot shot, Loxton often made such a decisive retreat that he almost stepped onto his stumps. One painter once captured the Victorian almost disturbing the woodwork with his right leg, leading Loxton to quip [...] "That's what I call using the crease". Hassett said that his fellow Victorian [...] "really used to give everything he had all the time... Put him on to bowl and he'd bowl his hardest, no matter how he felt." [...] Bradman said that Loxton [...] "never shirked the issue" [...] and that [...] "he’d throw himself into it with everything he had. This is one of the reasons he was a great team man. You could call on him at any stage and he’d give you his very best." [...] Bradman said that the Victorian all-rounder [...] "was never a great cricketer in the sense that some others were great, but he was a very good player and what he lacked in ability he made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>in</b> effort". He further added that the Victorian was [...] "the very essence of belligerence...His whole attitude suggests defiance and when he hits the ball it is the music of a sledgehammer." [...] Former Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly, while agreeing that Loxton was always energetic, regarded his bowling as being too dull and predictable to have any major impact at the highest level, and thought that the Victorian all-rounder’s career would have been best served by saving his energy purely for batting.|$|E
