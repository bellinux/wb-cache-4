Grantees directly provide services to individuals (clients) or arrange with service providers to do so. The Department of Health and Human Services's (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which administers CARE Act programs, is required to cancel balances of grants that are unobligated after one year and redistribute amounts to grantees in need. HRSA began to collect client-level data in 2009. Under the CARE Act, states and territories receive grants for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP), which provide HIV/AIDS drugs. GAO was asked to examine elements of the CARE Act. In this report, we review: (1) HRSA's implementation of the <b>unobligated</b> <b>balance</b> provisions, (2) HRSA's actions to collect client-level data, and (3) the status of ADAP waiting lists. GAO reviewed reports and agency documents and interviewed federal officials, officials from 13 state and 5 local health departments chosen based on location and number of cases, and other individuals knowledgeable about HIV/AIDS. ...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) [...] intended to provide aid to developing countries that have demonstrated a commitment to ruling justly, encouraging economic freedom, and investing in people [...] has received appropriations for fiscal years (FY) 2004 - 06 totaling more than $ 4. 2 billion. About $ 3. 8 billion of this amount has been set aside for compact assistance. As of January 2006, MCC had signed or approved eight compacts obligating about $ 1. 5 billion, leaving an <b>unobligated</b> <b>balance</b> of about $ 2. 3 billion. To assist in this year's budget deliberations, this letter provides a range of estimates under two scenarios of how quickly MCC could obligate this balance and three possible levels of FY 2007 appropriations at the current pace of compact award. The President has requested an additional $ 3 billion for MCC for FY 2007. To address this objective, we analyzed MCC's FY 2005 and 2006 budget presentations and other corporation records. We selected two illustrative scenarios for future MCC obligations: (1) a "higher cost" scenario in which the average size of future compacts is consistent with MCC projections and (2) a "lower cost" scenario in which future compacts {{are consistent with the}} average compact size to date. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Funds are made available under the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act of 1990 (CARE Act) for individuals affected by HIV/AIDS. Part A provides for grants to metropolitan areas and Part B provides for grants to states and territories and associated jurisdictions for HIV/AIDS services and for AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP). The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Modernization Act of 2006 (RWTMA) reauthorized CARE Act programs for fiscal years 2007 through 2009. RWTMA requires name-based HIV case counts for determining CARE Act funding, but an exemption allows the use of code-based case counts through fiscal year 2009. RWTMA formulas include hold-harmless provisions that protect grantees' funding at specified levels. RWTMA also included provisions under which Part A and B grantees with unobligated balances over 2 percent {{at the end of}} the grant year incur a penalty in future funding. GAO was asked to examine CARE Act funding provisions. This report provides information on (1) how many Part B grantees collect and use name-based HIV case counts for CARE Act funding; (2) the distribution of Part A hold-harmless funding; and (3) reductions in Part B grantees' funding due to <b>unobligated</b> <b>balance</b> provisions. GAO reviewed agency documents and analyzed data on CARE Act funding. GAO interviewed 19 grantees chosen by geography, number of HIV/AIDS cases, and other criteria. GAO also interviewed federal government officials and other experts. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Annual revenues into the Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF) from forfeited assets increased from $ 500 million in 2003 to $ 1. 8 billion in 2011, {{in part due to}} an increase in prosecutions of fraud and financial crimes cases. Expenditures in support of forfeiture activities such as equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement agencies and payments to victims also increased over the same 9 -year period, growing from $ 458 million in 2003 to $ 1. 3 billion in 2011. The Department of Justice (DOJ) uses the difference between revenues and expenditures in any year to help cover anticipated expenses in the next fiscal year. Because the AFF uses fund revenues to pay for the expenses associated with forfeiture activities, DOJ carries over funds {{at the end of each}} fiscal year to ensure it has sufficient resources to cover expenses that may not be covered by the next years revenues. When determining the amounts to carry over, DOJ reviews historical data on past program expenditures, analyzes known future expenses such as salaries and contracts, and estimates the costs of any potential new expenditures. However, DOJ has not documented the process for determining the amount of funds needed to cover anticipated expenditures in the next fiscal year in its annual budget justifications. Providing more transparent information as part of the AFFs annual budget process would better inform Congress oversight of the AFF. Further, after DOJ obligates funds needed to cover program expenses, any remaining AFF funds identified at the end of a fiscal year may be declared an excess <b>unobligated</b> <b>balance.</b> DOJ has the authority to use these balances for any of the departments authorized purposes. Per Office of Management and Budget guidance, in recent years, DOJ used these excess unobligated balances to help cover rescissions. Rescissions cancel the availability of DOJs previously enacted budget authority, making the funds involved no longer available for obligation. For example, in fiscal year 2011, DOJ used excess unobligated balances to help cover a $ 495 million AFF program rescission. ...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Spending reductions under sequestration affected DODs civilian workforce and many programs and functions, and required DOD to accept some risk in maintaining the readiness of military forces. However, DOD was able to mitigate some near-term effects of sequestration on its mission. Reduced spending levels required DOD to take actions such as furloughing most civilian employees for 6 days, cancelling or curtailing training for units that were not preparing to deploy by early in 2014, postponing some planned equipment maintenance at its depots and repairs or renovations of facilities, reducing some weapon system quantities or deferring modifications, and delaying system development and testing. DOD took various actions to plan for and implement sequestration, such as issuing guidance and establishing processes to identify priorities and evaluate alternatives for spending reductions. Generally, DODs approach to sequestration was a short-term response focused on addressing the immediate funding reductions for fiscal year 2013. DOD was able to reduce spending levels {{for the remainder of}} fiscal year 2013 without making permanent changes, such as adjusting the size of its forces or canceling weapon systems programs. By setting priorities for funding and using available prior year <b>unobligated</b> <b>balances</b> to help meet required reductions, DOD was able to protect or minimize disruptions in certain key areas, such as maintaining support for ongoing operations and adhering to plans for major weapons systems acquisitions. In addition, because of the flexibility afforded from its reprogramming and transfer authorities, DOD was able to manage and, in some cases, later reverse some initial actions taken to implement the spending reductions, such as resuming aircraft training. DOD officials reported that some effects of the spending reductions were felt in fiscal year 2013 but that the full impact of sequestration would likely not be fully realized until fiscal year 2014 and beyond, and may vary by service. For example, DOD made adjustments to some of its procurement programs, such as deferring modifications or delaying system development and testing. DOD officials stated that some of these decisions may result in increased costs over the next few years. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Officials at four selected agencies—the General Services Administration (GSA), U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Department of the Interior (Interior) —experienced challenges receiving full upfront funding for federal real property projects through the annual appropriations process. For example, due to budget constraints, GSA acquired one property between 2008 and 2012. In addition, GSA {{has been unable to}} access funding to complete renovations in Interior's headquarters building due to obligation limitations in the GSA-administered Federal Buildings Fund (FBF). The FBF, which is the primary funding source for operating and capital costs associated with federal space, held an <b>unobligated</b> carryover <b>balance</b> of $ 4. 7 billion at the end of fiscal year 2013 as a result of congressional limits on obligations. Officials noted that authority to retain proceeds provides a key incentive to initiate disposals, as agencies without this authority must request upfront funding for disposal costs while resulting proceeds are paid to the Department of the Treasury. Nonetheless, officials at selected agencies with the authority to retain disposal proceeds cited barriers to disposals, such as poor market demand, historical status or necessary remediation. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{separate}} {{bills are}} advancing in the 111 th Congress {{that could provide}} nearly $ 4 billion of supplemental funds for agricultural programs in FY 2010. The agricultural provisions in these bills have a relatively small funding impact compared with the nonagricultural provisions in the bills. H. R. 4213 (commonly known as the “tax extenders” bill) would provide up to $ 3. 6 billion for agriculture-related programs. The House and Senate are trading amendments to reconcile differences between each chamber’s version of the bill. The most recent House-passed version from May 28, 2010, includes $ 1. 48 billion for agricultural disaster assistance, $ 1. 15 billion for a settlement of the Pigford lawsuit against the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and $ 1. 06 billion to extend tax provisions for biodiesel and conservation. The Senate-passed version from March 10, 2010, does not contain funding for the Pigford settlement, but does include the other provisions. Difficulty reaching agreement over the budget impact of the bill, {{and the need for}} offsets rather than emergency spending, may be jeopardizing the prospects that some of the agriculture provisions will remain in the bill. H. R. 4899 (a supplemental appropriations bill for war spending and disaster response) would provide relatively smaller appropriations for other agricultural programs, as well as rescind prior appropriations from various agricultural accounts. The House and Senate are trading amendments to reconcile difference between each chamber’s version of the bill. The most recent House-passed version from July 1, 2010, contains $ 1. 4 billion for agriculture before rescissions, including $ 1. 15 billion for the Pigford settlement (duplicated from H. R. 4213 because of procedural uncertainty), $ 150 million for international food aid (P. L. 480 Food for Peace), $ 50 million for food purchases in a domestic nutrition assistance program (The Emergency Food Assistance Program, TEFAP), $ 32 million for the farm loan program (to support an additional $ 950 million of loans), $ 18 million for emergency forest restoration, and additional authorities to raise fees for the Section 502 rural housing loan guarantee program. The Senate-passed version from May 27, 2010, contains $ 200 million for agriculture before rescissions, including identical provisions for the loan programs and forestry, but does not have the Pigford or TEFAP funding. Rescissions from agriculture programs are significant in the most recent House-passed version of H. R. 4899, totaling $ 1. 0 billion, and are much larger than in the Senate-passed bill. The House bill from July 1 would rescind $ 487 million from reserve funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), $ 422 million from rural development (including $ 300 million of rural broadband funding), and $ 70 million from <b>unobligated</b> <b>balances</b> from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Both the House and Senate bills would offset $ 50 million by limiting mandatory outlays for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP). Both H. R. 4213 and H. R. 4899 await further floor action to resolve differences between the chambers...|$|R
