40|$|The term {{biomimicry}} {{first appeared}} in 1962 as a generic term including both cybernetics and bionics 1. It referred {{to all sorts of}} imitation of one form of life by another one while the term "bionics " defined as "an attempt to understand sufficiently well the tricks that nature actually uses to solve her problems" 2 is closer to the meaning of "biomimicry " as it has been used by material scientists since the 1980 s.

5000|$|Artspace was {{conceived}} {{as early as}} 1984, {{by a group of}} New Haven-based visual and performing artists in response to the elimination of a promised gallery space dedicated to local artists in the Shubert, a prominent local theater. Convinced that local visual art and performance needed an alternative showcase, they created Artspace with a mission to nurture and preserve the arts, focusing especially on artists and audiences in the greater New Haven area. The name Artspace originally described the permanent space and black box reserved for local artists and performers that was promised but never delivered by the Shubert. In its next incarnation without a permanent home, the name became an <b>umbrella</b> for a <b>variety</b> of projects. Its artistic leaders (led from 1997-2000 by Marianne Bernstein who incorporated the idea of “alternative spaces” and envisioned the term “citywide," [...] thinking of the entire city as an art space) loved the irony of using the name [...] "Artspace" [...] while operating without a space, appropriating found spaces as [...] "art spaces," [...] including factory buildings (former manufacturers of tires, rifles, corsets, cash registers, and Erector Sets), public libraries, public schools, public greenways, city buses, and old malls and storefronts.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} interplay between a {{dynamical}} process {{and the structure of}} the network on which it unfolds using the parameterized Laplacian framework. This framework allows for defining and characterizing an ensemble of dynamical processes on a network beyond what the traditional Laplacian is capable of modeling. This, in turn, allows for studying the impact of the interaction between dynamics and network topology on the quality-measure of network clusters and centrality, in order to effectively identify important vertices and communities in the network. Specifically, for each dynamical process in this framework, we define a centrality measure that captures a vertex’s participation in the dynamical process on a given network and also define a function that measures the quality of every subset of vertices as a potential cluster (or community) with respect to this process. We show that the subset-quality function generalizes the traditional conductance measure for graph partitioning. We partially justify our choice of the quality function by showing that the classic Cheeger’s inequality, which relates the conductance of the best cluster in a network with a spectral quantity of its Laplacian matrix, can be extended to the parameterized Laplacian. The parameterized Laplacian framework brings under the same <b>umbrella</b> a surprising <b>variety</b> of dynamical processes and allows us to systematically compare the different perspectives they create on network structure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the possible intertexts in Paul's {{letter to the}} Romans as a heuristic for creating model readers. It is argued that Paul's use of the Scriptures of Israel {{in the beginning of}} Romans functions thematically in an effort for Paul to set forth a normative means of how his letter ought to be interpreted. This thesis aims to offer a brief interpretation of the exodus event, how it came to be a motif, and its variegated (re) use and transformation in Second Temple literature. By using the exodus motif(s) as a pretext this thesis {{examines the}} beginning of Paul's letter to the Romans highlighting how the exodus theme is used in an effort to maintain continuity with the Jewish past and to offer a rational for Paul's own vocation - the inclusion of the nations into the people of God. Paul was thus not about the business of settling disputes between Judean and non-Judean Christians, but rather about securing the obedience of faith among the nations. One of the main means of securing the nation's obedience in Rome was by the proclamation of his good news over against the competing claims of Caesar and the Roman imperial order, here again we find the exodus motif to be a very helpful tool in exploring this phenomenon. This thesis operates using aspects of literary theory, especially that of Intertextuality. Intertextuality is used as an <b>umbrella</b> for a <b>variety</b> of different and distinctive possible ways which texts can be read, and consequently understood. No specific theory of intertextuality is chosen to examine these texts, rather a broad intertextual reading is used as a means of showing the possibilities contained within a text...|$|R
40|$|Children {{diagnosed}} with ADHD present with the core symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, {{which lead to}} challenges with school based activities, including peer interactions, academics, and extracurricular activities (McClelland, Morrison, 2 ̆ 6 Holmes, 2000; Hoza, 2007). Current research identifies social skills interventions as a potential strategy for occupational therapists (OTs) to address these participation challenges of children with ADHD, however there is a multitude of interventions that fall under this <b>umbrella.</b> The <b>variety</b> of social skills interventions allows for flexibility and diversity in implementation, but poses the challenge of choosing the most effective intervention. This choice should be informed by evidence-based practice, ensuring {{the viability of the}} profession and moving it towards the Centennial Vision (Clark, 2010). To understand the effectiveness of the available social skills interventions for children with ADHD, a systematic review was conducted. The purpose of this session is to present the results of an evidence-based review on the effectiveness of social skills interventions to improve school participation for children with ADHD and discuss implications for clinical practice. The authors searched 6 data bases, resulting in analysis of 12 articles to investigate effectiveness of social skills interventions for children with ADHD. The systematic review process is presented, including the clinical question, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and search terms. The authors outline emerging themes within the research. The authors found moderate support for effectiveness of interventions implemented in physical settings where children are naturally engaging in activities. There is also promising research supporting the use of a combined cognitive behavioral and play-based approach. Evidence did not support the use of a solely cognitive behavioral approach These results suggest that social skills interventions have potential as an effective technique to improve school participation in children with ADHD. Social skills interventions are often used in conjunction with other therapies, and provide a supplement to academics-focused therapy. To advance understanding of social skills interventions, continued {{research is needed to determine}} the effectiveness of social skills interventions, discern the most appropriate form of social skills intervention for each student, and solidify OT’s role in social participation intervention.

40|$|This study {{examines}} Al-Ḥirāk Al-Shabābī Al-ʾUrdunī (the Jordanian Youth Movement), {{from now on}} the HSU, and aims to be a first scholarly attempt at mapping the organisation, strategy, challenges, and significance of this youth-led and youth-organised social movement. Taking an interpretive approach to organisational research, this thesis has used {{a wide range of}} primary and secondary data, benefited from extensive periods of participant observation as well as interviews with a variety of people including movement participants, in order to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} HSU. The main findings that result from this research show that the HSU is ideologically an <b>umbrella</b> to a <b>variety</b> of ideologies, from leftist or communists to Islamists, and that it chooses to organise informally and uninstitutionally in accordance with their political conviction of political parties and traditional opposition groups being a tool of social control for the regime. Politically, therefore, the movement represents a rupture with traditional politics in the country which are perceived by participants as part of a historically constructed system for exercising social control. Finally, the movement challenges traditional frames of ethnic and religious understandings of social and political subjectivities by mobilising a more inclusive discourse that tries to recover the debate on class struggle. Its political independence from other actors in the Jordanian political scene allows participant to raise more radical claims that seek regime removal as well as demands for reform, and these radical discourse within the movement greatly depend on the varying political opportunity structure in time determined by the Jordanian regime’s combination of conciliatory and repressive counter-strategies. An analysis of the strategic conversation between the regime and the HSU is key to exploring the social and political significance of movement strategies in bringing about change in the country as it determines the challenges to organisation encountered. However, relevant transformations in the culture of activism in Jordan are evident, and have the potential to transforming the future of political participation and organisation...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to review the almost 50 years of formal {{regional}} and local history research practices in South Africa under the <b>umbrella</b> of a <b>variety</b> of rural and urban trends, themes and phenomena. This revisit of research practice is not approached from the traditional angle of critically debating the visibility of the research in historiography through publications (it is, after all, an extraordinarily broad field of study to cover, which may not correctly serve each author in the broader and/or local history). Rather the focus is on analysing where and when regional or local history in South Africa got its momentum and how historians have broadly assessed their progress and future in presenting and carrying out regional and local history research. International influences on historians and other academics in the humanities and social sciences which surface are also discussed. The reader is also exposed to a concise exposition of modern-day efforts in the field of integrative research that have been necessary in regional and/or local history research for decades. Local research methodologies used in the past have been combined with integrative methodology models to create an integrative multidisciplinary research methodology required for carrying out regional and local research in modern-day practice. Because no single definition of the concepts of local and regional history exists, its meaning in literature is first thrashed out to strengthen understanding of the term and the approach to it in this discussion. This debate, among others, was inspired by, and is part of, the commemoration of the journal New Contree’s 35 years of existence. The journal’s involvement in the dissemination of regional and urban history, especially during the early part of its existence, is discussed. It is hoped that this article’s review of the past will inspire South African historians to revisit regional, local, urban and/or rural spaces and places in South Africa. This could be done perhaps with the view to strengthening the methodologies used in regional history studies and to ambitiously embrace possibilities for engaging in a variety of integrative research from bottom-up and top-down perspectives. This may be the only way to progress towards inclusive regional histories as contributions to the understanding of regions...|$|R
