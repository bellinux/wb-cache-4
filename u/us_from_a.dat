25|$|However, Haufniensis {{mentions}} that anxiety {{is a way}} for humanity to be saved as well. Anxiety informs us of our choices, our self-awareness and personal responsibility, and brings <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> state of un-self-conscious immediacy to self-conscious reflection. (Jean-Paul Sartre calls these terms pre-reflexive consciousness and reflexive consciousness.) An individual becomes truly aware of their potential through the experience of dread. So, anxiety may be a possibility for sin, but anxiety can also be a recognition or realization of one's true identity and freedoms.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, Pfizer filed {{a patent}} {{covering}} the substance sildenafil {{and its use}} to treat cardiovascular diseases. This would be marketed as Revatio. The patent was published in 1993 and expired in 2012. The patent on Revatio (indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension rather than erectile dysfunction) expired in late 2012. Generic versions of this low-dose form of sildenafil have been available in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> number of manufacturers, including Greenstone, Mylan, and Watson, since early 2013. Health care providers may prescribe generic sildenafil for erectile dysfunction.

25|$|In 2013, in {{a lawsuit}} against our church, a woman accused my husband and three others of molesting her twenty-five years earlier. She didn’t {{remember}} the alleged “abuses” before her thirties, and then believed she was recovering lost memories. She also imagined that 18 people witnessed the abuse, and she listed them by name. However, none of those named supported her stories of abuse. Montgomery County police investigated and filed no charges. After eighteen months, an independent investigator concluded her accusations likely never happened. But that didn’t spare <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> witch hunt. In the initial months, the accused were labeled child sex offenders {{and the story of}} the abuse, truth be damned, was aggressively promoted in news, radio and social media.|$|E
25|$|On August 14, 2008, the U.S. and Poland {{agreed to}} have 10 {{two-stage}} missile interceptors – made by Orbital Sciences Corporation – placed in Poland, {{as part of a}} missile shield to defend Europe and the <b>U.S.</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> possible missile attack by Iran. In return, the U.S. agreed to move a battery of MIM-104 Patriot missiles to Poland. The missile battery was to be staffed – at least temporarily – by U.S. Military personnel. The U.S. also pledged to defend Poland, a NATO member, quicker than NATO would {{in the event of an}} attack. Additionally, the Czech Republic recently agreed to allow the placement of a radar-tracking station in their country, despite public opinion polls showing that the majority of Czechs were against the plans and only 18% supported it. The radar-tracking station in the Czech Republic would also be part of the missile defense shield. After the agreement was announced, Russian officials said defences on Russia's borders would be increased and that they foresaw harm in bilateral relations with the United States.|$|E

This two-part vocal fades as a solo harmonica plays a melody {{on top of the}} persistent quarter-note bass line and maraca that maintain the only rhythm throughout Episode 2. The section ends with a five-part harmony vocalizing a whole-note chord that is sustained by reverb for a further four beats. Lambert calls it the song's [...] "wake-up chord {{at the end of the}} meditation that transports the concept into a whole new realm: it's an iconic moment among iconic moments.

[...] A drawn-out adoption process began, slowed down by uncertainty over the exact fate of the girl's father, but in 1993 the adoption was ruled final. [...] McCain then stood by his wife when she disclosed in 1994 a previous addiction to painkillers {{and said that she}} hoped the publicity would give other drug addicts courage in their struggles. [...] Beginning in the early 1990s, McCain began attending the 6,000-member North Phoenix Baptist Church in Arizona, part of the Southern Baptist Convention, later saying [...] " [...] the message and fundamental nature more fulfilling than I did in the Episcopal church. [...] They're great believers in redemption, and so am I." [...] Nevertheless, he still identified himself as Episcopalian, and while Cindy and two of their children were baptized into the Baptist church, he was not.|$|E
500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from <b>us</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's very hopeful and sad at the same time." ...|$|E
