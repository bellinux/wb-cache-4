40|$|Contamination {{assessment}} for space optical systems {{requires an understanding}} of the sensitivity of component performance, e. g. mirror reflectance, to materials deposited on the mirror surface. In a previous study, the sensitivity of typical normal incidence mirror coatings to surface deposits of generic hydrocarbons was reported. Recent activity in the development of grazing incidence telescopes for extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> space <b>astronomy</b> has stimulated the need for a similar assessment in the spectral region extending from approximately 100 A to 1000 A. The model used for analysis treats the contamination layer as a continuous thin film deposited on the mirror surface. The mirror surfaces selected for this study are opaque vacuum deposited gold and the uncoated and polished Zerodur. Scatter caused by film irregularities or particulates are not included in this assessment. Parametric evaluations at 100, 500, and 1000 A determine the sensitivity of mirror reflectance to a range of optical constants selected for the generic contaminants. This sensitivity analysis combined with the limited amount of optical data in the EUV for hydrocarbons, is used to select representative optical constants for the three wavelength regions. Reflectance versus contamination layer thickness curves are then calculated and used to determine critical thickness limits based on allowable reflectance change. Initial observations indicate that thickness limits will be highly dependent on the real part of the complex index of refraction of the contaminant film being less than 1. 0. Preliminary laboratory measurements of samples contaminated with some commonly encountered hydrocarbons confirm trends indicated in the analytical studies...|$|R
40|$|Since their {{declassification}} in {{the late}} 1960 s microchannel plates (MCPs) {{have been used as}} detectors for X-ray and extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> (EUV) <b>astronomy,</b> offering a unique sensitivity in the EUV waveband. The post 1990 era, however, has seen a universal, and unexplained, reduction in EUV quantum efficiency (QE). An analysis of microchannel plate glass composition has recorded variations in along channel composition for the first time. These observations may provide insight into the lost QE problem and present a way forward for the development of future EUV missions. Although originally developed as photon detectors MCPs have more recently been applied as low mass X-ray optics for X-ray astronomy and planetary science, where fluorescent X-rays from planetary surfaces yield information on surface composition. The Mercury Imaging X-ray Spectrometer (MIXS), on the BepiColombo mission to Mercury, will have two instrument channels, both of which use MCP optical elements. The optimisation of the high spatial resolution imaging X-ray optics of MIXS-T is described and the novel MCP collimator geometry for the high throughput MIXS-C channel is introduced for the first time. The performance of both channels at Mercury is predicted. An in situ investigation into the effects of the International Space Station space environment on MCP optics has led to the serendipitous discovery of nanometre scale dust particles in near Earth space and the realisation of filmed MCPs as extremely sensitive cosmic dust detectors. Analysis of the exposed samples and evaluation of the discovery are presented and possibilities for future dedicated experiments are explored. Microchannel plates continue to be an important technology in astronomy and planetary science. This thesis describes developments in traditional MCP applications and the introduction of new ones, all of which will lead to unique measurement capabilities and significant scientific advancements.

40|$|We {{compare the}} {{equilibrium}} climate responses of a quasi-dynamical energy balance model to radiative forcing by equivalent changes in CO 2, solar total irradiance (S tot) and solar UV (S UV). The response is {{largest in the}} S UV case, in which the imposed UV radiative forcing is preferentially absorbed in the layer above 250 mb, {{in contrast to the}} weak response from global-columnar radiative loading by increases in CO 2 or S tot. The hypersensitive response of the climate system to solar UV forcing is caused by strongly coupled feedback involving vertical static stability, tropical thick cirrus ice clouds and stratospheric ozone. This mechanism offers a plausible explanation of the apparent hypersensitivity of climate to solar forcing, as suggested by analyses of recent climatic records. The model hypersensitivity strongly depends on climate parameters, especially cloud radiative properties, but is effective for arguably realistic values of these parameters. The proposed solar forcing mechanism should be further confirmed using other models (e. g., general circulation models) that may better capture radiative and dynamical couplings of the troposphere and stratosphere.

40|$|The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) /EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) {{provides}} rich {{information on}} the thermodynamic processes of solar activities, particularly on solar flares. Here, we develop a method to construct thermodynamic spectrum (TDS) charts based on the EVE spectral lines. This tool could potentially be useful for extreme <b>ultraviolet</b> (EUV) <b>astronomy</b> {{to learn about the}} eruptive activities on distant astronomical objects. Through several cases, we illustrate what we can learn from the TDS charts. Furthermore, we apply the TDS method to 74 flares equal to or greater than the M 5. 0 class, and reach the following statistical results. First, EUV peaks are always behind the soft X-ray (SXR) peaks and stronger flares tend to have faster cooling rates. There is a power-law correlation between the peak delay times and the cooling rates, suggesting a coherent cooling process of flares from SXR to EUV emissions. Second, there are two distinct temperature drift patterns, called Type I and Type II. For Type I flares, the enhanced emission drifts from high to low temperature like a quadrilateral, whereas for Type II flares the drift pattern looks like a triangle. Statistical analysis suggests that Type II flares are more impulsive than Type I flares. Third, for late-phase flares, the peak intensity ratio of the late phase to the main phase is roughly correlated with the flare class, and the flares with a strong late phase are all confined. We believe that the re-deposition of the energy carried by a flux rope, which unsuccessfully erupts out, into thermal emissions is responsible for the strong late phase found in a confined flare. Furthermore, we show the signatures of the flare thermodynamic process in the chromosphere and transition region in the TDS charts. These results provide new clues to advance our understanding of the thermodynamic processes of solar flares and associated solar eruptions, e. g., coronal mass ejections...|$|R
40|$|Neutral {{interstellar}} helium atoms penetrate {{into the}} solar system almost unaffected by gas–plasma interactions in the heliospheric interface region, and thus {{can be considered as}} carriers of original information on the basic parameters (like density, temperature, bulk velocity) of the Very Local Interstellar Medium (VLISM). Such information can nowadays be derived from analysis of data obtained from different experimental methods: in situ measurements of He atoms (Ulysses), observations of the solar backscattered He 584 A radiation (EUVE), in situ measurements of He + pickup ions (AMPTE, Ulysses, Wind, SOHO, ACE). In view of the current coordinated international ISSI campaign devoted {{to the study of the}} helium focusing cone structure and its evolution, we analyze expected variations of neutral He density, of He + pickup fluxes and of their phase space distributions at various phases of the solar activity cycle based on a realistic time-dependent modelling of the neutral helium and He + pickup ion distributions, which reflect solar cycle-induced variations of the photoionization rate. We show that the neutral helium density values are generally anticorrelated with the solar activity phase and in extreme cases (near the downwind axis) the maximum-to-minimum density ratio may even exceed factors of ~ 3 at 1 AU. We also demonstrate that in the upwind hemisphere (at 1 AU and beyond) the He + fluxes are correlated with the solar cycle activity, whereas on the downwind side the maximum of the expected flux up to distances of ~ 3 AU occurs around solar minimum epoch, and only further away does the correlation with solar activity become positive. Finally, we present the response of the phase space distribution spectra of He + pickup ions (in the solar wind frame) for different epochs of the solar cycle and heliocentric distances from 1 to 5 AU covering the range of Ulysses, Wind and ACE observations.
