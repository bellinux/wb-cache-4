5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major concern was human {{development}} in a technological era. He addressed employing spiritual guidance with a “program of human values” to achieve a good life. Nevertheless, his underlying goal was to achieve “full employment.” So, he kept himself grounded in economic principles, as <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> debated during that era.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain is}} not fully <b>understood,</b> <b>and</b> {{research}} is ongoing. Neuroscientists, along with researchers from allied disciplines, study how the human brain works.

5|$|The {{cause of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} is poorly <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> {{is thought to}} likely have several contributing factors. The plantar fascia is a thick fibrous band of connective tissue that originates from the medial tubercle and anterior aspect of the heel bone. From there, the fascia extends along the {{sole of the foot}} before inserting {{at the base of the}} toes, and supports the arch of the foot.|$|E
5|$|The role of RNA {{interference}} in mammalian innate immunity is poorly <b>understood,</b> <b>and</b> relatively little data is available. However, {{the existence of}} viruses that encode genes able to suppress the RNAi response in mammalian cells may be evidence in favour of an RNAi-dependent mammalian immune response, although this hypothesis has been challenged as poorly substantiated.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately all {{of these}} {{problems}} {{were considered to be}} well <b>understood,</b> <b>and</b> a much larger design emerged, NIF. NIF was designed to provide about twice the required driver energy, allowing some margin of error. NIF's design was finalized in 1994, with construction to be completed by 2002. Construction began in 1997 but took over a decade to complete, with major construction being declared complete in 2009.|$|E

5|$|By the 1890s {{electrical}} resonance {{was much}} more widely <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> had become {{a normal part of}} the engineer's toolkit. In 1891 Hutin and Leblanc patented an FDM scheme for telephone circuits using resonant circuit filters. Rival patents were filed in 1892 by Michael Pupin and John Stone Stone with similar ideas, priority eventually being awarded to Pupin. However, no scheme using just simple resonant circuit filters can successfully multiplex (i.e. combine) the wider bandwidth of telephone channels (as opposed to telegraph) without either an unacceptable restriction of speech bandwidth or a channel spacing so wide as to make the benefits of multiplexing uneconomic.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely <b>understood,</b> <b>and</b> rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
5|$|Gunpowder weapons {{had begun}} to be {{introduced}} into England in the early 14th century, initially being used as offensive siege weapons but rapidly being adapted for defensive purposes during the 1360s. Although they were expensive, by the 1380s their potential value in defending castles and city walls was well <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> specialised facilities {{had begun to}} be built. Norwich had acquired gunpowder weapons {{and a team of}} gunners by 1355, and by 1385 had fifty gunpowder pieces for use along its city walls. Typically, these would have been small guns called hand cannons, rather than the heavier pieces termed bombards.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 {{there were}} {{believed}} to be 4,035 species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle. Of these, 1,356 (33.6%) were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes 1,427 species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status. A number of causes are believed to be involved, including habitat destruction and modification, over-exploitation, pollution, introduced species, climate change, endocrine-disrupting pollutants, destruction of the ozone layer (ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin, eyes, and eggs of amphibians), and diseases like chytridiomycosis. However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly <b>understood,</b> <b>and</b> are a topic of ongoing discussion.|$|E
5|$|Initially J. D. B. {{denied any}} wrongdoing. After being {{confronted with the}} stolen camera and after the urging of a school administrator, J. D. B. confessed to the break-ins.

B. indicated that he <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> then proceeded to provide further details about the crime, including the location of the stolen property. J. D. B. wrote a statement at the investigator's request. He was allowed to leave to catch the bus home.|$|E

5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea {{was created}} as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes {{are the most}} recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, {{view is that the}} hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, if not all of the Cenozoic Era. However, while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well <b>understood</b> <b>and</b> extensively studied, the nature of hotspots themselves remains fairly enigmatic.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea {{has been}} created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian Ridge–Emperor seamount chain.
