5|$|Arguably {{the most}} sought-after lost episode is Episode 4 of the final William Hartnell serial, The Tenth Planet, which ends with the First Doctor's {{regeneration}} into the Second. The only portion of the episode still in existence, bar a few poor-quality silent 8mm clips, is the final 27 seconds, comprising the regeneration itself and a few seconds leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> The sequence had been shown in a 1973 episode of Blue Peter, and was retained in that show's archive.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, a French film, Flammes sur l'Adriatique (Adriatic Sea of Fire) was made, {{portraying the}} scuttling of Zagreb {{and the events}} leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> In 1973, the President of Yugoslavia and wartime Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito posthumously awarded the Order of the People's Hero to the two {{officers}} who scuttled Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to {{claims that it}} had broadcast a staged scene, Enderlin and France2 filed three defamation suits in 2004 and 2005, seeking symbolic damages of €1. The most notable lawsuit was against Philippe Karsenty, who ran a media watchdog, Media-Ratings. He published {{an analysis of the}} footage on his website in November 2004, based on work from the French-Israeli Metula News Agency, that alleged the shooting scene had been faked, as had several scenes leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> where protesters were shown being injured. France 2 and Enderlin issued a writ two days later.|$|E

5|$|From December 1559 Amy Dudley {{lived at}} Cumnor Place, near Abingdon in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). The house, an altered 14th century monastic complex, was rented {{by a friend}} of the Dudleys and {{possible}} relative of Amy's, Sir Anthony Forster. He lived there with his wife and Mrs. Odingsells and Mrs. Owen, relations of the house's owner. Lady Dudley's chamber was a large, sumptuous upper story apartment, the best of the house, with a separate entrance and staircase leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> At the house's rear there were a terrace garden, a pond, and a deer park. Amy Dudley received the proceeds of the Robsart estate directly into her hands and largely paid for her own household, which comprised about 10 servants. She regularly ordered dresses and finery as accounts and a letter from her of as late as 24August 1560 show. She also received presents from her husband.|$|E
5|$|James Polehinke, {{the first}} officer, {{suffered}} serious injuries, including multiple broken bones, a collapsed lung, and severe bleeding.

Doctors later determined that Polehinke had suffered brain damage and has no memory of the crash or the events leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> , Polehinke was a wheelchair user. During the same month, Polehinke {{filed a lawsuit against}} the airport and the company that designed the runway and taxi lights. A January 2014 episode of Piers Morgan Live reported that Polehinke was paraplegic.|$|E
5|$|Square {{released}} an enhanced port of Chrono Trigger developed by Tose in Japan for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. Square timed its release before that of Chrono Cross, the 1999 sequel to Chrono Trigger, to familiarize new players with story leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> This version included anime cut scenes created by original character designer Akira Toriyama's Bird Studio and animated by Toei Animation, {{as well as}} several bonus features, accessible after achieving various endings in the game. Scenarist Masato Kato attended planning meetings at Bird Studio to discuss how the ending cut scenes would illustrate subtle ties to Chrono Cross. The port was later released in North America in 2001—along with a newly translated version of Final Fantasy IV—under the package title Final Fantasy Chronicles. Reviewers criticized Chronicles for its lengthy load times and an absence of new in-game features. This same iteration was also re-released as a downloadable game on the Playstation Network on October 4, 2011, for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, and PlayStation Portable.|$|E

5|$|The helmet {{was found}} {{along with some}} 5,296 Iron Age and Roman coins mostly dating to AD 20/30–50, the largest {{assemblage}} of Iron Age coins ever found in Britain. They had been buried at what {{appears to have been}} a pre-Roman shrine where large-scale animal slaughtering had taken place; nearly 7,000 bone fragments were also found at the site, 97 per cent of which were from pigs. Many appear to have been buried without the meat being eaten, suggesting that they had been used as offerings. The site is located on a hilltop which appears to have been encircled by a boundary ditch and palisade, with a possible processional way leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> In Roman times it would have been located in the territory of the Corieltauvi, who inhabited an area of the East Midlands stretching from Northamptonshire to Lincolnshire.|$|E
5|$|According to St Petersburg {{psychiatrist}} Vladimir Pshizov, {{a disastrous}} factor for domestic psychiatry {{is that those}} who had committed the crime against humanity were allowed to stay on their positions until they can leave this world in a natural way. Those who retained their positions and influence turned domestic psychiatry from politically motivated one to criminally motivated one because the sphere of interests of this public {{has been reduced to}} making a business of psychopharmacologic drugs and taking possession of the homes of the ill. In Soviet times, all the heads of departments of psychiatry, all the directors of psychiatric research institutes, all the head doctors of psychiatric hospitals were the CPSU nomenklatura, which they remained so far. The representative of nomenklatura in psychiatry had the scheme of career that is simple and often stereotyped: for one to two years, he run errands as a resident, then joined the party and became a partgrouporg. His junior colleagues (usually non-partisan ones) collected and processed material for his dissertation. Its review of literature, particularly in a research institute for psychiatry, was often written by patients, because only they knew foreign languages, and their party comrades were not <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it,</b> the natural habitat did not stimulate learning a foreign language.|$|E
5|$|According to the Hebrew Bible, Solomon's Temple {{was built}} atop {{what is known}} as the Temple Mount in the 10th century BCE and {{destroyed}} by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, and the Second Temple completed and dedicated in 516 BCE. Around 19 BCE Herod the Great began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall. The excavators came upon the coins inside a ritual bath that predates Herod's building project, which was filled in to create an even base for the wall and was located under its southern section. This seems to indicate that Herod did not finish building the entire wall by the time of his death in 4 BCE. The find confirms the description by historian Josephus Flavius, which states that construction was finished only during the reign of King Agrippa II, Herod’s great-grandson. Given Josephus' information, the surprise mainly regarded the fact that an unfinished retaining wall in this area could also mean that at least parts of the splendid Royal Stoa and the monumental staircase leading <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> could not have been completed during Herod's lifetime. Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock. Some scholars are doubtful of the interpretation and have offered alternative explanations, such as, for example, later repair work.|$|E

5000|$|The 2008 fall in {{the value}} of {{sterling}} against the euro saw the price gap between North and South widen and shoppers cross to Northern Ireland to the detriment of businesses in the South. Coughlan asked multiple retailers to reduce their margins south of the border and provide better value to consumers in the South. Research from Forfás, concluded that only a five per cent difference in the cost of goods between North and South was justifiable. The findings highlighted retailers' larger margins in the South in relation to their operations in the North and Coughlan queried why the price differential in many identical goods was substantially in excess of 5%. Coughlan said: [...] "I don't own a shop. The Government doesn't own a shop. <b>It's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Tesco, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Superquinn, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Aldi, <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Lidl; <b>it's</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> them to cut their prices. They need to ensure that that happens; they {{have to do something about}} it." [...] When retailers continued to remain silent on the price differential, Coughlan sent in the Competition Authority to investigate supply chains in the retail sector.|$|R

5|$|After {{restoring}} the Beanstar, Mario and Luigi travel to Joke's End {{to make the}} exchange, once again traveling through a maze filled with puzzles to be solved. Bowletta refuses to hand over Peach, but Luigi, disguised in Peach's spare dress, ends up being taken in Peach's stead. He escapes from the repaired Koopa Cruiser, reclaiming the Beanstar in the process. The brothers return to Beanbean Castle Town, finding it under attack by Bowletta using Bowser's flying castle. The brothers and Prince Peasley fly <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> to stop Cackletta. Mario and Luigi battle past the Koopalings, but before they can reach Bowletta the brothers encounter Fawful yet again. A fierce battle between the three ensues with the brothers coming out on top. But Fawful plays a dirty trick and attacks the brothers while they weren't paying attention. However, Prince Peasly comes in and send Fawful flying, seemingly defeating him. The Bros. finally confront Bowletta and another epic battle begins. Feigning defeat, she tricks the brothers and swallows them. After waking up in her belly, the brothers battle and defeat Cackletta's soul, exorcising her from Bowser's body. The two are regurgitated and Bowser returns to normal. Afterwards, the brothers escape the castle before it explodes from a bomb set by Peasley. The explosion sends the castle falling into the ocean. Exhausted from their vacation, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toadsworth decide {{to head back to}} the Mushroom Kingdom. Before they can leave, Peasley brings a farewell gift for them to take home, which is Bowser, who regained his memory. The gang then returns home, and a movie based on their adventure is being shown at the Yoshi Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>it</b> with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble by swinging the neck down over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E
