5|$|Various {{plants are}} said to have apotropaic qualities, notably Mountain Ash. Henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) may have been used as a {{hallucinogen}} as long ago as the Neolithic period. This tradition has recently been taken <b>up</b> <b>once</b> again by New Agers.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} there was {{confusion}} between B.verticillata and B.littoralis (swamp banksia). Until 1984, {{the latter was}} circumscribed as encompassing what is now Banksia seminuda (river banksia), which has whorled leaves like B.verticillata. Thus {{it was easy to}} perceive B.verticillata as falling within the range of variation of this broadly defined species. The confusion was largely cleared <b>up</b> <b>once</b> B.seminuda was recognised as a distinct taxon.|$|E
5|$|On 2 September, the ZNG {{deployed}} A Company, 1st Battalion, 105th Infantry Brigade to Pakrac {{in order}} to reinforce police defences in the area.

5|$|The D magic system, {{in which}} wizards {{memorize}} spells {{that are used}} <b>up</b> <b>once</b> cast and must be re-memorized the next day, was heavily influenced by the Dying Earth stories and novels of Jack Vance. The original alignment system (which grouped all characters and creatures into 'Law', 'Neutrality' and 'Chaos') {{was derived from the}} novel Three Hearts and Three Lions by Poul Anderson. A troll described in this work influenced the D definition of that monster.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of a supercontinent insulates the mantle. The flow of heat will be concentrated, resulting in volcanism and the flooding of large areas with basalt.

5|$|After a {{match at}} Cincinnati Gardens, an enraged fan took a fire {{extinguisher}} {{off the wall}} and threw it at Costello and Kent from the balcony of the Gardens. The extinguisher hit Costello in the hip, damaging it so much that he needed hip replacement surgery later that year. The fan was arrested, served 15days in jail, and fined fifty dollars for damaging the fire extinguisher. The hip injury left Costello unable to wrestle, and The Fabulous Kangaroos split <b>up</b> <b>once</b> again. Costello had a full hip replacement and was forced to retire from active competition.|$|E
5|$|An {{announcement}} was made that Brosnan and director Martin Campbell will team <b>up</b> <b>once</b> again for a film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel, Across the River and into the Trees, in which Brosnan will {{play the role of}} the protagonist, Colonel Cantwell. However, according to Campbell, the film's production and development fell apart due to financial issues hence its delay, but as of October 2017, it is back in the pipeline for which he's hopeful to begin working on, soon. Brosnan later joined Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy in a film based on the events of The Maze Prison Escape, titled H-Block which is to be directed by Jim Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|Bostwick {{was called}} up {{to play for the}} England C team, who {{represent}} England at non-league level, in a match against Italy C in Benevento in November 2008. He came on as a 56th-minute substitute in a match that ended 2–2. He was called up again to represent England C in a match against Belgium U23 at the Kassam Stadium in May 2009. However, he was forced to withdraw due to injury, and was subsequently replaced by fellow Stevenage midfielder Joel Byrom. Bostwick was called <b>up</b> <b>once</b> more to play against Poland U23 in Grodzisk Wielkopolski, but again had to withdraw due to injury.|$|E

5|$|Following LeRoy's {{death in}} 1932, his film {{collection}} {{was bought by}} the Museum of Modern Art in 1936. The museum's acquisition and subsequent screenings of A Trip to the Moon, {{under the direction of}} MoMA's film curator Iris Barry, opened the film <b>up</b> <b>once</b> again to a wide audience of Americans and Canadians and established it definitively as a landmark in the history of cinema. LeRoy's incomplete print became the most commonly seen version of the film and the source print for most other copies, including the Cinémathèque française's print. A complete version of the film, including the entire celebration sequence, was finally reconstructed in 1997 from various sources by the Cinémathèque Méliès, a foundation set up by the Méliès family.|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Jackson, Michigan Avenue continues into downtown while M-50 is routed {{around the}} city center along paired one-way streets.

On the south side of Jackson, M-50 and US127 meet <b>up</b> <b>once</b> again just east of Vandercook Lake. M-50 follows the US127 freeway through a pair of conjoined partial interchanges before M-50 heads east away from Vandercook Lake.|$|E

5|$|Picard finds Bok {{waiting for}} him, who has another orb. Bok {{explains}} {{that it was}} his son in command of the Ferengi vessel at Maxia, and he came here seeking his revenge. He places the orb down and leaves Picard on the Stargazer bridge. The orb lights <b>up</b> <b>once</b> more, leaving Picard believing he is once again at the Battle of Maxia. On the Enterprise, Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the orb brought over from the Stargazer in Picard's chest. They take it to Riker as the Stargazer powers up its weapon systems. Riker hails the Ferengi vessel and speaks to Kazago, who is suspicious {{at the sight of the}} orb, which is a banned device. He promises to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Steph later begins feuding with Summer Shaw (Summer Strallen), who {{was after}} a career in show business, {{everything}} she previously wanted. When Max split up with Steph, she was heartbroken. After a talk they decided they would both give it another go, and Steph asked him to meet her for lunch. Niall made sure Max thought that he and Steph had an affair. This resulted in Max and Steph splitting <b>up</b> <b>once</b> more. They reconciled, but the doubts continued. When Steph was at The Loft with Niall and Nancy, she saw Max with another girl and {{decided to make a}} move of her own — grabbing Niall and kissing him passionately.|$|E
5|$|Tensions flared <b>up</b> <b>once</b> again {{five years}} later when Sarcófago, instead of Ratos de Porão, were picked {{up to be the}} opening band of DRI's first Brazilian shows. Ratos de Porão and friends from São Paulo thrash metal group Korzus invaded Sarcófago's {{backstage}} area; João Gordo then proceeded to sucker-punch Lamounier while he was lying drunk on the floor, and Gordo's friends attacked the rest with motorcycle chains. A massive brawl ensued, with a member of DRI's road crew getting his arm broken.|$|E

5|$|The {{championship}} {{has been}} declared vacant {{on a number of}} occasions, either because of an injury to one of the champions or because a wrestler stopped working for CMLL for a period of time. The championship has been held <b>up</b> <b>once,</b> based on the inconclusive outcome of a match, being vacant for a week until the two teams had a rematch. CMLL has also held a couple of tournaments designed to give the winners of the tournament a match against the champions, declaring them the official number one contender for the champions.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} {{significant}} human impact {{is a small}} prefabricated hut which is used by researchers while staying on the island. The hut includes a few bunk beds and a solar power source to drive an emergency radio and other key electronics. All visitors check themselves and belongings to ensure no seeds are accidentally introduced by humans to this ecosystem. It is believed that some young boys tried to introduce potatoes, which were promptly dug <b>up</b> <b>once</b> discovered. An improperly handled human defecation resulted in a tomato plant taking root which was also destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} first {{proposed}} in the 1980s, although no progress was made until August 2001, when the transportation officials said the official station could be constructed within several years. After several years of proposals, along {{with the passing of}} a high opposer in 2003, the station came <b>up</b> <b>once</b> again in 2008. That year, the proposed Metropark South was brought back to the Old Bridge council by developer Michael Alfieri. His proposal also brought up the plans for new residential homes, commercial businesses along with the new station. The proposal was conditionally accepted in November of that year. As of 2009, there is no forward on the actual station being constructed.|$|E
