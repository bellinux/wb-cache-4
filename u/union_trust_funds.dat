5000|$|Both Social Security and Medicare {{are funded}} by payroll tax {{revenues}} dedicated to those programs. Program tax revenues historically have exceeded payouts, resulting in program surpluses {{and the building}} of <b>trust</b> <b>fund</b> balances. The <b>trust</b> <b>funds</b> earn interest.
