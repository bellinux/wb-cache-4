50|$|In {{response}} to the mass market development in guitar manufacturing made possible by advances in wood working technologies such as CNC, laser cutting and <b>UV</b> <b>lacquer</b> curing, the company designed and introduced a mass market version, named the Avalon Silver series and built in Korea.|$|E
40|$|A UV-hardening lacquer {{material}} {{based on}} polyurethane, used in Philips compact disc lens systems, was tested as suitable material for low-cost intraocular lenses (IOLs). A slightly changed composition (code number I- 0. 5 A) {{came out as}} the best and was subsequenly tested, with reference to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), as a 'lobster-claw' lens in Hollander rabbit eyes {{for a period of}} 24 wk. No carcinogenic effects were found, while only minor vascularization of the cornea at the incision area occurred. The in vitro biocompatability tests of the material were positive. Scanning electron microscopy images of the IOLs at 2, 6, 12 and 24 wk postoperative showed portions of an acellular membrane, multinuclear giant cells which hyalinize and stay as pigmented plaques, microphages and fibroblasts with fibrillar strands, long pseudopodia, and broad microplicea. The chosen <b>UV</b> <b>lacquer</b> showed a foreign body reaction and properties comparable with PMMA, and is suitable for manufacturing low-cost IOLs...|$|E
5000|$|... 1-Vinylimidazole is {{used because}} of its high {{reactivity}} for free-radical (UV) polymerization as reactive diluent in <b>UV</b> <b>lacquers,</b> inks and adhesives for coatings and lacquers. It is also used for the functionalization of polymer surfaces by UV-induced grafting to improve wettability and adhesiveness.|$|R
5000|$|... 1-Vinylimidazole is a {{water-soluble}} basic monomer {{that forms}} quaternizable homopolymers by free-radical polymerization {{with a variety}} of vinyl and acrylic monomers. The products are functional copolymers, which are used as oil field chemicals and as cosmetic auxiliaries. 1-Vinylimidazole acts as a reactive diluent in <b>UV</b> <b>lacquers,</b> inks, and adhesives.|$|R
50|$|Diluents (or thinners) {{are usually}} added to {{lacquers}} {{to reduce their}} viscosity (they are used to adjust the rheology). In thermal cured lacquers, such diluents added are volatile substances which evaporate from the lacquer during drying. In the case of radiation-curing <b>lacquers</b> (for example <b>UV</b> <b>lacquers),</b> those diluents should be avoided. The addition of reactive diluents facilitates the processing of the lacquers, allows the addition of more fillers and improves the wetting behavior on the substrate. If volatile diluents are replaced by reactive diluents, flammability, smell, skin irritation and environmental compatibility (by lower or no VOC emissions) can be improved.|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} problematic of indoor air pollution. There were tested low emitting types of lacquers – UV and waterborne lacquers. The {{work has been}} splitted in to two parts. In the first part samples of lacquers were applied on the particle board with beech veneer on the surface. Samples of air with VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) from lacquers were taken 3 and 24 hours after application. Tests proved that film layer of <b>UV</b> <b>lacquer</b> emit much smaller volumes of VOCs than acrylic waterborne lacquers or than 2 –component epoxide waterborne lacquer. Acrylic waterborne lacquers’ materials emitted especially butoxyethylene, epoxide lacquer emitted a lot of butoxyethanol and methoxypropanol and UV lacquers particularly emitted toluene, benzene and xylene. Se­cond part of testing consists of VOCs’ measuring of chosen lacquers applied on different base materials – inertial material glass and particle board with beech veneer. Tested criterion was the impact of different base material on emitted amount of VOCs. The results showed that lacquer coated on glass emit much more chemicals than lacquer on wood material. All materials were also tested on total amount of organic compounds emitted in to the air – on the TVOC. Measuring showed the same results as the first parts of research...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of organic coatings {{is widely used}} {{in the production of}} metallic food containers to protect metal against corrosion and to avoid metal-food contact. The protective action of a lacquer film is determined by its physical-chemical characteristics, the method of application and its compatibility with the packed products. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the protective action of three groups of coatings (water based <b>lacquers,</b> <b>UV</b> cured <b>lacquers</b> and conventional epoxyphenolic lacquers) applied on four lots of different metallic substrate. In characterization, the methods used are dry adhesion, wet adhesion and wet adhesion after sterilization treatments of samples in food imitating solutions. The results show that the best characterization of lacquers is given by the last method, which allows better differentiation between lacquers/substrate systems...|$|R
50|$|After metalisation, the discs {{pass on to}} a spin-coater, where <b>UV</b> curable <b>lacquer</b> is {{dispensed}} {{onto the}} newly metallized layer. By rapid spinning, the lacquer coats the entire disc with a very thin layer (approx. 70 nm). After the lacquer is applied, the disks pass under a high intensity UV lamp which cures the lacquer rapidly. The lacquer also provides a surface for a label, generally screen printed or offset printed. The printing ink(s) must be chemically compatible with the lacquer used. Markers used by consumers to write on blank surfaces can lead to breaks in the protective lacquer layer, which may lead to corrosion of the reflective layer, and failure of the CD.|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{designed}} to investigate the possibility of producing alignment layers for liquid crystal devices by cross-linking thin films containing anisotropic polymer bound chromophores via irradiation with polarised ultra violet light. Photocross-linkable polymers find use in microelectronics, liquid crystal displays, printing and <b>UV</b> curable <b>lacquers</b> and inks; so there is an increasing incentive {{for the development of}} new varieties of photopolymers in general. The synthesis and characterisation of two new photopolymers that are suitable as potential alignment layers for liquid crystal devices are reported in this thesis. The first polymer contains the anthracene chromophore attached via a spacer unit to a methacrylate backbone and the second used a similarly attached aryl azide group. Copolymers of the new monomers with methyl methacrylate were investigated to establish reactivity ratios in order to understand composition drift during polymerisation...|$|R
40|$|Paper is a cheap {{substrate}} {{which is}} in principle compatible with the process temperature applied in the plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) and hot wire CVD (HWCVD) of thin film silicon solar cells. The main drawback of paper for this application is the porosity due to its fibre like structure. The feature size (micrometre scale) {{is larger than the}} thickness of the applied photovoltaic layers. To overcome this problem, <b>UV</b> curable <b>lacquer</b> was used to planarize the surface. Plain 80 grams printer paper was taken as a substrate and the lacquer smoothens the rough surface of the paper such that a designed nanostructure can be imprinted for light scattering. In this manner single junction amorphous silicon solar cells with a HWCVD deposited intrinsic layer were processed on paper, without any concessions to the process temperature of 200 °C. The cell performance is comparable to that of reference cells grown on stainless steel, proving that solar cells can be deposited on paper substrates without sacrificing performance. PV on paper could be applied as ”disposable” power source for gadgets, electronic labelling, remote sensing systems, etc. (Internet of Things) ...|$|R
40|$|Economically {{advantageous}} microfabrication {{technologies for}} lab-on-a-chip diagnostic devices substituting commonly used glass etching or injection molding processes {{are one of}} the key enablers for the emerging market of microfluidic devices. On-site detection in fields of life sciences, point of care diagnostics and environmental analysis requires compact, disposable and highly functionalized systems. Roll-to-roll production as a high volume process has become the emerging fabrication technology for integrated, complex high technology products within recent years (e. g. fuel cells). Differently functionalized polymer films enable researchers to create a new generation of lab-on-a-chip devices by combining electronic, microfluidic and optical functions in multilayer architecture. For replication of microfluidic and optical functions via roll-to-roll production process competitive approaches are available. One of them is to imprint fluidic channels and optical structures of micro- or nanometer scale from embossing rollers into ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> curable <b>lacquers</b> on polymer substrates. Depending on dimension, shape and quantity of those structures there are alternative manufacturing technologies for the embossing roller. Ultra-precise diamond turning, electroforming or casting polymer materials are used either for direct structuring or manufacturing of roller sleeves. Mastering methods are selected for application considering replication quality required and structure complexity. Criteria for the replication quality are surface roughness and contour accuracy. Structure complexity is evaluated by shapes producible (e. g. linear, circular) and aspect ratio. Costs for the mastering process and structure lifetime are major cost factors. The alternative replication approaches are introduced and analyzed corresponding to the criteria presented. Advantages and drawbacks of each technology are discussed and exemplary applications are presented...|$|R
