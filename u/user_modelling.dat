This paper {{outlines}} a {{new approach}} for decentralized agent based <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> using a taxonomy of purposes that define a variety of contextdependent <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> processes rather than creating and maintaining a single centralized <b>user</b> <b>modelling</b> server.

This chapter complements other chapters of this book in reviewing <b>user</b> <b>models</b> and <b>user</b> <b>modeling</b> approaches applied in adaptive Web systems. The presentation is structured along three dimensions: what is being modeled, how it is modeled, and how the models are maintained. After a broad overview {{of the nature of}} the information presented in these various <b>user</b> <b>models,</b> the chapter focuses on two groups of approaches to <b>user</b> <b>model</b> representation and maintenance: the overlay approach to <b>user</b> <b>model</b> representation and the uncertainty-based approach to <b>user</b> <b>modeling.</b> 1. ...|$|R

Unobtrusive <b>user</b> <b>modeling</b> is complementary to transparent <b>user</b> <b>modeling.</b> Unobtrusive <b>user</b> <b>modeling</b> induces <b>user</b> <b>models</b> appropriate for Educational AH (EAH) based on metaphors characterized by a shared locus of control over learning, such as small group learning.

The types of information that a <b>user</b> <b>model</b> may be required to keep about a user are then identified and discussed. <b>User</b> <b>models</b> themselves can vary greatly depending on the requirements of the situation and the implementation, so several dimensions along which they can be classified are presented.
