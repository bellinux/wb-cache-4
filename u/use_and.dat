40|$|This study {{explores the}} <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gratifications of {{different}} stakeholders regarding marketing communication messaging <b>and</b> how these <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gratifications {{vary according to}} stakeholder loyalty. Marketing is increasingly recognising {{that in order to}} be effective, firms need to consider a broader range of stakeholders other than just consumers. However, current literature fails to identify how firms should interact with their various stakeholder groups and only identifies that such interactions should take place. In developing an understanding of how to interact with various stakeholder groups, the <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gratifications approach was adopted and stakeholders were positioned on the extended ladder of stakeholder loyalty. The analysis of data emerging from a qualitative survey among 28 stakeholders of Philips Design demonstrates that the revealed <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gratifications of various stakeholder groups regarding marketing communication messaging have much in common with classifications derived from studies of other mass media <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gratifications. A wide range of <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gratifications with regard to marketing communication messaging was revealed varying according to stakeholder loyalty. Based on their specific <b>uses</b> <b>and</b> gratifications the various stakeholder groups have different content preferences regarding marketing communication messaging. Based on these findings, companies can decide on how they should communicate with various stakeholder groups...|$|R
