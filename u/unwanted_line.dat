Necessary mathematical model and computer simulation results have been presented. A wider time margin would be beneficial in many ways, such as precluding <b>unwanted</b> <b>line</b> tripping following temporary earth fault or transient swings, deferring costly replacement of the existing relays and breakers by the faster ones, and making a fair decision on tripping, taking into consideration a large volume of on-line data, constraints and complicated policies likely to be encountered in operating a power system under deregulation or a competitive market environment...|$|E
40|$|International audience; Line broadening, {{which can}} arise from inhomogeneities or {{homogeneous}} relaxation effects {{that lead to}} finite lifetimes of quantum states, is the Achilles' heel of many forms of spectroscopy. We show that line broadening may be considerably reduced by exploiting long lifetimes associated with superpositions of quantum states with different symmetry, termed long-lived coherences. In proton NMR of arbitrary molecules (including proteins) in isotropic solution, the slow oscillatory decays of long-lived coherences can yield spectra with very high resolution. This improvement opens the way to high-field magnetic resonance of molecular assemblies that are almost {{an order of magnitude}} larger than could be hitherto studied. Coherences between states of different symmetry may be useful in other forms of spectroscopy to cancel <b>unwanted</b> <b>line</b> broadening effects...|$|E

After detection and tracking of the vehicles, detailed data for microscopic traffic analysis result. To increase speed and reliability of vehicle detection and tracking, road detection is suggested. In this way, the search area for vehicle detection is limited to road boundaries while other moving objects such as vegetation or pedestrians are omitted. Road detection from aerial helicopter images is done by a line detection method based on edge detection and morphology operations. <b>Unwanted</b> <b>lines</b> and other errors introduced during the line detection are removed by a threshold method.

A sacrificial aluminum layer was used to provide both a conductive substrate for electron beam exposure, and a clean highly resistant etch stop for reactive ion etching. This enabled {{the use of a}} low pressure CF 4 RE process that minimized the rates of polymerization during etch and provided stable etch rates necessary to achieve 100 angstrom etch depth control. Alignment errors of up to 1 micron were attributed to stage drifts on the electron beam exposure system. No systematic errors were found to indicate problems with the MEBES alignment system and alignment mark detection. Simulations of multiphase PSMs were performed using a program developed as a part of this work capable of simulating a 1024 pixel array of arbitrary magnitude and phase under conditions of partially coherent illumination. Cases of annular (off-axis) illumination and defocus are also allowed. The program has demonstrated rapid calculation as well as flexibility of user input using a graphical user interface.

Therefore, comparison among the approaches has been conducted because to recognize the suitable approach is the importance tasks before this research can be proceed for the next stage. Approach: This study focused on CAD data extraction approach to identify product information. CAD data referred as Computer-Aided Design (CAD) data extracted from the CAD drawing which contained the drawing of product that be produce by manufacturing. CAD data consisted of geometric and non-geometric data. Geometric data contained lines, curves and vertex. While non-geometric data include texts, colors and layers. The extracted CAD data were needed to generate the product information which is useful information for the machine in production field to produce the product for the manufacturing same as depicted in the CAD drawing. Basically, the product information consisted of product details such as length, thickness, wideness and radius of the product, processes information for the machine to process the product such as taper, cutting, drilling and punching.

40|$|A {{search for}} long {{transient}} gravitational waves associated with neutron stars is presented. The estimated length of these sources is from hours to weeks. Two types of astrophysical sources are considered: pulsar timing glitches associated with r-modes oscillations {{in the interior}} of isolated neutron stars, and Type I X-Ray bursts in neutron stars from binary systems. These signals follow the model of an e-folding sinusoid signal with a duration dependant on dissipation processes {{in the interior of}} the neutron stars and the gravitational radiation reaction. Estimations of the timescales of gravitational wave signals emitted by stable stars are presented. From this study, it is concluded that detecting signals from faster spinning neutron stars is more feasible than from slower neutron stars. The study of this type of transient gravitational wave signals is explored for the first time using an adaptation of the F-statistic gravitational wave search method used regularly in continuous gravitational wave searches. This adaptation, proposed by Prix et al, is a search methodology in which the duration of a signal plays a significant role in its detection. This code is part of the LAL/LAL-apps data analysis algorithm libraries of the LIGO and VIRGO scientific collaborations (LVC). The use of this method in the gravitational wave search presented in this thesis was implemented in two different environments: gaussian noise data and data in gravitational wave detector-like noise. For the latter, injections of long transient signals with durations ∼ 10, 000 s on the LVC Engineering Run 3 were done. A comparison between the results obtained in these two studies is presented. It shows that, by having a good characterisation of <b>unwanted</b> noise <b>lines,</b> it is possible to distinguish the frequency of the injected signal within a small search band of only a few frequency bins. On the other hand, the recovery of the duration of the signal would require a broad search band over time. This estimation is set to be approximately ±τ, where τ is the damping time of the injected signal, in order to construct a complete τ distribution.

40|$|Synthetic {{aperture}} sonar (SAS) is {{the underwater}} acoustic counterpart to stripmap-mode {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR). Current seagoing SAS systems are deployed on unmanned robotic vechicles, {{commonly referred to as}} autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). As with SAR, SAS imaging is ideally done with a straight-line collection trajectory. However, SAS is far more susceptible to image degradation caused by the actual sensor trajectory deviating from a pefectly straight <b>line.</b> <b>Unwanted</b> motion is virtually unavoidable in the sea due to the influence of currents and wave action. In order to construct a perfectly-focused SAS image the motion must either be constrained to within one-eighth of a wavelength over the synthetic aperture, or it must be measured with the same degree of accuracy and then accounted for in the processing software. Since the former is not possible, the latter approach must be taken. The technique known as redundant phase centers (RPC) has proven to be insrumental in solving the problem of SAS motion compensation. In essence, RPC simply refers to the practice of overlapping a portion of the receiver array from one ping (transmission and reception) to the next. The signals observed by this overlapping portion will be identical except for a time shift proportional to the relative motion between pings. The time shifts observed by the RPC channels of the receiver array are scalars representing the projection of the array receiver locations onto the image slant plane, and these time shifts can be used to compensate for the unwanted platform motion. This thesis presents several extensions to the standard RPC technique in which the RPC time delays are combined with the AUV's on-board navigation data. The scalar time delays are decomposed into the components induced by the six degrees of freedom of the motion: i. e., the linear and angular velocities. Thus, the time delays observed in the image slant plane can be used to refine the motion estimate in an absolute frame of reference external to the AUV. Creating a high-resolution SAS image of the sea floor in an automatic fashion demands accurate and robust motion estimation. The performance of the motion estimation schemes presented is demonstrated using actual field data collected from an assortment of current research SAS systems. M. S.
