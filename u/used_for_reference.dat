5|$|Andrew Graham, {{programmer}} of {{the original}} game, had returned to university after its completion, and David Darling, co-founder of Codemasters, decided {{that they could not}} wait for him to finish his degree. Codemasters approached Peter Williamson of Supersonic Software and had him produce the sequel. Williamson had just completed Cosmic Spacehead and wanted to do something new. It was intended for the sequel to reproduce the feeling {{of the original}} and add as many new features as possible. The original was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference,</b> and the code and graphics were produced from the beginning. Williamson explained that it was hoped that they could capture and go beyond that the original game offered, and the game's success was anticipated. Darling wanted it {{to be more than a}} mere continuation of the first.|$|E

25|$|On May 21, DPP legislators {{criticized the}} Mainland Affairs Council for {{classifying}} the disadvantages {{of the trade}} accord and releasing only information it considers favorable to the agreement. Responding to the questions, former Mainland Affairs Council Minister Wang Yu-chi said that the classified information was to be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> only within the government. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Cho Shih-chao said that research produced by academics is only used for internal reference for decision making. However, neither official explained why only poll numbers favorable to the government's position have been released to the public, while others were not.|$|E
25|$|The {{producers}} {{wanted to}} have a gathering place outside of home and work where the characters could meet. After a trip to Seattle, and seeing the many burgeoning coffee shops, the production designer suggested to producers that they use a coffee shop. Unlike many of the relatively modern coffee shop designs prevalent in Seattle, the production designer opted for a more warm and inviting style which would appear more established and traditional. Stools were specifically omitted to avoid any similarity to the bar on Cheers. Several Los Angeles coffee shops were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference.</b> A bookcase was added on the back wall, suggesting patrons could grab a book and read while they enjoyed their coffee. The show used three versions of the interior set depending on how much space other sets for each episode required. If there was not space for the full set, a smaller version that omitted the tables closest to the audience could be used. If there wasn't space for that set, a small back section {{of the back of the}} cafe at the top of the steps could be set up under the audience bleachers. A set was also used on occasion for the exterior patio.|$|E

500|$|Several {{competing}} linguistic {{theories have}} been put forth. Some scholars argue that her name may {{be a combination of}} the Greek sus ("pig") and korax ("crow"). Another rough translation produces the phrase [...] "the Scythian raven", an etymological description of Medea (Batman upon Bartholome, a work which Shakespeare is likely to have <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference,</b> gives the name Corax for a raven) Also, psychorrhax ("heartbreaker"), may be a play on the Greek word psychoraggia ("death struggle"). One critic searched for a connection to Sycorax's North African heritage, and found a parallel in Shokereth שוקרת, a Hebrew word meaning [...] "deceiver". Another recent idea suggests that, for thematic as well as historical reasons, the name is the reverberant combination of syllables in the name Corax of Syracuse – the oft acknowledged founder of rhetoric and worthy, fictionalised rival of Prospero. An especially odd and early guess at a meaning by one critic was sic or rex, a Latin homophone alluding to Queen Elizabeth's pride.|$|E
500|$|Animation on The Sorcerer's Apprentice {{began on}} January 21, 1938, when James Algar, the {{director}} of the segment, assigned animator Preston Blair to work on the scene when Mickey Mouse wakes from his dream. Each of the seven hundred members of staff at the time received a synopsis of Goethe's 1797 poem Der Zauberlehrling, and were encouraged to complete a twenty-question form that requested their ideas on what action might take place. Layout artist Tom Codrick created what Dick Huemer described as [...] "brilliantly colored thumbnails" [...] from preliminary storyboard sketches using gouache paints, which featured bolder use of color and lighting than any previous Disney short. Mickey was redesigned by animator Fred Moore who added pupils to his eyes {{for the first time to}} achieve greater ranges of expression. Most of the segment was shot in live action, including a scene where a UCLA athlete was asked to run and jump across one of the studio's sound stages with barrels in the way, which was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> when Mickey traverses through water.|$|E
500|$|Reviews {{interpreted}} these visions as Ben's {{challenge to}} find and defeat Brother Justin; Ben has to ultimately stop {{the creation of the}} atomic bomb as [...] "the world's march towards doomsday." [...] The Season 1 prologue already suggested this interpretation, mentioning [...] "a false sun explod over Trinity," [...] at which point [...] "man forever traded away wonder for reason." [...] The Trinity test near Alamogordo, New Mexico was humankind's first test of a nuclear weapon in 1945, and Daniel Knauf would have finished Carnivàles six-year run with the explosion of an atomic bomb as the beginning of the [...] "Age of Reason". Still, Knauf's story is [...] "not about the deployment of the bomb, it's more about the invention of the bomb," [...] with the focus [...] "around Alamogordo and the Trinity test site rather than Hiroshima and Nagasaki." [...] Much research was put into the visual effects of the explosion. Stock footage of the first beats of nuclear explosions and a self-created explosion of 300gallons of gasoline were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference.</b> The ground effects and blowing dust were created with combinations of volumetric computer graphics smoke, and the fireball of the nuclear explosion was built from Hubble images of the Sun. Knauf left the interpretation of the kiss vision open to both the characters and the audience.|$|E

40|$|Amarasi nominal demonstratives ia, naan and ne {{are used}} both pro- and adnominally {{to refer to}} objects and {{entities}} in the speech situation, with ia being <b>used</b> <b>for</b> near-speaker <b>reference,</b> naan being the near-addressee term for visible referents and ne being <b>used</b> <b>for</b> distal <b>reference.</b> The terms ia and ne are visibility-neutral. The nominal demonstratives can be used pronominally in copular clauses to identify referents in the speech situation. In adnominal form, they can co-occur with other determiners in a noun phrase. The corresponding local adverbs are ia, naa and nee respectively. Both ia and naan can be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> endophoric <b>reference.</b> Addressee-based naan is used anaphorically to refer back to preceding noun phrases and preceding chunks of discourse. The cataphoric demonstrative is ia, used to introduce direct speech. Speaker-based ia can only be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> anaphoric <b>reference</b> when the referent has high topicality...|$|R
500|$|Coke's {{jurisprudence}} centres on {{the hierarchy}} of the judges, the monarch, and Parliament in making law. Coke argued that the judges of the common law were those most suited to making law, followed by Parliament, and that the monarch was bound to follow any legal rules. This principle was justified by the idea that a judge, through his professional training, internalised what political historian and theorist Alan Cromartie referred to as [...] "an infinity of wisdom", something that mere politicians or laypersons could not understand due to the complexity of the law. Coke's Commentary on Littleton has been interpreted as deliberately obtuse, with his aim being to write what Cromartie called [...] "a sort of anti-textbook, a work whose very form denied that legal knowledge could be organised. The original edition could not be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> purposes, as Coke had published it without an index... It is a book to be 'read in' and lived with, rather than consulted, a monument to the uselessness of merely written knowledge unless it is internalised in a trained professional mind". This theory – that judges were the natural arbiters of the law – is known as the [...] "appeal to reason", with [...] "reason" [...] referring not to rationality but the method and logic used by judges in upholding and striking down laws. Coke's position meant that certainty of the law and intellectual beauty was the way to see if a law was just and correct, and that the system of law could eventually become sophisticated enough to be predictable.|$|E
2500|$|Mourouzis was an Enlightenment prince, {{whose time}} on the two thrones was {{connected}} with modernization. The prince belonged to the Freemasonry, having affiliated with two separate Lodges: in 1773, {{he was a member}} of the one active in the Transylvanian city of Hermannstadt, and, after 1803, belonged to the Moldavian Freemason branch in Galați. His Western contacts and his political ideals were probably connected with the goal of uniting the two Danubian Principalities under a single prince, as a symbolic legacy of Dacia: an 1800 atlas published in Vienna referred to his two rules as a single leadership of [...] "the two Dacias". As local legislation was primarily based on Byzantine law, he acknowledged the importance given to the Hexabiblos of 14th century Byzantine jurist Konstantinos Armenopoulos, and ordered it to be translated into Romanian [...] although it failed to become official law in Wallachia, the Hexabiblos was widely <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> by the Bucharest Divan.|$|E
2500|$|Vector Unit had {{contemplated}} simply porting {{the original}} Hydro Thunder to the Xbox 360, {{as they had}} been given the source code to the original game.

The original source code was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference,</b> and the Vector Unit [...] "played the heck out of the original game to refresh our memories." [...] The boats and environments were redesigned, taking cues from the original, but accommodating the new physics system and updated graphics engine. [...] The developers contemplated things such as boat customization and user-generated tracks, but [...] "ultimately we felt that it was more important to present an accessible, hand-crafted experience that players can just jump into and have fun with." [...] On May 1, 2012 Vector Unit announced that the game would be available for Windows 8 via Microsoft's Windows Store when the operating system is released. It joins other ports of popular Xbox 360 Xbox Live Arcade titles such as Ms. Splosion Man, Toy Soldiers and Ilomilo.|$|E

60|$|With {{the long}} strain gone, I am {{in a sort}} of {{physical}} collapse today, but it will be gone tomorrow. I judged that this end of the book would be hard work, and it turned out so. I have never done any work before that cost so much thinking and weighing and measuring and planning and cramming, or so much cautious and painstaking execution. For I wanted the whole Rouen trial in, if it could be got in {{in such a way that}} the reader's interest would not flag--in fact I wanted the reader's interest to increase; and so I stuck to it with that determination in view--with the result that I have left nothing out but unimportant repetitions. Although it is mere history--history pure and simple--history stripped naked of flowers, embroideries, colorings, exaggerations, invention--the family agree that I have succeeded. It was a perilous thing to try in a tale, but I never believed it a doubtful one--provided I stuck strictly to business and didn't weaken and give up: or didn't get lazy and skimp the work. The first two-thirds of the book were easy; for I only needed to keep my historical road straight; therefore I <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>reference</b> only one French history and one English one--and shoveled in as much fancy work and invention on both sides of the historical road as I pleased. But on this last third I have constantly used five French sources and five English ones and I think no telling historical nugget in any of them has escaped me.|$|E
