A rotating boom rainfall simulator was used on replicated treatments having either preplant in-row subsoiling or postplant between-row subsoiling used in both tilled and <b>untilled</b> surface conditions. Tilled and <b>untilled</b> treatments without subsoiling were used as checks. These six treatments were used up-and-downhill and on the contour. Subsoiling reduced the rate of water runoff but did not significantly reduce the soil erosion rate after equilibrium had been reached between water application and runoff rates. Surface condition and farming direction did not significantly affect runoff. However, the <b>untilled</b> surface treatments had about 55 % less soil loss than the tilled surfaces.

40|$|Compaction of {{replaced}} soil during reclamation of surface-mined land {{can limit}} trees. Growth, survival, and water relations of bare-root seedlings of six tree species were followed on deep-tilled and <b>untilled</b> minesoil for 2 years after planting. Trees were planted in rows deep-tilled to 0. 7 m and in <b>untilled</b> soil; mowing and herbicides controlled competing vegetation. Leaf area, shoot elongation, and diameter increment were measured in both years, and predawn and midday water potential, and midday stomatal conductance, were {{measured in the}} second year. Survival was 16 – 98 % after the first season, varying more among species than between tillage treatments. Rainfall was 50 % less in the second season, resulting in a progressive decline in predawn water potential in all treatments {{and a decrease in}} survival for several species on <b>untilled</b> soil. Similarly, trees on deep-tilled soil grew slightly more than those on <b>untilled</b> soil in the second season. Tillage effects on survival and growth were not consistently detectable between years, however, and 3 years after planting there were no further changes in survival. Differences in survival and growth among species were large. Survival of black locust was approximately double that of any other species, and its growth was several orders of magnitude greater than that of other species, whereas all of the tulip poplars died {{by the end of the}} second season. Over 2 years it appeared that most species had not grown enough either to exploit fully the deep-tilled soil or to be impeded on the <b>untilled</b> soil such that differences in establishment could be detected. The full impact of deep tillage on reclamation with trees must be assessed, however, by following growth and survival over a longer time period...|$|R
50|$|In {{places with}} {{rigorous}} winter, <b>untilled</b> soil can {{take longer to}} warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying {{on the surface of}} <b>untilled</b> fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.|$|R

40|$|A set of 119 study trees was {{identified}} in a 65 year-old Douglas-fir stand after a thinning operation conducted {{seven years ago}} using pre-planned skid trails and groundbased machinery. Some of the trails were tilled using a winged subsoiler after this operation in order to alleviate the effect of compaction caused by the heavy machinery used during logging. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether tilling compacted forest soils after a harvesting operation serves to alleviate the compaction over time, and if tillage has any discernable positive or negative effect on the growth of the residual trees adjacent to tilled skid trails. To clarify growth relationships, soil bulk density measurements were taken around study trees adjacent to undisturbed areas, tilled trails, and <b>untilled</b> trails. In addition, different tree growth parameters and competition indexes were evaluated to help distinguish thinning and other effects. The results showed that although mean soil bulk densities were generally higher around trees adjacent to <b>untilled</b> skid trails, there was no statistical difference between the densities in <b>untilled</b> and tilled zones (95...|$|R

40|$|George Moore’s The <b>Untilled</b> Field (1903) is {{generally}} considered a precursor of James Joyce’s paradigmatic short story cycle Dubliners (1914). Moore himself called The <b>Untilled</b> Field “a landmark in Anglo-Irish literature, a new departure” in his preface to the 1914 edition and “a frontier book, between the new and the old style” {{in a letter to}} Edmund Gosse. Moreover, while writing The <b>Untilled</b> Field, he stated that “the book is a perfect unity” and expressed his hope that it would “not be reviewed as a collection of short stories”. Although some critics claim that the work lacks unity in comparison with Dubliners, others find that Moore’s book does possess a “loose progressive argument”. In this paper, I will argue that The <b>Untilled</b> Field can indeed be considered a short story cycle, in fact bridging an earlier tradition of regional cycles (so-called narratives of community) and Joyce’s anti-narrative of community. I hope to demonstrate this by analysing how Moore takes elements from Jane Barlow’s Irish Idylls (1892), {{but at the same time}} refashions them, thereby prefiguring Dubliners. As opposed to the cycles of Irish mythology and the framed tale collections by other nineteenth-century Irish authors, both Barlow’s Irish Idylls and Moore’s The <b>Untilled</b> Field are unified by “internal linking” instead of “external framing”. Irish Idylls is a collection of short stories unified by a shared, though varying, set of characters, as well as by setting and theme. The same goes for The <b>Untilled</b> Field, although the latter covers different themes and settings, and includes several protagonists. Barlow’s Irish Idylls does not only participate in the Anglo-Irish tradition of informing the outside world about Irish life, but can also be considered part of a regional tradition of cycles which Sandra A. Zagarell has called narratives of community. She defines the genre as grouping together works which “take as their subject the life of a community […] and portray the minute and quite ordinary processes through which the community maintains itself as an entity”. Zagarell mentions Irish Idylls as an example. With The <b>Untilled</b> Field, as I hope to demonstrate, Moore both harks back to this tradition and alters it. Moore’s book shares with Barlow’s a focus on the ordinary yet typical aspects of the life of a (rural) community. Moreover, the contrast between community life and the modern world typical of the genre comes to the fore in both works. On the other hand, Moore’s severe critique of “Irish Renaissance constructions of ‘Irishness’” contrasts sharply with Barlow’s idyllic stories set in the village of Lisconnel. Moore, then, does not provide his readers with a romanticized image of Irish peasant life: for instance, he attacks the repressive power of the village clergy, sheds light on the unfairness of poverty and gives a new interpretation to the theme of exile. In addition, he does not limit himself to Irish rural life but also includes urban settings. Similarly, he looks at the Irish peasantry as well as at the middle class. In this way, as I hope to show, with The <b>Untilled</b> Field, Moore at the same time inscribed himself in the tradition of the narrative of community and paved the way for Joyce’s anti-narrative of community, Dubliners. status: publishe...|$|R
