40|$|The electrospinning {{process of}} fiber {{production}} is examined {{in regards to}} the preparation of continuous Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers with the purpose of preparing carbon nanofibers for the reinforcement of thin films and nanocomposites. The mechanical properties and reinforcing behavior of nanofibers are expected to differ significantly from their conventional counterparts; the strength of a carbon filament increases as the diameter decreases. ^ Discrete lengths of partially aligned and oriented electrospun PAN fibers with diameters between 0. 27 μm and 0. 29 μm (FESEM) were prepared from solution with Dimethylformamide electrospun between 10 - 16 kV and collected onto a take-up wheel rotating between 3. 5 m/s and 12. 3 m/s. A maximum chain orientation parameter of 0. 23 is determined by dichroism (FTIR) and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) for fibers collected between 8. 1 m/s and 9. 8 m/s. Twisted yarns of aligned PAN nanofibers with an average denier of 446 and twist angles between 1. 1 ° and 16. 8 ° are prepared. The ultimate strength and modulus of the twisted yarns increase with increasing angle of twist to a maximum of 162 ± 8. 5 MPa and 5. 9 ± 0. 3 GPa, respectively, at an angle of 9. 3 °. Drawing of the <b>untwisted</b> <b>yarn</b> in batch above the Tg of the material resulted in a further increase of the ultimate strength and modulus to 253 ± 46 MPa and 4. 8 ± 0. 5 GPa at a draw ratio of approximately 1 : 2; the ultimate strength of commercially prepared precursor fiber is 512 MPa with post-treatment. A high temperature oxidation process is optimized and carbon nanofibers are prepared. The carbonized yarns are observed to exhibit graphitic structure by Raman scattering and wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), although the mechanical properties are weak. ^ Continuous lengths of electrospun PAN yarn, provided through a collaboration, are characterized and evaluated for the production of carbon nanofiber yarn. The yarn is continuously processed and converted into carbon. Although, the yarn exhibits graphitic strucuture, the strength of the carbonized nanofiber yarn is only approximately 5 % that of commercial carbon fiber prepared from the same precursor material. The poor mechanical properties are due to a loss of preferred orientation during an extended stabilization step. ...|$|E

5000|$|A yarn's {{usefulness}} for a knitting {{project is}} judged by several factors, {{such as its}} loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and felting qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn. The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas <b>untwisting</b> <b>yarns</b> can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|R

40|$|The fibre {{properties}} of cotton, which vary widely according to genetic and environmental conditions, determine its price and textile processing performance and product quality. It is therefore {{hardly surprising that}} cotton fibre properties are routinely measured for trading and quality control purposes, {{with a great deal}} of research having been, and still being, devoted towards developing instruments which enable the various fibre properties to be measured rapidly and accurately. In many cases, it is also necessary to be able to measure {{properties of}} cotton fibres when they have already been converted into yarn and fabric form. To do so, the yarn has to be dismantled into its component fibres, preferably without significantly changing the fibre properties. This could only be done by manually untwisting the yarn and carefully extracting the fibres from the <b>untwisted</b> <b>yarn,</b> care being taken not to break or lose any fibres in the process. This is a time consuming, laborious and labour intensive process. In view of this, a „yarn dismantler‟ which could automatically, cost effectively and within acceptable time frames, dismantle a cotton yarn into its constituent fibres, without undue damage or changes to the fibres, was developed and patented. This thesis reports the results of research undertaken to further develop, evaluate and optimize the yarn dismantler into the final prototype, as well as those relating to its practical applications, including tracking changes in fibre properties during miniature and pilot scale processing, up to, and including the yarn stage. Initial research undertaken on the original bench and first prototype models indicated that, although they produced very promising results, certain improvements and modifications were necessary, if the dismantler was to perform in an efficient and operator friendly manner at the required speeds. These included changes in the axial position of the untwisting spindle and the perforated screen of the suction drum, increasing the air suction at the perforated drum, installing a new motor for the untwisting spindle drive, separating the drives to the different parts of the unit in order to control them independently, integrating a more effective steaming unit into the unit etc. It was found that the dismantling rate had to be set to equal about 95 percent of the original twist in the yarn, and that steaming of the dismantled (<b>untwisted)</b> <b>yarn</b> on the perforated drum was necessary in order to eliminate any twist liveliness (residual torque) in the dismantled yarn, and enable it to be handled and tested on the AFIS instrument. When the final prototype Yarn Dismantler was produced, incorporating all the above mentioned improvements, it functioned very well at dismantling speeds of at least 2 m/min, enabling the length of yarn required for subsequent AFIS testing to be dismantled within an acceptable time of less than 10 minutes, with excellent reproducibility and repeatability of results, also under commercial conditions. It was found that the AFIS measured length characteristics of fibres from the instrument dismantled yarns compared very well with those of fibres from manually dismantled yarns, differences in fibre length generally being less than 1 mm, and it was concluded from these and other evaluation tests, that the yarn dismantler produced fibres without any significant fibre breakage. Some limited tests, carried out on commercially produced carded and combed yarns, indicated that short fibre content and dust and trash levels, as measured by the AFIS on fibres from dismantled yarn, together with the corresponding Uster Statistics, could enable a carded cotton yarn to be distinguished from a combed cotton yarn. Statistical analysis of fibre test results obtained at the different stages during miniature and pilot plant scale processing of various cottons, clearly showed that very significant changes in fibre properties could be caused by certain of the processes. For example, significant fibre breakage occurred during the drafting on the spinning frame, prior to twist insertion. The thesis provides detailed results of changes in various fibre properties, including length, short fibre content, maturity, immature fibre content, seed coat neps and fibrous neps, which occurred from the lint to the final yarn, as well as on the relationship between the properties of the fibres from the dismantled yarn and those from the lint. The results obtained have clearly demonstrated the practical value of the yarn dismantler in enabling yarns to be automatically dismantled into their constituent fibres, which can then be tested by an instrument, such as the AFIS, and the test results related to those of the original lint fibres, thereby opening up many fields of research and practical applications, some of which are captured under „Recommended Further Work...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = the density of yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. 　In the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the nip point of delivery roller. 　(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting rayon yarn with the flyer frame showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of <b>untwisted</b> <b>yarn</b> is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in false twisting of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) The permanent deformations of twisted yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|E
