5|$|Bird had {{actually}} been drafted the year before, but later decided to stay an additional year, and the two superstars both entered the league in 1979, leading their respective teams to dazzling heights. Johnson and the Showtime Lakers reached the 1980 NBA Finals against the 76ers, which was also led by NBA superstar Julius Erving. The Lakers took a 3–2 lead, but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could not play in Game 6 due to injury. Johnson, a natural point guard, was shifted to center, and ended <b>up</b> <b>playing</b> every position on the court during the game, scoring 42 points, while also attaining 15 rebounds and 7 assists to win his first championship while being awarded his first NBA Finals MVP; a remarkable performance {{in the annals of}} the sport.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} enquiries {{from other}} clubs, he stayed at Vicarage Road for pre-season, {{in the hope}} of regaining his match fitness.

They conceded 38 goals in 46 league matches, the joint-best defensive record in the division. Gibbs missed just one of the club's 57 fixtures, scoring in a game against Brentford. The defender later noted the irony that having been released as an injury concern, he ended <b>up</b> <b>playing</b> more games the following season than any of his teammates.|$|E

5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s, Takemitsu {{began to make}} use of {{traditional}} Japanese instruments in his music, and even took <b>up</b> <b>playing</b> the biwa—an instrument he used in his score for the film Seppuku (1962). In 1967, Takemitsu received a commission from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, to commemorate the orchestra's 125th anniversary, for which he wrote November Steps for biwa, shakuhachi, and orchestra. Initially, Takemitsu had great difficulty in uniting these instruments from such different musical cultures in one work. Eclipse for biwa and shakuhachi (1966) illustrates Takemitsu's attempts to find a viable notational system for these instruments, which in normal circumstances neither sound together nor are used in works notated in any system of Western staff notation.|$|E

Nonetheless, he played in Port Moody at the double-A level through to bantam (age 13–14 level), including a peewee (age 11–12) provincial championship. In 2007–08, he played with the Vancouver North East Chiefs of the British Columbia Major Midget League.|$|E
