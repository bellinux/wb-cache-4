25|$|The {{internet}} {{layer is}} not only agnostic of data structures at the transport layer, but it also does not distinguish between operation of the various transport layer protocols. IP carries data {{for a variety of}} different <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocols.</b> These protocols are each identified by a unique protocol number: for example, Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) and Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) are protocols 1 and 2, respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{layers of}} the {{protocol}} suite near the top are logically closer to the user application, while those near the bottom are logically closer to the physical transmission of the data. Viewing layers as providing or consuming a service is a method of abstraction to isolate <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocols</b> from the details of transmitting bits over, for example, Ethernet and collision detection, while the lower layers avoid having to {{know the details of}} each and every application and its protocol.|$|E

50|$|Because the CE {{indication}} {{can only}} be handled effectively by an upper layer protocol that supports it, ECN is only {{used in conjunction with}} <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocols,</b> such as TCP, that support congestion control and have a method for echoing the CE indication to the transmitting endpoint.|$|E
50|$|In {{discussions of}} encapsulation, the more {{abstract}} layer {{is often called}} the upper layer protocol while the more specific layer is called the lower layer protocol.

50|$|UDP is {{a minimal}} message-oriented {{transport}} <b>layer</b> <b>protocol</b> that is documented in RFC 768.

50|$|All error {{conditions}} in the network must be detected and compensated by the end nodes of a transmission. The <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocols</b> of the Internet protocol suite are responsible for resolving reliability issues.

30|$|As is well known, {{orthogonal}} waveforms allow multiple UWB {{sensors to}} access the same idle band {{at the same time}} and in the same location, without causing serious collision. In a UWB sensor network, therefore, the orthogonal waveform division multiple accessing (WDMA) can also greatly simplify the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocol</b> design and reduce accessing delay, hence significantly reducing scheduling complexity and improving spectrum efficiency.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to use diverse framings in a single network.

50|$|On {{broadcast}} networks, such as Ethernet, the MAC {{address is}} expected to uniquely identify each node on that segment and allows frames to be marked for specific hosts.

Since the attacker normally can't see any reply packets, the sequence number must be guessed in order to hijack the connection. The poor implementation in many older operating systems and network devices, however, means that TCP sequence numbers can be predicted.|$|E

We focus on the requirements for the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> OSI <b>protocols</b> and illustrate how inheritance, subtyping, and polymorphic function effect their implementation...|$|R
40|$|Above the {{transport}} layer, the open systems interconnection (OSI) basic reference model describes several application standards {{supported by a}} common <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocol</b> stack. Digital's high-performance implementation of the <b>upper</b> <b>layers</b> of the <b>protocol</b> stack concentrates on maximizing data throughput while minimizing connection establishment delay. An additional benefit derived from the implementation is that, for normal data exchanges, the delivery delay is also minimized. The implementation features of Digital's two OSI applications-file transfer, access, and management (FTAM) and virtual terminal (VT) -include the use of common code to facilitate portability and efficient buffer management to improve performance. The open systems interconnection (OSI) basic reference model defined in the International Organization for Standardization standard ISO 7498 - 1 specifies a <b>layered</b> <b>protocol</b> model consisting of seven layers.

For example, an EtherType value of 0x0800 signals that the frame contains an IPv4 datagram. Likewise, an EtherType of 0x0806 indicates an ARP frame, 0x8100 indicates an IEEE 802.1Q frame and 0x86DD indicates an IPv6 frame.|$|R

50|$|The Wireless Datagram Protocol (WDP), a {{protocol}} in WAP architecture, covers the Transport Layer Protocols in the Internet model. As a general transport service, WDP offers {{to the upper}} layers an invisible interface independent of the underlying network technology used. In consequence of the interface common to transport protocols, the <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocols</b> of the WAP architecture can operate independent of the underlying wireless network. By letting only the transport layer deal with physical network-dependent issues, global interoperability can be acquired using mediating gateways.|$|E
50|$|To support weapons {{applications}} such as digitized video, and transfers of terrain maps, target images, and program files, Revision E of MIL-STD-1760 includes an option for higher speed data communication. This option, the High Speed Network for MIL-STD-1760 (High-Speed 1760), is defined by SAE standard AS5653. High-Speed 1760 specifies a gigabit-speed interface based on Fibre Channel, operating at 1.0625 Gbit/s over a pair of 75 ohm coax cables. The Fibre Channel <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocols</b> for High-Speed 1760 are FC-AE-1553, based on MIL-STD-1553, for command and control messages and file transfers; and FC-AV for video and audio.|$|E

3000|$|... (2) Network latency: Due to {{the large}} {{overhead}} of global CSI/user data and the limited transmission capability of the backhaul network, {{the distribution of the}} necessary information among BSs must be achieved by well-designed cross-layer algorithm including media access control (MAC) layer scheduling as well as physical (PHY) layer transmission strategies [22 – 25]. The communication between the PHY and <b>upper</b> <b>layers</b> <b>protocols,</b> and the traffic routing will naturally bring excessive time delay, causing dramatic performance degradation especially when the delay exceeds the coherence time of the downlink channels.|$|R
5000|$|Management agility: By {{abstracting}} <b>upper</b> <b>layer</b> <b>protocols</b> {{from physical}} connections, I/O virtualization provides greater flexibility, greater utilization and faster provisioning {{when compared to}} traditional NIC and HBA card architectures. Virtual I/O technologies can be dynamically expanded and contracted (versus traditional physical I/O channels that are fixed and static), and usually replace multiple network and storage connections to each server with a single cable that carries multiple traffic types. Because configuration changes are implemented in software rather than hardware, time periods to perform common data center tasks - such as adding servers, storage or network connectivity - can be reduced from days to minutes.|$|E
