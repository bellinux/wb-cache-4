We argue that their homogeneity constraint on spillovers across G 7 countries is inappropriate, {{and show that}} it is rejected by the data. Extending the data set and applying new empirical approaches, we find: (i) R&D spillovers are extremely heterogeneous across G 7 countries; (ii) panel estimates do not correspond to country specific estimates and conceal important cross-country differences in knowledge diffusion; and (iii) the US is a net loser in terms of international R&D spillovers. Our interpretation is that when competitors ‘catch-up’ technologically, they challenge <b>US</b> <b>market</b> <b>shares</b> and investments worldwide and this has implications for US productivity...|$|R
