40|$|We {{present an}} infant with {{congenital}} nephrogenic diabetes insipidus with a V 2 receptor mutation. The infant {{was admitted to}} our hospital because of high fever 7 days after birth. Laboratory examinations demonstrated elevated serum sodium (152 mEq/L) and chloride (113 mEq/L) concentrations. Plasma osmolarity was increased to 312 mOsm/kg, even though <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> was 76 mOsm/kg. Serum AVP concentration was markedly increased. Pitressin-loading test did not show marked increment in the <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> or secretion of urinary cyclic-AMP. Therefore, the patient was clinically diagnosed as having nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. DNA analysis of the V 2 receptor gene identified a C to A transition at nucleotide position 1503. This mutation leads to a predictable change from Proline to Histidine. The patient was fed a sodium-restricted formula and administered trichlormethiazide. After initiating treatment, the serum concentration of Na was maintained below 150 mEq/L, {{and there was no}} physical dysfunction or mental retardation.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the diuretic potential of Polyherbal formulations prepared from {{the seeds of}} Vitis venifera, Duranta repens and Centratherum anthelminticum in Albino rats. Methods: Different concentrations of Polyherbal formulations (100, 200 and 400 mg/kg), furosemide (10 mg/kg) and vehicle were orally administered to rat (n = 6 animals per group) and their urine output was collected after 24 h. The <b>Urinary</b> output, <b>Osmolarity,</b> pH, Na+, K+ and Cl- concentrations of urine were estimated. Results: The Polyherbal formulations produced significant increase in Na+, K+, Cl- excretion, caused alkalinization of urine, showed strong Diuretic index, saluretic index and Natruretic index. All the concentrations of Polyherbal formulation showed dosedependent relationship when compared to control animals. Conclusions: These finding strongly suggests that the Polyherbal formulations have a good diuretic activity on rats in the above experimental model...|$|R

40|$|Sensitive and {{specific}} urinary biomarkers can improve patient outcomes in many diseases through informing early diagnosis. Unfortunately, to date, the accuracy and translation of diagnostic urinary biomarkers into clinical practice has been disappointing. We believe {{this may be}} due to inappropriate standardization of diagnostic urinary biomarkers. Our objective was therefore to characterize the effects of standardizing urinary levels of IL- 6, IL- 8, and VEGF using the commonly applied standards namely <b>urinary</b> creatinine, <b>osmolarity</b> and protein. First, we report results based on the biomarker levels measured in 120 hematuric patients, 80 with pathologically confirmed bladder cancer, 27 with confounding pathologies and 13 in whom no underlying cause for their hematuria was identified, designated "no diagnosis". Protein levels were related to final diagnostic categories (p = 0. 022, ANOVA). Osmolarity (mean = 529 mOsm; median = 528 mOsm) was normally distributed, while creatinine (mean = 10163 µmol/l, median = 9350 µmol/l) and protein (0. 3297, 0. 1155 mg/ml) distributions were not. When we compared AUROCs for IL- 6, IL- 8 and VEGF levels, we found that protein standardized levels consistently resulted in the lowest AUROCs. The latter suggests that protein standardization attenuates the "true" differences in biomarker levels across controls and bladder cancer samples. Second, in 72 hematuric patients; 48 bladder cancer and 24 controls, in whom urine samples had been collected on recruitment and at follow-up (median = 11 (1 to 20 months)), we demonstrate that protein levels were approximately 24 % lower at follow-up (Bland Altman plots). There was an association between differences in individual biomarkers and differences in protein levels over time, particularly in control patients. Collectively, our findings identify caveats intrinsic to the common practice of protein standardization in biomarker discovery studies conducted on urine, particularly in patients with hematuria...|$|R
40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Experimental studies suggest a detrimental role for vasopressin in {{the pathogenesis of}} autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). However, it is unknown whether endogenous vasopressin concentration is associated with disease severity in patients with ADPKD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Plasma copeptin concentration (a marker of endogenous vasopressin levels) was measured in 102 ADPKD patients (diagnosis based on Ravine criteria) by an immunoassay. Plasma and <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> were also measured. To assess disease severity, GFR and effective renal blood flow were measured by continuous infusion of I- 125 -iothalamate and I- 131 -hippuran, total renal volume by magnetic resonance imaging, and 24 -hour urinary albumin excretion by nephelometry. Results In these ADPKD patients, copeptin {{was associated with the}} various markers of disease severity in ADPKD (positively with total renal volume [R = 0. 47] and albuminuria [R = 0. 39] and negatively with GFR [R = - 0. 58] and effective renal blood flow [R = - 0. 52], all P < 0. 001). These associations were independent of age, gender, and use of diuretics. Copeptin was furthermore associated with plasma osmolarity (P < 0. 001) but not with 24 -hour urinary volume, 24 -hour <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> or fractional urea excretion (P = 0. 7, 0. 9, and 0. 3, respectively). Conclusions On cross-sectional analysis, copeptin is associated with disease severity in ADPKD patients, supporting the results of experimental studies that suggest that vasopressin antagonists have a renoprotective effect in ADPKD and offering a good prospect for clinical studies with these agents.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the bifidogenic effect of galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) in a follow-on formula and the effects on other intestinal bacteria. Secondary objectives were the effects on stool characteristics, growth, and general well-being. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind study, 159 healthy infants, formula-fed at enrollment (at 4 - 6 months), were randomized to an experimental follow-on formula supplemented with 5 g/L (GOS) (77 infants), or to a standard follow-on formula (control, 82 infants). Infants were evaluated at enrollment (study day 1 = sd 1), after 6 weeks (study day 2 = sd 2), and after an additional 12 weeks (study day 3 = sd 3). At each study day, a fresh stool sample for the bacterial counts was collected, and the growth parameters were measured. At sd 2, urinary specimens were collected for the evaluation of <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity.</b> RESULTS: At sd 2 and sd 3, the GOS group had a higher median number (colony-forming units per gram of stool) of bifidobacteria than did the control group (sd 2 GOS 9. 2 x 10 (9) vs control 4. 4 x 10 (9), P = 0. 012); (sd 3 GOS 7. 2 x 10 (9) vs control 2. 4 x 10 (9), P = 0. 027). Other bacteria did not show any significant differences between the 2 groups at all study days. The GOS produced softer stools but had no effect on stool frequency. The <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> (mOsm/L) at sd 2 was comparable in both groups. Supplementation had no influence on the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects or on the growth of the infants. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the addition of GOS (5 g/L) to a follow-on formula positively influences the bifidobacteria flora and the stool consistency in infants during the supplementation period at weaning. No local or systemic side effects were recorded...|$|E

The study subjects were assigned to six different groups, five of whom took different NSAIDs (namely nabumetoce, indotaethacin, diclofenac, sulindac, tenoxicam) and the sixth was a control group. Data were collected on serum sodium, chloride, potassium, urea; creatinine, bicarbonate and uric acid as well as <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity,</b> sodium, potassium, chloride and urea.

40|$|This {{article will}} provide a pathophysiologic basis for the {{assessment}} of critically ill children who have developed disorders of urine volume. The anatomical and pathophysiologic causes of oliguria and polyuria are considered. The physiologic basis for the use of <b>urinary</b> sodium and <b>osmolarity</b> as a guide to the assessment of patients with disorders of urine volume are discussed in detail. In addition, guidelines for the management of children with acute renal failure, with particular emphasis on the consideration for nutritional support of these patients, is discussed {{as a part of the}} comprehensive approach to this problem. This article emphasizes an understanding of the pathophysiology of salt and water excretion by the kidney as a foundation to the diagnosis and management of patients with oliguria and polyuria. In a critically ill patient, the volume or rate of urine excretion is used, frequently, as an index of cardiovascular stability, cardiac output, and peripheral perfusion. In fact, in some instances, the adequacy of parenteral fluid therapy is assessed and adjusted according to urine output. Such assumptions concerning urine output and judgments about fluid therapy are not only an oversimplification of complex renal physiology, but also hazardous for patient management.

40|$|Background. Prolonged lithium {{treatment}} may induce progressive deterioration of renal function in humans and experimental animals. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) {{has been shown}} to be effective in the prevention of hypoperfusion and toxin-induced renal failure, but its effect on lithium nephrotoxicity has not been evalu-ated yet. The purpose of this study was to examine a possible renoprotective effect of NAC against lithium-induced renal failure in a rat model. Methods. Moderate renal failure was induced in 40 Sprague–Dawley rats using a 5 week protocol includ-ing 3 weeks of lithium chloride administration in the drinking water. The animals were divided randomly into two equal groups receiving either 10 mg/kg NAC or saline by two daily intraperitoneal injections. In week 6, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was assessed by 99 mTechnetium diethylene triaminepenta-acetic acid, and serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 24 h <b>urinary</b> protein and <b>osmolarity</b> were measured. Kidneys were excised for pathological evaluation. Results. At the end of the lithium protocol, the GFR was significantly higher in the NAC-treated group compared with the control group, 0. 92 ± 0. 35 vs 0. 56 ± 0. 25 ml/min/ 100 g, respectively, P 0. 002.

40|$|To {{test the}} effect of {{prostaglandin}} A 2 (PGA 2) on renal function, infusions of PGA 2 (0 =. ng/ kg/min), arginine-vasopressin (AVP) (1 =. 5 ng/kg/min) and PGA 2 plus AVP were adminis-tered to male rats made resistant to the antidiuretic effect of AVP by pre-treatment with lithium. In non-lithium-treated control rats, AVP had its expected antidiuretic action but in lithium-treated rats neither <b>urinary</b> volume nor <b>osmolarity</b> was changed. Prostaglandin A 2 alone {{had no effect on}} urine output in lithium-treated rats; AVP plus PGA 2 infused together evoked a near normal antidiuretic response. This antidiuretic action of PGA 2 contrasts with the diuretic action reported by others. However, our infusion rates were 300 =n- 000 times lower than those of other workers and it is suggested that PGs may have opposite actions on the kidney depending on their concentration. The effect of indomethacin (a blocker of prostaglandin synthesis) on urine flow was tested in five groups of rats on different rł=e' liquid intake. Urine flow was reduced in the three groups with the highest urine volumes before treatment, and increased in the two groups with the lowest urinary volumes, again indicating that PGs may have both diuretic and antidiuretic actions...|$|R

In Group 2, the moments M 3, M 4, M 5 were 15, 30 and 60 minutes after the priming dose of magnesium sulphate and during the maintenance dose. Results - In Group I no significant changes were observed in renal hemodynamic parameters and creatinine clearance. The extracellular volume expansion increased urinary volume and decreased <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> as a consequence of sodium, potassium and free water clearance. The fractionary excretion of sodium was maintained. The plasmatic osmolarity increased. In Group 2, renal hemodynamic parameters and creatinine clearance were also maintained. There was an increase in renal sodium clearance, as detected by the increase in the fractionary excretion of sodium.

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that intravenous {{delivery of the}} human tissue kallikrein (HK) gene reduced blood pressure and plasma insulin levels in fructose-induced hypertensive rats with insulin resistance. In the current study, we evaluated the potential of a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector expressing the HK cDNA (rAAV·HK) as a sole, long term therapy to correct insulin resistance and prevent renal damage in streptozotocin-induced type- 2 diabetic rats.

However, {{the relationship between}} nutritional consumption and performance measures are less obvious for athletes competing in Polar conditions. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to evaluate dietary intake, hydration status, body composition and performance times throughout an 800 -km Antarctic race. Methods: The event organisers declared that 17 competitors would participate in the South Pole race. Of the 17 competitors, pre-race data were collected from 13 participants (12 males and 1 female (M±SD) : age: 40. 1 ± 8. 9 years; weight 83. 9 ± 10. 3 kg; and body fat percentage: 21. 9 ± 3. 8 %). Dietary recall, body composition and <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> were assessed pre-race, midway checkpoint and end race. Data were compared on the basis of fast finishers (the Norwegian team (n= 3) who won in a record of 14 day) and slower finishers (the remaining teams (n= 10) reaching the South Pole between 22 and 28 days). Results: The percentage contribution of macronutrients to daily energy intake for all participants was as follows: carbohydrate (CHO) - 23. 7 % (221 ± 82 g. day- 1), fat = 60. 6 % (251 ± 127 g. day- 1) and protein = 15. 7 % (117 ± 52 g. day- 1). Energy demands were closer met by faster finishers compared to slower finishers (5, 332 ± 469 vs. 3, 048 ± 1, 140 kcal. day- 1, p= 0. 02). Average reduction in body mass throughout the race was 8. 3 ± 5. 5 kg, with an average loss of lean mass of 2. 0 ± 4. 1 kg. There as a significant negative correlation between changes in lean mass and protein intake (p= 0. 03), and lean mass and energy intake (p= 0. 03). End-race <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> was significantly elevated for faster finishers compared to slower finishers and control volunteers (faster finishers: 933 ± 157 mOsmol.

40|$|Introduction: Diabetes melitus (DM) and {{hypertension}} are {{the most}} frequent causes of kidney function damage. Many different tests are developed to detect reversible functional kidney changes (detection of microalbuminuria and selective urinary enzymes). Objective The aim of our {{study was to examine}} tubular kidney function in type 2 DM patients with different proteinuria levels, and to compare these results with healthy people. Method The patients with type 2 DM and creatinine clearance > 80 ml/min were included in the study. According to the levels of proteinuria, the patients were classified in three groups: group I - patients with proteinuria 20 mg/ 24 h; and group III- the patients with proteinuria > 300 mg/ 24 h. The control group consisted of healthy subjects. Results The study revealed that in type 2 DM patients and normal global kidney function, fractional excretions of sodium, potassium, and phosphates as well as renal phosphate concentrations were not adequately sensitive markers to detect damage in tubular kidney function in DM. There were some changes of urate fractional excretion in these patients: this value was significantly lower in patients with microalbuminuria compared with those with proteinuria > 300 mg/ 24 h, {{as well as in the}} control group (p< 0. 05).

40|$|In hypovolemic hyponatremia, {{there is}} {{decrease}} in both total body sodium and water leading to ECF volume depletion with consequent AVP release and decreased solute-free water excretion. Clinically the patient will have tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension {{and loss of}} skin turgor. Causes of hypovolemic hyponatremia can be further classified into extrarenal and renal causes. Extrarenal causes include vomiting, diarrhea, burns, peritonitis and pancreatitis etc. Renal causes include use of thiazide diuretics, mineralocorticoid deficiency and salt wasting nephritis. Extrarenal and renal causes can be differentiated {{with the help of}} estimating urinary sodium; if urinary sodium is less than 10 mmol/L, then this point toward an extrarenal cause and if urinary sodium is more than 20 mmol/L, it points toward a renal etiology of hyponatremia. Prototype example of euvolemic hyponatremia is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH); in this syndrome, there is hyponatremia along with hypo-osmolarity; physical examination did not show any signs of dehydration or fluid overload; <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> is more than 100 mOsm/L and urinary sodium is more than 25 mmol/L.

Causes of hypervolemic hyponatremia include cardiac failure, liver cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome. In these conditions decreased effective arterial blood volume leads to activation of renin angiotensin aldosterone (RAAS) system and increased AVP levels leading to retention fluid in excess to sodium.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred six men with nocturia aged ≥ 60 years underwent full-night polysomnography {{to determine whether they}} had OSAS. Blood count, standard chemistry panel, BNP, urinary ADH, urinary creatinine (u-Cre), and <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> were measured at 6 : 00 AM, and a frequency volume chart was recorded {{on the same day that}} polysomnography was performed. RESULTS: We evaluated 83 patients after excluding 18 with mild OSAS and 5 with nocturnal polyuria index < 0. 35. Participants with OSAS had higher apnea-hypopnea index (P <. 0001) than those without OSAS. Body mass index and systolic blood pressure were higher in OSAS patients than those in the control group. BNP was higher in the OSAS patients than in the control patients (48. 6 ± 41. 4 vs 30. 7 ± 31. 5; P =. 0006). On urinalysis, OSAS patients showed higher urinary sodium and u-Cre secretion than controls (24. 7 ± 11. 3 vs 16. 2 ± 5. 1; P <. 0001). Urine osmolarity was also higher in OSAS patients than in the control patients (616 ± 172 vs 516 ± 174; P =. 0285). There was no significant difference in urinary ADH and u-Cre (6. 7 ± 10. 4 vs 6. 8 ± 7. 8; P =. 3617) between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that older men with nocturnal polyuria and OSAS did not compensate their fluid imbalance presented with decreased secretion of ADH but increased BNP level. 博士（医学）・乙第 1349 号・平成 26 年 12 月 3 日Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Verify {{if there}} is any {{difference}} in sensitive and motor bladder response in the presence of solutions with different osmolarities, simulating physiological extremes of <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients (24 men and 9 women) with mean age of 46. 4 years (8 to 87 years) took part in this study. They were all subjected to 2 consecutive urodynamic examinations. In each exam, the vesical filling was accomplished by using a hyperosmolar (1000 mOsm/L) or hypo-osmolar (100 mOsm/L) sodium chloride solution in similar speed. The sequence in which each solution was instilled was determined by a double blind draw.

The mean age of those with detrusor hyperactivity was 45. 8 years, against 46. 9 for those without hyperactivity. The infusion of the hyperosmolar/hypo-osmolar solution generated the following results, when comparing patients without vs. with detrusor hyperactivity: initial sensation of vesical filling (mL) : 167. 5 / 159. 2 vs. 134. 9 / 157. 3 (p > 0. 05); volume of occurrence of the first involuntary bladder contraction (mL) : 163. 9 / 151. 9 (p > 0. 05); detrusor micturition pressure (cm H 2 O) : 24. 0 / 24. 4 vs. 13. 8 / 27. 5 (p > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The vesical filling with solutions simulating extreme urinary osmolarities, accomplished with similar speed and without previous identification, did not likewise alter the sensitive and motor urodynamic behavior in the current study.

40|$|Background: We have {{recently}} shown that in MCD 4 renal cells, cell surface AQP 2 expression in cells exposed to CaSR agonists {{was higher than}} in control cells and did not increase significantly in response to short term exposure to forskolin. Those findings were in line with data obtained in hypercalciuric subjects displaying at baseline significantly higher AQP 2 excretion and no significant increase in AQP 2 excretion and <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> after acute DDAVP administration compared to normocalciurics (Procino et al Plos One 2012). This indicates that CaSR-AQP 2 interplay represents an internal renal defense to mitigate the effects of rising of calcium during antidiuresis on the risk of calcium precipitation. Methods: Human wild-type CaSR (hCaSR-wt) and its constitutively active variants (hCaSR-R 990 G; hCaSR-N 124 K) were functionally expressed in renal HEK cells stably expressing hAQP 2. The N 124 K mutation is one of eight naturally occurring activating mutations in subjects with autosomal dominant hypocalcemia, whereas R 990 G is a gain-of- function of the CASR gene polymorphism. Western blotting analysis of a crude membrane fraction was performed using phospho-specific antibodies. Results: Compared to mock cells, pS 256 -AQP 2 abundance was significantly increased in cells expressing either the wt-CaSR or its activating variants. Of note, we also found {{a significant increase in}} pS 261 -AQP 2 in hCaSR-wt expressing cells compared to mock. Interestingly, the expression of pS 261 -AQP 2 was significantly higher in cells expressing the constitutively active CaSR variants with respect to wt-CaSR expressing cells. No change in the pS 269 was observed. Conclusions: Since previous data demonstrated that the amount of pS 261 significantly decreases in response to short-term vasopressin exposure, it can be speculated that the increase in pS 261 observed in cells expressing constitutively active CaSR variants might counteract the vasopressin response...|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Potential {{therapeutic}} {{interventions are}} being developed for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). A pivotal question will be when to initiate such treatment, and monitoring disease progression will thus become more important. Therefore, the prevalence of renal abnormalities in ADPKD at different ages was evaluated. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: Included were 103 prevalent ADPKD patients (Ravine criteria). Measured were mean arterial pressure (MAP), total renal volume (TRV), GFR, effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), renal vascular resistance (RVR), and filtration fraction (FF). Twenty-four-hour urine was collected. ADPKD patients were compared with age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Results: Patients and controls were subdivided into quartiles of age (median ages 28, 37, 42, and 52 years). Patients in the first quartile of age had almost the same GFR when compared with controls, but already a markedly decreased ERPF and an increased FF (GFR 117 +/- 32 versus 129 +/- 17 ml/min, ERPF 374 +/- 119 versus 527 +/- 83 ml/min, FF 32 % +/- 4 % versus 25 % +/- 2 %, and RVR 12 (10 to 16) versus 8 (7 to 8) dynes/cm(2), respectively). Young adult ADPKD patients also had higher 24 -hour urinary volumes, lower 24 -hour <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity,</b> and higher urinary albumin excretion (UAE) than healthy controls, although TRV in these young adult patients was modestly enlarged (median 1. 0 L). Conclusions: Already at young adult age, ADPKD patients have marked renal abnormalities, including a decreased ERPF and increased FF and UAE, despite modestly enlarged TRV and near-normal GFR. ERPF, FF, and UAE may thus be better markers for disease severity than GFR. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 5 : 1091 - 1098, 2010. doi: 10. 2215 /CJN. 0036011...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: it is {{accepted}} that menstruation has many features of inflammatory process. In menstruation, the complex events involving the inflammatory process lead the final tissue breakdown and bleeding; {{and they are}} orchestrated by specific molecular pathways, as well as hormones such as progesterone and estradiol. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the expression of cytokines excreted in the urine in both phases of the menstrual cycle in female football players in the city of São Paulo. Methods: 42 female football players were evaluated, with an average age of 18. 95 years (SD: 2. 77) with regular menstrual cycle for at least 2 years and without use of contraceptive hormone therapy; regular physical activity 5 times a week for 2 hours a day. Both, the study protocol and consent form had been approved by the UNIFESP-EPM Ethics Committee (nº 1604 / 10). The urine was collected at 4 moments: before the game (pré) and after the game (post) and in the two phases of the menstrual cycle: luteal and follicular; and stored at - 80 °C degrees. The cytokines IL- 15 and TNF-alfa were quantified by Elisa method. Statistics: the values were represented in medians and quartiles and compared through Wilcoxon test. The value of excretion of cytokines was standardized by <b>urinary</b> <b>osmolarity</b> for better homogeneity of samples. Results: the analysis of urine samples showed an increase of interleukin IL- 15 after the game (post) when compared to values before the game (pré) in the follicular phase (p 3 ̆c 0. 01) as well as in the luteal phase (p 3 ̆c 0. 003). Additionally, we observed an increase of TNF-alfa after the game (post) when compared with values before the game (pré) in the follicular phase (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Conclusion: our results of TNF-alfa may be associated to inflammatory cascade related to reproductive tract, which is regulated by cyclic form by the sex steroids and were an increase of NFkB induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this way, during the luteal phase the athlete has an inflammatory condition and the physical activity is not enough to promote an additional increase of this cytokine. Otherwise the results of IL- 15 suggests that this cytokine has a key role in normal pregnancy, is still elevated after the game probably due to its importance as a mechanism of protection of pregnancy and that even the effort of the game is not sufficient to alter this physiologic process...|$|E
