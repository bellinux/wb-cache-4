40|$|In {{the present}} study {{the use of the}} theory of {{critical}} distances (TCD) was extended to notched components subjected to torsional fatigue loading. Initially, using some basic solid-mechanics arguments, it was demonstrated that the reference stress to use for assessing notched components under torsional fatigue loading is the fully-reversed plain torsional fatigue limit. Secondly, some data sets taken from the literature were used to show that the characteristic material length constant under torsion is different from that under <b>uniaxial</b> <b>fatigue</b> loading. This experimental evidence was shown to be in agreement with several results of previously published investigations. Finally, the material cracking behaviour under pure torsional loading was reviewed, showing that the characteristic material length constant under cyclic shear stress cannot be easily calculated using linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) concepts (as can be done for <b>uniaxial</b> <b>fatigue</b> loading), mainly {{due to the lack of}} experimental data generated under Mode III loading. To overcome this problem, two different hypotheses were proposed: (i) that the critical distance under torsion is the same as that under <b>uniaxial</b> <b>fatigue</b> loading; (ii) that the critical distance under torsion can be calculated using an effective threshold value of the stress intensity factor which accounts for the experimental evidence that the torsional fatigue limit for a crack subjected to cyclic shear stress is determined by the non-propagation of Mode I branched cracks. Comparison with experimental data found in the literature showed that both of these hypotheses gave reasonable predictions of the fatigue limit, with hypothesis (ii) being somewhat better than hypothesis (i). This result is very useful, because it allows engineers engaged in fatigue assessment of real components to predict the effect of torsion, by using material constants derived from <b>uniaxial</b> <b>fatigue</b> tests and by simply post-processing information obtained from linear elastic FE models...|$|E

40|$|This paper summarises {{an attempt}} to study the high-cycle fatigue {{cracking}} behaviour in specimens of low carbon steel weakened by U-notches. The specimens were tested under <b>uniaxial</b> <b>fatigue</b> loading with a load ratio equal to 0. 1, and the considered Kt values, calculated {{with respect to the}} gross area, ranged from 3. 8 up to about 25. The generated crack paths were quite irregular showing a propagation occurring in alternate trans- and intra-crystalline mode: in many cases, this made difficult to unambiguously measure orientation and length of Stage 1 planes. In spite of these experimental difficulties, the observed material cracking behaviour seemed to suggest that a Stage 1 -like process could always be assumed to be representative of the crack initiation phenomenon, and this held true independently of the notch sharpness. In light of the fact that, at a mesoscopic level, crack initiations never occurred on material planes parallel to the notch bisector, we attempted to investigate whether it was possible to use a critical plane approach to estimate high-cycle fatigue damage in notched components under <b>uniaxial</b> <b>fatigue</b> loading. In more detail, the generated results have initially been re-analysed by using the Modified WoÂ¨ hler Curve Method re-interpreted in terms of the Theory of Critical Distances [Susmel L. A unifying approach to estimate the high-cycle fatigue strength of notched components subjected to both uniaxial and multiaxial cyclic loadings. Fatigue Fract Eng Mater Struct 2004; 27 : 391 â 411]. The accuracy in predicting the high-cycle fatigue behaviour of the considered multiaxial fatigue method was then compared to the accuracy of two other uniaxial approaches: the classical one by Smith and Miller [Smith RA, Miller KJ. Prediction of fatigue regimes in notched components. Int J Mech Sci 1978; 20 : 201 â 206] and the one recently proposed by Atzori and co-workers [Atzori B, Lazzarin P, Meneghetti G.
