25|$|Bitterness is {{the most}} {{sensitive}} of the tastes, and many perceive it as unpleasant, sharp, or disagreeable, but it is sometimes desirable and intentionally added via various bittering agents. Common bitter foods and beverages include coffee, <b>unsweetened</b> <b>cocoa,</b> South American mate, bitter gourd, olives, citrus peel, many plants in the Brassicaceae family, dandelion greens, wild chicory, and escarole. The ethanol in alcoholic beverages tastes bitter, as do the additional bitter ingredients found in some alcoholic beverages including hops in beer and orange in bitters. Quinine is also known for its bitter taste and is found in tonic water.|$|E

5000|$|Keemun (...) is {{a famous}} Chinese black tea. First {{produced}} in late 19th century, {{it quickly became}} popular in the West and is still used {{for a number of}} classic blends. It is a light tea with characteristic stone fruit and slightly smoky notes in the aroma and a gentle, malty, non-astringent taste reminiscent of <b>unsweetened</b> <b>cocoa.</b> Top varieties have orchid-like fragrance and additional floral notes in the flavor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Unsweetened</b> natural <b>cocoa</b> powder (UNCP) is a {{pulverized}} high-grade powder of compressed solid blocks {{which remains}} after extraction. Little scientific data is available concerning its safety {{despite the presence}} of potential toxic elements. Elemental composition in UNCP was analyzed with ED-XRF spectroscopy. Single oral high dose toxicity study was conducted on adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (150 [*]g) by the limit test method. One group received water and the test group 2000 [*]mg/kg UNCP. All animals were observed for 14 days and then euthanized for haematological, biochemical, and histopathological examinations. Thirty-eight (38) elements were found in UNCP. There was an increase in HDL cholesterol (p 0. 05), alkaline phosphatase (p 0. 05). Haematological changes were not significant. Histopathological analysis showed no toxic effect on the heart, liver, kidney, lungs, testis, and spleen. Intestinal erosion was observed in the test group. UNCP appears to be relatively safe when taken as a single oral high dose of 2000 [*]mg/kg b. w. t. in rats. Caution should however be exercised at high doses due to the high elemental content of copper and high possibility of intestinal lining erosion...|$|R
5000|$|Typical {{ingredients}} include flour, chocolate, <b>unsweetened</b> <b>cocoa,</b> sugar, vegetable oil, margarine or shortening, vanilla, {{salt and}} baking soda. Additional ingredients may include nuts, such as almonds and cashews, and carob. Some varieties are dusted with powdered sugar after being baked and cooled. Quick-preparation varieties may use cake mix and chocolate chips. [...] Additional varieties include fudge thumbprint and fudge sandwich cookies. Vegan versions of fudge cookies exist. Some varieties are prepared with rolled oats or breakfast cereal and boiled, rather than baked.|$|E

The Swiss confectioner hand manufactures over 200 varieties of confections and pastries. Its signature confections are Champagne Truffles, {{the first of its}} kind. [...] They are made with Dom Perignon champagne, butter cream, and surrounded by dark cream ganache made from 66% dark base chocolate.

5000|$|... "Life {{on board}} was tough. Breakfast {{consisted}} of one {{slice of bread}} and margarine washed down with 'cocoa flush' which had been prepared in the galley by dropping solid slabs of <b>cocoa,</b> <b>unsweetened,</b> in a cauldron of boiling water. The liquid was drawn off into kettles which were lowered to the mess decks where the boys drank it from basins. Cups were never seen on board! Dinner consisted of varieties of 'buzz'. There was pea buzz, Irish buzz and mystery buzz. Buzzes were neither soups nor stews but had the characteristics of both and were served in the same basins as the cocoa flush. A small pile of broken ship's biscuits was placed beside each plate. Boiled cod was the 'treat' on Fridays!" ...|$|R
40|$|Objective. This study {{investigated}} the elemental composition of <b>unsweetened</b> natural <b>cocoa</b> powder (UNCP), its effect on nitric oxide, and its hepatoprotective potential during simultaneous administration with high-dose artemether/lumefantrine (A/L). Method. Macro- and microelements in UNCP were analyzed with EDXRF spectroscopy. Thirty (30) male guinea-pigs were then divided into five groups. For groups 3 (low-dose), 4 (medium-dose), and 5 (high-dose), the animals received oral UNCP prophylactically for 14 days. Group 1 received distilled water (14 days) and group 2 A/L for the last 3 days (days 12 to 14). After euthanisation, biochemical and histopathological examinations were carried out in all groups. Results. Phytochemical analysis of UNCP showed the presence of saponins, flavonoids, tannins, and cardiac glycosides. Thirty-eight (38) macro- and microelements were found. UNCP produced significant decreases in ALT, ALP, GGT, and AST levels. A significant increase in total protein levels was observed during A/L+UNCP administration in comparison to 75 [*]mg/kg A/L group. Histopathological examinations buttressed the protective effects of cocoa administration. UNCP administration increased nitric oxide levels 149. 71 % (P< 0. 05) compared to controls. Conclusion. UNCP increases nitric oxide levels and has hepatoprotective potential during A/L administration. A high level of copper was observed which may be detrimental during high daily consumptions of UNCP...|$|R
5000|$|... "Cocoa powder" [...] is {{used for}} baking, and for {{drinking}} with added milk and sugar. There {{are two types of}} <b>unsweetened</b> <b>cocoa</b> powder: natural cocoa (like the sort produced by the Broma process), and Dutch-process cocoa. Both are made by pulverizing partially defatted chocolate liquor and removing nearly all the cocoa butter; Dutch-process cocoa is additionally processed with alkali to neutralize its natural acidity. Natural cocoa is light in colour and somewhat acidic with a strong chocolate flavor. Natural cocoa is commonly used in recipes that also use baking soda; as baking soda is an alkali, combining it with natural cocoa creates a leavening action that allows the batter to rise during baking. Dutch cocoa is slightly milder in taste, with a deeper and warmer colour than natural cocoa. Dutch-process cocoa is frequently used for chocolate drinks such as hot chocolate due to its ease in blending with liquids. However, Dutch processing destroys most of the flavonoids present in cocoa. In 2005 Hershey discontinued their pure Dutch-process European Style cocoa and replaced it with Special Dark, a blend of natural and Dutch-process cocoa.|$|E
5000|$|Devil's food cake is {{commonly}} a dense, rich chocolate cake, {{quite different from}} other chocolate cakes such as the German chocolate cake. It traditionally uses unsweetened chocolate baking squares in lieu of <b>unsweetened</b> <b>cocoa</b> powder. However, contemporary recipes typically use cocoa powder for its convenience over the more traditional chocolate baking squares. Also, because of its reduced amount of cocoa butter, cocoa powder has a more intense chocolate flavor than unsweetened chocolate. Moreover, coffee is frequently added as a liquid to enhance the chocolate flavor. Some recipes use hot or boiling water as the cake's main liquid, rather than milk. One of the more famous devil's food cake recipes, called [...] "The Vassar Devil," [...] was on the menu of the historic and now closed restaurant [...] "The Treasure Chest." [...] A competing recipe was the Wellesley Fudge Cake, which uses a half pound of unsweetened baking chocolate, four ounces for the cake itself and four ounces for the fudge frosting. Devil's food cake historically is baked as a layer cake. Its antithetical counterpart, the angel food cake, is a very light white cake that uses stiffly beaten egg whites and no dairy. However, the devil's food cake is most often paired with yellow vanilla cakes, and the two combined may create a Marble cake.|$|E
