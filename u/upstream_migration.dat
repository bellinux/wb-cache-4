500|$|Cutthroat trout require cold, clear, well-oxygenated, shallow rivers with gravel bottoms or cold, {{moderately}} deep lakes. Healthy stream-side vegetation {{that reduces}} siltation {{is typical of}} healthy cutthroat trout habitat and beaver ponds may provide refuge during periods of drought and over winter. Most populations stay in fresh water throughout their lives and are known as nonmigratory, stream-resident or riverine populations. The coastal cutthroat trout [...] is the only cutthroat trout subspecies to coevolve through its entire range with the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus). Portions of the westslope cutthroat trout's [...] range overlap with the Columbia River redband trout , {{but the majority of}} its native range is in headwater tributary streams above major waterfalls and other barriers to <b>upstream</b> <b>migration.</b> At least three subspecies are confined to isolated basins in the Great Basin and can tolerate saline or alkaline water.|$|E
500|$|The {{route and}} the {{environmental}} characteristics of Missouri River in the northern Great Plains states of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Montana have been significantly altered. The resultant changes to the Missouri River in the upper Great Plains from channelization and impoundment prevent <b>upstream</b> <b>migration.</b> The reduced water flow rates and sediment loads have brought {{an end to the}} seasonal flooding of the flood plains in the region. Since the construction of the Fort Peck Dam in Montana in 1937, and subsequent damming and channelization, the Missouri River has lost over 90% of its wetland and sandbar ecosystems. More than [...] of the Missouri River have been altered and only that stretch of the river above Fort Peck Reservoir in Montana remains relatively unchanged. These alterations of the river have had a detrimental impact on a number of native fish species. In the 13 U.S. states where the pallid sturgeon is found, only a few other fish species are listed as endangered. Although substantial efforts are being implemented to ensure the survival of this species, the rarity of self-sustaining populations of pallid sturgeon ensures that it will remain federally protected for many decades.|$|E
500|$|American {{paddlefish}} {{populations have}} declined dramatically, {{primarily as a}} result of overfishing and habitat destruction. [...] In 2004 they were listed as Vulnerable (VU A3de ver 3.1) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. [...] They are currently proposed for listing as VU 3de throughout their range {{as the result of a}} U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service assessment. [...] The assessment concluded that [...] "an overall population size reduction of at least 30% may occur within the next 10 years or three generations due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and the effects of introduced taxa, pollutants, competitors or parasites." [...] American paddlefish are filter-feeding pelagic fish that require large, free-flowing rivers with braided channels, backwater areas, oxbow lakes that are rich in zooplankton, and gravel bars for spawning. [...] Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the Missouri River have impounded large populations of American paddlefish, and blocked their <b>upstream</b> <b>migration</b> to spawning shoals. Channelization and groynes or wing dykes have caused the narrowing of rivers and altered flow, destroying crucial spawning and nursery habitat. [...] As a result, most impounded populations are not self-sustaining and must be stocked to maintain a viable sport fishery.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —We {{investigated}} {{the ability of}} otolith microchemistry to discriminate natal habitats of the splittail Pogonichthys macrolepidotus, a migratory cyprinid endemic to the San Francisco Estuary, California. Splittails are broadly distributed in the brackish and freshwater portions of the lower estuary and make long-distance <b>upstream</b> <b>migrations</b> during winter to rivers and floodplains for spawning. We found that the ratios of Sr: Ca and 87 Sr: 86 Sr in the otoliths (ascertained by laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry) of age- 0 fish collected from natal habitats significantly varied among four primary spawning rivers. Based on these two constituents, quadratic discriminant function analysis correctly classified 71 % of the fish to their natal rivers.

40|$|During a {{study period}} of 26 months, twenty trout (26. 0 - 57. 0 cm FL; 198 - 1, 685 g) were daily located from 16 to 466 {{days in a}} small stream of the Belgian Ardenne, the Aisne stream (tributary of the river Ourthe) in order to {{characterize}} their annual pattern of mobility. Daily movements were more frequent and longer during the spawning period (October-December) {{than at any other}} time of the year. <b>Upstream</b> <b>migrations</b> (max. : 25 km) generally occurred during October and the first fortnight of November and were triggered by a combination of Variations of water temperature and water level within a thermal range of 10 - 14 degrees C. Spawning activity (second fortnight of November until late December) took place in the Aisne stream (max. width : 10 m) or in its small tributaries. Trout surviving spawning undertook a fast (max. : 9, 200 m in 24 h) and precise post reproductive homing. From winter to summer, daily movements were shorter and mainly corresponded to changes of residences within a home range of which the size was proportional to the trout's size. In March and June, some trout made long <b>upstream</b> unidirectional <b>migrations</b> of which the biological signification is still unknown.

500|$|The {{most serious}} {{impact on the}} genetic purity of most {{cutthroat}} trout subspecies results from interspecific and intraspecific breeding resulting in hybrids that carry the genes of both parents. In inland populations, the introduction of rainbow trout from hatchery stocks have resulted in cutbow hybrids that continue to diminish the genetic purity of many cutthroat trout subspecies. The introduction of hatchery-raised Yellowstone cutthroat trout into native ranges of other cutthroat trout subspecies, particularly the westslope cutthroat trout, has resulted in intraspecific breeding and diminished genetic purity of the westslope subspecies. As such, populations of genetically pure westslope cutthroat trout are very rare and localized in streams above barriers to <b>upstream</b> <b>migrations</b> by introduced species.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been demonstrated that {{a large percentage of}} yearling Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha smolts released from a production-scale hatchery on the Yakima River display an underappreciated life history strategy. Instead of migrating to the ocean for long-term rearing and growth, males may instead undertake a short-term migration downstream, turn around, and migrate back upstream where they reproductively mature at age 2. Following local hatchery traditions, these fish are referred to as 2 ̆ 7 minijacks. 2 ̆ 7 We used information produced from (1) large-scale passive integrated transponder (PIT) -tagging programs at hatcheries in the Columbia and Snake River basins and (2) the installation of PIT tag detectors in the fish passage ladders built into dams on these rivers to investigate the occurrence, behavior, distribution, and origin of minijacks. A minijack was operationally defined as a fish detected in a ladder after 1 June in the same year it was released. Minijacks were found in every hatchery release group of more than 7, 500 PIT-tagged Chinook salmon smolts reported (2002, 13 groups; 2003, 15 groups). Minijack population <b>migration</b> <b>upstream</b> past Bonneville Dam peaked in late June and July. This lagged migrations of age- 4 adults (from the same populations) by approximately 2 months.

50|$|Historically, {{anadromous}} spawning runs of alewife, blueback herring, striped bass, and American shad and catadromous runs of American eel {{were common}} in the NYC/NJ harbor estuary.

40|$|Instream refuges {{are places}} where {{invertebrates}} persist during disturbances due to reduced adverse impacts. During droughts, low flows may be accompanied by elevated temperatures, and potential refuges including subsurface sediments and spring-fed headwaters are therefore characterized by hydrological and thermal stability. This study examined invertebrate use of benthic and interstitial habitats (analogous to the hyporheic zone) in a groundwater-dominated, perennial limnocrene spring during a supra-seasonal drought. Although exceptionally high air temperatures occurred as flow declined, environmental conditions in the spring were relatively stable, and refuge-seeking vertical migrations into interstitial habitats did not coincide with peak temperatures. However, maximum benthic abundance of two amphipods (Gammarus pulex and Crangonyx pseudogracilis) occurred shortly after the period of elevated temperatures. It is suggested that this temporary increase in the abundance of these mobile taxa reflected <b>upstream</b> <b>migrations</b> triggered {{by a combination of}} refuge-seeking behaviour and thermally-stimulated activity. In addition, the spring provided a passive refuge for many lotic invertebrate taxa. A conceptual model is presented, which illustrates the potential contribution of multiple refuges to invertebrate persistence in drought-impacted ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Removing small {{artificial}} {{barriers that}} hinder <b>upstream</b> <b>migrations</b> of fish {{is a major}} problem in riparian habitat restoration. Because of budgetary limitations, it is necessary to prioritize barrier removal and repair decisions.

We develop a novel decision-making approach, based on integer programming techniques, which optimizes repair and removal decisions. Results show based on real datasets of barrier culverts located in Washington State that scoring and ranking is over 25 % below the optimum on average and a full 100 % below in the worst case, producing no net habitat gain whatsoever. This is compared to a dynamic programming method that was able to find optimal solutions in less than a second, even for problems with up to several hundred variables, and a heuristic method, which found solutions with less than a 1 % average optimality gap in even less tim...|$|R
