While no television, {{magazine}} or tabloid representatives were present, several newspapers {{were invited to}} attend, and did, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Pittsburgh City Paper, which printed both a preview and an extensive review. When local television station KDKA-TV showed up, Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel. In November 2006 he gave a radio interview to Dublin's 98FM. Anthrocon still retains tight control over media access, {{not only to the}} convention grounds but to the membership, and has official policy that forbids <b>unmonitored</b> dealings with unauthorized members of the media.|$|E
5|$|Human {{activity}} {{once again}} threatened the amazon {{during the following}} years. In 2012, {{it was reported that}} the unsanctioned flight of light aircraft from adjacent islands was disrupting the reproductive and social behaviors of the species. Via Verde, a gas pipeline grid proposed by the Luis Fortuño administration, raised concerns among conservationists due to further deforestation of the regions where the birds feed. New conservation efforts have also begun during this timeframe. In 2011, a research team of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez sequenced the amazon's genome. On August 15, 2013, the discovery of non-assisted nests in the Río Abajo State Forest was announced. Experts considered this a sign of expansion, impliying that the reintroduced amazon population was fully adapting to wild life and was dispersing throughout the region. This was noted as a significant advance, since El Yunque is not an ideal habitat for the bird due to its humidity, which precipitates sickness in some of the individuals. This was accompanied by a second announcement, which noted that added to the known number of amazons in the wild (fluctuating between 64 and 112 specimens) there is an <b>unmonitored</b> population of approximately 50 birds dispersed throughout Puerto Rico.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{assessed}} the sicklefin lemon shark globally as Vulnerable; it is harvested using anchored and floating gillnets, beach nets, and longlines. The meat is sold fresh or dried and salted for human consumption, the fins used for shark fin soup, and the liver oil is processed for vitamins. The sicklefin lemon shark is highly susceptible to local overfishing, {{due to its}} slow reproductive rate and limited movements. Off Southeast Asia, this shark has become scarce {{under the pressure of}} expanding, <b>unmonitored,</b> and unregulated fisheries, and has been assessed there as Endangered by the IUCN. Widespread habitat degradation, including pollution and blast fishing on coral reefs and deforestation in mangroves, poses an additional threat to the survival of this species in the region. Already, the sicklefin lemon shark has been extirpated in parts of India and Thailand, and has not been reported from Indonesian markets in recent years despite being historically abundant there. Off Australia, the sicklefin lemon shark is taken in only small numbers intentionally and as bycatch, and has been listed under Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|The State of New Jersey {{instituted a}} cash meal {{allowance}} for its state {{police officers in}} July 1949. Before that, troopers were provided a mid-shift meal at one of several meal stations located throughout the State. The State had decided that this system was unsatisfactory, as it required troopers to leave their patrol areas unattended for extended periods of time. The new system provided troopers with a cash allowance, which troopers could use to purchase a meal at a location within their patrol area, thus making it unnecessary for them to leave the area <b>unmonitored.</b>|$|E
25|$|New York City Police Commissioner Julius Enderby is {{secretly}} {{a member}} of the Medievalists, a subversive anti-robot group which pines for the 'olden days' where men did not live in the 'caves of steel'. He uses his position to engineer meetings with Spacer Dr. Sarton under the guise of further cooperation, but he actually intends to destroy R. Daneel - who lives with and resembles Dr. Sarton. Enderby orders R. Sammy to bring a blaster through the <b>unmonitored</b> 'open air' (something that no Earthman could countenance), but {{in the heat of the}} moment Enderby drops his glasses and fails to distinguish between the human and robot, accidentally shooting the human. Knowing that Baley's wife is also a Medievalist, he assigns Baley to the case, working with R. Daneel who represents the Spacers, and spreads a rumour about humanoid robots amongst the subversives to throw suspicion on Baley when Enderby later destroys R. Sammy with radiation. Furthermore, Daneel rules out Enderby as the murderer as his brain patterns show him incapable of deliberately killing.|$|E

[...] He immediately accused the Army of using the TOT as an <b>unmonitored</b> slush fund. [...] He claimed that an unnamed Army unit had requested that TOT buy it 800 million baht worth of electronic equipment. [...] Upon receiving the request, Vuthipong demanded to know why neither the Army nor the Defence Ministry used their own secret budgets to purchase the equipment, and why an internal Army unit, rather than the Kingdom's main national security organisations, had made the request. [...] Saprang denied {{that there was any}} lack of transparency in the request for financial support. [...] Vuthipong claimed that the equipment should only have cost 30 million baht, not 800 million baht. [...] He was fired and expelled from the Board soon after refusing to sign off on the deal. [...] The Board later appointed Col. Natee Sukolrat as the new TOT President and accepted the army's donation request.|$|E
500|$|Major [...] Adam Foley of the 64 Headquarters and Support Squadron, 28 Engineer Regiment of the Royal Engineers was {{appointed}} to be the project designer. [...] The project {{was the first of}} its kind to be undertaken in Afghanistan and was allocated a budget of £3.5million. [...] The road designed was [...] long and [...] wide. [...] One design constraint was that the patrol bases had to be able to see straight along the route to prevent insurgents gaining <b>unmonitored</b> access to the road. [...] Another factor was a [...] wide wadi known as the Suf Mandah that consisted of two water bearing channels. [...] This provided agricultural irrigation for the local people and so could not be interrupted during construction because of its economic importance. [...] The design for this section included a floating roadway over the waterlogged ground and two box culverts for the irrigation channels. [...] The 17smaller culverts along the route were made from reinforced concrete and stone gabions. [...] The road itself was designed to be of unbound aggregate that could in the future be overlain with an asphalt surfacing.|$|E
500|$|In Island of Lost Souls (1932), an {{adaptation}} of H. G. Wells' science-fiction novel, The Island of Doctor Moreau, Charles Laughton plays yet another mad scientist with a God complex. As Moreau, Laughton creates a mad scientist's island paradise, an <b>unmonitored</b> haven where he is free to create a race of man-beasts and Lota, a beast-woman he wants to mate with a normal human male. A castaway lands on his island, providing him {{an opportunity to see}} how far his science experiment, the barely clothed, attractive Lota, has come. The castaway discovers Moreau vivisecting one of the beast-men and attempts to leave the island. He runs into the camp of the man-beasts and Moreau beats them back with a whip. The film ends with Lota dead, the castaway rescued, and the man-beasts chanting, [...] "Are we not men?" [...] as they attack and then vivisect Moreau. The film has been described as [...] "a rich man's Freaks" [...] due to its esteemed source material. Wells, however, despised the movie for its lurid excesses. It was rejected by 14 local censor boards in the United States, and considered [...] "against nature" [...] in Great Britain, where it was banned until 1958.|$|E

2500|$|An {{increase}} in cerebral water content is called cerebral edema and it usually results from {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), subdural hematoma, ischemic stroke, brain tumors, infectious disorders and intracranial surgery. Cerebral edema may result in compromised regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP) gradients {{which could lead to}} death of the affected. Increased ICP leads to increased intracranial volume. <b>Unmonitored</b> ICP leads to brain damage by global hypoxic ischemic injury due to reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) which is found by [...] subtracting the ICP from mean arterial pressure(MAP), cerebral blood flow, and mechanical compression of brain tissue due to compartmentalized ICP gradients.|$|E

The <b>unmonitored</b> entrance created security problems, including reports of drug dealers {{in front of the}} facility. Injured soldiers stated they were forced to [...] "pull guard duty" [...] to have some level of security. In an attempt to alleviate the toll that Building 18's condition was taking on the wounded soldiers, a staff team headed by a clinical social worker at WRAMC obtained a grant of $30,000 from the Commander's Initiative Account for improvements; however, [...] "a Psychiatry Department functionary held {{up the rest of the}} money because she feared that buying a lot of recreational equipment close to Christmas would trigger an audit."

Arrested for assaulting a police officer, public disorder and theft of a passport—which was actually his own—he was then placed face-down with his legs bent behind him in the caged rear section of a police van and transported to Brixton police station. During the journey [...] "his {{mental and physical health}} deteriorated" [...] and he was [...] "extremely unwell and not fully conscious" [...] when eventually taken out of the van. This followed a delay of ten minutes during which he was left handcuffed in a 'rear stack' position, unattended and <b>unmonitored</b> while the van sat outside the station in the car parking area. One of the arresting officers was captured on the station's CCTV claiming that Rigg was [...] "faking it".|$|E
2500|$|Sleeping Beauty {{was made}} while Walt Disney was {{building}} Disneyland (hence the six-year production time). To help promote the film, Imagineers named the park's icon [...] "Sleeping Beauty Castle" [...] (it was originally to be Snow White's). An indoor walk-through exhibit {{was added to}} the empty castle interior in 1957, where guests could walk through the castle, up and over the castle entrance, viewing [...] "Story Moment" [...] dioramas of scenes from the film, which were improved with animated figurines in 1977. It closed shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, supposedly because the dark, <b>unmonitored</b> corridors were a risk. After being closed for seven years, the exhibit space underwent extensive refurbishment to restore the original 1957 displays, and reopened to guests on November 27, 2008. Accommodations were also made on the ground floor with a [...] "virtual" [...] version for disabled guests unable to navigate stairs. Hong Kong Disneyland opened in 2005, also with a Sleeping Beauty Castle, nearly replicating Disneyland's original design.|$|E
2500|$|He {{began to}} {{question}} his devotion to the organization in 2004, after an encounter with actor and Scientologist Tom Cruise at the annual International Association of Scientologists Gala Ball where Cruise was described as [...] "the most dedicated Scientologist," [...] Duignan felt hurt that {{he was working for}} between five and fifteen pounds per week under difficult conditions, but was not seen to be as dedicated to the organization as Cruise. Duignan then began to research Scientology on the Internet, which he had been forbidden to do inside the organization. He told Scientology management officials that he had to leave for a week to visit his dying uncle, in order to get permission to go back to Ireland. He left and later traveled to Dublin and then returned to his native County Cork, where he is studying for an arts degree. He currently regards Scientology as [...] "unlicensed and <b>unmonitored</b> psychotherapy". In an interview on Phantom FM radio, Duignan said that [...] "the readjustment after it has been tremendously difficult".|$|E
2500|$|Hanson {{has also}} been {{consistently}} critical of unchecked and <b>unmonitored</b> illegal immigration into the United States from Mexico and the Central American republics, which he sees as threatening to overwhelm the United States with millions of Spanish-speakers who make assimilation difficult and some of whom he charges have criminal records and do not establish a record of work history. In a 2014 column [...] "1984 Redux: Orwellian Illegal Immigration" [...] Hanson wrote that Hispanic groups that use the name La Raza are racialists who have [...] "hijacked" [...] America's immigration policy to permit non-diverse, illegal, and unrestricted illegal immigration into the United States to further demographically-based political agendas, and who have made often false claims of suffering continual racial prejudice from a supposed prejudiced white majority, while arguing that Latinos as members of La Raza should keep themselves separate {{from the rest of}} Americans. Hanson has condemned groups such as the National Council of La Raza as he argued that term La Raza has an unfortunate history as a [...] "racialist term," [...] whose origins he claims go back to fascist Spain of General Francisco Franco and Benito Mussolini's fascist Italy, and those Mexican-American leaders who self-identify with the Francoist term La Raza are themselves guilty of operating as racial separatists. In this regard, Hanson has voiced qualified support for Donald Trump's plans to deport illegal immigrants from the United States, after offering a chance for green card residence to those who were vetted and found to have no criminal record, no history of public support, and residence of some duration. Blanket deportation policy, Hanson argued, would be as [...] "unworkable", as is the present open-borders status quo.|$|E
