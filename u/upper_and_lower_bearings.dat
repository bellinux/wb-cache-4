30|$|Similarly, it {{is worth}} {{explaining}} why the gravity-based recentering mechanism of the RNC isolator is unique {{and it is not}} traditional. The integrated passive recentering mechanism of the RNC isolator can provide gravity-based recentering force without generating any undesired side effects. Several available traditional isolation devices [such as springs, elliptical and friction pendulum systems (FPS)] can provide some recentering forces but they are always accompanied by the generation of vertical accelerations out from the horizontal acceleration components, which leads to additional vertical vibration of structural elements, housed inner equipment and occupants discomfort. Moreover, the configurations that provide such recentering forces in elliptical and FPS isolation systems force the isolated structure to oscillate as a simple pendulum with a single vibration period, which may be close to the dominant period of the exciting earthquake causing resonance unlike the RNC isolator. In the RNC isolator, although the rolling core is ellipsoidal to provide adequate eccentricity for gravity-based recentering, the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> plates are provided with carefully designed inner curvatures (facing the rolling core) to exactly absorb any generated vertical displacement that arises from rolling of the elliptical core. This always keeps the vertical offset between the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> plates unchanged during the RNC isolator motion, which theoretically prevents the generation of vertical motion component out from the horizontal one, leading to a unique recentering behavior of the RNC isolator.|$|R

The annual wear rate of the phase- 2 bearings (mean 0. 022 mm/year) was significantly less (p = 0. 01) than that of phase- 1 bearings (mean 0. 07 mm/year). The linear wear rate of the Oxford UKR remains very low into the third decade. We believe that phase- 2 <b>bearings</b> had <b>lower</b> wear rates than phase- 1 implants because of the improved bearing design and surgical technique which decreased the incidence of impingement.

5000|$|A {{relatively}} recent development, integrated headsets {{do away with}} the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> cups on threadless headsets and instead seat the bearings directly against the head tube of the frame. Favored sometimes for their aesthetic appeal, integrated headsets reduce the number of parts involved in the headset assembly. Prominent standards for integrated headsets include Cane Creek's [...] "IS" [...] and Campagnolo's standard, which is nameless apart from the manufacturer name. Chris King, a leading headset manufacturer, offers a vehement argument against the implementation of integrated headsets. The basis of King's argument is that headtubes with bearing [...] "seats" [...] are far from being machined with reasonable precision. The headset cartridge bearings therefore sit somewhat loosely in the headtube of the bicycle (as opposed to being press fit). During use, the bearings, under thrust loads, will rock in their seats and will easily damage the softer frame material (often aluminum, although some titanium frames are manufactured for integrated headsets). Given enough damage to the frame, there would be no choice but to replace the frame, especially if the frame is made of an aluminum alloy (titanium and steel can potentially be repaired, but usually at great cost to the consumer).King also argues that the integrated headset is largely a cost-cutting measure for many of the larger bicycle manufacturers, since integrated headsets are somewhat cheaper and take less time to install.|$|R
40|$|Tubular {{systems are}} {{proposed}} {{to be used}} as energy absorber because they are cheap and easy to manufacture; recently some researchers use the elliptical tube as energy absorber. In this work, the influence of elliptical ratio (r =D 1 /D 2) on energy absorption capability and load carrying capacity and stress of mild steel elliptical tubes has been investigated both experimentally and numerically, the experimental analyses conducted by using Zwick Type BT 1 -FB 050 TN testing instrument. This machine is universal instrument for performing tensile test and compression test, Fig (1) and bending test and it is consider as an important machine for measuring the mechanical properties of materials and structures. The loading frame consist of two vertical lead screws, a moving crosshead <b>and</b> an <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> plate which bears the load of the lead screws. The maximum capacity of the loading frame attached to the table mounted unit is 50 KN In this study a velocity between 310 mm/min was applied to the moving component to ensure the quasistatic conditions whereas velocities between 0. 5 mm/min and 15 mm/min have been used by many researchers to simulate the quasi-static lateral compression of tubes between various indenters [1 - 2]. In addition to the experimental work, computational method using ANSYS is used to predict the loading and response of such tubes where series of models was performed with elliptical ratios ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 5. Comparison of numerical and experimental forcedeflection response is presented. It has been found that with changing the elliptical ratio of the tube the loaddeflection curve change and this leads to change the energy absorbed by tube, the changing of the geometrical shape of the tube leads to change the volume of this tube and hence the mass. By reducing the elliptical ratio to 0. 5 the tube will absorb 43. 3 % more energy and the system will gain 102 % more in terms of specific energy, fig (2) ...|$|R
40|$|Rotary {{steerable}} {{drilling tool}} systems (RSS) {{are ideal for}} tool integrating downhole automation control and drilling technology, which are used for drilling directional and complex track wells. A simply supported beam model is generally used to research bit side force for point-the-bit RSS tools. The greatest advantage is simplification {{in the analysis of}} the bit side force. However, for the side force solution on a point to the bit conditions, the existing literature ignore that this drilling tool system has an outward extended distance. Otherwise the bit in contact with the well wall will form a new support. According to the situation, a point to the bit tool has an outward extended distance; if we ignore this extended distance, and simplify it or just take it as the reaction force of the tool <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> support, or side force of the bit a great inaccuracy error will result. Because the beam has an outward extended distance related to the real bit side force, we need more research in this area. Using to the principle of minimum complementary energy, we can explore the mechanical properties of rotary steerable tools. The rotary steerable tool mandrel force model is based on the mandrel and the rotary steering drilling tool which has three supports; <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>and</b> continuous beam model bit. The coordinate system is built in accordance with axial line of orienting rotary steerable drilling tool. The conclusions from the theory analysis and project example calculation in this paper indicate: RSS technology is a powerful tool for oil exploration and development. It effectively solves technical difficulties in oil and gas exploration and development. Particularly, with regard to higher productivity and fewer drilling risks and downhole accidents with more exposed reservoirs, it delivers excellent performance. A basic theoretical study of a rotary steering tool system helps us further master the mechanical characteristics of the tool system from the angle of mechanical behavior and features of the tool. In combination with different whipstocking operation principles, we have established different mechanical models to solve the mechanical property parameters, then we can assess the mechanical properties of the RSS...|$|R
30|$|Recently, the Roll-N-Cage (RNC) {{isolator}} {{has been}} proposed (Ismail 2009; Ismail et al. 2008, 2009 b, 2010) as an attempt of improvement, see Figs. 1 and 2. It is a rolling-based isolation system to achieve the maximum possible structure–ground decoupling and, therefore, minimizes the seismic force transfer. It is designed to achieve a balance in controlling isolator displacement demands and structural accelerations. It provides in a single unit all the necessary functions of vertical rigid support, horizontal flexibility with enhanced stability, hysteretic energy dissipation and resistance to minor vibration loads. Although the rolling core is quasi-ellipsoidal, the RNC isolator generates no vertical fluctuation of isolated structure during motion due to the inner curvatures of the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> plates. Moreover, the RNC isolator is distinguished by two unique features: (1) a self-braking (buffer) mechanism to limit the isolator displacement under severe seismic excitations to a preset value by the designer, as shown in Fig. 3 and (2) a linear gravity-based self-recentering mechanism that prevents residual displacement after earthquakes, as shown in Fig. 4. Such recentering mechanism {{is a result of}} adopting a quasi-ellipsoidal shape of the rolling core. Besides the rolling-based motion mechanism, which requires less lateral forces to initiate and maintain high degree of structure–ground decoupling compared to other motion mechanisms of the elastomeric-based and friction-based isolation systems, the RNC isolator is provided with a perfect design advantage to get the most benefit of that rolling-based motion mechanism. Such design advantage is the independency of both vertical bearing mechanism and the mechanism that provides lateral pre-yield stiffness against minor vibration loads. This independency allows for accurate tuning of the initial pre-yield stiffness to permit the commencement of the seismic isolation process, or decoupling, just after the seismic forces exceed the maximum limit of minor vibration loads, contrary to the available isolation systems. The RNC isolator can be available in different other forms to suit the structure or object to be protected, see Fig. 2 a and b. More detailed description and thorough treatment of the RNC isolator are found in Ismail (2009) reference.|$|R

The negative influence of significant amount of pith, or parenchymatous tissue, present in sugarcane bagasse is discussed.

A brief historical review in the development of bagasse depithers and depithing systems is presented in this paper. Further results in the development of depither, named S. M.

40|$|Some {{primarily}} aquatic vertebrates make brief forays onto land, creating traces as they do. A lack {{of studies}} on aquatic trackmakers {{raises the possibility that}} such traces may be ignored or misidentified in the fossil record. Several terrestrial Actinopterygian and Sarcopterygian species have previously been proposed as possible models for ancestral tetrapod locomotion, despite extant fishes being quite distinct from Devonian fishes, both morphologically and phylogenetically. Although locomotion has been well-studied in some of these taxa, trackway production has not. We recorded terrestrial locomotion of a 35 cm African lungfish (Protopterus annectens; Dipnoi: Sarcopterygii) on compliant sediment. Terrestrial movement in the lungfish is accomplished by planting the head and then pivoting the trunk. Impressions are formed where the head impacts the substrate, while the body and fins produce few traces. The head leaves a series of alternating left-right impressions, where each impact can appear as two separate semi-circular impressions created by the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> jaws, <b>bearing</b> some similarity to fossil traces interpreted as footprints. Further studies of trackways of extant terrestrial fishes are necessary to understand the behavioural repertoire that may be represented in the fossil track record...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. - In the Bigadiç volcano-sedimentary basin, Palaeozoic-Mesozoic {{basement}} {{rocks are}} overlain unconformably by the Miocene rock units. The straligraphic sequence of Miocene units, {{from the bottom}} to the top in ascending order is, basement volcanic unit, basement limestone unit, lower tuff unit, <b>lower</b> borate <b>bearing</b> unit, upper tuff unit, upper borate bearing unit, and basalt unit. Miocene units are over-lain unconformably by the recent sediments, and alluvium rests unconformably on the recent sediments. In the region, Palaeozoic and Meso-zoic basement rocks were subjected to block faulting and dislocation during the pre-Miocene. As {{a result of these}} movements, large and small sized several playa lake type sedimentation basins were formed, and Miocene sediments were deposited in these basins. In the study area, the general strike of the fold axis is NE-SW. Beds generally dip towards MW or SE with 5 °- 35 °. Borate deposits occur as two different horizons in the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> borate <b>bearing</b> units, which are separated from each other by the upper tuff unit. In the region, the <b>lower</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> borate zones show thickness varying between 35 - 130 meters and 20 - 110 meters, respectively. Boron ores are alternated with clay-stone, mudstone, tuff and thin-bedded limestone, and generally exhibit lenticular structures. Colemanite and ulexite are the dominant ore minerals in both of the ore zones. In addition to these, other boron minerals such as pandermite, probertite, howlite, tunellite, meyerhoffente, hydroboracite and inyoite have also been determined in the basin. Colemanite in the <b>lower</b> <b>and</b> <b>upper</b> borate zones have possibly precipitated directly from the solutions contemporaneous with sedimentation, within the unconsolidated sediments under the sediment/water interface.

40|$|Main and {{connecting}} rod bearings along the crankshaft in a heavy-duty engine oil system requires efficient feed of oil flow to ensure the performance of lubrication, cooling and cleaning. The bearings and builded bearing models considered in this work {{are based on a}} Volvo 13 L engine. Two main models to predict the oil flow in main {{and connecting}} rod bearings have been investigated using the system analysis software GT-SUITE. These two models are based on two numerical methods called  the Mobility method and the Reynold's equation respectively. The main bearing and the connecting rod large end bearing loads calculated in the present work is similar to the reference bearing loads, especially for connecting rod large end <b>bearing</b> <b>and</b> at <b>lower</b> engine speeds. For higher engine speeds, the present load results are far off,  compared to the reference load results. This difference at the higher engine speeds showed also an increased difference in the oil volume flow rates. But more information regarding the calculations of the reference loads is needed to analyze the differences further. Considering the "split lines", where the <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> the <b>lower</b> <b>bearing</b> shell meet, in the bearing models increased the oil volume flow rate with 13. 3 % on average for the main bearing. Main bearing stand for 86 % of the total flow whilst connecting rod large end and small end bearing stand for the rest 13 % and 1 % of the total flow. The feed of oil to main bearing and connecting rod large end bearing appears continuously whilst the feed of oil to connecting rod small end bearing appears {{in the form of a}} few pulsations. Comparing to the numerical reference flow results, the results in this work are similar at high oil temperatures and at low engine speeds, otherwise the results are far off. Considering the Reynold's equation when predicting the oil volume flow rates in plain journal bearings is a more accurate way than using the Mobility method since it takes more specific geometrical irregularities into account. The oil volume flow rate for main bearing differ with 2. 7 % on average when solving the Reynold's equation compared to the Mobility method...|$|R

However, only a few quantitative studies have been performed to compare <b>upper</b> <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> extremity weight <b>bearing.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate forearm and foot weight bearing using a FWW-AR and the effect of the armrest height. Methods: Eleven elderly women (mean age 80. 1 ± 5. 3 years; mean height 148. 5 ± 4. 0 cm; mean weight 51. 2 ± 9. 0 kg) were enrolled. The subjects walked with an FWW-AR, with the elbow in either 90 degree (D 90) or 130 degree (D 130) flexion, for a distance of 10 m. Surface electromyographic signals were recorded for the <b>upper,</b> middle, <b>and</b> <b>lower</b> trapezius, anterior deltoid, and erector spinae muscles; walking velocity was measured with the subjects weight bearing on their feet and forearms while walking. Simultaneously, the maximum plantar and forearm loads during walking with an FWW-AR were measured. Results: The normalized foot plantar loads were lower at D 90 than at D 130, while the normalized forearm load was higher at D 90 than at D 130 (all P< 0. 05; left foot, 7. 9 ± 0. 1 N/kg versus 8. 8 ± 0. 1 N/kg; right foot, 8. 6 ± 0. 2 N/kg versus. 9. 6 ± 0. 1 N/kg; left forearm, 1. 8 ± 0. 5 N/kg versus 0. 8 ± 0. 2 N/kg; and right forearm, 2. 0 ± 0. 5 N/kg versus 1. 0 ± 0. 2 N/kg, respectively). The surface electromyographic activity of the muscles involved in shoulder elevation and the walking velocity were both lower with the elbow at D 90 than at D 130 (all P< 0. 05; left upper trapezius, 98. 7 %± 19. 5 % versus 132. 6 %± 16. 9 %; right upper trapezius, 83. 4 %± 10. 6 % versus 108. 1 %± 10. 5 %; left anterior deltoid, 94. 1 %± 12. 8 % versus 158. 6 %± 40. 4 %; right anterior deltoid, 99. 1 %± 15. 0 % versus 151. 9 %± 19. 4 %; and velocity, 0. 6 ± 0. 1 m/sec versus 0. 7 ± 0. 1 m/sec, respectively).
