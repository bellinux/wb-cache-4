25|$|The {{common clay}} {{minerals}} are montmorillonite or smectite, illite, and kaolinite or kaolin. These minerals tend {{to form in}} sheet or plate like structures, with length typically ranging between 10−7m and 4x10−6m and thickness typically ranging between 10−9m and 2x10−6m, {{and they have a}} relatively large specific surface area. The specific surface area (SSA) is defined as the ratio of the surface area of particles to the mass of the particles. Clay minerals typically have specific surface areas in the range of 10 to 1,000 square meters per gram of solid. Due to the large surface area available for chemical, electrostatic, and van der Waals interaction, the mechanical behavior of clay minerals is very sensitive to the amount of pore fluid available and the type and amount of dissolved ions in the pore fluid. To anticipate the effect of clay on the way a soil will behave, it is necessary to know the kinds of clays as well as the amount present. As home builders and highway engineers know all too well, soils containing certain high-activity clays make very <b>unstable</b> <b>material</b> on which to build because they swell when wet and shrink when dry. This shrink-and-swell action can easily crack foundations and cause retaining walls to collapse. These clays also become extremely sticky and difficult to work with when they are wet. In contrast, low-activity clays, formed under different conditions, can be very stable and easy to work with.|$|E

50|$|Although kinetic isotope effect {{measurements}} at natural abundance are {{a powerful}} tool for understanding reaction mechanisms, the amounts of material required for analysis can make this technique inaccessible for reactions that employ expensive reagents or <b>unstable</b> starting <b>materials.</b> In order to mitigate these limitations, Jacobsen and coworkers developed 1H to 13C polarization transfer as a means to reduce the time and material required for kinetic isotope effect measurements at natural abundance. The distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT) takes advantage of the larger gyromagnetic ratio of 1H over 13C to theoretically improve measurement sensitivity by a factor of 4 or decrease experiment time by a factor of 16. This method for natural abundance kinetic isotope measurement is favorable for analysis for reactions containing <b>unstable</b> starting <b>materials,</b> and catalysts or products that are relatively costly.|$|R

The characterization of different materials {{is an important part}} in thermoelectric materials research to improve their properties. Usually, different methods and setups are combined for the temperature dependent determination of all thermoelectric key quantities - Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. Here, we present a measurement system for the simultaneous determination of all of these quantities plus the direct determination of the figure of merit by means of the Harman method (zT) (H) in a temperature range from room temperature up to 600 K. A simultaneous measurement saves time and reduces the measurement error, and the change of all material properties can be monitored even for <b>unstable</b> <b>materials.</b> Thermal conductivity measurements are inherently affected by undesired thermal losses, in particular, through radiation at higher temperatures. We show a simple experimental approach to measure radiation losses and correct for those. Comparative measurements on traditional systems show good agreement for all measured quantities.

The failure of two dams is discussed briefly. The problem of fault rupture as a hazard in its own right, apart from the associated generation of strong ground motion, is treated from the points of view both of faulting mechanics and also the effect of the displacements on structures. Methods of analysis including the finite element and finite difference techniques are considered with respect to the examination of failures.

Commercially available diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA), triallylisocyanurate (TAIC) and pentaerythritol tetrakis (3 -mercaptopropionate) (PETMP) were combined to produce tailored materials with a 75, 50 and 25 % of thiol-ene/thiol-epoxy networks. A photoinitiator was used to trigger the radical thiol-ene polymerization and a latent amine precursor was used to start the base-catalyzed thiol-epoxy click reaction. Neat thiol-ene and thiol-epoxy materials were prepared and taken as the references. The use of a latent amine precursor in adequate proportion and under suitable reaction conditions allowed us to reach a dual system with two well-defined steps, stable intermediate materials and well-controlled structure after the first curing stage {{and at the end}} of the curing process.

Beginning in 1967, environmental resource managers and local fishers initiated a project to build an artificial reef using banded, but unballasted, waste automobile and truck tires offshore Broward County, Florida, USA. Estimates {{of the number of}} tires placed offshore range between 1, 000, 000 – 2, 000, 000. Since deployment, storm events and ocean currents have caused the bands to give way and the break-up of the reef. Over the years, many tires have washed ashore onto recreational beach areas. Tires that remain in the water continue to move with wave action and currents. Many of these remaining tires have already been forced up against the offshore edge of natural reef with numbers at individual sites estimated in the 100, 0002 ̆ 7 s. The objectives of this project were to examine the feasibility of removing the tires as well as gain subjective insight into the impact of the tires on natural habitat. Sixteen hundred tires were removed from the reef edge and recycled. The potential problems arising from the use of tires in artificial reef construction were apparent. Natural reef fauna was broken and buried providing a seascape resembling a junkyard. The shortsighted use of <b>unstable</b> <b>material</b> to construct artificial reefs is an issue facing many coastal areas.

In this study the problem is considered geotechnical point of view where the geotechnical properties of failed Jamuna river embankment material and Padma riverbank material were investigated.

We assume that the propagation power follows an upward drifting Brownian motion between cascades, and drops discontinuously each time a cascade occurs. Cascades are described by a continuous state branching process with distributional properties determined by the value of the propagation power when they occur. In common with many cascading models, pure power law behaviour is exhibited at a critical level of propagation power, and the mean cascade size diverges. This divergence constrains large systems to the subcritical region. We show that as a result, crossover behaviour appears in the cascade distribution when an average is performed over the distribution of propagation power.

Metal-triazenide complexes are instantaneously formed upon addition of metal cations to trans-triazenes dissolved in aqueous solutions. For silver-triazenide and mercury-triazenide complexes, the metal-to-ligand ratios are 1 : 1 and 1 : 2, respectively. Unfortunately, target metal-triazenide complexes do not photoisomerize upon 355 nm laser excitation. Triazenes are also known to be <b>unstable</b> <b>materials</b> under acidic conditions.
