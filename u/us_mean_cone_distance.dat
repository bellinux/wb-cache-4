Further characterizations are given by means of conditional distributions, by characteristic functions and by the local structure of the model in terms of the tangent cone. The relations between two different nonparametric location models can be made explicit. We consider especially the total variation distance and the deficiency. Consequences of these results for the statistical analysis of models of this type will be discussed in a subsequent paper. location models characterizations tangent <b>cone</b> <b>distances</b> deficiency...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To compare ex vivo the {{penetration}} of three brands of gutta-percha cones, compacted under a constant force and heated to different temperatures, into artificial lateral canals. METHODOLOGY: Resin blocks with simulated main canals, each having two lateral canals (C at 6. 5 and A at 13 mm {{from the surface}} of the resin block), were selected. A gutta-percha cone, either Mynol MF, Hygenic MF or GT Tulsa 0. 04 was compacted into each main canal for 5 s using a wire rod with a diameter of 0. 7 mm soldered to the bottom of a metal cylinder, with a force of 2. 7 kg at controlled temperatures of 37, 42, 47, 52, 60 degrees C. The {{penetration of}} each brand of gutta-percha into 60 lateral canals (10 at each temperature) was measured using a stereomicroscope. Statistical analysis was performed using the ANOVA, the Scheffè test and the t-test. RESULTS: None of the three brands of cones entered up to 0. 1 mm within either lateral canal until a temperature of 47 degrees C was reached; at that temperature only Mynol cones (P < or = 0. 05) penetrated in four of 10 A-level canals (mean 0. 13 +/- 0. 19 mm) and in all 10 C-level canals (mean 0. 43 +/- 0. 12 mm). The A-level lateral canals were penetrated at 52 degrees C by Mynol <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 0. 76 +/- 0. 34 mm) to a significantly greater distance (P < or = 0. 05) than Tulsa <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 0. 31 +/- 0. 12 mm) and Hygenic <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 0. 11 +/- 0. 08 mm). At 60 degrees C the Mynol <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 1. 93 +/- 0. 34 mm) penetrated significantly more (P < or = 0. 05) than the Tulsa <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 0. 86 +/- 0. 22 mm) and Hygenic <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 0. 67 +/- 0. 19 mm). The C-level lateral canals were penetrated at 52 degrees C by Mynol <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 0. 91 +/- 0. 29 mm) to a significantly greater distance (P < or = 0. 05) than Tulsa <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 0. 47 +/- 0. 16 mm) and Hygenic <b>cones</b> (<b>mean</b> 0. 46 +/- 0. 15 mm), whilst no significant difference was found at 60 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: When heated and compacted, the three gutta-percha cones penetrated the lateral canals to different degrees.

The experimental technique {{is similar to that}} used in stellar speckle interferometry. It is based on the recording and posterior processing of coherent short-exposure images of a small area of the central fovea. By using this optical-digital procedure, we have obtained what are to our knowledge the first objective measurements in vivo of the cone spacing in the human fovea. The reconstruction of the whole spatial information of the cone mosaic would also be possible by further improvements of the technique by subsequent application of image-reconstruction algorithms.
