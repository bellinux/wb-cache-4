5|$|The bird's song can be {{described}} as a buzzed zee-zee-zeeee with an <b>upward</b> inflection. Its call is a flat ctuk.|$|E
5|$|After the {{relatively}} stable years of 1976 to 1978, fiscal deﬁcits started to climb again, and the external debt tripled in three years. The increased debt burden interrupted industrial development and <b>upward</b> social mobility.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to identify migration intensity {{makes use of}} <b>upward</b> pointing microphones to record the nocturnal contact calls of flocks flying overhead. These are then analyzed in a laboratory to measure time, frequency and species.|$|E
5|$|Breathing {{involves}} expelling {{stale air}} from the blowhole, forming an <b>upward,</b> steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs; a humpback whale's lungs can hold about 5,000 litres of air. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.|$|E
5|$|Diverging {{winds aloft}} ahead of these troughs cause {{atmospheric}} lift within the troposphere below, which lowers surface pressures as <b>upward</b> motion partially counteracts {{the force of}} gravity.|$|E
5|$|In African antelopes, {{the lateral}} dental {{grooming}} apparatus {{does not appear}} to be used during grazing or browsing. Instead, it is used during grooming when the head sweeps <b>upward</b> in a distinctive motion. It is thought to comb the fur and remove ectoparasites.|$|E
5|$|Nobel, P. (2005). Onward and <b>upward?</b> Four {{years after}} 9/11 – at perhaps {{the peak of}} the real estate bubble – very tall has never been hotter. Metropolis, 25, 66–72.|$|E
5|$|Osteen, Mark. Nightmare Alley: Film Noir and the American Dream (Johns Hopkins University Press; 2013) 336 pages; interprets {{film noir}} as a genre that {{challenges}} the American mythology of <b>upward</b> mobility and self-reinvention.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian {{saturation}} decompression {{tables are}} similar, but specifically {{do not allow}} decompression to start with an <b>upward</b> excursion. Partial pressure of oxygen is maintained between 0.4 and 0.5 bar, and a rest stop of 6 hours is specified each night starting at midnight.|$|E
5|$|The bright {{coat the}} bottom {{extends to the}} shoulders, flanks, and hips in three arches <b>upward.</b> It is {{distinguished}} from the darker fur {{on the top of}} the existing black-brown hair, three curved line.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the station and the shops to each side was designed {{with the intention of}} taking <b>upward</b> development on its roof, though this did not come until around 1960 when three storeys of office building were added.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is <b>upward.</b> Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough to {{pose a threat to}} both people and property.|$|E
5|$|A ridge soaring pilot uses <b>upward</b> air {{movements}} caused {{when the wind}} blows on {{to the sides of}} hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of exhaustion.|$|E
5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is heated and expands causing an <b>upward</b> buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|E
5|$|According to the Geothermal Energy Association (GEA) {{installed}} geothermal {{capacity in}} the United States grew by 5%, or 147.05 MW, ce the last annual survey in March 2012. This increase came from seven geothermal projects that began production in 2012. GEA also revised its 2011 estimate of installed capacity <b>upward</b> by 128 MW, bringing current installed U.S. geothermal capacity to 3,386 MW.|$|E
5|$|After the {{momentary}} reduction in speed, the train {{turns to the}} right and descends into a downward 540-degree helix. Immediately following the first helix, the train climbs into an <b>upward</b> 270-degree helix to the left. Following the climb is a small descent and a final hill. The train climbs up from the final hill into the terminal brake run.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{entertainments}} {{formed a}} central part of the games and normally took place in the morning. Dio says that {{over the course of the}} inaugural games <b>upward</b> of nine thousand tamed and wild animals were slain sometimes by women of no particular prominence. This conflicts with the work of Eutropius who wrote, in the later part of the fourth century, that 5,000 animals were slain during the games.|$|E
5|$|By extrapolating the now-eroded {{and tilted}} beds <b>upward,</b> geologists have {{determined}} that these mountains were several kilometers high. Similar projections of the tilted beds downward, coupled with geophysical measurements on the greenstone belts in Canada, suggest the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the belts project downward {{at least a few}} kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Divorce {{rates in}} Shanghai and Beijing, China's two most {{populated}} economic centres, have been steadily rising since 2005 with it reaching 30% in 2012. This among other contributing {{factors such as}} online dating and the <b>upward</b> mobility {{of people have been}} attributed to pushing the average age of marriage in China to 27, up from 20 in 1950, making it closer to global marriage trends.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{internal}} heat is {{thermal energy}} generated from radioactive decay and continual heat loss from Earth's formation. Temperatures at the core–mantle boundary may reach over 4000°C (7,200°F). The high temperature and pressure in Earth's interior cause some rock to melt and solid mantle to behave plastically, resulting in {{portions of the}} mantle convecting <b>upward</b> since it is lighter than the surrounding rock. Rock and water is heated in the crust, sometimes up to 370°C (700°F).|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a normal force (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground <b>upward</b> on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E
5|$|Houston is flat marshy {{area where}} an {{extensive}} drainage {{system has been}} built. The adjoining prairie land drains into the city which is prone to flooding. Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from {{the erosion of the}} Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced <b>upward.</b> As it pushed <b>upward,</b> the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.|$|E
5|$|I {{know why}} the caged bird sings, ah me,When his wing is bruised and his bosom sore,When he beats his bars and would be free;It is not a carol of joy or glee,But a prayer that he sends from his heart's deep core,But a plea, that <b>upward</b> to Heaven he flings— I {{know why the}} caged bird sings.|$|E
5|$|Investment capital {{flowing into}} {{renewable}} energy reached a record US$77billion in 2007, with the <b>upward</b> trend continuing in 2008. The OECD still dominates, {{but there is}} now increasing activity from companies in China, India and Brazil. Chinese companies were the second largest recipient of venture capital in 2006 after the United States. In the same year, India was the largest net buyer of companies abroad, mainly in the more established European markets.|$|E
5|$|Many Cossacks {{were being}} hired to {{participate}} in wars waged by the Commonwealth. This status resulted in privileges and often constituted a form of social <b>upward</b> mobility; the Cossacks resented the periodic reductions in their enrollment. Cossack rebellions or uprisings typically assumed the form of huge plebeian social movements.|$|E
5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and {{darker than the}} common impala; melanism {{is responsible for the}} black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} nose, that runs <b>upward</b> to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the men}} {{helps the}} girl up, she spreads her wings and gives them a {{grateful}} smile; he kisses her hand, and the other winks in farewell. Soon, she is gone drifting <b>upward</b> into the sky. Briefly, a major urban cityscape is seen beyond the trees. From a bird's-eye view, we see {{the shape of the}} car veering off the road and slowing to a stop in the grass.|$|E
5|$|Physically, some insects {{move their}} flight muscles {{directly}}, others indirectly. In insects with direct flight, the wing muscles directly {{attached to the}} wing base, so that a small downward movement of the wing base lifts the wing itself <b>upward.</b> Those insects with indirect flight have muscles that attach to and deform the thorax, causing the wings to move as well.|$|E
5|$|Rainbands are {{cloud and}} {{precipitation}} areas which are significantly elongated. Rainbands can be stratiform or convective, and are generated by differences in temperature. When noted on weather radar imagery, this precipitation elongation {{is referred to}} as banded structure. Rainbands in advance of warm occluded fronts and warm fronts are associated with weak <b>upward</b> motion, and tend to be wide and stratiform in nature.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{researchers}} described galaxies called super-luminous spirals. They {{are very}} large with an <b>upward</b> diameter of 437,000 light-years (compared to the Milky Way's 100,000 light-year diameter). With {{a mass of}} 340 billion solar masses, they generate {{a significant amount of}} ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge is}} both a {{connector}} and a viewing platform for the park. It was designed to link the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the entire Loop to the west with the Lake Michigan lakefront to the east. It was also {{designed to be a}} berm noise barrier blocking noise on the eight-lane Columbus Drive from the Park's outdoor band shell (Jay Pritzker Pavilion), by deflecting traffic sounds <b>upward.</b>|$|E
5|$|The dam wall is {{situated}} in a narrow gorge running east and west, with rock sides sloping <b>upward</b> from the river bed. Behind the dam wall, the south branch of the Canning River joins the main stream, with the impounded water forming a lake which stretches back in three major arms to the east south-east and south.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, while others were more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings lull in the middle, and ended with an <b>upward</b> curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that a higher proportion of younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors than many other shows.|$|E
5|$|The main ways {{water vapor}} {{is added to}} the air are: wind {{convergence}} into areas of <b>upward</b> motion, precipitation or virga falling from above, daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies or wet land, transpiration from plants, cool or dry air moving over warmer water, and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Elevated portions of weather fronts (which are three-dimensional in nature) force broad areas of <b>upward</b> motion within the Earth's atmosphere which form clouds decks such as altostratus or cirrostratus. Stratus is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass. It can also form due to the lifting of advection fog during breezy conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{major cause}} of rain {{production}} is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and <b>upward</b> motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong <b>upward</b> vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall {{along the sides of}} mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by downslope flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects <b>upward</b> and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest {{is often described as}} solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that may have had a respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E
