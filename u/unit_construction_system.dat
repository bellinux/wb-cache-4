40|$|Many {{industrial}} branches {{may benefit}} from MEMS technology. Most of them require custom-designed MEMS in mid-scale volumes, which are at present not available at market-acceptable costs. A modular MEMS packaging and interface concept, which includes electric, fluidic, optic, mechanical, thermal and communication interfaces, contributes to less costly solutions with faster time to market. On its foundation, a modular microfactory framework based on a <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> <b>system</b> is proposed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} partial automation of Wizard of Oz usability studies. Such simulations {{allow for}} interactive usability testing and user feedback on software or human-machine-interfaces prior {{to building a}} working prototype. We believe that the wizard needs tool support to be effective and have developed a tool called UsaWiz to help automate the interpretation of generic multimedia user input cues, and in quickly developing high level prototypes. In particular, this concept addresses one of the weaknesses of the major usability engineering techniques: the reproducibility of the study under the same conditions. The subjective influences of test conductors are limited to a minimum. Furthermore all test-data is streamed efficiently. The introduction of a usability experiment control language and a modular <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> <b>system</b> are {{the heart of the}} generic nature of the concept. Besides the basic goals a realization of the presented ideas is introduced and evaluated regarding in particular performance and savings achieved by the approach. Especially for studies in the automotive environment an exemplary distraction task and baseline evaluation are also explained in detail...|$|E

The modular framework, similar to <b>unit</b> <b>construction</b> <b>systems</b> well-known in the macro world, {{consists of a}} manufacturer set and an application kit.

40|$|The present study’s main {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} applicability of organic phase change materials (PCMs) in a building’s envelope <b>construction</b> <b>system</b> for the passive provision of comfortable indoor thermal conditions over one year based on thermal inertia in Mexico City. Research on PCMs relate mainly to their use in building envelope <b>construction</b> <b>systems</b> to reduce energy consumption for mechanical indoor thermal conditioning—not in passive systems. Computer simulation results of mean indoor temperature variations are presented with the objective of evaluating these construction systems’ thermal inertia properties. In the present study, dynamic thermal simulations (DTS), using EnergyPlus software, of ten 1 m 3 test <b>units</b> with envelope <b>construction</b> <b>systems</b> combining organic PCMs of different fusion temperatures with conventional materials were performed. Based on the results, it is concluded that the implementation of organic PCMs with a fusion temperature around 25 °C in combination with aerated concrete in a space envelope results in the highest number of hours the indoor temperatures remain within the comfort range throughout a typical year, due to the decrement of indoor temperature oscillations and, to a large extent, to thermal lag...|$|R
40|$|The <b>unit</b> modular <b>construction</b> <b>system</b> is a {{building}} technique in which unit modules are manufactured at a factory and then assembled at the construction site. It has many benefits, including {{reduction of the}} construction period and improvement in quality. For this reason, it is utilized for various purposes in Japan and England. While it has been introduced in Korea, {{there have been few}} Korean studies conducted on the unit modular system. In particular, little research has been done on the method of safely fixating the unit modules to a truck. Therefore, this study reviewed the fixation methods of unit modules for transport, analyzed the problems, and designed a fixation device for unit modules. In addition, a device for the fixation of unit modules to a truck was developed, and a structural simulation was implemented for a safety test by considering the maximum stress generated during the transport of the unit modules fixed on a truck. When the device for the fixation of unit modules is manufactured {{based on the results of}} the structural simulation done in this study, it is expected to aid the development of a more practical fixation device for unit modules...|$|R

40|$|Subdivision of {{the whole}} {{production}} system of an operation into various subsystems shows that the assembly system is connected to other subsystems, such as materials procurement and marketing, via the flow of material and information. The assembly system consists, as does the total production system, of different subsystems, such as assembly machines <b>systems,</b> basic <b>construction</b> <b>units,</b> interlinking <b>systems,</b> which are also joined via a flow of material information. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the general subject of assembly with emphasis on selection and design of the appropriate assembly approach, design for assembly and assembly techniques. The following topics are included: classification of assembly type and choice of assembly method, design for assembly (DFA) and assemblability evaluation, design of manual assembly systems, design of automatic and robotic assembly systems, performance evaluation and economic justification in selecting the assembly system, relevant tec hnologies associated with assembly operations, and computer-aided assembly.
