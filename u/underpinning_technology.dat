This necessitates a broader and more profound understanding of design that needs to be more future-proof than relying on the latest or emerging technologies and yet embraces the collaborative, multimodal and ubiquitous nature of learning in 21 C. In addressing this challenge this article develops, exemplifies and tests the approach of Deep Learning Design (DLD), which has led to relatively large-scale and sustainable innovations and also outlined clear directions for near-future developments. Specifically, in this article we: justify why DLD is necessary and describe its key principles; exemplify these principles through four TEL initiatives; and, draw some implications and conclusions from across these projects about DLD and future learning...|$|R

For instance, Regenbrecht and Donath (1997) defined the tangible components of VR as a congruent set of hardware and software, with actors within a three-dimensional or multi-dimensional input/output space, where actors can interact with other autonomous objects, in real time.

A three- level mode of analysis is used to examine actor behaviour: actors at the micro-level, national technology systems, and the European-level institutions. The study makes a comparative analysis of participation by two of the European member states, the United Kingdom and Spain, to examine the community building processes that operated in each. The national institutional system in which economic actors operate influences their behaviour, and the analysis of the European technology collaboration identified the political changes that took place within the context of particular national institutional systems. One variable that is key to the process of integration is the technological capability of the national system. At the supranational level, the ideology and ideas <b>underpinning</b> <b>technology</b> policy created a market-based community, excluding other interests.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to contribute to the existing technology transfer literature by comprehensively reviewing and outlining the theories <b>underpinning</b> <b>technology</b> transfer. This review could stimulate and generate dynamic ideas for future researchers i. e. to further identify, conceptualize and understand the theories and perspectives underlying technology transfer. Such strong understanding is necessary to enable the interested parties (such as private sectors, government departments, academics, researchers and students) to relate these theories with the practical and empirical aspects of various technology transfer models, mechanism, issues and challenges. This is due to the fact that different perspectives/theories underlying technology transfer will have different theoretical arguments and insights, research problems, constructs, variables, and measurements. The literatures on technology transfer and international technology transfer are extensive, varied in perspective and from many disciplines; which include political science, economics, sociology, public policy, marketing and management.

Over this period, the demands and expectations from the profession have increased. At the dawn of 20 th century the expectations from the profession was articulated, defined and encapsulated in one killer-phrase- sustainable development. The Brundtland Report of 1987 highlighted development challenges to humanity. The problems stem from our living and consumption patterns vis-a-vis interaction with the wider ecosystem. Sustainable development as a concept is multidimensional, straddling across socio-economic, ecological, and technical perspectives.

In this step - which addressed the question: what kind of future society is embedded in this technology? - the technosocial imaginaries and visions driving and <b>underpinning</b> <b>technology</b> innovation and implementation of Syngenta have been de-constructed and scrutinized, not only per se but also in relation to dominant sociopolitical imaginaries.

The debate therefore shifts to costs and benefits of GMOs, whilst the basic question of why GMOs were developed in the first place remains unanswered and, indeed, disappears into the background. Visions and imaginaries sustaining technological innovation do matter: Scientists' and companies' values need to be unpacked and analysed. In addition, it is time to incorporate non-technical expertise: Lay publics, social scientists and farmers have access to relevant societal knowledge that has to inform risk assessment.

40|$|Many Condition Monitoring (CM) domains are {{suffering}} from the dual challenges of substantial increases in the volumes of data being produced and collected by sensing systems, and the challenges of modelling increasing complexity in the remote monitored systems. These two issues give rise to the problem that fast and reliable data mining of CM data is a computationally demanding task for real-time (or near real-time) applications. We present the use of AURA [1], a class of binary associative network built on correlation matrix memories (CMMs), as an <b>underpinning</b> <b>technology</b> for efficient, scalable pattern recognition in complex and large scale CM applications. AURA is a class of binary neural network. However, it {{has a number of}} advantages over standard neural network techniques for CM pattern classification tasks. These include; high levels of data compression, one-pass training for on-line training, a scalable architecture that can be readily mapped onto high performance computing platforms, and a sound theoretical basis to determine the bounds of the system operation. We describe applications illustrating how the AURA system can be optimised to create an extremely efficient and scalable k-nearest neighbour classifier for multi-variate models. We will also illustrate how the one-pass training capability of the AURA system can be used as the basis of normality and exception modelling in complex CM systems. This latter application has particularly powerful advantages for fault detection models in domains which are characterised by highly dynamic trends or drifting in the standard operational mode of a system, and which, as a result, are extremely difficult to accurately model.
