5|$|In {{creating}} Selina Kyle's catsuit, {{two layers}} of material were used, with the outer layer being polyurethane coated spandex, embossed with a hexagonal pattern. The catsuit also consisted of elbow-length gloves, a <b>utility</b> <b>belt,</b> and thigh-high boots with spike heels.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempting}} {{to present the}} character as a figurative mirror to Batman, the costume worn by Anarky in Beware the Batman was radially redesigned as entirely white, in contrast to Batman's black Batsuit. It consists of a tightly worn jumpsuit, cape, hood, flexible mask with white-eye lenses, and a <b>utility</b> <b>belt.</b> Upon the chest is a small, stylized circle-A in black. The design was negatively compared by reviewers to the longstanding design for Moon Knight, a Marvel Comics superhero.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons visit a {{high-tech}} gadget store and Bart buys a gimmicky <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> from Comic Book Guy for $4. He shows off its features to his classmates {{until he is}} beaten up by Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney, who steal the belt. In response, Homer decides {{to talk with the}} bullies' fathers at Moe's Tavern, but he is also beaten; however, they are unnerved when they cannot even knock Homer down, and are then chased away by a shotgun-wielding Moe.|$|E

50|$|One notable {{modification}} {{was made}} to the utility belt; an air-powered charge-firing rifle, which allows Batman to fire timed explosive charges from considerable distances and can be folded into two halves into a box-like shape to fit into his <b>utility</b> <b>belt's</b> compartment.|$|R
5|$|Lara Croft is {{depicted}} as an athletic and fast woman with brown eyes and reddish-brown hair, frequently kept in a plait or ponytail. The character's classic costume is a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> with holsters on either side, and two pistols. The video game sequels introduced new outfits designed for different environments, such as underwater and cold weather. In the later games, Croft wears a crop top, camouflage pants and black or light brown shirts. When exploring, she often carries two pistols, but has used other weaponry throughout the series. She is fluent in several languages.|$|E
5|$|She was a costumed crime-fighter like Batman, yet in {{many ways}} not an exact counterpart. For example, the {{contents}} of her utility purse were actually weapons disguised as stereotypical feminine products such as lipstick, cosmetic compacts, charm bracelets, and hair nets. Batwoman appeared regularly {{in the pages of}} Batman and Detective Comics through the early 1960s. Although letters from fans indicated Batwoman had become popular with readers, editor Julius Schwartz considered the heroine, as well as other Batman-related characters, to be inappropriate for the new direction he planned to take the Batman universe. Following the revamp to Detective Comics in 1964, Batwoman was removed from the series. The 'new' Batgirl, Barbara Gordon, not only replaced Batwoman as Batman's female counterpart, she surpassed the original heroine in popularity. Batgirl also proved to be more appropriate for her time period and the realistic approach DC Comics began taking with its characters. Unlike Batwoman, Gordon's Batgirl used a <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> and various gadgets similar to Batman's, {{in addition to being a}} skilled martial artist and possessing a doctorate in her civilian identity. Despite requests from readers to revive Batwoman, DC's editorial staff initially declined to bring the character out of retirement, considering the fact that she was specifically created to be a love interest for Batman.|$|E
25|$|Like Robin, Flamebird has a <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> {{containing}} a grappling hook with line, gas grenades, gas mask, flares, flashlight, radio/transmitter, handcuffs, bird-shaped throwing blades (Bird-A-Rangs), and an emergency medical kit. She increased her arsenal by equipping her mask with lenses capable of emitting powerful bursts of blinding light, and created bird-like bolas that can electrocute anyone tangled in them.|$|E
2500|$|After the First World War, Sam Browne belts [...] "become almost {{universal}} among American police". The <b>utility</b> <b>belts</b> worn today by American police usually lack the cross-strap and the attachments for them. The belt fastens {{in the same}} way, with the bar of the buckle engaging a pair of hooks {{and the end of}} the belt retained by a post and keeper loop. [...] They are also frequently fully lined, as opposed to the old style half-linings, to support equipment the length of the belt.|$|R

5000|$|Created by writer Gerry Conway, the {{character}} {{first appeared in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #149 (October 1975). During the [...] "Clone Saga" [...] storyline, he came to wear a makeshift costume similar to Spider-Man's consisting of a blue sleeveless hoodie sweatshirt adorned with black motifs of a spider on its front and back, over a red spandex bodysuit and mask, with <b>utility</b> <b>belts</b> and wrist-worn sizable web-shooters that was designed by artist Tom Lyle, before donning a variation of Spider-Man's costume designed by artist Mark Bagley as his successor for some time before his death.|$|R
25|$|When on duty {{officers}} wear a black wicking T-shirt {{with the}} Brunswick star and 'Wiltshire Police' {{on the chest}}, 'Police' on the sleeves, and black uniform trousers. Wiltshire Police no longer use the traditional police jumper, having favoured the black fleece with 'Police' on the chest and back. They also wear black body armour with the Wiltshire police 'patch' badge on the front, and 'Police' on the back. Officers then {{have a choice of}} <b>utility</b> <b>belt,</b> tactical vest or both, to hold their equipment. Officers are issued waterproof reflective coats and trousers, and a simple reflective tabard for traffic duties.|$|E
25|$|Other {{holsters}} can {{be added}} to the belt to suit members duties such as a clip to hold the polycarbonate baton or mag light. In 2007/08, the chief commissioner approved the issue of firearm holsters which could be strapped around the members thighs, to replace the low-riding belt gun holster. These holsters are not standard issue but are issued to members upon request, and are commonly requested by members who suffer from back aches (as a result of heavy <b>utility</b> <b>belt),</b> or those who find it more operationally sound to draw their firearms from a lower position (as this option offers a more comfortable reach).|$|E
25|$|Lara Croft is {{the main}} protagonist and playable {{character}} of the series: {{she is a woman}} who travels the world in search of forgotten artifacts and locations, frequently connected to supernatural powers. While her biography has changed throughout the series, her shared traits are her origins as the only daughter and heir of the aristocratic Croft family. She is portrayed as intelligent, athletic, elegant, fluent in multiple languages, and determined to fulfill her own goals at any cost. She has brown eyes and brown hair worn in a braid or ponytail. The character's classic outfit consists of a turquoise tank top, light brown shorts, calf-high boots, and tall white socks. Recurring accessories include fingerless gloves, a backpack, a <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> with holsters on either side, and twin pistols. Later games have multiple new outfits for her.|$|E
5000|$|While many serials made {{changes as}} part of their adaptation, {{to the extent that they}} were [...] "often 'improved' almost out of recognition", Batman [...] "fared better than most and changes were minor". In this serial special <b>utility</b> <b>belts</b> were worn but never used, the villain was not taken from the comics' stories, there was no Batmobile, and Batman was a secret {{government}} agent instead of an independent crime fighting vigilante. This last change was due to the time period's film censors, who would not allow the hero to be seen taking the law into his own hands.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{mistakes}} and failures of logic {{occur in the}} serial. One example is that the film shows the Bat-Signal working in broad daylight. Another occurs when, {{despite the fact that}} the heroes' <b>utility</b> <b>belts</b> had been replaced by normal belts with no pockets or pouches for this serial, in order to escape from a vault, Batman pulls the nozzle and hose of an oxy-acetylene torch from his belt to cut through a steel door (the tanks for the torch are not shown); to compound this mistake, it is a full-sized oxy-acetylene torch that would have been impossible to carry unseen on his person. Harmon and Glut suggest that this was probably scripted to be a miniaturised 3-inch torch, as used in the comics, but the film-makers improvised in following the directions for a [...] "blowtorch." ...|$|R
5000|$|Back in the Trogowog kingdom, Batman, Nightwing and Batgirl {{are held}} in the dungeon, {{stripped}} of their <b>utility</b> <b>belts</b> and imprisoned with Madame Mantis and the Trogowogs' cowardly prince Grungle (the only Trogowog not to fall victim of the Psyche Stone). Prince Grungle reveals that the Trogowogs were once a peaceful and friendly race until Bane found out about their kingdom and used the Psyche Stone to teach them hatred and violence. In addition, he killed Grungle's father and locked away Grungle. Luckily for the prisoners, Batman stashed away a brick separator and uses it to break them free. Unfortunately, they are recaptured after Bane threatens to kill them and Batman reluctantly succumbs to the Psyche Stone's power (while repeatedly saying [...] "Dance") and reveals {{how to use the}} [...] "Forbidden Move," [...] which involves harnessing one's own chi to create a projectile of destructive power.|$|R
500|$|Anarky's second costume {{was used}} during the 1999 ongoing Anarky series. It {{retained}} the red jumpsuit, gold mask, and hat, but excised the character's red robes. New additions to the costume included a red cape, a <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> modeled after Batman's <b>utility</b> <b>belt,</b> and a single, large circle-A across the chest, akin to Superman's iconic [...] "S" [...] shield. The golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective, but flexible material that wrapped around Anarky's head, allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion. This had previously been impossible, as the first mask was made of inflexible metal. Being a relatively new creation, Breyfogle encountered no editorial resistance in the new character design: [...] "Because [...] doesn't have 50 years of merchandising behind him, I can change his costume whenever I want..." [...] Within the Anarky series, secondary costumes were displayed in Anarky's base of operations. Each was slightly altered in design, but followed the same basic theme of color, jumpsuit, cloak, and hat. These were designed for use in various situations, but only one, a [...] "universal battle suit", was {{used during the}} brief series. These suits were also intended {{to be seen in}} the unpublished ninth issue of the series.|$|E
500|$|The character's arsenal is {{inspired}} by his nemesis' weaponry, such as batarangs. In [...] "The Joker's Utility Belt" [...] (1952), he mimicked Batman's <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> with non-lethal items, such as Mexican jumping beans and sneezing powder. In 1942's [...] "The Joker Follows Suit" [...] the villain built his versions of the Batplane and Batmobile, the Jokergyro and Jokermobile (the latter with a large Joker face on its hood), and created a Joker signal with which criminals could summon him for their heists. The Jokermobile lasted for several decades, evolving with the Batmobile. His technical genius is not limited by practicality, allowing him to hijack Gotham's television airwaves to issue threats, transform buildings into death traps, launch a gas attack on the city and rain poisoned glass shards on its citizens from an airship.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 3:05p.m. CST, Steven Kazmierczak {{entered a}} large auditorium-style lecture hall in Cole Hall (Auditorium 101), where an oceanography class was in session with approximately 120 students present. Kazmierczak was wearing dark brown boots with laces; jeans; a black T-shirt {{with the word}} [...] "Terrorist" [...] imposed over an image of an assault rifle; a coat; a black knit hat; and a black <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> with two magazine holsters, a holster for a handgun, three handguns (a 9×19mm Glock 19, a [...]380 ACP SIG Sauer P232, and a [...]380 ACP Hi-Point CF380), eight loaded magazines, and a knife. He also carried in a 12 gauge Remington Sportsman 48 shotgun concealed in a guitar case. He opened the auditorium door with such extreme force that many witnesses described him as [...] "kicking the door in", entering at the extreme southwest corner, near the stage {{in front of the}} classroom, [...] and began firing at the students.|$|E
5000|$|... 826NYC {{is located}} in a [...] "secret lair" [...] behind The Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company, a store similar in {{eccentricity}} to 826 Valencia’s storefront pirate shop, and which sells capes, grappling hooks, <b>utility</b> <b>belts</b> (new and vintage), masks, tights, deflector bracelets, bottles of chaos and anti-gravity, secret identity kits, and more. Visitors to the store can try out capes for free in a cape-testing wind tunnel (essentially a series of fans on a pedestal). The store sells new and back issues of Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern, The Believer, Wholphin, and other McSweeney's publications. The Brooklyn Superhero Supply Co. also carries a complete stock of publications written and edited by students at 826NYC including Trapped: The Encyclopedia of Escape, Sonny Paine, and issues 1 and 2 of The 826NYC Review. The store front is literally a front for the charitable organization, with all sales going to the organization. The store employs volunteers.|$|R
5000|$|In the gym, Batman and Robin confront Susie {{and warn}} her of {{impending}} danger, but {{she refuses to}} listen and slumps unconsciously when she applies the perfume. It is later revealed that Batman and Robin saved her life by using the [...] "Universal Antidote" [...] pills in their <b>utility</b> <b>belts,</b> and she repaid them by revealing the whole criminal scheme. Meanwhile, Joker, Nick, and Two-Bits arrive at the school in time to snap an incriminating picture of the Woodrow Roosevelt High School basketball team clutching the exam papers complete with written-in answers, which the team received from a rigged milk machine. The Joker then reaches a new low in crime: he {{plans to use the}} picture to disqualify and suspend the otherwise innocent team members for cheating, and stop them from playing Disko Tech in the night's big game, for he bet his cash on the opposite team and with the home players out of the game, the opposing team, Disko Tech would win from default.|$|R
50|$|The Penguin, Hawkeye and Sparrow swing {{across to}} Robbins' terrace on giant umbrellas; Penguin enters {{through the screen}} door and he gasses Dawn to sleep. As Batman and Robin try to stop the Penguin, a {{powerful}} magnet the Penguin had positioned just outside is turned on and they are pulled to it because of the metal in their <b>utility</b> <b>belts,</b> immobilizing them. It is later revealed that Batman and Robin had escaped from the magnet by a room service waiter and return to police headquarters. Knowing Penguin is listening in through the umbrella's bug, they announce that the ransom will be paid at Wayne Manor and that Batman and Robin will be waiting inside the armor statues immediately inside in the entrance hall. The Penguin goes to Wayne Manor and returns the actress. He then uses his gas-umbrella to knock out anyone inside the statues. He returns to his hideout to find out that Batman and Robin were waiting there; there had been dummies inside the statues all along. The Penguin is apprehended.|$|R
500|$|With {{the success}} of the limited series, Darren Vincenzo, an {{assistant}} editor at DC Comics, and the editor of the Anarky mini-series, promoted the continuation of the comic into a regular monthly title. In the lead-up to the publication of both ventures, Breyfogle and Grant wrote introductory essays intended for the trade paperback in June 1998. Breyfogle also continued the character costume adjustments he'd begun for the limited series. Fully redesigning the suit, Breyfogle retained the red jumpsuit, flexible gold mask, and hat, but eliminated the red robes in favor of a more traditional outfit. New additions to the suit included a red cape, golden <b>utility</b> <b>belt,</b> and a single, large Circle-A insignia across the chest, akin to Superman's iconic [...] "S" [...] shield. Batman: Anarky was published several months later with the new costume featured on the cover page, {{despite the fact that it}} does not appear in any of the collected stories.|$|E
500|$|Bennet cut {{her hair}} for the season, {{in order to}} further her character's {{transformation}} to the Daisy Johnson / Quake of the comics, while not cutting her hair as short as her comic counterpart. Bennet stated, [...] "The comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair." [...] Bennet also received a new costume for the season, along with Quake's signature gauntlets. On the costume, Foley said, [...] "It's about strength. She feels very empowered in it....I wanted to stay true to some of the designs I saw in the comics. In the style lines, I wanted to pay {{a little bit of a}} tribute to [...] tactical ability from last season, but we also incorporated the Quake symbol into her gauntlets and on the back of her suit." [...] Legacy Effects created the gauntlets and <b>utility</b> <b>belt,</b> [...] "out of flexible materials painted to look like metal" [...] so as not to injure anyone during stunts.|$|E
2500|$|During July 1939, {{just two}} issues after debut of the {{character}} Batman by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Fox wrote {{the first of his}} several tales for that character, introducing an early villain in the story [...] "The Batman Meets Doctor Death". Alongside Kane and Finger, Fox contributed to the evolution {{of the character}}, including the character's first use of his <b>utility</b> <b>belt,</b> which [...] "contain choking gas capsules," [...] as well as writing the first usages of both the Batarang and the Batgyro, an autogyro precursor to the Batcopter, two issues later.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s Batman TV series, the Clock King {{was portrayed}} by Walter Slezak {{in the season}} two {{consecutive}} episodes, '"The Clock King's Crazy Crimes" [...] and [...] "The Clock King Gets Crowned", which ABC transmitted on October 12 and October 13, 1966. The two-parter was written by Batman co-creator Bill Finger and Charles Sinclair and directed by James Neilson. In the episode, the Clock King, disguised as a pop artist, tries to rob a gallery of a time-related surrealist painting. Batman and Robin are stuffed {{into the bottom of}} an oversized hourglass, stripped of their <b>utility</b> <b>belts,</b> and left to be drowned in sand as the Clock King plots to filch Bruce Wayne's collection of antique pocket watches, only for the duo to escape the trap later. Later in the episode, he starts his masterplan, to steal the atomic-powered Cesium clock. As the Clock King, Slezak wore a black cape and a top-hat with a clock inside it. He had many weapons such as [...] "Super Slick Watch Oil", [...] "Knock Out Gas", and [...] "Super Sonic Sound".|$|R
5000|$|The bookstore is closed, but {{the door}} is unlocked. Batman and Robin enter, and quickly {{discover}} a note that leads them to a slim volume titled, [...] "The Truth About Bats." [...] Removing it from the shelf opens a concealed door into Eivol Ekdol's workshop and his [...] "Inescapable Doom Trap". A fake bat inside leads the duo into the trap. Its space age plastic resists the tools from their <b>utility</b> <b>belts,</b> deadly gas begins to pour in, and the floor vent is electrified. But the gas rises; Robin realizes it must contain hydrogen. Using their metal belt buckles, the Duo creates a spark and the exploding gas bursts apart the trap. As they're about to pass between the mummies, inside where the machine gun equipped gangsters lurk, Zelda warns them. They duck and the gangsters kill each other with crossfire. Ekdol tries to escape, but Batman knocks him out with a Batarang. A tearful Zelda surrenders, truly remorseful. While Ekdol is taken into custody, Zelda is granted her reprieve.|$|R
50|$|All Noh assassins bear {{a dragon}} tattoo on the back. The dragon wings spread to cover both shoulders, while the tail reaches {{to the lower}} back area. A {{bulletproof}} kabuki mask covers the face, to conceal the identity. The mask is made of the ceramic lightweight material that used for Japanese bullet trains, and is stronger than metal. Boots and <b>utility</b> <b>belts</b> are included. The eyes of the mask are connected to a red visor, which allows the assassin to share their vision with the Noh via camera-link, all while processing data. The general color and clothing is black leather and silk, which {{makes it easy for}} an assassin to avoid detection while moving about in shadows and darkness. The silk is mostly used to cover the arms to conceal arm movements. The body armor worn is bulletproof. All assassins have individual designs to suit them. For example, spikes are worn as part of Scarab's assassin garb, because her armor design is based on a sketch that Yukio drew in his spare time. Scarab's appearance may be considered the most fancy look among the eight assassins. The Noh assassins are highly skilled with Neo Warsaw Pact and NATO firearms, Okinawan black market weaponry, hand-to-hand combat, and attack and defense using the environment. The preferred weapons of choice are usually handguns, and various bladed weapons. The long fingernails are sometimes dipped in poisoned nail polish. Each assassin has her own favorite weapons that she normally prefers to carry out her missions.|$|R
2500|$|Post [...] "Sins of Youth" [...] (2000): When he was depowered {{after the}} [...] "Sins of Youth" [...] storyline, his costume {{was a black}} T-shirt with red and yellow S-shield, blue pants, red gloves, red boots, and a yellow <b>utility</b> <b>belt.</b> He used a Legion flight ring to fly and later used a gold wrist guard {{designed}} by the Gadget Guru of the Hairies that was powered by the same Legion flight ring. It enabled Superboy to fly and hid a gold S-shield made of expandable alloy that Superboy used for combat. The S-shield could also be launched from Superboy's wrist guard.|$|E
2500|$|The show's campiness {{was played}} up in elements, {{including}} {{the design of}} the villains, dialogue and in signs appearing on various props. Batman would frequently reveal one of his many crime-fighting gadgets, which were usually given a ridiculous-sounding name that somehow incorporated the word [...] "bat"– often simply by adding the word [...] "bat" [...] to an otherwise normal descriptor, such as Shark Repellant Bat-Spray, Bat-Computer, Extra-Strong Bat-Knockout Gas, etc. [...] Most of Batman's items in the Batcave, bat-vehicles and on the <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> were given superfluous and simplistic block-letter labels, even though Batman, Robin and Alfred, the only people who used the equipment, clearly knew what all of it was.|$|E
2500|$|Adult Swim {{has also}} {{produced}} bumpers parodying the Super Friends. [...] The {{first was a}} clip from the episode [...] "The Time Trap", with bleeping edited in to {{give the appearance of}} profanity. They produced similar clips using other Hanna-Barbera cartoons. In another bumper, they lampooned {{the manner in which the}} Super Friends described every action before completing it (e.g., [...] "I need to reach my <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> so that I may free myself!") In this commercial, the heroes went to a movie and struggled to find money for popcorn. [...] Several bumpers consist of little more than Aquaman walking into a realistic photograph and then proceeding to dance to some rump-shaking music.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Comics {{historian}} Jim Steranko {{wrote in}} 1970 that Finger's slowness {{as a writer}} led Batman editor Whitney Ellsworth to suggest Kane replace him, a claim reflected in Joe Desris' description of Finger as [...] "notoriously tardy". During Finger's absence, Gardner Fox contributed scripts that introduced Batman's early [...] "Bat-" [...] arsenal (the <b>utility</b> <b>belt,</b> the Bat-Gyro/plane and the Batarang). Upon his return, Finger created or co-created items such as the Batmobile and Batcave, and is credited with providing the name [...] "Gotham City". Finger wrote the debut issue of Batman's self-titled comic book series which introduced the Joker and the Catwoman. Among {{the things that made}} his stories distinctive were a use of giant-sized props: enlarged pennies, sewing machines, or typewriters. Two of the prevalently featured trophies in Batman's Batcave, a full-size animatronic Tyrannosaurus Rex and a giant replica of a Lincoln penny, were both introduced in stories written by Finger. He was one of the writers of the syndicated Batman comic strip from 1943 to 1946.|$|E
2500|$|In , {{a version}} of the Batmobile appears with a design heavily {{influenced}} by the one used in Batman (1989 film) and [...] In the game, it is vandalized by Harley Quinn and the Blackgate prisoners. Batman later controls the Batmobile remotely using his <b>utility</b> <b>belt</b> to take Bane into the sea along with it. In , the Batmobile appears in the Batcave Predator Challenge Map and was back under re-construction following its tussle with Bane, thus explaining its absence {{in the rest of the}} game. In , a prototype of the Batmobile was seen in the Batcave and was under construction by Batman, under the working title [...] "Urban Assault Vehicle" [...] and when scanned in Detective Mode its description: [...] "Armored to resist direct collisions and small arms fire. Multiple LTL armaments. Shield tracking profiles reduced thermal/radar footprint. 1.200BHP. 7MPG. Status: Under Maintenance." [...] After Bane destroyed the Batcave, the prototype fell off the ledge, destroyed, with Alfred under the rubble. The destroyed remains of that early Batmobile could still be seen on the ledge.|$|E
