500|$|Insurance is a {{contract}} based upon speculation. The special facts, {{upon which the}} contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in {{the knowledge of the}} insured only; the underwriter trusts to his representation and proceeds upon the confidence that he does not keep back any circumstance in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist, and to induce him to estimate the risque as if it did not exist. Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary. This was an attempt by Mansfield to introduce the assumption of good faith into English law, and although it failed for the most part (as most areas of English commercial law no longer use <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides),</b> it is still used in insurance contracts. In insurance agreements, the insuree inevitably knows more about the risk involved than the insurer; without the requirement for pre-contractual [...] "good faith," [...] the insuree would have no reason to tell the truth, and insurance companies would be loath to make contracts.|$|E
500|$|Mansfield made a {{great effort}} to bring English {{merchant}} law up to the same standards as that of other European nations, defining his position by saying that [...] "the daily negotiations and property of merchants ought not to depend on subtleties and niceties, but upon rules easily learned and easily retained because they are dictates of common sense drawn from {{the truth of the}} case". In most European countries, the principle was that a merchant was bound by his promises, not just his signed legal documents, while English lawyers maintained that a merchant could only be legally bound by documents that he signed. The European principle was based on the assumption of good faith {{on the part of the}} merchants, or <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides,</b> something completely lacking in English law. In , [...] Mansfield got a chance to reform the law relating to the assumption of good faith. Carter was the Governor of Fort Marlborough (now Bengkulu), which was built by the British East India Company in Sumatra, Indonesia. He took out an insurance policy with Boehm against the fort's being taken by a foreign enemy. A witness called Captain Tryon testified that Carter knew the fort was built to resist attacks from natives but not European enemies, and the French were likely to attack. The French did attack, and Boehm refused to fulfil the insurance claim.|$|E
5000|$|... s.17: {{imposes a}} duty on the insured of <b>uberrimae</b> <b>fides</b> (as opposed to caveat emptor); ie. that {{questions}} must be answered honestly {{and the risk}} not misrepresented.|$|R
5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>uberrimae</b> <b>fides</b> - {{utmost good faith}} - {{is present in the}} insurance law of all common law systems. An insurance contract is a contract of utmost good faith. The most important expression of that principle, under the doctrine as it has been interpreted in England, is that the prospective insured must accurately disclose to the insurer everything that he knows and that is or would be material to the reasonable insurer. Something is material if it would influence a prudent insurer in determining whether to write a risk, and if so upon what terms. If the insurer is not told everything material about the risk, or if a material misrepresentation is made, the insurer may avoid (or [...] "rescind") the policy, i.e. the insurer may treat the policy as having been void from inception, returning the premium paid. Reinsurance contracts (between reinsurers and insurers/cedents) require the highest level of utmost good faith, and such utmost good faith is considered the foundation of reinsurance. In order to make reinsurance affordable, a reinsurer cannot duplicate costly insurer underwriting and claim handling costs, and must rely on an insurer’s absolute transparency and candor. In return, a reinsurer must appropriately investigate and reimburse an insurer’s good faith claim payments, following the fortunes of the cedent.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} sections of this Act include::§4: a policy without insurable interest is void.:§17: imposes a duty on the insured of <b>uberrimae</b> <b>fides</b> (as opposed to caveat emptor), i.e., that questions must be answered honestly {{and the risk}} not misrepresented.:§18: the proposer of the insurer {{has a duty to}} disclose all material facts relevant to the acceptance and rating of the risk. Failure to do so is known as non-disclosure or concealment (there are minor differences in the two terms) and renders the insurance voidable by the insurer.:§33(3): If warranty be not exactly complied with, then, subject to any express provision in the policy, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach of warranty, but without prejudice to any liability incurred by him before that date.:§34(2): where a warranty has been broken, it is no defence to the insured that the breach has been remedied, and the warranty complied with, prior to the loss.:§34(3): a breach of warranty may be waived (ignored) by the insurer.:§39(1): implied warranty that the vessel must be seaworthy at the start of her voyage and for the purpose of it (voyage policy only).:§39(5): no warranty that a vessel shall be seaworthy during the policy period (time policy). However, if the assured knowingly allows an unseaworthy vessel to set sail the insurer is not liable for losses caused by unseasworthiness.:§50: a policy may be assigned. Typically, a shipowner might assign the benefit of a policy to the ship-mortgagor.:§§60-63: deals with the issues of a constructive total loss. The insured can, by notice, claim for a constructive total loss with the insurer becoming entitled to the ship or cargo if it should later turn up. (By contrast an actual total loss describes the physical destruction of a vessel or cargo.):§79: deals with subrogation, i.e., the rights of the insurer to stand in the shoes of an indemnified insured and recover salvage for his own benefit. Schedule 1 of the Act contains a list of definitions; schedule 2 contains the model policy wording.|$|R

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides</b> is strictly limited in English law {{to the formation}} of the insurance contract. During the mid-20th century, American courts expanded it much farther into a post-formation implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

5000|$|Early {{insurance}} contracts {{were considered to}} be contracts like any other, but first English (see <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides)</b> and then American courts recognized that insurers occupy a special role in society by virtue of their express or implied promise of peace of mind, as well as the severe vulnerability of insureds at the time they actually make claims (usually after a terrible loss or disaster).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Uberrima</b> <b>fides</b> (sometimes seen in its genitive form uberrimae fidei) is a Latin phrase meaning [...] "utmost good faith" [...] (literally, [...] "most {{abundant}} faith"). It is {{the name}} of a legal doctrine which governs insurance contracts. This means that all parties to an insurance contract must deal in good faith, making a full declaration of all material facts in the insurance proposal. This contrasts with the legal doctrine caveat emptor ("let the buyer beware").|$|E

5000|$|Insurance {{contracts}} {{are governed by}} the principle of utmost good faith (<b>uberrima</b> <b>fides)</b> which requires both parties of the insurance contract to deal in good faith and in particular it imparts on the insured a duty to disclose all material facts which relate to the risk to be covered. This contrasts with the legal doctrine that covers most other types of contracts, caveat emptor (let the buyer beware). In the United States, the insured can sue an insurer in tort for acting in bad faith.|$|E

5000|$|Despite these remarks, {{and despite}} the fact that the House of Lords has subsequently, with {{reference}} to them, noted that “the concept of <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides</b> does not appear to have derived from civil law and that it has been regarded as unnecessary in civilian systems,” Reinecke observes that [...] "old habits die slowly," [...] and that insurance contracts are still occasionally referred to as [...] "contracts of the utmost good faith." [...] This usage, he urges, [...] "must be deprecated," [...] at least insofar as it suggests that the distinction between utmost good faith and good faith involves a difference of principle rather than merely one of degree.|$|E
5000|$|To {{counter the}} effects of adverse selection, {{insurers}} may offer insurance premiums that are proportional to the customer's risk of accident. The insurer screens customers to distinguish high-risk individuals from low-risk individuals. For instance, medical insurance companies ask a range of questions and may request medical or other reports on individuals who apply to buy insurance. The premium can be varied accordingly and any unreasonably high risks individuals are rejected. This risk selection process is one part of underwriting. In many countries, insurance law incorporates an [...] "utmost good faith" [...] or <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides</b> doctrine, which requires potential customers to answer any underwriting questions asked by the insurer fully and honestly. Dishonesty may be met with refusals to pay claims.|$|E
50|$|The {{fact that}} a {{contract}} is one of utmost good faith does not mean, however, that it {{gives rise to a}} general fiduciary relationship. The relationship between insured and insurer is not akin to the relationship between, say, guardian and ward, principal and agent, or trustee and beneficiary. In these latter instances, the inherent character of the relationship is such that the law has traditionally imported general fiduciary obligations. The insurer-insured relationship is contractual; the parties are parties to an arms-length agreement. The principle of <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides</b> does not affect the arms-length nature of the agreement, and cannot be used to find a general fiduciary relationship. The insurance contract, as noted above, imposes certain specific obligations on its parties. These obligations, however, do not import general fiduciary duties into each and every insurance relationship. Before such fiduciary obligations can be imported there must be specific circumstances in the relationship that call for their imposition.|$|E

40|$|Mutuality is the {{principle}} of private, commercial insurance; individuals enter the pool for sharing losses, and pay according to the best estimate of the risk they bring with them. Solidarity is the sharing of losses with payment according to some other scheme; this is {{the principle}} of state social insurance; essential features of solidarity are comprehensiveness and compulsion. Private insurance {{is subject to the}} <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides</b> principle, or utmost good faith; each side declares all it knows about the risk. The Disability Discrimination Act requires insurers to justify disability {{discrimination on the basis of}} relevant information, acturial, statistical or medical, on which it is reasonable to rely. It could be very damaging to private insurance to abandon <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides.</b> However, although some genetic information is clearly useful to underwriters, other information may be so general as to be of little use. The way in which mortality rates are assessed is also explained...|$|E
40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências Jurídicas (Direito Comercial), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Direito, 2013 O presente estudo tem por objecto um dos temas mais controversos e fecundos entre a jurisprudência e a doutrina do Direito dos seguros: a vinculação do proponente do contrato de seguro a informar o segurador, de forma completa e exacta, em sede de formação do contrato, sobre as características do risco proposto, de modo a que o segurador possa conformar a sua vontade negocial e determinar o prémio devido. Associado às origens do seguro e inerente à alea, à assimetria informativa e ao carácter <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides</b> que caracterizam este contrato, o instituto em análise comporta uma {{lex specialis}} cujas soluções são precursoras da responsabilidade pré-contratual e superam o dualismo entre normas de conduta e normas de validade. O texto começa por situar conceptualmente o objecto de análise e identificar os aspectos metodológicos relevantes, concentrando-se depois nos fundamentos materiais e normativos do instituto. Este é estudado, tanto numa dimensão histórica, acompanhando as grandes tendências de regulação através do tempo, como comparatística, analisando as soluções normativas de um leque de ordenamentos de referência e dando lugar à síntese, ancorada numa grelha comparativa, e à construção de uma tipologia de modelos de regulação. Quanto ao sistema jurídico português, o regime da declaração do risco é abrangentemente analisado, procurando-se identificar de forma exaustiva as questões jurídicas suscitadas e as soluções providenciadas pelo ordenamento, tanto no âmbito do regime geral da Lei do Contrato de Seguro, como no dos regimes especiais do seguro automóvel, do seguro de acidentes de trabalho e dos seguros de vida. A análise estende-se mesmo para além das fronteiras do Direito dos seguros, do Direito civil e do Direito comercial, visando implicações pertinentes no quadro do Direito penal e do Direito processual civil, e não negligenciando considerações de ordem económica. The present study {{concerns}} {{one of the}} richest and most controversial themes among jurisprudence and legal theory: the duty, which binds the proponent of the insurance contract, to fully and exactly disclose to the insurer, before the contract is concluded, the characteristics of the proposed risk, {{in such a way that}} the insurer may form his contractual will and determine the due premium. The legal institute under analysis is deeply intertwined with the insurance origins and is inherent to the main characteristics of the contract, namely its alea, asymmetrical information and <b>uberrima</b> <b>fides</b> nature. That institute comprises a special regime whose solutions largely precede those of pre-contractual liability and overcome the dualism between rules of conduct and rules of contract validity. The text starts by conceptually defining the object of analysis and identifying the relevant methodological coordinates, focusing thereafter upon the material and normative grounds of the institute. This later is studied, both in a historical dimension, following the major trends of regulation over time, and in a comparative one, analyzing the solutions of a range of reference legal systems and giving way to a synthesis, based on a comparative grid, and to the identification of a set of types of regulation models. As to the Portuguese legal system, the regulation of non-disclosure and misrepresentation is widely analyzed, and an effort is put on the exhaustive identification of the legal issues raised – and on the remedies provided for – by law (considering the Insurance Contract Act framework, as well as the special regimes of vehicle insurance, work accidents insurance, and life insurance). The analysis goes further beyond the borders of insurance law, civil law and commercial law, extending to the relevant implications on the fields of criminal law and procedural law and to some considerations of economic nature.

40|$|Dr. Han Yong Qiang, Research Fellow, Centre for Banking 2 ̆ 6 Finance Law, National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, {{provided}} {{this report}} in remembrance of the one-year anniversary on March 15, 2017 of {{the passing of}} Reuben Hasson, a leading Canadian scholar in insurance law and social assistance law {{who was a member}} of the Osgoode faculty from 1975 until his retirement in 2001. “The late Professor Reuben Hasson was remembered at an insurance law colloquium held on November 30 and December 1, 2016 at the Faculty of Law, National University of Singapore and organized by its Centre for Banking 2 ̆ 6 Finance Law. The colloquium involved insurance law academics from Australia, China, France, Germany, Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the USA. It focused on the insurance law principle of utmost good faith (<b>Uberrima</b> <b>Fides</b> in Latin) and pre-contractual duties which were widely believed to be established in Carter v Boehm (1766), a landmark English case in insurance law. In 1969, Professor Hasson’s article “‘Uberrima Fides’ in Insurance Law – A Critical Evaluation” was published in The Modern Law Review. At the Singapore colloquium, a 10 -minute silent PowerPoint presentation was given on Professor Hasson’s illuminating article. Before this presentation, Professor Robert Merkin, one of the global leading experts in insurance law, recollected how he in the 1970 s as a law student was introduced by Professor Hasson into the world of insurance law at Queen Mary College, University of London, where he had taught insurance law amongst other courses. Professor Hasson’s article is still as illuminating and relevant now as it was then. Based on both the idea of the colloquium project investigator and the subsequent advice of an anonymous reviewer of the book proposal thereafter, the article, if permitted, will be reprinted for the benefit of wider readership in the edited-book Pre-contractual Duties in Insurance Law across Legal Traditions: Carter v Boehm 250 Years on, which will be published by Hart Publishing in December 2017. In this way, it is hoped that Professor Hasson’s influence in insurance law will remain for a long time to come. ”[URL]...|$|E
