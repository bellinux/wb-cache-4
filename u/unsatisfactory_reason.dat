Infrarenal abdominal aortic replacement was carried out with nondrug-loaded and drug-loaded prostheses in 18 rats and followed for 6 months.

For, while the Copernican and Tychonic systems are equivalent geometrically, they are quite different dynamically. Galileo's tidal theory entailed the actual, physical movement of the Earth; that is, if true, it would have provided the kind of proof that Foucault's pendulum apparently provided two centuries later. With reference to Galileo's tidal theory, there would be no difference between the Ptolemaic and Tychonic systems.|$|R
40|$|Abstract | Many North American anthropologists remain deeply {{suspicious}} {{of attempts to}} theorize the evolution of culture, given the legacy in our discipline of nineteenth-century stagist theories of cultural evolution that were shaped by scientific racism. In the late twentieth-century, some theorists tried to escape this legacy by using formal models drawn from neo-Darwinian population biology to reconceptualize cultural evolutionary processes, but these more recent approaches have been found <b>unsatisfactory</b> for <b>reasons</b> of their own. For example, gene-culture coevolution and the dual inheritance theory have limited appeal to many contemporary cultural anthropologists because these theories rely on definitions of culture, and assumptions about human individuals and social groups, that many cultural anthropologists no longer find persuasive. Niche construction, by contrast, appears more promising {{as a framework for}} connecting cultural change with biological and ecological change. Nevertheless, the innovative features of niche construction coexist uneasily alongside the same problematic features that limit the usefulness of gene-culture coevolution and dual inheritance theory in cultural anthropology. This article discusses anthropological concerns about niche construction theory, but also suggests ways in which some of them might be reduced if niche construction theory were to incorporate insights from developmental systems theory and actor network theory...|$|R
40|$|Osteoarthritis is a {{degenerative}} {{joint disease}} characterized by pain and disability. It involves {{all ages and}} 70 % of people aged > 65 have some degree of osteoarthritis. Natural cartilage repair is limited because chondrocyte density and metabolism are low and cartilage has no blood supply. The results of joint-preserving treatment protocols such as debridement, mosaicplasty, perichondrium transplantation and autologous chondrocyte implantation vary largely and the average long-term result is <b>unsatisfactory.</b> One <b>reason</b> for limited clinical success is that most treatments require new cartilage to be formed {{at the site of}} a defect. However, the mechanical conditions at such sites are unfavorable for repair of the original damaged cartilage. Therefore, it is unlikely that healthy cartilage would form at these locations. The most promising method to circumvent this problem is to engineer mechanically stable cartilage ex vivo and to implant that into the damaged tissue area. This review outlines the issues related to the composition and functionality of tissue-engineered cartilage. In particular, the focus will be on the parameters cell source, signaling molecules, scaffolds and mechanical stimulation. In addition, the current status of tissue engineering of cartilage will be discussed, with the focus on extracellular matrix content, structure and its functionality...|$|R
40|$|The need to {{introduce}} the sampling method There has been a tradition of regular and frequent administrative censuses of economic establishments {{in many of the}} Transition Countries. This system of data collection is becoming increasingly unsustainable, and in any case <b>unsatisfactory</b> for <b>reasons</b> of cost, respondent burden and data quality. At least for medium-sized and large establishments, good lists with considerable amount of recent and relevant information on characteristics of individual establishments are often available. This information can be used to design efficient samples to obtain the required information, replacing frequent censuses. Apart from being more economical and manageable, the introduction of sampling will reduce the burden on the statistical organisation and, what may be even more important in the longer run, on the respondents. We will use a recently designed (yet to be implemented) Survey on Wage Rates in Ukraine as a concrete illustration in the following discussion [Verma (1998) ]. The sampling procedures discussed are, of course, applicable more generally. Currently, data on wage rates in the country are obtained from a monthly census of some 160, 000 large and medium sized establishments.
