5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} {{for the different}} blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape is high in malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight <b>unevenness</b> in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E

40|$|This article attends to {{the work}} of Dutch artist Gert Jan Kocken, one of the {{foremost}} arts practitioners to have drawn on geographical mapping for formal and thematic substance in recent years. Discussion focuses on his series the Depictions, in which found maps, made in pursuit of conflicting ideologies during the Second World War, are combined digitally into composite representations of cities such as Amsterdam, Berlin and Rome. Layering together hundreds of different cartographies, the artworks provide a concentrated exploration of the connections between maps, states and warfare. To grasp these connections, I read the Depictions in conjunction with Zygmunt Bauman’s conception of the modern state as a ‘gardener’ of society and space. In doing so, I highlight Kocken’s vivid demonstrations of not only the transformative potential released in state military mapping but also <b>unevennesses</b> and dialogic complexities with which even apparently totalising state gardening projects are fraught.

40|$|Properly-designed road {{surfaces}} {{provide a}} durable surface on which traffic can pass smoothly and safely. In fact, the main causes that determine the structural decay of {{the pavement and}} its parts are the traffic loads. These repeated actions can create undesirable <b>unevennesses</b> on the road surface, which induce vertical accelerations on vehicles, up to hindering contact between pavement and tire, with dangerous consequences on traffic safety. The dynamic actions transmitted by the vehicles depend on these irregularities: often, a bridge expansion joint (BEJ), introducing a necessary discontinuity between different materials, determines from the beginning a geometric irregularity in the running surface. Besides, some structural conditions could emphasize the problem (e. g., local cracking due to the settlement of the subgrade near the abutment or the discontinuity of stiffness due {{to the presence of}} different materials). When the BEJ is located in a transition curve, an inevitable vertical irregularity between road and joint can reach values of some centimeters, with serious consequences for the road safety. This paper deals with the analysis of a case study of a BEJ. Several test surveys were performed in order to fully characterize the effects on both vehicles and pavement. The three-dimensional representation of the pavement surface and the acceleration measurements on a heavy test vehicle were performed to analyze the joint behavior under traffic. Finally, a finite element model was implemented to evaluate the stress contribution on vehicle components induced by the vertical irregularities...|$|R
25|$|The villa {{itself is}} sited {{in an unusual}} {{location}} – the <b>unevenness</b> of the terrain, which was riddled with small streams and natural springs, would seem to render it unsuitable for such a large dwelling. It is thought, however, that these springs would have been harnessed into water features in stylised gardens, and that a cult of water nymphs may have been cultivated around this, although this is supposition. To cope with the difficult terrain, the building itself was constructed on four terraces, cut into the hillside and heavily buttressed, which are still evident on the gallery connecting the two main wings of the house. The architectural design of the villa differs greatly from similar dwellings from the same period, given that the main living quarters were in the large eastern wing, and a long gallery of little function connected this wing with the ‘leisure wing’ where the bath house and temple were located. This layout reflects {{the evolution of the}} house over time—the bath house wing was a later expansion—and a consideration of the spatial restrictions of the site.|$|E

40|$|Roughness {{parameters}} as {{the elements}} of surface condition and deformation assessment {{based on the results}} of TLS scanning. Roughness is the attribute of a surface that can be defined as a collection of small surface <b>unevennesses</b> that can be identified optically or detected mechanically which do not result from the surface’s shape and their size depends on a material type as well as on undergone processing. The most often utilised roughness parameters are: Ra - mean distance value of the points on the observed profile from the average line on the sampling length, and Rz - difference between arithmetic mean height of the five highest peaks and arithmetic mean depth of the five deepest valleys regarding to the average line on the length of the measured fragment. In practice, roughness parameters are most often defined for surface elements that require relevant manufacturing or processing through grinding, founding or polishing in order to provide the expected surface roughness. To measure those parameters for the produced elements profilometers are used. In this paper the authors present an alternative approach of determining and utilising such parameters. Instead of the utilising methods based on sampling length measurement, roughness parameters are determined on the basis of point clouds, that represent a surface of rough concrete, obtained through terrestrial laser scanning. The authors suggest using the surface roughness parameter data acquired in this way as a supplementary data in the condition assessment (erosion rate) of surfaces being a part of engineering constructions made of concrete...|$|R
40|$|Two {{small scale}} 'pilot' test {{sections}} {{have been constructed}} in Sterrebeek on a private road without traffic to gain experience with the construction method. These construction works demonstrated that a 'regular' asphalt paver {{can be used for}} onsite PERS constructions. Then a full scale test track has been constructed on a road with regular traffic in Herzele. The result of the first small scale construction was an inhomogeneous test section as the mix hardened too quickly and the construction had to be done in five parts. Skid resistance was not fulfilling the minimum requirement. The amount of accelerator in the mix influences skid resistance significantly. The more accelerator, the more foaming, the less skid resistance. The result of the second small scale construction was a more homogeneous test section with a slightly improved skid resistance, using a mix with less accelerator. Unfortunately, local <b>unevenness's</b> of the surface were caused by infiltration of water during the construction. Both small scale test sections were monitored yielding the following results:" Initial skid resistance was found to be insufficient based on dynamic measurements. It has been improved by sanding the surface with porphyry 0 / 2. An amount of 200 g/m² yields sufficient skid resistance. The sandblasting technique may be used as a solution in case skid resistance problems rise on a trafficked road. Attempts to measure sound absorption on drill cores of laboratory samples indicate that possibly absorption is not affected by sanding but more tests are needed to confirm this. " Drill cores taken from the first test section demonstrate a good adhesion to the sub layer. The adhesion is apparently weakened by some repeated action. Settling of the underlayer by the forces exerted by heavy vehicles is the main suspect. " Test slabs made during the second site construction were tested in laboratory: o Measurements on thin and plane sections reveal an average air void content of 21. 4 % and a good coating of aggregates and rubber by polyurethane. o A permeability of 3. 2 seconds was measured, which is comparable to new two-layer porous asphalt. o Mechanical impedance measurements show an estimated dynamic Young modulus of 526 MPa, which is very high compared to the other tests on PERS that were performed (64 to 208 MPa). o Acoustical absorption was measured on three drill cores. The peak frequencies of were found to be 995, 970 and 980 Hz. The maximum absorption coefficients were found to be 0. 93, 0. 94 and 0. 95. These results are similar to Arnakke. " CPB measurements were performed on the second test sections with a Citroën C 1. A noise reductions of 7. 6 dB(A) at 50 km/h was measured with respect to an old dense asphalt concrete. This is surprisingly high if one keeps in mind the numerous <b>unevenness's</b> which caused tyre vibrations and extra noise. A small speed dependency was observed (more noise reduction at higher speeds). As CPX measurements could not be performed according to the standard and as the test section was too short, no reliable conclusions can be drawn from these measurements on both test sections. The full scale test section showed among others that:" An ordinary asphalt finisher can be used to get a surface with a nice texture and an acceptable evenness; although for the latter there is scope for improvement which is relatively easy to achieve by more practicing with the laying and the compacting" Porphyry 0 / 2 sand can be used to enhance the initial skid resistance, but it wears off after some time before the stone aggregates are exposed by wearing off of the polyurethane film. The skid resistance dropped during the first months without becoming dramatically low and then stabilized" The noise reduction is remarkable: and lies between 6 and 9 dB(A). " A CPB measurement with the same vehicle (Citroën C 1) as in Sterrebeek showed a similar noise reduction: 7. 9 dB(A). " CPX and SPB measurements showed no significant deterioration of the acoustic properties during the nine months the test track existed" Absorption appeared to be relatively low according to field test and quite high according to lab testing (considered the most reliable results). Mechanical impedance relatively high for a poroelastic pavement" Although about 2000 vehicles passed per day over the test track with about 5 % heavy vehicles, this test track showed a remarkable good raveling resistance during the 10 months of its existance. No glimpse of local or global raveling was observed as texture or colour change of the pavement. Neither were loose aggregate ever found in the gutter. " In the 8 th month of its lifetime some loosening was observed at the edge and in the 9 th also some in the first 10 m, apparently caused by settlings in the underlayer which did not resist to the direct exposure of the forces exerted by heavy vehicles. " The situation deteriorated quickly and the experiment had to be aborted in the 10 th month after the construction, i. e. June 2015...|$|R
40|$|Swedish {{agricultural}} soils {{are reported to}} receive an annual application of plant nutrients as fertilizer amounting to a value almost as large the total new-investment made during one year. Poor precision in nutrient supply results in yield decreases and environmental loading. The purpose of this work is to summarize the knowledge available today on factors that influence fertilizer distribution achieved by pneumatic fertilizer spreaders. The work is mainly concentrated on technical design parameters that influences the spreading uniformity parallel to and {{at right angles to}} the direction of travel. The average coefficient of variation for the evenness of spreading of today’s fertilizer spreaders is 25 % in the field. In practise, there is no significant difference between centrifugal spreaders and pneumatic spreaders. During the work of which this report accounts for, 87 Swedish and international references have been studied in order to find factors influencing the result of fertilizer spreading. Factors influencing the spreading result can be divided into: the fertilizer, the machine, the field the weather and the operator. The flow properties of the fertilizer and its tendency to deposit on working mechanism are affected by its physical properties. The particle size distribution influences length of throw, flow properties and tendency of separation. The durability of the fertilizer will affect the particle size distribution. Particle shape and surface texture affect the flow properties. Density influences throw properties. Hygroscopicity influences water uptake and thereby flow properties and tendency to deposit within the machine. Thixotropic fertilizers lead to hard deposits being placed on working mechanisms and transport ducts against which the fertilizer glides. The machine can be divided into fertilizer hopper, feeder mechanism, fan, piping, spreader boom and spreader mechanism. When filling a hopper separation generally occurs. Severe separation influences the resulting distribution. When emptying the hopper the slope of the floor will influence the amount of fertilizer remaining in the hopper. 60 — 65 ° slope of the bottom of the hopper will ensure complete emptying. Metering mechanisms can be divided into active and passive mechanisms. The function of passive mechanisms depend on the flow properties of the fertilizer. The studded roller is a semi-active metering mechanism. Cyclic variations in out-flow may occur in metering devices that measure out the fertilizer in portions, e. g. cell wheels, star wheels and augers. Shaking and slope of hopper influences the mass flow from passive metering mechanisms. The fan is used to transport the fertilizer within the machine. The flow of air can be used to reduce drift caused by wind if both the flow of fertilizer and the flow of air are directed downwards at the spreading mechanism. At high fertilizer application rates the fan-pipe system in modern fertilizer spreaders tend to overload, with pulsating flows as a result. These pulsating flows are reflected in a severe deterioration of the spreading uniformity. The piping functions as a way of transport of the fertilizer. Piping with a high coefficient of friction leads to a rapidly attained even radial distribution of granules in the pipe. Curves induces pressure losses and deteriorated radial distribution in the pipe. Bends immediately before the spreading mechanism should be avoided. Movements of the spreader boom influences the final result of fertilizer spreading. Boom movements occur {{largely as a result of}} the torque of the fertilizer vehicle along its respective longitudinal and vertical axles. The response of a boom suspension to the rolling motion of the vehicle to which it is attached should be such that the boom is insulated from the high frequency random rolling movements but is able to follow the low frequency undulations of the ground. An example of such a boom suspension is found in the literature. In the literature, spreader mechanisms are found in many different shapes. Significant for the majority of them is that their evenness of distribution is sensitive to the radial distribution of granules in the pipe immediately before entering the spreader mechanism. The evenness of distribution is also sensitive to the working height above the ground. The field will through its geometry (shape, slope and bumpiness) affect the working result in form of <b>unevennesses</b> in the spreading pattern, gaps and overlapping. Soil type variations and varying cultivation capacity demand variable application rates. The weather factors that mainly influence the spreading accuracy are wind speed, air temperature and relative humidity. The wind speed influences the length and direction of throw. Air temperature and moisture are together with the temperature of the fertilizer decisive for the water uptake of the fertilizer. Large water uptake will change the flow properties of the fertilizer in a negative direction. The operator is the overall regulator in the "granule spreading system". The operator adjusts and maintain the machine. It is the operator who choses driving technique and the way the work is done. A technically very good fertilizer spreader cannot compensate fully for a bad operator. The operator should have assistance in steering the tractor and information of and possibility to adjust the application rate. What requirements can be placed on the future fertilizer spreader? The requirements placed on the fertilizer spreader of the future involve large control ability, i. e. high spreading accuracy and possibility to continuously vary the application rate. Furthermore, some kind of control over the mass flow of fertilizer will be needed. This review of the literature is concluded with a presentation of a new type of fertilizer spreader. The concept gives precedence to low manufacturing cost, active metering mechanism, variable mass flow and even distribution of fertilizer to the spreader mechanisms...|$|R

Lefebvre {{was also one of the}} first commentators to link uneven development to the production of space on a global scale: [...] "The law of <b>unevenness</b> of growth and development, so far from becoming obsolete, is becoming world-wide in its application — or, more precisely is presiding over the globalization of a world market".|$|E
