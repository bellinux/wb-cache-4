25|$|In Europe, {{liberalism}} has a {{long tradition}} dating back to 17th century. Scholars often split those traditions into British and French versions, with the former version of liberalism emphasising the expansion of democratic values and constitutional reform and the latter rejecting authoritarian political and economic structures, as well as being involved with nation-building. The continental French version was deeply divided between moderates and progressives, with the moderates tending to elitism and the progressives supporting the <b>universalisation</b> of fundamental institutions, such as universal suffrage, universal education and the expansion of property rights. Over time, the moderates displaced the progressives as the main guardians of continental European liberalism. A prominent example of these divisions is the German Free Democratic Party, which was historically divided between national liberal and social liberal factions.|$|E
500|$|The Programme of <b>Universalisation</b> of Elementary Education and {{the five-year}} plans has been accorded the highest {{priority}} {{in order to provide}} free education to all children up to the age of 14 years.The 86th constitutional amendment of 2002 inserted a new article, Article 21-A, into the Constitution, that seeks to provide free and compulsory education to all children aged 6 to 14 years. Welfare schemes for the weaker sections are being implemented both by the Central and State governments. These include programmes such as boys' and girls' hostels for scheduled castes' or scheduled tribes' students. The year 1990-1991 was declared as the [...] "Year of Social Justice" [...] in the memory of B.R. Ambedkar. The government provides free textbooks to students belonging to scheduled castes or scheduled tribes pursuing medicine and engineering courses. During 2002-2003, a sum of Rs. 47.7million was released for this purpose. In order that scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are protected from atrocities, the Government enacted the Prevention of Atrocities Act, which provided severe punishments for such atrocities.|$|E

According to Couturat, [...] "In May 1676, he once again identified the universal language with the characteristic and dreamed of a language that {{would also be a}} calculus—a sort of algebra of thought" [...] (1901, chp 3.).

2500|$|Ethical {{conduct is}} {{justified}} by reasons {{that go beyond}} prudence to [...] "something bigger than the individual," [...] addressing a larger audience. Singer thinks this going-beyond identifies moral reasons as [...] "somehow universal", specifically in the injunction to 'love thy neighbor as thyself', interpreted by him as demanding that one give the same weight {{to the interests of}} others as one gives to one's own interests. This universalising step, which Singer traces from Kant to Hare, is crucial and sets him apart from those moral theorists, from Hobbes to David Gauthier, who tie morality to prudence. <b>Universalisation</b> leads directly to utilitarianism, Singer argues, on the strength of the thought that one's own interests cannot count for more than the interests of others. Taking these into account, one must weigh them up and adopt the course of action that is most likely to maximise the interests of those affected; utilitarianism has been arrived at. Singer's universalising step applies to interests without reference to who has them, whereas a Kantian's applies to the judgments of rational agents (in Kant's kingdom of ends, or Rawls's Original Position, etc.). Singer regards Kantian <b>universalisation</b> as unjust to animals. As for the Hobbesians, Singer attempts a response in the final chapter of Practical Ethics, arguing that self-interested reasons support adoption of the moral point of view, such as 'the paradox of hedonism', which counsels that happiness is best found by not looking for it, and the need most people feel to relate to something larger than their own concerns.|$|E

5000|$|The title, [...] "Systems <b>Universalisation</b> Specialist", or {{was created}} in the 1980s, for someone {{involved}} in Radar and GPS systems. While the idea of a S.U.S. member had been around since World War II, with infantry men operating radio devices and planning out tank movements for the war effort. The term [...] "Systems <b>Universalisation</b> Specialist" [...] comes from three parts. The first part, being [...] "System" [...] is reference to the GPS or Radar systems operated. The second part, [...] "Universalisation" [...] {{comes from the fact that}} all systems should be linked, and connected to each other. This is to ensure that no soldier, nor tank, nor airplane is operating by itself, and that the whole field army is working on a team.|$|E

5000|$|Consequently, Løgstrup is {{critical}} of the emphasis on rule-following and universal principles in most anglophone moral theory.

According to Toulmin, this question will push us to reflect on principles of ever-higher levels of abstraction: [...] "I should always keep my promises," [...] "I should never lie" [...] etc. For Løgstrup, this increasing <b>universalisation</b> leads to a 'moralism' that abstracts from the concrete situation and the needs of the actual person.
