The <b>used</b> <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> was pyrolysed at four temperatures which is 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C and 800 °C. The pyrolysed samples were characterized using Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) to find the carbon content. The parameter involves in this experiment are contact time, pH of solution, initial concentration and carbonization temperature. The Langmuir sorption isotherm was plotted to describe the equilibrium adsorption and the maximum sorption capacities of the bleaching clay towards Pb. From the adsorption kinetics experiment, it was clearly observed that the concentration of Pb decrease as time increased until it reaches the equilibrium time while the uptake capacity increase as time and initial concentration increased. For the effect of pH of adsorption solution, the highest maximum sorption capacity was determined at pH 6 and the carbonization temperature that yields highest sorption capacity is 600 °C.

The major waste generated by these indus-tries is spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clays.</b> It is estimated that about 6000 ton of this waste is generated annually.

Further-more, the disposal of spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> in landfills can cause environmental pollution problems {{in addition to being}} a source of odors and fire hazards. This paper describes a process for the recovery of oil from spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> by solvent extraction followed by reactivation of the deoiled clay by acid treatment.

With the ecological advantage that the acid can be decomposed of biologically and/or chemically. The possibility of managing natural acid clays from the island of Milos, which were generated by natural acid alteration systems. Acid activation of a bentonite can be monitored by N 2 -ad/desorption, IR-spectroscopy, titration, chemical analysis and CEC-determination: The octahedral layering of smectites is dissolved during acid attack. The remaining tetrahedral layer forms an x-ray amorphous, in a sodium-carbonate-solution soluble and porous phases which provides most of the activity. The natural acid alteration of the milosbentonites is comparable to a technical reaction. The activated clay represents a thermodynamically unstable material because of its trend towards recrystallisation of the silicious phase (finally: CT-Opalum). This mineral forms throughout geological periods from the remaining tetrahedral layer. Within 1, 5 years it was not possible to crystallize CT-Opalum from a <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay.</b> However, the effect of time could be monitored by IR-spectroscopy, pore size distribution and the solubility of SiO 2. Mineralogical-chemical characteristics of the rather different natural acid milosbentonites were classified by an „alteration-recrystallization-model“ with respect to mineralogical-genetic aspects as well as applicability. <b>Using</b> <b>bleaching</b> tests a high decolourisation ability with respect to soybean oil of some samples was detected.

40|$|The {{final stage}} of edible soybean oil {{manufacture}} is refining, the most delicate phase of which is bleaching. At this step, undesirable substances are removed, such as pigments, traces of metals, phospholipids and certain degradation products. However, certain valua-ble compounds such as tocopherols and sterols may also be removed, significant loss of oxidative stability can occur, and fatty acid content may increase. To avoid these negative oil changes, bleaching parameters such as the concentration of <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay,</b> temperature and duration should be optimized. Since bleaching conditions depend on {{the properties of the}} <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> {{as well as on the}} type of crude oil, bleaching parameters should be opti-mized with different types of clay for each vegetable oil.

Biodiesel fuel is produced catalytically by transesterification reaction here catches the researcher attention nowadays {{as it is a}} promising alternative diesel fuel (Xie and Yang, 2012). Edible oil industries produce spent <b>bleaching</b> <b>clay</b> (SBC) as their major wastes. Biodiesel is prepared via a catalytic reaction between triglycerides and alcohol. Glycerol is the by-product of the reaction. The reaction involves the breakage of the glycerol structure and exchanges of alkyl group between the alcohol and ester part of the triglycerides molecule; as such, the reaction is known as transesterification (Alba-Rubio et al., 2010). Among the three major routes, transesterification seems to be the best compared to heating and microemulsions for reducing the viscosity as well as minimizing engine complications (Feyzi et al., 2014). Other than that, the transesterification pathway, esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) with alcohols in the presence of acid catalysts also produces methyl esters or biodiesel. One of the main reasons or the conceptualization of biodiesel is the environmental pollution, specifically CO 2 emission. Concerning the CO 2 emission, in 2005 the EU introduced an innovative cost-effective scheme termed the ‘Emission Trading Scheme’ (ETS), a scheme that Australia, New Zealand and the United States are keen to adopt in their long-term plan for dealing with greenhouse gases (Narkhede et al., 2014).
