50|$|During {{calibration}} {{with the}} no-net-flux-method, the microdialysis probe is perfused {{with at least}} four different concentrations of the analyte of interest (Cin) and steady-state concentrations of the analyte leaving the probe are measured in the dialysate (Cout). The recovery for this method can be determined by plotting Cout−Cin over Cin and computing {{the slope of the}} regression line. If analyte concentrations in the perfusate are equal to concentrations at the sampling site, no-net flux occurs. Respective concentrations at the no-net-flux point are represented by the x-intercept of the regression line. The strength of this method is that, at steady-state, no assumptions about the behaviour of the compound {{in the vicinity of the}} probe have to be made, since equilibrium exists at a specific time and place. However, <b>under</b> <b>transient</b> <b>conditions</b> (e.g. after drug challenge), the probe recovery may be altered resulting in biased estimates of the concentrations at the sampling site. To overcome this limitation, several approaches have been developed that are also applicable under non-steady-state conditions. One of these approaches is the dynamic no-net-flux method.|$|E

The {{aim is to}} {{describe}} the irreversibility of energy system <b>under</b> <b>transient</b> <b>conditions</b> more scientifically and to lay foundation for further energy saving <b>under</b> <b>transient</b> <b>conditions.</b> Models for exergy destruction in single-phase heated surfaces of boiler <b>under</b> <b>transient</b> <b>conditions</b> were established. Taking a 1913 t/h-boiler as an example, exergy destructions in single-phase heated surfaces of the boiler were calculated. The results show that exergy destruction in each heated surface under transient condition is mainly related to the difference of temperature and transferred heat. Error occurs when models for steady conditions are used for simulation of transient conditions.

However in wavelet analysis the basis functions could be any permissible wavelets and the results produced are unique to the selected wavelet. Some wavelets are more efficient at encoding, denoising, compressing, decomposing and reconstructing signals than others. It is therefore desirable to select a wavelet that produces the best results for the signal being analyzed.

However, studying {{the evolution of}} morphology during solidification at micrometre scale using experimental techniques is of high cost. Therefore, in this PhD project phase-field (PF) models were developed and applied to simulate the dendritic growth of industrially important steels in a weld pool. The problem of Ohno and Matsuuras proposal to include solid diffusivity in PF simulations is that a priori unknown term associated with the solute flux needs to be input.

The effect of solid diffusivity on the steady-state dendrite under free growth was next investigated, showing that the solid diffusivity of C should be included for Fe-C alloys. The evolution of side branches <b>under</b> the imposed <b>transient</b> <b>conditions</b> by decreasing the velocity was examined because dendrites do not grow under steady state in a weld pool.
