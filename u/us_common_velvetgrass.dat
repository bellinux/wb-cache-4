30|$|Observation-based {{information}} on fuels, postfire occurrence, and postfire seedling establishment {{was available for}} about half of species reviews. This information may have been readily available in the literature because it is easily detected by casual observation; however, it rarely contained enough detail to assess how widely and reliably it could be applied. Fuels information, for example, often consisted of qualitative observations such as a species’ tendency to form dense stands, produce abundant litter, or shade out understory herbs. Quantitative comparisons of fuel characteristics on invaded versus uninvaded sites were much less common; in fact, this information was available in the literature only for the reviews of <b>common</b> <b>velvetgrass</b> (Gucker 2008), <b>common</b> buckthorn (Zouhar 2011), and black locust (Stone 2009 c).|$|R

30|$|Six species {{reviews in}} this project had more than 20 sources with observation-based fire {{information}} (Table 4), but coverage of fire topics was uneven and the information often had limited applicability to wildland management. For example, fire information on Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolius) was relatively plentiful (probably because it occurs in ecosystems that are managed with frequent prescribed fire [e.g., Loope and Dunevitz 1981, Gunderson 1983, Doren et al. 1991, Dooley 2003]), {{but most of it}} addressed fuel characteristics and none addressed heat tolerance of seed or postfire seedling establishment (Meyer 2011). In contrast, 40 sources provided observation-based information on fire topics for the sweetclovers (Melilotus alba and M. officinalis), but none addressed fire regimes or fuels (Gucker 2009 d). While fire information on weeping lovegrass and <b>common</b> <b>velvetgrass</b> (Holcus lanatus) seemed abundant, most of it came from research in US deserts (e.g., see Brooks 2008, Rice et al. 2008), so it had limited application to management in the eastern states. Furthermore, much of the information on weeping lovegrass addressed the use of prescribed fire to increase its productivity as a forage species (McIlvain and Shoop 1970, Klett et al. 1971), information with little relevance for managers attempting to reduce the species’ abundance in wildlands. Because substantial resources must be invested to locate field sites for a study and carry out fire treatments, it seems unfortunate that few studies provide complete descriptions of burning conditions and fire behavior, and few report details that are easily observed in the field, such as whether individuals establishing after fire were seedlings or sprouts.|$|R

We find substantial common area wide component, that {{can be related to}} common euro area monetary policy, to exchange rate and oil prices changes. The effects of the area wide factors differ across regions, however. We also find a substantial national component. Our findings do not differ substantially before and after EMU.
