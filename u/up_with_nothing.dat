5|$|Napoleon III {{had tried}} to secure {{territorial}} concessions from both sides {{before and after the}} Austro-Prussian War, but despite his role as mediator during the peace negotiations, he ended <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>nothing.</b> He then hoped that Austria would join in a war of revenge and that its former allies—particularly the southern German states of Baden, Württemberg, and Bavaria—would join in the cause. This hope would prove futile since the 1866 treaty came into effect and united all German states militarily—if not happily—to fight against France. Instead of a war of revenge against Prussia, supported by various German allies, France engaged in a war against all of the German states without any allies of its own. The reorganization of the military by von Roon and the operational strategy of Moltke combined against France to great effect. The speed of Prussian mobilization astonished the French, and the Prussian ability to concentrate power at specific points—reminiscent of Napoleon I's strategies seventy years earlier—overwhelmed French mobilization. Utilizing their efficiently laid rail grid, Prussian troops were delivered to battle areas rested and prepared to fight, whereas French troops had to march for considerable distances to reach combat zones. After a number of battles, notably Spicheren, Wörth, Mars la Tour, and Gravelotte, the Prussians defeated the main French armies and advanced on the primary city of Metz and the French capital of Paris. They captured Napoleon III and took an entire army as prisoners at Sedan on 1 September 1870.|$|E
25|$|Many of the European comics {{based on}} the Disney Universe have created {{their own version of}} Scrooge McDuck, usually {{involving}} him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s-1980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero dragging his long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or blunderbuss, or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings {{up at the end of}} the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb – something which Scrooge shows little concern for – he tends to end <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
500|$|Abbott {{stated that}} there were two reasons for what he {{considered}} to be the show's failure. The first was Rodgers and Hammerstein's overconfidence; they thought of themselves as Broadway's [...] "Golden Boys" [...] who could do no wrong. The other was the play-within-the-play, which had not been thoroughly thought out by anyone. According to Abbott, Hammerstein remained [...] "positively Sphinx-like" [...] on the subject. At a loss to understand the characters of the play-within-the play, Alton came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> more than routine song-and-dance numbers. During the run, the duo approached choreographer Jerome Robbins and asked him if he could fix the dances. Robbins said that he could, but he would not, as [...] "it would kill Bob Alton". According to Hammerstein biographer Hugh Fordin, [...] " [...] intended contrast between onstage and backstage life was never achieved because the onstage show was so tepid and confusing." ...|$|E

30|$|After a {{while the}} site manager stops the work with taping joints and says that the {{architect}} is coming by to show them how the taping {{is supposed to be}} done. Note that the teacher already has instructed the students. This break takes a couple of hours, which results in the students lapsing into a passive mode. The architect arrives at the project when there are two hours left of the day. The first hour goes to discussing with the teachers and site manager how the taping should be done. This is followed by a practical instruction from the architect that lasts one hour. The students pay less and less notice to his instruction. After 45 minutes one student says, “But it is just taping” with which the architect agrees. So, this day that was supposed to start with mounting windows ends <b>up</b> <b>with</b> doing <b>nothing.</b> The students’ reaction to this is frustration. The day started with a ‘perfect’ introduction, just to end <b>up</b> <b>with</b> doing <b>nothing.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{next day}} Captain Robert Barrie of Pomone had boats from Pomone and Scout tow their ships {{close to the}} French vessels. After a 90-minute engagement, Giraffe and Nourrice caught fire. (French records report that their crews set the two vessels on fire to prevent their being {{captured}} and then abandoned them.) Brands from Nourrice {{set fire to the}} merchant vessel. Barrie had the British withdraw, awaiting the explosion of the French vessels. The battery and the tower fell silent. Shortly thereafter the Giraffe exploded, and then so did Nourrice. Some of the timbers from Nourrice fell on the tower, demolishing it, with further sparks setting fire to the shore battery, which also blew <b>up.</b> <b>With</b> <b>nothing</b> left to accomplish, the British withdrew. The action cost the British two men killed and 25 wounded, including three men wounded on Scout. French casualties were six dead and 30 wounded.|$|E

Had not Wilfred Merrifield always been a cavalier of her own?

60|$|In January {{the whole}} family went to London, the object of many of Marian's terrors. Caroline and Clara were both sorry to go, and the boys lamented exceedingly; Lionel saying {{it was very hard}} that the last two months before his going to school should be spent boxed <b>up</b> there, <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> to do. Indeed the life of the schoolroom party was here more {{monotonous}} than that at Oakworthy; for besides the constant regularity of lessons, there was now no variety in the walks; they only paced round the square, or on fine days went as far as the park.|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{could it}} come to {{anything}} else?' he said, his face full of sorrow and severity. 'I was mad to suppose there was any hope for such a temper of pride and stubbornness. Yet,' he added, softening, and his quick, stern eyes filling with tears, 'it is a noble nature,--high-minded, uncompromising, deeply tender, capable of anything. It has been a cruel wicked thing to ruin all by education. What could come of it? A life of struggle with women who had no notion of an appeal to principle and affection--growing <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> worthy of her love and respect--her very generosity becoming a stumbling-block, till her pride and waywardness have come to such an indomitable pitch that they are devouring all that was excellent.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{scene was}} one {{to set off}} any figure of {{distinction}} that entered on it, and certainly when Mr. and Mrs. Grandcourt entered, no beholder could deny that their figures had distinction. The bridegroom had neither more nor less easy perfection of costume, neither more nor less well-cut impassibility of face, than before his marriage. It was to be supposed of {{him that he would}} put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> less than the best in outward equipment, wife included; and the bride was what he might have been expected to choose. [...] "By George, I think she's handsomer, if anything!" [...] said Mr. Vandernoodt. And Deronda was of the same opinion, but he said nothing. The white silk and diamonds--it may seem strange, but she did wear diamonds on her neck, in her ears, in her hair--might {{have something to do with}} the new imposingness of her beauty, which flashed on him as more unquestionable if not more thoroughly satisfactory than when he had first seen her at the gaming-table. Some faces which are peculiar in their beauty are like original works of art: for the first time they are almost always met with question. But in seeing Gwendolen at Diplow, Deronda had discerned in her more than he had expected of that tender appealing charm which we call womanly. Was there any new change since then? He distrusted his impressions; but as he saw her receiving greetings with what seemed a proud cold quietude and a superficial smile, there seemed to be at work within her the same demonic force that had possessed her when she took him in her resolute glance and turned away a loser from the gaming-table. There was no time for more of a conclusion--no time even for him to give his greeting before the summons to dinner.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Lister {{looked at}} him earnestly. [...] "I think you will do, youngster," [...] he said approvingly, [...] "that is the right spirit. There {{is a lot of}} rough fun and larking in a regiment, and the man that goes through it best, is he who can take a joke good-temperedly {{as long as it does}} not go beyond the bounds of moderation, but who is ready to resent any wilful insult: but I think you would be very wise to do as you say. Half an hour in a pistol-gallery every day is likely to be of vastly more use to you than any amount of Russian. The {{reputation}} that a man is a crack shot with a pistol will do more than anything in the world to keep him out of quarrels. Here at the depôt at any rate, where the fellows are for the most part young, it would certainly save you a good deal of annoyance if it were known that, although not by any means a quarrelsome fellow, you were determined to put <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>nothing</b> beyond good-humoured jokes. Well, lad, I don't want to interfere with your hobby, only I advise you not to ride it too hard, at any rate at first. When the men all know you and get to like you, and see that, apart from this fancy of yours, you are an all-round good fellow, as I can see you are, they will let you go your own way. At any rate, as captain of your troop, I will do all I can to make things pleasant for you, but don't forget about the pistol practice. At a depôt like this, where there are half a dozen regiments represented, you will meet with a larger proportion of disagreeable men than you would in your own ante-room. You see, if colonels have such men, they are glad enough to rid the regiment of them by leaving them at the depôt, and any serious trouble is more likely to come from one of them than from anyone in your own regiment." ...|$|E
