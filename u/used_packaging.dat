50|$|Among fresh-cut produce Equilibrium Modified Atmosphere Packaging (EMAP) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} <b>used</b> <b>packaging</b> technology. When packaging vegetables and fruits the gas atmosphere of package is not air (O2 21%; CO2 0.038%; N2 78%) but consists usually of a lowered level of O2 and a heightened level of CO2. This kind of package slows down the normal respiration of the product to prolong its shelf-life. Of course there are other factors, like {{the size of the}} product, severity of preparation, maturity of the product and type of tissue that have an effect to the shelf-life of EMA packaged produce.|$|E
50|$|Over the years, other {{styles of}} {{artificial}} Christmas trees have evolved and become popular.

Another type of artificial tree is the aluminum Christmas tree, first manufactured in Chicago in 1958, and later in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, {{where the majority of}} the trees were produced. Most modern artificial Christmas trees are made from plastic recycled from <b>used</b> <b>packaging</b> materials, such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Approximately 10% of artificial Christmas trees are using virgin suspension PVC resin; despite being plastic most artificial trees are not recyclable or biodegradable.|$|E

50|$|When {{selecting}} packaging films (web substrates) for EMAP {{of fruits}} and vegetables the main characteristics to consider are gas permeability, water vapour transmission rate, mechanical properties, transparency, type of package and sealing reliability. Traditionally <b>used</b> <b>packaging</b> films like LDPE (low-density polyethylene), PVC (polyvinyl chloride), EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate) and OPP (oriented polypropylene) are not permeable enough for highly respiring products like fresh-cut produce, mushrooms and broccoli. As fruits and vegetables are respiring products, {{there is a need to}} transmit gases through the film. Films designed with these properties are called permeable films. Other films, called barrier films, are designed to prevent the exchange of gases and are mainly used with non-respiring products like meat and fish.|$|E
50|$|More recently, in 2007, The Netherlands {{introduced}} a Waste Fund that {{is funded by}} a carbon-based packaging tax. This tax was both used to finance the national Treasury and to finance the activities to help reach the goals of recycling 65% of <b>used</b> <b>packaging</b> by 2012. The organization Nedvang (Nederland van afval naar grondstof or The Netherlands from waste to value), which {{was set up in}} 2005, is the organization supporting producers and importers of packaged goods reaching individual company goals under the Dutch packaging decree. This decree was signed in 2005 and states that producers and importers of packaged goods are responsible for the collection and recycling of that waste, and that at least 65% of that wast has to be recycled. Producers and importers can choose to reach the goals on an individual basis or by joining an organization like Nedvang.|$|E
50|$|Reverse {{logistics}} {{has become}} an important extension within the supply chain as it carries high potentials to achieve a sustainable distribution process that fulfills both environmental and social needs. It deals with reclaiming <b>used</b> <b>packaging</b> as well as unsold and end-of-life products {{that have to be}} disposed in order to make materials available for recycling or reuse. By taking back waste and packaging, appropriate and environmental-friendly recycling of the product’s components and materials can be ensured {{while at the same time}} reducing the amount of waste brought to landfills. Additionally, vehicle loadings can be optimized as empty return trips of trucks employed for distribution processes are avoided in case they take back materials. By combining and implementing these measures, producers can substantially improve their environmental performance and comply with the requirements given by the so-called life-cycle approach.|$|E

50|$|The {{earliest}} {{integrated circuits}} were packaged in ceramic flat packs, which the military used {{for many years}} for their reliability and small size. Commercial circuit packaging quickly moved to the dual in-line package (DIP), first in ceramic and later in plastic. In the 1980s VLSI pin counts exceeded the practical limit for DIP packaging, leading to pin grid array (PGA) and leadless chip carrier (LCC) packages. Surface mount packaging appeared in the early 1980s and became popular in the late 1980s, using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull-wing or J-lead, as exemplified by small-outline integrated circuit — a carrier which occupies an area about 30 - 50% less than an equivalent DIP, with a typical thickness that is 70% less.The next big innovation was the area array package, which places the interconnection terminals throughout the surface area of the package, providing {{a greater number of}} connections than previous package types where only the outer perimeter is used. The first area array package was a ceramic pin grid array package. Not long after, the plastic ball grid array (BGA), another type of area array package, {{became one of the most}} commonly <b>used</b> <b>packaging</b> techniques.|$|E

The scrap dealers remove nails and screws and the material is sold in retail by weight to the user. Design Circle, Bangalore, India have been re-purposing <b>used</b> <b>packaging</b> timber and plywood from 2004 onwards. The packaging timber from scrap dealers is processed further to suit different product categories like toys, educational products, lifestyle accessories, physiotherapy products, play and furniture using regular woodworking techniques. Value addition to the material is done by glue lamination transforming the packaging timber into solid timber sections with expensive feel and look. The constrained availability of the raw material calls for design of low quantity and high quality production. The paper presents product examples for different sections of the pyramid, designed and executed at design circle, Bangalore. The paper points the constraints, fresh avenues, sustainable practices in raw material procurement and in product design. The paper emphasizes the importance of re-purposing of a renewable, sustainable, material like timber after serving its originally intended purpose...|$|E
