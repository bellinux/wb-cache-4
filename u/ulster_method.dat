40|$|The {{spectrum}} of fungal diversity associated with rape seeds belonging to 33 cultivars (Alaska, Astrada, Astrid, Atlantic, Betty, Champlein, Chayenne, Dexter, Digger, Elvis, Eurowest, Finesse, Herkules, Hydromel, Hydromel-MA, Ladoga, anitoba, Masa Rom, Milena, Mohican, Montego, Nectar, Ontario, Orkan, Perla (4 lots), Remy, Robust, Rodeo, Saphir, Tiger, Tiger CBC Lot ROM 06 - 121 - 110, Triangle, Valesca, Vectra) and 2 hybrids (H- 90 - 20 - 83, H- 90 - 21 - 83) {{has been established}} by samples’ macroscopical and microscopical analizying, during 2006 - 2008, {{for the first time}} in Romania. The <b>Ulster</b> <b>method</b> on malt-agar and PDA culture media has been used, evaluating the percentage of fungal taxons present on/in rape seeds. The most important pathogenic fungi identified were: Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary, Botrytis cinerea Pers., Rhizoctonia solani Kühn, Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc., A. brassicicola (Schwein.) Wiltshire and Fusarium spp. Also, a large quantities of some saprophytic fungi, as Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Rhizopus have been recorded. These ones have been affected the health condition of rape seeds, suppressing their germination and other vital phenomena. Among potential antagonistic fungi the following genera have been isolated: Chaetomium (0 - 4 %), Trichoderma (0 - 10 %), Aspergillus (0 - 14 %), Penicillium (0 - 100 %). Some correlations and comparisons have been established between fungal diversity, their provenience, cultivars, culture media (Malt-Agar/MA, Potato-Dextrose-Agar/PDA) used. It has been evaluated the behaviour of rape cultivars and hybrids towards the main rape seed pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Marking {{assignments}} is a {{time consuming}} activity which is further exacerbated by the need for regular submission and quick turn around time. At the University of <b>Ulster,</b> online assessment <b>methods</b> have been adopted {{in order to address}} the pressing problem of coping with large student numbers. The `TopClass' system is used to provide a vehicle for the regular assessment of more than 400 students studying `Networks and data communications'. This paper outlines the experience gained through large scale use of automated assessment...|$|R
50|$|Ferric {{reducing}} {{ability of}} plasma (FRAP, also Ferric ion reducing antioxidant power) is an antioxidant capacity assay that uses Trolox as a standard. The FRAP assay was first performed by Iris Benzie and J. J. Strain of the Human Nutrition Research Group at the University of <b>Ulster,</b> Coleraine. The <b>method</b> {{is based on}} the formation of O-Phenanthroline-Fe(2+) complex and its disruption in the presence ofchelating agents. This assay is often used to measure the antioxidant capacity of foods, beverages and nutritional supplements containing polyphenols.|$|R
