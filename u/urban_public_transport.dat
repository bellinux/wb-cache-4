5|$|Greater Manchester's {{railway network}} {{historically}} suffered from poor north–south connections {{due to the}} fact that Manchester's main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, were built in the 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester City Centre. The central commercial district had no rail links, and over the years, a number of unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester's rail termini. In the 1960s, transport design studies were undertaken to address the problems of increasing traffic congestion. A number of <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> <b>transport</b> schemes were evaluated for Manchester, including several types of monorail systems and metro-style systems.|$|E

A partial solution of this problem is achieved by the introduction of high-quality <b>public</b> <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> of passengers that enables faster and more efficient transport. Since the introduction of individual forms of <b>public</b> <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> depends on several factors, such as economic, traffic, environmental and technical ones, the problem is often a very complex one. The implementation of trolleybuses represents one of the forms of passenger transportation in <b>public</b> <b>urban</b> <b>transport.</b> It is the most favourable electrical vehicle for <b>public</b> <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> when the implementation of a rail system is not affordable. Looking through history, the trolleybus has experienced significant changes in the implementation, in a large number of world urban environments. This paper points out the unjustifiable neglect of trolleybus in the implementation for the <b>public</b> <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> and the renewed increase in the interest for its implementation. The advantages and drawbacks of the trolleybus are listed in relation to buses, as well as the reasons due to which some {{cities in the}} world are introducing it or increasing its implementation. The paper also emphasises and provides arguments of the ecological and energy advantages of trolleybuses in relation to buses as crucial in advanced <b>public</b> <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> of passengers. Also, advanced technical solutions are pointed out that contribute to safer, faster and more comfortable transport of passengers.

30|$|In this section, we need {{to precise}} some {{definitions}} of used names. “Gare Lille Flandres” means the “Gare Lille Flandres” railway station. “Gare Lille Flandres Interchange” means the interchange composed of the “Gare Lille Flandres” railway station and the metro and tramway stations bearing the same name linked with the other <b>public</b> <b>transports</b> such as buses, free access bikes named V’Lille and free access car system named Lilas. The same distinction occurs for the “Gare Lille Europe” that is the railway station and the “Gare Lille Europe Interchange” that combines the entire <b>urban</b> <b>public</b> <b>transports</b> and the future private coaches station.|$|R
