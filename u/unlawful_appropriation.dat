RS Art 8 2 (a) (iv) provides some allowance for requisition, due to military necessity. Even so it must be legal, as the provision prohibits the extensive, <b>unlawful,</b> or wanton <b>appropriation</b> of civilian property.

40|$|Text in AfrikaansTheft in South African law {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{well-known}} common law crimes. It is also one of the crimes in respect of which opinions vary considerably. Furtum possessionis {{is one of the}} manifestations of the crime of theft at common law. The general requirements of furtum possessionis were already established in Roman law. Emphasis was not placed on the taker of the thing but on the particular position of the person who was deprived of the property. This approach was also followed in Roman-Dutch law. Fur tum possessionis in South African law can be defined as follows: It is the <b>unlawful</b> and intentional <b>appropriation</b> by the owner or someone else of a movable corporeal thing in commercio, in circumstances in which the possessor of the thing has a valid right of retention of the thing, with the intention of depriving the possessor permanently of control of the thing. Theft in the form of furtum possessionis differs in an important respect from theft in the form of the removal of a thing. In the case of removal the complainant can also be a person acting as a holder, that is someone exercising control of the thing on behalf of the owner. In the case of furtum possessionis the complainant is the person with the right of retention and from whose possession the thing is taken away. The accused either possesses the thing as an owner or as a holder before possession of the thing was transferred to the complainant. Mere possession is not enough. The possession of the complainant has to be accompanied by a right to retention. Furthermore the possession of the thing has to be lawfulCriminal and Procedural LawLL. M.

The ordinary observer test relies on whether the accused work captures the total feel of the copyrighted work, but overlooks an essential aspect of <b>unlawful</b> <b>appropriation</b> and copyright law – the idea that only particular elements of a work are copyrightable. If a jury is exposed to expert testimony regarding probative similarity before making their evaluation, it is unlikely they will forget such evidence when evaluating the illicit copying. A better test for infringement would be one that allows the ordinary observer, representative of the intended audience, to detect {{whether there is a}} similarity in the works, exclusive of an expert’s opinion.

Almost ninety-one percent of the United States population listens to music, and spends more than twenty-four hours a week listening to their favorite songs—making music {{one of the top}} forms of entertainment for most Americans. Music has unique qualities that differentiate it from other works of authorship, which must be recognized by copyright law. The current subjective measure used to determine <b>unlawful</b> <b>appropriation</b> of copyrightable work is not sufficient. A minority of courts have expanded the current “ordinary observer” standard to consider the “intended audience” of the specific work—claiming the “ordinary observer” lacks the necessary skill and expertise to properly test for subjective copying. This Note argues that the Intended Audience Test should apply in all music copyright infringement cases as a better measure for <b>unlawful</b> <b>appropriation.</b> A change in the subjective test is necessary to foster a more accurate measure of malicious copying versus music production with use of musical influences; to align with today’s landscape of individualized and highly personal consumption of music; and to better promote the main purpose of copyright law, which is to foster the greatest amount and highest quality of creative works in the public domain...|$|E

30|$|Examination {{confirms}} that pillage is {{included as a}} crime in the statutes of the ad hoc tribunals and other international courts, often under the synonyms of plunder, looting, and spoliation. It is generally accepted, nonetheless, that these terms are synonymous legally. Moreover, it is widely considered that they all relate to a wide definition of the varieties and forms of civilian property theft (Bing Bing 2002; Stewart 2011; Keenan 2014). The UN ICTY [2009], significantly, simply defined pillage as ‘embracing all forms of <b>unlawful</b> <b>appropriation</b> of property in armed conflict for which individual criminal responsibility attaches under international law.’ The Statute of the UN ICTY [2009] maintains individual criminal responsibility under CIHL, to be defined as ‘A person who planned, instigated, ordered, committed or otherwise aided and abetted in the planning, preparation or execution of a crime (…)’. The ICRC (2006) Business and International Humanitarian Law guidance document highlights the criminal responsibility of all those involved in pillage through forced displacement. Previous research by various authors has found that pillage is aligned with theft in the domestic law of most countries (Herik and Jong 2011 et al.). Pillage has been recognized as a crime in legislation {{as early as the}} Lieber Code of 1863, which prohibited pillage or sacking under the penalty of death (Stewart 2011).|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{researches}} {{the interpretation}} of the basic principles of international space law as they relate and apply to the activity of the exploitation of the natural resources in space, both of outer space sensu stricto and of celestial bodies. In so doing, it focuses on the non-appropriation principle of Article II of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and its alleged incompatibility with the exploitation of celestial bodies. The thesis analyses the predominant view in space law doctrine that a creative interpretation of the main principles of the Outer Space Treaty is necessary {{in order to meet the}} proclaimed need of legal certainty through the establishment of a system of property rights over resources from celestial bodies. The suggested solution prevailing in legal scholarship necessitates a strict distinction between areas and resources in outer space, and between the material resources from celestial bodies and the immaterial resources of space sensu stricto, so as to exclude the material resources from celestial bodies from the physical scope of application of Article II. On the basis of a thorough analysis of the concepts of celestial bodies and natural resources as employed in the outer space treaties, the thesis argues against the predominant scholarly approach as being ill-founded and impractical. Alternatively, the thesis paves the way for an approach that does not depend on capricious exceptions to the scope of the non-appropriation principle but rather on a clear delineation between the activities of lawful exploitation and <b>unlawful</b> <b>appropriation.</b> It does so by illuminating the basic principles of international space law as they relate to the use of orbital positions by satellites, regulated by the International Telecommunication Union, and extrapolating these findings to the material resources of celestial bodies. In so doing, an alternative understanding of the legal limits of lawful resource exploitation is developed that precludes the need for a strict property regime in outer space, and, thereby, the problematic interpretation of the scope of application of the non-appropriation principle. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The property-information {{interface}} {{is perhaps}} the most crucial and under-theorized dimension of property law. Information about property can make or break property rights. Information about assets and property rights can dramatically enhance the value of ownership. Conversely, dearth of information can significantly reduce the benefit associated with ownership. It is surprising, therefore, that contemporary property theorists do not engage in sustained analysis of the property-information interface and in particular of registries — the repositories of information about property. Once, things were different. In the past, discussions of registries used to be a core topic in property classes and a focal point for property scholarship. In recent decades, registries have lost their luster for scholars, and their discussion has been relegated to the innermost pages of property textbooks. The {{reason for this is that}} registries are widely considered the domain of legal practitioners, not of theorists. We argue that nothing could be further from the truth. Registries and the information they contain are, in fact, the formative forces that shape the world of property and no theoretical account of the institution of property can be complete without them. In this Essay, we offer the first in-depth legal-theoretical analysis of the intricate relationship among title information, rights and assets in the domain of property, as mediated by registries. Our analysis gives rise to several new insights. First, we highlight the triple role that registries perform for property owners. They simultaneously perform a facilitative role by streamlining transactions between willing sellers and buyers, an obstructive rule by hindering non-consensual encroachments and takings of assets, and an enabling role by allowing owners to locate and use their own lost assets. Second, going against the accepted lore, we posit that perfect registries, even if they were possible, are socially undesirable on account on what we call “the information/asset paradox. ” Perfect information about assets and legal rights may result in the destruction, dismembering and mutilation of the asset by non-consensual takers in an attempt to make the asset unrecognizable, as exemplified by millions of stolen cars and jewelry, or, conversely, to attempts to engage in “identity theft” in order to give thieves the benefit of the registered rights. Third, we argue that the registries are socially desirable when it is impossible or difficult to alter the defining characteristic of the underlying asset. This insight explains why there are registries for non-transformable assets, such as land and unique artworks, but not for transformable assets that include mass production goods and many natural resources. Finally, we address the question of which rights should be covered by registries and how much legal deference should be given to them. The framework we provide is significant not only for theoretical reasons, but also for practical ones. For example, it can inform policymakers in deciding whether to establish new registries for smart-phones and personal computers in order to combat theft of such devices. Similarly, our analysis sounds a cautionary note about the ability of registries of copyrighted works to curb <b>unlawful</b> <b>appropriation</b> and distribution. Per our analysis, such assets are infinitely malleable and, worse yet, information concerning ownership in such works can be easily effaced or altered in the digital age. We also discuss how considerations of costs and privacy affect the comprehensiveness and integrity of registries. At the end of the day, our analysis exposes the promise and the limitations of registries, as well as the ways in which they can be improved by the state...|$|E
