5|$|Fighters <b>Uncaged</b> is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters <b>Uncaged</b> {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings and opponents. Simon is able to go up in leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters <b>Uncaged</b> received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as the biggest issue they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E

However, the delivery of <b>uncaging</b> light into the cytosol can vary between cell types, individual cells of the same type, and different loci within an individual cell because of optical differences in absorbance and light-scattering properties of the cytoplasm. Here, we demonstrate a simple technique for monitoring the magnitude of cytosolic ultraviolet delivery during <b>uncaging,</b> which also leaves a quantitative and persistent record of this within the cells. The simple method shown here provides a much needed universal monitor of the delivery of ultraviolet light to molecules within the cytosol, providing a much needed parameter for the correct interpretation of <b>uncaging</b> experiments...|$|R

Although we found that GABAA-mediated currents were diffusely distributed along the dendrites, currents elicited at the branch points of the apical dendritic trunk were approximately two times larger than those elsewhere in the dendrite. We examined the inhibitory action of the GABA-induced currents on Ca 2 + transients evoked with a single back-propagating action potential (bAP) in oblique dendrites. We found that GABA <b>uncaging</b> selectively inhibited the Ca 2 + transients in the region adjacent (, 20 mm) to the <b>uncaging</b> site, and that GABA <b>uncaging</b> was effective only within a short period after bAP (, 20 ms). The strength of inhibition was linearly related to the amplitudes of the GABA currents, suggesting that the currents inhibited a sustained, subthreshold after-depolarization without preventing propagation of bAP. GABA <b>uncaging</b> at the dendritic branch points inhibited Ca 2 + transients farther into dendritic branches (. 20 mm). Our data indicate that GABA inhibition results in spatially confined inhibition of Ca 2 + transients shortly after bAP...|$|R
40|$|Photoactivation of caged biomolecules {{has become}} a {{powerful}} approach to study cellular signalling events. Here we report a method for anchoring and <b>uncaging</b> biomolecules exclusively at the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane by employing a photocleavable, sulfonated coumarin derivative.

We synthesized arachidonic acid derivatives bearing the new negatively charged or a neutral, membrane-permeant coumarin caging group to locally induce signalling either at the plasma membrane or on internal membranes in b-cells and brain slices derived from C 57 B 1 / 6 mice. <b>Uncaging</b> at the plasma membrane triggers a strong enhancement of calcium oscillations in b-cells and a pronounced potentiation of synaptic transmission while <b>uncaging</b> inside cells blocks calcium oscillations in b-cells and causes a more transient effect on neuronal transmission, respectively.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{evaluates the}} o-hydroxycinnamic {{platform}} for designing efficient caging groups with fluorescence reporting upon one- and two-photon excitation. The model cinnamates are easily prepared in one step by coupling commercial or readily available synthons. They exhibit a large one-photon absorption {{that can be}} tuned in the near-UV range. <b>Uncaging</b> after one-photon excitation was investigated by 1 H NMR, UV-vis absorption, and steady-state fluorescence emission. In the whole investigated series, the caged substrate is quantitatively released upon photolysis. At the same time, <b>uncaging</b> releases a strongly fluorescent coproduct {{that can be used}} as a reporter for quantitative substrate delivery. The quantum yield of double bond photoisomerization leading to <b>uncaging</b> after one-photon absorption mostly lies in the 10 % range. Taking advantage of the favorable photophysical properties of the <b>uncaging</b> coproduct, we use a series of techniques based on fluorescence emission to measure the action <b>uncaging</b> cross sections with two-photon excitation of the present cinnamates. Exhibiting values in the 1 - 10 GM range at 750 nm, they satisfactorily compare with the most efficient caging groups reported to date. Noticeably, the <b>uncaging</b> behavior with two-photon excitation is retained in vivo as suggested by the results observed in living zebrafish embryos. Reliable structure property relationships were extracted from analysis of the present collected data. In particular, the careful kinetic analysis allows us to discuss the relevance of the o-hydroxycinnamic platform for diverse caging applications with one- and two-photon excitation...|$|R
500|$|Fighters <b>Uncaged</b> is a single-player-only {{fighting}} game controlled {{using the}} Kinect, a motion sensing input device. The player controls {{the protagonist of}} the game, Simon, through his attempts to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. The game features one gamemode called [...] "Fight" [...] which is only accessible after completing the tutorial. Fighters <b>Uncaged</b> is played in an over-the-shoulder perspective, with the opponent being on the opposite side. Simon {{is able to do}} a range of different actions, including short and long punches, kicks, blocks, dodges, and headbutts. The player can execute special moves via shouting {{in the direction of the}} Kinect, once the corresponding bar is full. Fighting consists of looking for telegraphs in the movements of one's opponents to figure out when to dodge or block attacks, then hitting them while they are vulnerable. In the early stages Fighters <b>Uncaged,</b> it is made less difficult to read the telegraphs of the opponent, but as the player progresses, they become increasingly imperceptible. The moves Simon can complete depend on where the opponent is at the time, and therefore only certain moves will land hits at particular moments. Fighters <b>Uncaged</b> features different leagues, with higher leagues being reached by having a certain number of points. Points are obtained by defeating the opponent, while having a good score. Good scores are attained by accomplishing counter attacks, exploiting the enemies weak spots, and correctly completing combos. If a good score is not secured at the end of the fight, no points are rewarded.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{evaluated}} the o-nitrobenzyl platform for designing photolabile protecting groups with red-shifted absorption {{that could be}} photolyzed upon one- and two-photon excitation. Several synthetic pathways to build different conjugated o-nitrobenzyl backbones, {{as well as to}} vary the benzylic position, are reported. Relative to the reference 4, 5 -dimethoxy- 2 -nitrobenzyl group, several o-nitrobenzyl derivatives exhibit a large and red-shifted one-photon absorption within the near-UV range. <b>Uncaging</b> after one-photon excitation was studied by measuring UV-visible absorption and steady-state fluorescence emission on model caged ethers and esters. In the whole series investigated, the caged substrates were released cleanly upon photolysis. Quantum yields of <b>uncaging</b> after one-photon absorption lie within the 0. 1 - 1 % range. We observed that these drop as the maximum wavelength absorption of the o-nitrobenzyl protecting group is increased. A new method based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) after two-photon excitation was used to measure the action <b>uncaging</b> cross section for two-photon excitation. The series of o-nitrobenzyl caged fluorescent coumarins investigated exhibit values within the 0. 1 - 0. 01 Goeppert-Mayer (GM) range. Such results are in line with the low quantum yields of <b>uncaging</b> associated with cross-sections of 1 - 50 GM for two-photon absorption.
