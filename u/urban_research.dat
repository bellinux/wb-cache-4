40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some central {{theoretical and}} methodological constructs {{in the field}} of <b>urban</b> ecologies, identifies <b>research</b> gaps in the field, and uses the Victoria Laboratory of Urban Ecologies (VALUE) as a case study illustrating possible directions of future <b>urban</b> ecologies <b>research.</b> It begins by tracing the theoretical roots of urban ecologies before reviewing contemporary urban ecologies studies throughout the world. Two critical gaps in <b>urban</b> ecologies <b>research</b> are identified, suggesting opportunities for future studies. The paper then introduces the research teams and projects of VALUE – a research centre hosted by the School of Architecture and Building at Deakin University. The paper concludes that the research activities in VALUE are at the edge of <b>urban</b> ecologies <b>research</b> due to the interdisciplinary nature of collaboration in and between project teams, which have thus been able to address gaps in <b>urban</b> ecologies <b>research</b> and make important contributions to the field...|$|R

Between 2000 and 2010, it increased by 45%. The Asian {{ethnic groups in}} Harris County have differing levels of educational attainment, religion, political views, and income. During that year, in Harris County, 50% of the county's Asian immigrants have postgraduate degrees. As of 2013 28% of Harris County Asians have household incomes of over $75,000. The report stated that many Asians were in earlier stages of careers and were younger, leading to lower incomes. Of Indian and Pakistani residents, the second most educated Asian group in the county, behind Taiwanese, 71% have university or post-graduate degrees and 2% did not finish high school. Of Vietnamese, the least educated Asian group in the county, 30% have university or post-graduate degrees and 20% did not finish high school.|$|E
25|$|In 1966 {{the state}} {{designated}} Pitt as a state-related university, which {{allows it to}} receive public funds (currently more than $160 million per year). This allows the university to offer reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents, but it remains under independent control. Pitt is typically listed as a public university. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to prominence, with a national championship season in 1976 led by Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett, and continued success in the 1980s with players such as Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino. In the 1980s, significant medical {{research in the field}} of organ transplantation was conducted by Thomas Starzl, establishing Pitt as a world leader in the field. Chancellor Wesley Posvar retired in 1991, after 24 years in office. His administration is known for eliminating the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and growing the school's prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630 million and its endowment tripled to $257 million. He also established the Honors College, the School of Health-Related Professions, the University Center for International Studies, the Center for Philosophy of Science, and the University Center for Social and <b>Urban</b> <b>Research.</b>|$|E
