60|$|Katharine now renewed her {{signs of}} leave-taking; she had drawn {{on one of}} her gloves, and looked about her as if in search of some trivial saying to end with. Wasn't there some picture, or clock, or chest of drawers which might be singled out for notice? {{something}} peaceable and friendly to end the <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>interview?</b> The green-shaded lamp burnt in the corner, and illumined books and pens and blotting-paper. The whole aspect of the place started another train of thought and struck her as enviably free; in such a room one could work--one could have a life of one's own.|$|E

5000|$|Oftentimes, {{sideline}} {{reporters are}} faced with <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>interviews</b> {{that they have to}} conduct because the network demands it and they are asked to bring forth the tough question. If the sideline reporter is not prepared for an interview, it may make for an awkward moment on national television. As with the case with professional athletes and coaches, for instance, it may be very difficult and sometimes unavoidable, to stray away from <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>interviews.</b> An example of a notorious interviewee is San Antonio Spurs Head Basketball coach Gregg Popovich. Popovich is known for giving short, often bizarre answers, when interviewed by a court side reporter. All of his interactions with reporters have become must see television. ESPN reported that that [...] "bubbling sense of discomfort for NBA sideline reporters as a between-quarters date with Popovich draws near is almost universal." ...|$|R

If an applicant is nervous, they might not act the same way they would on the job, making it harder for organizations to use the interview for predicting someone’s future job performance.|$|R
2500|$|After Zappa began regular {{occupation}} at Paul Buff's PAL Studio in Cucamonga he and Van Vliet began collaborating, tentatively as the Soots (pronounced [...] "soots" [...] ). By {{the time}} Zappa {{had turned the}} venue into [...] the duo had completed some songs. These were Cheryl's Canon, Metal Man Has Won His Wings and a Howlin' Wolf styled rendition of Little Richard's Slippin' and Slidin'. Further songs, on Zappa's Mystery Disc (1996), I Was a Teen-Age Malt Shop and The Birth of Captain Beefheart also provide an insight to Zappa's [...] "teenage movie" [...] script titled Captain Beefheart vs. the Grunt People, the first appearances of the Beefheart name. It has been suggested this name came from a term used by Vliet's Uncle Alan who {{had a habit of}} exposing himself to Don's girlfriend, Laurie Stone. He would urinate with the bathroom door open and, if she was walking by, would mumble about his penis, saying [...] "Ahh, what a beauty! It looks just like a big, fine beef heart". [...] In a 1970 interview with Rolling Stone, Van Vliet requests [...] "don't ask me why or how" [...] he and Zappa came up with the name. Johnny Carson also asked him the same question to which Van Vliet replied that one day he was standing on the pier and saw fishermen cutting the bills off pelicans. He said it made him sad and put [...] "a beef in his heart". Carson appeared nervous and <b>uncomfortable</b> <b>interviewing</b> Van Vliet and after the next commercial break Van Vliet was gone. He would later claim in an appearance on Late Night with David Letterman that the name referred to [...] "a beef in my heart against this society". In the [...] "Grunt People" [...] draft script Beefheart and his mother play themselves, with his father played by Howlin' Wolf. Grace Slick is penned in as a [...] "celestial seductress" [...] and there are also roles for future Magic Band members Bill Harkleroad and Mark Boston.|$|R
2500|$|Dana Kennedy, a {{journalist}} and correspondent, profiled Cosby for the Associated Press (AP) in 1992, noting that even though Cosby was {{at the height of}} his success and did not have any measurably negative publicity, he went on at length about [...] "why he mistrusts the press", saying he likes to [...] "control" [...] his interviews. The AP piece reflected more on how <b>uncomfortable</b> the <b>interview</b> was than the substance of the interview itself. In 2014, Kennedy recalled that after the critical AP piece ran, Cosby sent her a cryptic package with a withered piece of fruit wrapped up in a paper towel. She noted that despite her interviews with some of the most notorious celebrities, it was Cosby—during the time of his highest popularity—who stood out as having a [...] "scary" [...] persona, recalling the mysterious package as something that [...] "has always given" [...] her [...] "the creeps". It was her remembrance of [...] "how intimidating and menacing" [...] Cosby was during that experience that led her to believe the stories of the women who were accusing Cosby.|$|R

He had been sincerity itself, while I, picking up the discarded mask, had tied it on, probably upside down, for it made me feel excessively <b>uncomfortable</b> during our <b>interview.</b> To make matters worse, I was also sure that it had quite failed to hide my countenance, and that he knew as well as I knew myself the real cause of the change he had noticed in me.|$|R
5000|$|The show {{broadcast}} {{its most}} memorable April Fools' Day prank with {{a fight between}} Tom Arnold and Michael Strahan, that not only fooled viewers but also cast members and producers. On Friday, March 31, 2006 Tom Arnold returned to the show to promote his [...] "new tell-all book", which blasted his former BDSSP hosts and colleagues {{as well as many}} notable athletes, including many New York Giants. Strahan became heated at Tom Arnold after an <b>uncomfortable</b> two-segment <b>interview.</b> He became so angry, he started wrestling Arnold, and Arnold retaliated by tackling him to the ground. Strahan pretended to be very hurt by screaming and clutching his shoulder as the cameras cut to black. It fooled cast members Rodney Peete and Rob Dibble enough to have them intervene in the fight. Rodney Peete {{went so far as to}} give Tom rabbit punches while he broke up what he thought was a real fight. The next day, the New York Giants' media relations reported that they received several calls about the injury status of their star defensive end. It also worked enough to fool the popular internet sports site Deadspin into reporting it as a real event immediately after it was broadcast.|$|R
5000|$|A typical Hollywood Dish sketch {{starts with}} Trunk and Sticks {{introducing}} {{themselves to their}} guest just before the interview starts. During the interview they distract their guest by making strange faces and gestures. The guest {{becomes more and more}} <b>uncomfortable</b> throughout the <b>interview.</b> They tempt the guest in giving an over-the-top reaction to some experience she has had. The guest becomes so uncomfortable she wants to leave, but is convinced to answer one more question. This question is about her opinion about a television show the guest has not seen. Bill Hader does a spit-take in response. The guest leaves when she realises the interviewers are not listening to her anymore. The sketch ends with a promo to the recording in which Trunk and Sticks question their guest’s sanity, showing the over-the-top reaction.|$|R
40|$|As {{a former}} {{professional}} television journalist, I was often <b>uncomfortable</b> with <b>interviewing</b> or capturing images of people showing grief and sadness. On {{the one hand}} I knew the public {{had a right to}} see those images, however on the other hand I also knew that taking those images could cause even further harm to the individuals involved by getting too close and invading an individual 2 ̆ 7 s privacy. After I gathered my interviews and images, I would leave the scene of a tragedy convincing myself! was just doing my job. When I left journalism to raise a family, I entered the master 2 ̆ 7 s degree program at Marquette University and began to think about that conflict that I had felt as a journalist. I wondered how a professional news photojournalist might handle these morally sticky situations, especially given the market-driven journalism environment of today. Moreover, I wondered about the perspective of the National Press Photographers Association and what the award-winning instructors taught new and aspiring news photojournalists to do in those situations. This study demonstrated that the ethic of care is clearly a moral underpinning that helps to guide the professional television news photojournalist in his or her work. This relational ethic rearranges ethical priorities and provides different ways for a news photojournalist to solve morally difficult situations beyond codes of ethics because it allows the news photojournalist {{to take into account the}} context of the event and empathize with those in the image...|$|R
5000|$|Harman {{was working}} as a lorry driver for {{supermarket}} chain Sainsbury when he was cast in the role of Dennis Rickman: [...] "They said: 'You've got the job.' I was sitting there in my Sainsbury's fleece, with Mrs Bloggs's groceries in the back, and I just laughed my arse off." [...] However, Harman revealed in a 2003 interview that he actually auditioned for a character called [...] "Tim", and had no idea that he was set to join the Watts family as the unknown son of the soap's most [...] "iconic" [...] figure, Den Watts. Part of Harman's appeal lay in his dark good looks and appealing physicality. EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge noted: [...] "We cast Nigel for his tremendous acting ability and his screen presence, but there's no question he's also a very sexy young man." [...] Dennis Rickman's role as [...] "EastEnders beefcake" [...] made Harman <b>uncomfortable.</b> In an <b>interview</b> with The Independent in 2003 he commented on his character's status as a sex symbol: [...] "It's Dennis, not me... I am a bit embarrassed... I don't get off on it. I walk into the living-room in the morning in my jogging pants, with my hair all over the place, and my flatmates say: 'So, you're supposed {{to be one of the}} sexiest men in the country?' And I go: 'I know. I don't get it either.'" ...|$|R
40|$|Any {{new book}} by Wallace Stegner is a cause for celebration among {{students}} of the fiction {{and history of the}} American West, and this collection of ten interviews, conducted by Richard W. Etulain in 1980 and 1981, is an event of signal importance to all admirers of Stegner 2 ̆ 7 s work. The interviews begin with biographical clarifications, treat the fiction next (with separate chapters on The Big Rock Candy Mountain and Angle of Repose), and then turn to the Mormons, western literature, western history, and the western wilderness, with a concluding miscellaneous chapter. The transcripts of the interviews were revised only minimally, so there is some repetition in the volume, particularly in the chapter on the Mormons. This is a mere quibble, however. One of the most striking things about this volume is Etulain 2 ̆ 7 s resourcefulness as an interviewer. His questions indicate thought and care and a thorough knowledge of both Stegner 2 ̆ 7 s work and its critical reception. The interviews are comprehensive and well planned but not restrictively so; Etulain frequently follows up on new topics Stegner has introduced. There are a few surprises in the collection. We learn that the eleven-year hiatus between The Preacher and the Slave (retitled Joe Hill) and A Shooting Star occurred because Stegner 2 ̆ 2 gave up writing novels after Joe Hill. 2 ̆ 2 His reason was the popular and critical indifference to and misunderstanding of the novel. We also learn that Stegner, an ardent and informed environmentalist, is 2 ̆ 2 not very optimistic about the [ecological] future of the West. 2 ̆ 2 This rich harvest of Stegner 2 ̆ 7 s ideas and opinions is an indispensable source book for scholarly research on Stegner 2 ̆ 7 s writing. Emotionally and intellectually intimate in a not <b>uncomfortable</b> way, the <b>interviews</b> bring us as close as we are soon likely to come to Stegner the man as well as Stegner the man of letters...|$|R
40|$|The {{achievement}} gap between African-American and European-American students in U. S. {{public schools is}} a problem with no simple explanation, and one that leaders struggle to correct. The researcher's central premise is that {{there are many ways to}} improve education for African-American students and that the racial {{achievement gap}} is inexcusable. African-American women may offer a unique perspective on this topic, by virtue of their status as women and as African Americans, as well as their experiences as students and teachers. The researcher set out to conduct research exploring the perspectives of African-American female teachers with respect to perceived and actual barriers to the effective education of students, specifically African-American students, teachers' coping strategies, and teachers' recommendations for change. However, major obstructing factors prevented the necessary collection of data for that research. In the dissertation, the researcher describes the current climate of education reform in the United States and critiques current reform efforts. She conceptualizes reasons for the structural factors that contribute to and explain the difficulty in collecting data on the experiences and perspectives of African-American teachers in U. S. public schools. Factors that may have prevented schools from allowing access to interview and observe African-American teachers are analyzed. Additionally, the researcher explores the question of why, in the rare cases in which schools did grant permission for the research, African-American teachers may have been <b>uncomfortable</b> participating in <b>interviews</b> about and observations of their experiences and practices. In theorizing about these factors, the researcher discusses the nature of the proposed research, her orientation, and the rationale for the proposed study. Major factors potentially influencing the decisions of school leaders and teachers not to participate are also presented. These include the nature of the public school teaching profession; race relations and history in the United States; education and experience in the United States; and laws, policies, and practices applicable to public education. In evaluating these elements, the researcher brings to light several factors that may prevent such research. The researcher concludes by presenting similar research initiatives and theories on how comparable research goals may be met, and by discussing areas for future research. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|R
