The {{southern}} caracara (Caracara plancus) {{is one of}} the characteristic objects of a Patagonian landscape; the presence of austral parakeets (Enicognathus ferrugineus) as far south as the shores of the strait attracted the attention of the earlier navigators; and green-backed firecrowns (Sephanoides sephaniodes), a species of hummingbird, may be seen flying amidst the falling snow. One of the largest birds in the world, the Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) can be seen in Patagonia.

6000|$|Then I fired {{just as the}} birds, {{catching}} {{sight of}} my cap, raised their long necks in alarm. Bang! Up they rose with a noise of wings, leaving not one behind!

I went home as much puzzled as disappointed. Late in the day my brother returned with one <b>upland</b> <b>goose</b> and three or four ducks, and inquired if I had had any luck. I told him my sad story, whereupon he burst out laughing and informed me that he had taken care to draw the shot from my gun before going out.

60|$|The Falkland Islands offer {{a second}} {{instance}} of birds {{with a similar}} disposition. The extraordinary tameness of the little Opetiorhynchus has been remarked by Pernety, Lesson, and other voyagers. It is not, however, peculiar to that bird: the Polyborus, snipe, <b>upland</b> and lowland <b>goose,</b> thrush, bunting, and even some true hawks, are all more or less tame. As the birds are so tame there, where foxes, hawks, and owls occur, we may infer {{that the absence of}} all rapacious animals at the Galapagos is not the cause of their tameness here. The <b>upland</b> <b>geese</b> at the Falklands show, by the precaution they take in building on the islets, that they are aware of their danger from the foxes; but they are not by this rendered wild towards man. This tameness of the birds, especially of the waterfowl, is strongly contrasted with the habits of the same species in Tierra del Fuego, where for ages past they have been persecuted by the wild inhabitants. In the Falklands, the sportsman may sometimes kill more of the <b>upland</b> <b>geese</b> in one day than he can carry home; whereas in Tierra del Fuego it is nearly as difficult to kill one as it is in England to shoot the common wild goose.|$|R

60|$|He who {{believes}} that each being has been created as we now see it, must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having habits and structure not at all in agreement. What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water; and no one except Audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four toes webbed, alight {{on the surface of}} the sea. On the other hand grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by membrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating plants, yet the water-hen is nearly as aquatic as the coot; and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In such cases, and many others could be given, habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. The webbed feet of the <b>upland</b> <b>goose</b> may be said to have become rudimentary in function, though not in structure.

60|$|The {{foregoing}} remarks {{lead me to}} say a {{few words}} on the protest lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor. They believe that many structures have been created for the sake of beauty, to delight man or the Creator (but this latter point is beyond the scope of scientific discussion), or for the sake of mere variety, a view already discussed. Such doctrines, if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory. I fully admit that many structures are now of no direct use to their possessors, and may never have been of any use to their progenitors; but this does not prove that they were formed solely for beauty or variety. No doubt the definite action of changed conditions, and the various causes of modifications, lately specified, have all produced an effect, probably a great effect, independently of any advantage thus gained. But a still more important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every living creature is due to inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures have now no very close and direct relation to present habits of life. Thus, we can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the <b>upland</b> <b>goose,</b> or of the frigate-bird, are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that the similar bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the horse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of special use to these animals. We may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. But webbed feet no doubt were as useful to the progenitor of the <b>upland</b> <b>goose</b> and of the frigate-bird, as they now are to the most aquatic of living birds. So we may believe that the progenitor of the seal did not possess a flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse and bat, were originally developed, on the principle of utility, probably through the reduction of more numerous bones in the fin of some ancient fish-like progenitor of the whole class. It is scarcely possible to decide how much allowance ought to be made for such causes of change, as the definite action of external conditions, so-called spontaneous variations, and the complex laws of growth; but with these important exceptions, we may conclude that the structure of every living creature either now is, or was formerly, of some direct or indirect use to its possessor.|$|E

40|$|The {{measurement}} of faecal glucocorticoid metabolites {{is used as}} a non-invasive technique to study stress in animal populations. They have been used most widely in mammals, and mammalian studies have also treated issues such as sample stability and storage methods. In birds, faecal corticosterone metabolite (CM) assays have been validated for a small number of species, and adequate storage under field conditions has not been addressed explicitly in previous studies. Furthermore, while it is well-established that baseline plasma corticosterone levels in birds rise with declining body condition, no study so far investigated if this relationship is also reflected in faecal samples. We here present data of a field study in wild <b>Upland</b> <b>geese</b> Chloephaga picta leucoptera on the Falkland Islands, testing different storage methods and investigating the relationship of faecal CM concentrations to body condition and reproductive parameters. We found that faecal CM measures are significantly repeatable within individuals, higher in individuals with lower body condition in both male and female wild <b>Upland</b> <b>geese</b> and higher in later breeding females with smaller broods. These results suggest that measuring faecal CM values may be a valuable non-invasive tool to monitor the relative condition or health of individuals and populations, especially in areas where there still is intense hunting practice...|$|R

60|$|The {{foregoing}} remarks {{lead me to}} say a {{few words}} on the protest lately made by some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor. They believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man, or for mere variety. This doctrine, if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory. Yet I fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessors. Physical conditions probably have had some little effect on structure, quite independently of any good thus gained. Correlation of growth has no doubt played a most important part, and a useful modification of one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use. So again characters which formerly were useful, or which formerly had arisen from correlation of growth, or from other unknown cause, may reappear from the law of reversion, though now of no direct use. The effects of sexual selection, when displayed in beauty to charm the females, can be called useful only in rather a forced sense. But by far the most important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every being is simply due to inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures now have no direct relation to the habits of life of each species. Thus, we can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the <b>upland</b> <b>goose</b> or of the frigate-bird are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that the same bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the horse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of special use to these animals. We may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. But to the progenitor of the <b>upland</b> <b>goose</b> and of the frigate-bird, webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds. So we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse, and bat, which have been inherited from a common progenitor, were formerly of more special use to that progenitor, or its progenitors, than they now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits. Therefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired through natural selection, subjected formerly, as now, to the several laws of inheritance, reversion, correlation of growth, etc. Hence every detail of structure in every living creature (making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been of special use to some ancestral form, or as being now of special use to the descendants of this form--either directly, or indirectly through the complex laws of growth.|$|E

There was war, and the city from which we obtained our supplies was besieged by an army from the [...] "upper provinces" [...] which had come down to break the power and humble the pride of Buenos Ayres. Our elders missed their tea and coffee most, but our anxiety was that we should soon be without powder and shot. My brother constantly warned me not to be so wasteful, although he fired half a dozen shots to my one without getting more birds for the table.

60|$|Now arctic and {{antarctic}} geese {{are alike}} in this their devotion to their distant breeding-ground, the cradle and true {{home of the}} species or race; and I will conclude this chapter with an incident related to me many {{years ago by a}} brother who was sheep-farming in a wild and lonely district on the southern frontier of Buenos Ayres. Immense numbers of <b>upland</b> <b>geese</b> in great flocks used to spend the cold months on the plains where he had his lonely hut; and one morning in August in the early spring of that southern country, some days after all the flocks had taken their departure to the south, he was out riding, and saw at a distance before him on the plain a pair of geese. They were male and female--a white and a brown bird. Their movements attracted his attention and he rode to them. The female was walking steadily on in a southerly direction, while the male, greatly excited, and calling loudly from time to time, walked at a distance ahead, and constantly turned back to see and call to his mate, and at intervals of a few minutes he would rise up and fly, screaming, to a distance of some hundreds of yards; then finding that he had not been followed, he would return and alight at a distance of forty or fifty yards in advance of the other bird, and begin walking on as before. The female had one wing broken, and, unable to fly, had set out on her long journey to the Magellanic Islands on her feet; and her mate, though called to by that mysterious imperative voice in his breast, yet would not forsake her; but flying a little distance to show her the way, and returning again and again, and calling to her with his wildest and most piercing cries, urged her still to spread her wings and fly with him to their distant home.|$|R
6000|$|My chief {{ambition}} was {{to shoot}} wild duck. My brother shot them in preference to anything else: {{they were so}} much esteemed {{and he was so}} much commended when he came in with a few in his bag that I looked on duck-shooting as the greatest thing I could go in for. Ducks were common enough with us and in great variety; I know not in what country more kinds are to be found. There were no fewer than five species of teal, the commonest a dark brown bird with black mottlings; another, very common, was pale grey, the plumage beautifully barred and pencilled with brown and black; then we had the blue-winged teal, a maroon-red duck which ranges from Patagonia to California; the ringed teal, with salmon-coloured breast and velvet-black collar; the Brazilian teal, a lovely olive-brown and velvet-black duck, with crimson beak and legs. There were two pintails, one of which was the most abundant species in the country; also a widgeon, a lake duck, a shoveller duck, with red plumage, grey head and neck, and blue wings; and two species of the long-legged whistling or tree duck. Another common species was the rosy-billed duck, now to be seen on ornamental waters in England; and occasionally we saw the wild Muscovy duck, called Royal duck by the natives, but it was a rare visitor so far south. We also had geese and swans: the <b>upland</b> <b>geese</b> from the Megellanic Straits that came to us in winter--that is to say, our winter from May to August. And there were two swans, the black-necked, which has black flesh and is unfit to eat, and the white or Coscoroba Swan, as good a table bird as there is in the world. And oddly enough this bird has been known to the natives as a [...] "goose" [...] since the discovery of America, and now after three centuries our scientific ornithologists have made the discovery that it is a link between the geese and swans, but is more goose than swan. It is a beautiful white bird, with bright red bill and legs, the wings tipped with black; and has a loud musical cry of three notes, the last prolonged note with a falling inflection.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Upland</b> <b>Goose</b> is {{primarily}} a herbivore, feeding mostly of seeds, leaves, stems, and other plant matter. They are very gregarious, and flocks of thousands of birds can be found grazing in one pasture alone. They are considered pests by farmers {{due to the fact}} that they eat on the pastures that are meant for cattle and sheep. They breed in densely-vegetated areas on plains or slopes, mostly in September and October, or November on the Falkland Islands. Males attract females through a courtship display in which they whistle loudly, to which the female responds with softer cackles. They are monogamous, and if a male encroaches on another's territory, a violent fight may break out. Males have been found injured or dead after these fights.|$|E
6000|$|The avi-fauna is {{relatively}} much richer than the mammalia, {{owing to the}} large number of aquatic species, most of which are migratory with their [...] "breeding" [...] or [...] "subsistence-areas" [...] on the pampas. In more senses than one they constitute a [...] "floating population," [...] and their habits have in no way been modified by the conditions of the country. The order, including storks, ibises, herons, spoonbills, and flamingoes, counts about eighteen species; and the most noteworthy birds in it are two great ibises nearly as large as turkeys, with mighty resonant voices. The duck order is very rich, numbering at least twenty species, including two beautiful <b>upland</b> <b>geese,</b> winter visitors from Magellanic lands, and two swans, the lovely black-necked, and the pure white with rosy bill. Of rails, or ralline birds, there are ten or twelve, ranging from a small spotted creature no bigger than a thrush to some large majestic birds. One is the courlan, called [...] "crazy widow" [...] from its mourning plumage and long melancholy screams, which on still evenings may be heard a league away. Another is the graceful variegated ypicaha, fond of social gatherings, where the birds perform a dance and make the desolate marshes resound with their insane humanlike voices. A smaller kind, Porphyriops melanops, has a night-cry like a burst of shrill hysterical laughter, which has won for it the name of [...] "witch;" [...] while another, Rallus rythyrhynchus, is called [...] "little donkey" [...] from its braying cries. Strange eerie voices have all these birds. Of the remaining aquatic species, the most important is the spur-winged crested screamer; a noble bird as large as a swan, yet its favourite pastime is to soar upwards until it loses itself to sight in the blue ether, whenca it pours forth its resounding choral notes, which reach the distant earth clarified, and with a rhythmic swell and fall as of chiming bells. It also sings by night, [...] "counting the hours," [...] the gauchos say, and where they have congregated together in tens of thousands the mighty roar of their combined voices produces an astonishingly grand effect.|$|R

40|$|Williams, Christopher K. Population {{estimates}} from Mid-Winter Survey Counts {{over the last}} half century show that Atlantic brant numbers have fluctuated over the course of this time period; however, between 2000 – 2016 the population has been showing a slow decline of ~ 20 %. Additionally, the Mid-Winter Surveys (MWS) indicate a low percentage of young in flocks in recent years (< 10 % between 2013 – 2015), indicating breeding ground limitations in those years. Southampton Island’s East Bay (located on {{the southern end of the}} Foxe Basin), supported a historic nesting colony of brant as well as a significant population of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) and a small population of cackling geese (Branta hutchinsii). However, range-wide, lesser snow geese populations have increased from a few million to ~ 15 million in the last few decades with consequences that resonate throughout the ecosystem, affecting other species sharing that ecosystem. Additionally, the MWS indicates the range-wide cackling goose population has also increased from ~ 400, 000 to ~ 700, 000 in the last 3 decades. ☐ While East Bay historically supported a large nesting colony of Atlantic brant. Research crews in 2010 found that a local decline in brant nesting had occurred, though reasons for the decline were not resolved. The aim of my study was to begin to decipher the keys to understanding why a localized decline is occurring and to provide an update of the status of nesting Atlantic brant at East Bay. By means of nest searching, the careful observation of brant pairs during incubation, and collection of habitat and nest site selection data, we now believe we have a better grasp on some of the factors limiting brant success at East Bay, Southampton Island. ☐ Snow geese and cackling geese arrived 25 May 2014 and 21 – 22 (respectively) May 2015. Brant arrived on 9 June in summer 2014 and 8 June in summer 2015. Snow melt in 2014 occurred much faster than snow melt in 2015. In 2014, snow cover reached 0 % by 12 June, while in 2015 snow cover did not reach 0 % until 28 June. The snow melt was much quicker in 2014, with 100 % snow melt lasting only until ~ 23 May as compared to 2 June in 2015. The peak initiation for snow geese was 2 June in 2014, but 14 June in 2015. Following a similar pattern, the peak initiation for cackling geese was 6 June 2014 and 19 June 2015. Brant had a less pronounced difference between years, peaking on 18 June 2014 and 22 June 2015. Importantly, the late snow melt in 2015 also caused a significant reduction in initiated nests in cackling geese (from 570 in 2014 to 355 in 2015) and snow geese (from 230 in 2014 to 48 in 2015) and an increase in brant nests (from 44 in 2014 to 78 in 2015). Atlantic brant and lesser snow geese did not overlap in their nesting habitat in 1979, nor did they between 2010 – 2015 when their nesting habitat appeared to be segregated between the <b>upland</b> (snow <b>geese)</b> and the graminoid/moss zones (brant). By 2010 – 2015, cackling geese populations at East Bay increased and appeared to wedge between Atlantic brant and lesser snow geese populations, thus overlapping with brant nesting regions. In 1979, 88. 5 % of Atlantic brant had at least 2 other brant nests within 200 m of their nest. By 2010 that decreased to 18. 4 % and further declined to 13. 6 % in the 2014 breeding season, but rebounded slightly to 26. 9 % in the 2015 breeding season. In contrast, in 1979 only 5 % of Atlantic brant had at least 2 or more cackling goose nests within 200 m of their nest. That increased to 46. 1 % by 2010 and to 40. 9 % in 2014. In 2015, due to the lower number of cackling goose nests, only 16. 7 % of brant nests included 2 or more cackling goose nests within 200 m. Even though there were a lower number of nesting cackling geese in 2015, I still found 39 % of 2014 brant nest sites were occupied by a cackling goose nest (< 200 m) showing the strong overlap in preferred habitat. ☐ Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed significant differences between male and female brant behaviors between 2014 and 2015. Male brant spent less time feeding as well as less time engaged in locomotive behaviors (swimming/walking) in 2014 than in 2015. Females on the nest spent more time alert more time engaged in nest construction behavior in 2014 than in 2015. Females off the nest spent less time feeding and less time flying in 2014 than in 2015, but more time alert and more time preening. ☐ Mean island size, mean water depth, and mean water distance did not differ between cackling geese and Atlantic brant in summer 2015 when these data were collected for both species indicating brant and cackling geese prefer similar island nest sites. Water distance was defined as the distance from a nesting island to the nearest mainland body. This path was chosen by finding the shallowest water path, with the assumption that a fox will use the shallowest path to access an island. If islands were scattered across that path, then the water distance between those islands was measured and summed (i. e. distance to island # 1, distance to island # 2, etc.). Brant apparent nest success declined from a high of 86 % in 1979 to 65 % in 2010, 5 % in 2014, and 17 % in 2015. Cackling goose nest success dropped from 86 % in 2010 to 61 % in 2014 and to 2 % in 2015. Snow goose nest success was lower (63 %) in 2010 compared with 74 % in 2014; but then dropped to 6 % in 2015. The overwhelming majority of failures were due to arctic fox depredation, responsible for 82 % of brant failures in 2014 and 73. 3 % of brant failures in 2015. I examined the impact of nest site selection on fox predation. The top model included year, maximum water depth, distance to a mainland (water distance), and whether or not the nest was located on an island. Both year and maximum depth had the greatest effect size within the top model. Brant daily nest survival was 0. 828 (SE + 0. 029) in 2014 and 0. 924 (SE + 0. 012) in 2015. ☐ I conducted an artificial nest experiment and calculated Kaplan-Meier survival probabilities for artificial nests located in different density plots (high vs. low goose nest density) and found high density nesting plots to experience increased predation and decreased survival probability. ☐ Preliminary evidence at East Bay reveals a complex system in which many factors are influencing the localized decline of brant nest success and local population. My results indicate that at least some level of four kinds of competition (exploitative, preemptive, interference, and apparent competition) is occurring at East Bay. Whether or not these forms of interspecific competition have larger implications for the brant population as a whole remains to be studied at other breeding locations. I also found weather to have a profound impact on the nesting success of geese and the level of competition displayed between different goose species at East Bay. The role that climate change may play in brant survival and reproduction in future decades is yet to be seen, but I believe the importance of weather and climatic variables in the success of East Bay brant indicates that it will play a large role in the future of all breeding brant colonies.

40|$|A species {{distribution}} may {{be determined by}} its responses to patterns of human distur- bance {{as well as by}} its habitat preferences. Here we investigate the distribution of the <b>Upland</b> <b>Goose</b> Chloephaga picta, which has been historically persecuted by farmers and ranchers in Patagonia because it feeds on crops and pastures and is assumed to compete with sheep for forage. We assess whether its current breeding distribution is shaped by persecution by ranchers or whether it can be better explained by differences in habitat primary productivity and preference for wetlands, or by other anthropogenic distur- bances not associated with ranching. We built {{species distribution}} models to examine the relative effect of environmental and anthropogenic predictors on the regional distribution of <b>Upland</b> <b>Goose.</b> We performed vehicle surveys in the province of Santa Cruz, Argen- tina, in two years, surveying 8000 km of roads and recording 6492 Geese. Generalized additive models were used to model the presence ⁄ absence of Geese in 1 -km cells. The models suggested that <b>Upland</b> <b>Goose</b> distribution is not currently affected by rancher control, as the species is more abundant in areas with high sheep stocking levels, but it is positively influenced by primary productivity and negatively influenced by urban areas. Anthropogenic disturbance caused by urban areas and oil extraction camps had a greater impact in limiting the species distribution than sheep ranchingPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoid (GC) hormones rise in {{response}} to stressors, including natural events including weather or predator presence, and human activities, such as hunting, scientiWc research or recreational visits. However, because blood sampling itself causes stress and is dangerous or even impossible in some wildlife species, feedback-free methods for GC determination are needed to assess stress in these animals. Faecal GC analyses have thus gained interest. Here, we validate a non-invasive method to estimate the physiological stress in the <b>Upland</b> <b>goose</b> Chloephaga picta. An adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) challenge was conducted in captive adults (female and male), and droppings were collected before, {{during and after the}} experiment. Corticosterone metabolite (CM) secretion {{in response}} to the ACTH challenge was measured with several enzyme immunoassays (EIA) to Wnd the most appropriate test. We used CM levels during the periods before and after the experiment as control data. An EIA for 11 -oxoetiocholanolone achieved the highest response to the ACTH challenge and also reXected a stress response to unfamiliar environment. Furthermore, CM concentrations of dry samples were highly correlated with the corresponding non-dried (frozen) samples. The data suggest that this method is appropriate to measure the stress in Upland geese, and that samples can be stored either frozen or dry form...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{studies have}} shown that {{waterfowl}} females in good condition lay larger clutches and start egg-laying earlier in a breeding season. However, most of these studies lack corresponding data on individual condition and timing of breeding in different years. We analysed data on clutch size, egg size, hatching date and female body condition of a non-migratory species, the <b>Upland</b> <b>Goose</b> recorded in three seasons on New Island, Falkand Islands. We found a strong seasonal decline in both egg and clutch size. Egg size increased with clutch size. The mean egg volume and total clutch volume increased with female body condition and hatching date was earlier for females in higher body condition. Chicks hatched from nests with higher mean egg volume had higher early body condition. We also compared individual females between different study years and found that individual body condition showed a significant repeatability between years, whereas hatching date did not. While female aging did not systematically affect hatching date, females produced clutches that hatched earlier in years of higher body condition. We could thus show {{for the first time that}} the frequently reported negative relationship between female condition and hatching date also holds true on an individual basis. To our knowledge, this is the first study on seasonal clutch size decline in sheldgeese and one of a few in waterfowl comparing condition and timing of breeding within individuals between different years...|$|E
40|$|Although {{studies on}} the {{evolution}} and function of female ornaments have become more numerous in the last years, {{the majority of these}} studies were carried out in cases where female ornaments were a smaller and duller version of the ornaments found in males. There are substantially fewer studies on species with female-specific ornaments. However, no study so far investigated the potential of female-specific colouration as a quality signal in birds with conventional sex roles. We studied female-specific ornamentation in a strongly sexually dichromatic species, the <b>upland</b> <b>goose</b> Chloephaga picta leucoptera, in two consecutive years. Male upland geese have white head and breast feathers and black legs, whereas females have reddish-brown head and breast feathers and conspicuous yellow-orange legs. We found that female-specific colouration in upland geese can reliably indicate different aspects of female phenotypic quality. Females with more orange coloured legs and more red-like head colours had higher clutch and egg volumes than females with a paler leg and head colouration, and a more reddish plumage colouration was related to a higher body condition. These relationships provide the theoretic possibility for males to assess female phenotypic quality on the basis of colouration. Furthermore, the females with a more orange-like tarsus colouration had higher plasma carotenoid levels. Both tarsus colouration and carotenoid concentrations of individual females were highly correlated across years, indicating that tarsus colour is a stable signal. Despite this correlation, small individual differences in plasma carotenoid concentrations between the two study years were related to differences in tarsus colouration. We thus show {{for the first time in}} a wild bird and under natural conditions that carotenoid-based integument colouration remains consistent between individuals in consecutive years and is also a dynamic trait reflecting individual changes in carotenoid levels. In this species, where pairs form life-long bonds, the honesty of the carotenoid-based integument colouration suggests that it may be a sexually selected female ornament that has evolved through male mate choice...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1978 {{publication}} of my Ducks, Geese and Swans of the World hundreds {{if not thousands}} of publications on the Anatidae have appeared, making a comprehensive literature supplement and text updating impossible. Janet Kear’s (2005) survey of the waterfowl family Anatidae and closely related screamers of the family Anhimidae included more than 3, 700 references, of which a significant proportion appeared later than 1978. My revision of the Anseriformes (families Anatidae and Anhimidae) for the 2 nd edition of J. C. Peters’ Check-List of the Birds of the World (Johnsgard, 1979) closely followed the classification structure and taxonomic sequence {{that had been used}} in this book, except for the absence of a tribe category, which was excluded in order to conform with the categories that had traditionally been used in earlier volumes of the Check-List. In addition to incorporating some more recent taxonomic changes, I have revised several of the range maps to conform with more current information. For these updates I have relied largely on Kear (2005). Other important waterfowl books published since and covering the entire waterfowl family include an identification guide to the waterfowl, illustrated by color paintings of all species (Madge 2 ̆ 6 Burn, 1988), and two books by Frank Todd (1979, 1996) that are especially notable for their excellent color photographic illustrations. In addition to these world surveys, several smaller taxonomic groups of waterfowl have been monographed. They include the whistling ducks (Bolen 2 ̆ 6 Rylander, 1983), mute swan (Birkhead 2 ̆ 6 Perrins, 1986), whooper swan (Brazil, 2003), snow goose (Batt, 1996; Cooke, Rockwell 2 ̆ 6 Lane, 1995), Canada goose (Hanson, 1997), Hawaiian goose (Kear 2 ̆ 6 Berger, 1980), <b>upland</b> <b>goose</b> (Summers 2 ̆ 6 McAdam. 1993), common shelduck (Patterson 1982), muscovy duck (Donkin, 1989), wood duck 2 ̆ 6 mandarin duck (Lever, 1989, Shurtleff 2 ̆ 6 Savage, 1996), and stiff-tailed ducks (Johnsgard 2 ̆ 6 Carbonell, 1996). Also since 1978, many taxonomic studies have been performed (see literature listing that follows this supplement), but the most ambitious of these were the molecular/morphological studies of B. C. Livezey. Because Kear’s 2005 monograph generally followed Livizey’s (1997) proposed taxonomy, a comparative overview of the two is shown in Table 1. It may be seen that the two taxonomies are very similar, at least as to their broad sequential organization. I recognized a total of one family, three subfamilies, 13 tribes, 45 genera and 151 species, while Livizey accepted three families, five subfamilies, 13 tribes, 55 genera and 173 species of Recent Anatidae. Kear generally followed Livizey’s taxonomy, but recognized 52 genera and 165 Recent anatid species. In the following updating of species information, emphasis is placed on those species and populations for which significant conservation, taxonomic, or behavioral information has appeared since 1978. No attempt has been made to update all aspects of these species’ biology and status. The 2005 monograph by Kear comprehensively summarized published Anseriformes literature through 2004, and The Birds of North America monograph series documenting all North American species breeding north of Mexico and published between 1993 and 2003 has comprehensive literature surveys. Alternative English names shown in parentheses below are those used by Kear (2005) or other recent authorities. The conservation categories of “endangered”, “critically endangered” and “vulnerable” refer to their IUCN classification status; individual countries, states and conservation organizations may use different terminology or classification criteria. Endangered and vulnerable species are also listed and internationally protected by CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), as well as by individual countries or other geo-political entities. Most of the following citations are more recent than this book’s publication date of 1978, but a few earlier ones are included were among the book’s original citations, usually because they have been mentioned above.
