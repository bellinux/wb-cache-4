5|$|Anne's {{drug use}} {{results in the}} loss of many of her inhibitions, and the film shows her actions under the influence, {{including}} scenes implying sexual promiscuity. As the film progresses, she is fired from her job and begins selling drugs for Markey. Her brother hangs himself when he learns of her new job, and she is arrested and given a tour of the various psychiatric wards and jails in which drug users end up. Finally, after 50 days in jail, she is released, cleaned <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> to cooperate with the authorities regarding Markey.|$|E
25|$|All US {{productions}} (including Broadway and its revival) were visually {{identical in}} scale and design {{but the third}} national tour was notable for its portability without sacrificing the Broadway-caliber experience. Thanks to innovative touring techniques borrowed from the pop/rock concert industry, the 4.5million dollar production was adaptable to smaller and larger venues and traveled complete in all of 8 semi tractor trailers. It was set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> to go in less than 24 hours and broken down and packed up in about 16 hours. This allowed it to reach many cities and venues in its acclaimed, original Broadway form.|$|E
25|$|As {{the rest}} of the Greek fleet came in {{disorder}} into the battle scene, the Carthaginians, formed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready,</b> turned on them en masse. A fierce battle ensued, with ships exchanging darts, maneuvering to ram their counterparts and grapple each other for boarding. The Greeks were ultimately overwhelmed, their heavier ships and superior missile troops being of little use partly because of their disordered formation. The Carthaginians sent out boats to capture/kill the Greek sailors swimming in the water. Over 20,000 soldiers/rowers and 100 ships were lost before the surviving Greek ships could make a break for it.|$|E

25|$|Paddle down: A type of stance by the goaltender {{when the}} play {{is coming from the}} corner {{to the front of the}} net and the puck carrier is {{carrying}} the puck in front of the net looking to score. Here the goaltender puts the stick down on the ground, parallel to the ice, with the leg farthest from the post down and the other <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> to push. This works well against angled rushes or wrap arounds where the skater would normally out–skate the goalie. The skater does have the top part of the net to shoot at, but it is difficult to lift the puck over the goalie from up close. The paddle down stance is also effective against low passes from behind the net to players looking to score from the slot.|$|E
25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before Jimmy is executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge that Jimmy is tied <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and Jimmy is executed off-stage.|$|E
500|$|So {{much time}} had been spent on [...] "screwdriver work" [...] that Eno {{thought it would be}} best to start from scratch. His idea was to [...] "stage an accident" [...] and have the song's tapes erased. He said that this was not to force {{abandonment}} of the song, but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance. At one point, Eno had the tapes cued <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> to be recorded over, but this erasure never took place; according to engineer Flood, fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes, dropped the tray of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno.|$|E

2500|$|Polling {{showed a}} tight {{race in the}} days leading up to the New Hampshire primary. All of the {{candidates}} barnstormed in New Hampshire during the four days after the Iowa caucuses, targeting undecided and independent voters in the state. The day before the election, polls conducted by CNN/WMUR, Rasmussen Reports and USA Today/Gallup showed Obama jumping ahead by 9, 10, and 13 points respectively. Despite the apparent surge of momentum, Clinton defeated Obama by a margin of 39.1 percent to 36.5 percent in the New Hampshire primary on January 8, 2008. Obama told supporters that he was [...] "still fired <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> to go", echoing a theme of his campaign.|$|E
2500|$|The second Confederate wave was by Polk's corps, {{consisting}} of the divisions of Maj. Gens. Jones M. Withers and Benjamin F. Cheatham. What saved the Union from total destruction that morning was the foresight of Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan (McCook's wing), who anticipated an early attack and had the troops of his division <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> {{in the center of}} the right half of the line by 4 a.m. Withers hit Sheridan's right flank first (and Davis's left) but was repulsed in three separate charges. Then Cheatham, with his reserve division, hit Sheridan's front as Cleburne struck his flank. Cheatham's assault was sluggish and piecemeal; observers claimed he had been drinking heavily and was unable to command his units effectively. While Sheridan's men slowed the enemy advance, they did it at heavy cost to themselves; all three of Sheridan's brigade commanders were killed that day, and more than one third of his men were casualties in four hours of fighting in a cedar forest surrounded on three sides that became known as [...] "The Slaughter Pen." [...] By 10 a.m., many of the Confederate objectives had been achieved. They had captured 28 guns and over 3,000 Union soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|As {{former member}} and founder Bullington puts it [...] "we {{can play an}} old folks home in the {{afternoon}} and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready</b> for a good time, or some music at midnight. They all seem to enjoy it equally." [...] Fellow founder Sickmen claims [...] "the original intent of the band [...] [...] was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock." [...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't think many people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals. Then we have some old-time songs we play in our own way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Also under NFHS rules only, all runners are {{required}} to attempt to avoid collisions. If a runner fails to do so, he is guilty of malicious contact, which is one kind of offensive interference. [...] Malicious contact carries the additional penalty of ejection from the game. [...] In contrast, in professional and higher amateur baseball, violent collisions can occur without any interference (or obstruction), especially when a fielder is receiving a thrown ball near a base where a runner is trying to reach. [...] Any collision that occurs in this situation is not interference, because the fielder's action is in regard to a thrown ball. [...] As long as such a runner's actions are related to his attempt to reach the base, he cannot be called for interference. [...] The most common case of this is when a runner is attempting to score and the catcher has control of the ball. [...] If the catcher is in the path between third base and home plate, the baserunner may strike the catcher with his body {{in an attempt to}} dislodge the ball from the catcher's hand and then reach home plate. [...] This is usually attempted only when the play is close. [...] When the catcher is set <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>ready,</b> the runner has little chance of knocking the ball away. [...] Any such attempt presents a significant chance of injury to the baserunner, which has prompted the malicious contact rule to be used more often.|$|E
