As black celebrity invited us into their homes through shows like MTV cribs, we forgot the condition of overall African American financial affairs. Despite a large section of the 14 million black households drowning in poverty and debt the stories of a few are told as if they represent those of millions, not thousands. It is this new veil of economics that has allowed for a broad swath of America to become not just desensitized to black poverty, but also hypnotized by black celebrity... The decadent veil not only warps the black community's vision outward to a larger economic world, but it also distorts outside community's view of Black America's actual financial reality." ...|$|E
40|$|Pablo D’Erasmo for {{outstanding}} research assistance. We propose {{a theory of}} <b>unsecured</b> consumer <b>credit</b> where: (i) borrowers have the legal option to default; (ii) defaulters are not exogenously excluded from future borrowing; (iii) there is free entry of lenders; and (iv) lenders cannot collude to punish defaulters. In our framework, limited credit or credit at higher interest rates following default arises from the lender’s optimal response to limited information about the agent’s type and earnings realizations.

Our underlying framework is broadly consistent with the way real-world <b>unsecured</b> consumer <b>credit</b> markets work.

40|$|T he {{growth in}} <b>unsecured</b> <b>credit</b> {{over the past}} two decades has, becauseof current {{bankruptcy}} law, reduced the average welfare of the poor. This striking conclusion emerges from a model designed to maximize the benefits of both plentiful <b>unsecured</b> <b>credit</b> and lax bankruptcy law. Even exclusive concern for wealth redistribution does not provide self-evident jus-tification for lax bankruptcy law in the face of the unprecedented expansion in <b>unsecured</b> <b>credit</b> occurring {{over the past two}} decades. Specifically, accord-ing to the model, the welfare of low-income, low-asset households appears to have fallen in response to the dramatic increase in the availability of <b>unsecured</b> <b>credit</b> that has occurred since the Marquette Supreme Court ruling in 1978. The driving forces behind this welfare decrease are, first, the role of lax per-sonal bankruptcy law in thwarting debtors from credibly committing to repay debts, second, the premium that the poor must pay to borrow on <b>unsecured</b> <b>credit</b> markets, and third, the welfare loss from the imposition of deadweight bankruptcy penalties.

40|$|In this paper, I {{discuss the}} {{influence}} of the banking industry’s liability structure on the FDIC’s risk exposure, the relationship between this exposure and the assessment base, and various ways that the FDIC could incorporate the effects of bank liability structure into its price for deposit insurance. For most of the industry, I find that the FDIC’s risk exposure increases when banks move from domestic deposits to other funding sources because decreases in assessment income associated with a smaller assessment base are not offset by reductions in the FDIC’s exposure to loss. However, {{this may not be the}} case for banks that rely heavily on <b>unsecured</b> <b>credits</b> due to the benefits of market discipline. I outline three ways to incorporate bank liability structure into the FDIC’s pricing policy for deposit insurance: 1) change the assessment base; 2) adjust the pricing matrix; and 3) price directly for risk. I conclude that no such changes should be made in isolation. In particular, issues related to bank size must also be addressed because any change associated with liability structure would effectively shift the assessment burden towards larger banks. The FDIC’s historical loss experience indicates that, in terms of cost per dollar of expected FDIC losses, large banks already pay considerably more fo...|$|R
