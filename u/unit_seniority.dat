The enactment of title VII spawned extensive commentary on the effect of facially neutral employment practices that perpetuated pre-Act discrimination. Particular controversy arose concerning the application of seniority rules to blacks in jobs or <b>seniority</b> <b>units</b> from which they previously had been excluded because of their race. The problem of accommodating seniority systems and title VII arose in times of economic distress, when employers had to decide who would lose the job: the white employee who was more senior, or the minority employee whose lack of seniority was the result of historic discriminatory practices. The Supreme Court recently gave this controversy new life in its decision in Firefighters Local 1784 v. Stotts. This Article will discuss the interplay between seniority systems and title VII. Part I will examine the conflict that arises from the exemption of seniority systems from title VII. Part II will explore judicial decisions that have addressed the seniority-title VII conflict. Part III will analyze and critique the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Stotts.

There seems, {{over the}} past few years, to have arisen in Canada a grawing {{interest}} in Industry-wide bargaining. In Québec the government has explicitly stated its intention to encourage (through legislation) such a type of structure. A large number of advantages are alleged to flow from this « rational » approach as compared the traditional plant or local bargaining relationships. The author recognizes that such a shift could result in certain improvements, In the event of layoffs or complete plant shutdowns older workers may obtain wider bumping rights if the <b>seniority</b> <b>unit</b> is thereby enlarged. In this way {{the average age of the}} disemployed may drop, the age mix of the unemployed having been altered. Since retraining and mobility programs are likely to be more successful with younger workers, this change could represent a social gain. There remains of course the thorny issue of equity and compensation for the losers. Industry-wide certification - accompanied by appropriate changes in the majority requirements - may also extend the opportunity of collective bargaining to new sectors where plants are too small, turnover rates too high, and employer power too extensive to permit workers to even think seriously of unionization under the present regime. We should not underestimate the attachment of workers to seniority as the only meaningful proxy for job security. Enlargement of the <b>seniority</b> <b>unit,</b> to the extent that it heightens the state of insecurity of all but the older workers, will have to be compensated for by other ingredients of the job security concept. One such response might be that the (federal) government adhere honestly and explicitly to its 1946 commitment to maintain a full employment. Tight full employment combined with a meaningful and active manpower policy program would create the kind of environment in which workers do not fear dilution of their present seniority arrangements. Recent performance of our governments, mysteriously stricken with a pathological inflation phobia, have driven worker job securitybelow tolerable levels !One of the « advantages » seen to flow from industry-wide bargaining is a reduction in the number of strikes. This is a simplistic mathematical truism. The strike unit would of course be larger and the man-days lost would thus not be expected to fail. Of great interest here is that strikes would shut down entire industries rather that single plants. This more complete interruption of product flow would surely increase the « public interest » element in such a conflict. This would promote greater direct government intervention in collective bargaining, an undesirable development on almosta priori grounds alone. While on the subject of eliminating or reducing strike activity, it is necessary to point out that it is wholly illusory to pretend that this is necessarily desirable. Surely strikes are but one form of costly industrial conflict. Indeed, if enlargement of the bargaining unit does mean a reduction of strike activity we should anticipate that conflict will merely change its form. Among these other (substitute) forms of conflictual activity we find ;(1) a lowering of worker morale (frustration)  ;(2) a reduction in effort or productivity ;(3) an increase in grievances;(4) an increase in turnover rates ;(5) an increase in absenteeism ;(6) an increase in spoilage and breakage ;(7) an increase in accident rates ;(8) an increase in thefts;(9) an increase in sabotage ;(10) strikes that do break out (legal and illegal) will tend to be more violent. These aggressive manifestations result in increased costs of production, and where possible, increased prices. In the end, all parties in the market pay the price whether the conflict is open and explicit or hidden and implicitThe most potent argument against industry-wide bargaining is that it inevitably results in an upward displacement of the locus of power within the union hierarchy. The many advocates of the broader structure underestimate the dangers for the trade union movement of an even greater centralization of power than exists today. Most members are already alienated as citizens, as workers, and we are asked to witness a further alienation of the individual as union member. If a more concentrated power base is indeed imposed, this author predicts that the lower echelon leaders and the rank and file will create a (n) (informal) parallel structure while the existing unions will care for the « social » welfare rather than the narrow members' interests. Unions are institutions whose first (and almost only) role is to advance the interests of their members. They are not intended to occupy themselves with the « common good ». It is a matter of the allocation of private resources on the basis of a priority ranking...|$|R
40|$|Conflicts between {{seniority}} {{and employment}} equity became evident after the United States adopted {{laws in the}} 1960 s prohibiting discrimination in employment. Seniority rights sometimes slowed down or prevented the integration of Blacks {{and women in the}} workplace; in times of layoffs, they insured that recently-hired employees from these groups were the first to go. This led to innumerable law suits culminating in a series of U. S. Supreme Court decisions in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s. The potential for similar conflicts is even greater under Canadian anti-discrimination provisions because Canadian laws contain no counterpart of the general seniority exemption which is included in U. S. law. In spite of this, not a single case concerning indirect discrimination by seniority systems has been reported in this country. The few reported cases involving seniority and discrimination dealt with crude questions such as separate <b>seniority</b> <b>units</b> for women and men. The main elements demonstrated in this thesis are: (1) that seniority rules have harmful effects on Canadian women; (2) that these harmful rules constitute unjustified adverse impact discrimination under Canadian law; (3) that laws prohibiting adverse impact discrimination by seniority rules are not enforced in Canada; and (4) that many measures could be taken to reduce the negative impact of seniority systems on women while retaining the beneficial effects of the seniority principle. These points are developed in five chapters. Chapter I provides background information on the nature and coverage of seniority rights, the arguments for and against them {{and the way in which}} they are applied. Chapter II assesses the impact of seniority on women to correct its unjust effects on them. Chapter III reviews the legal history of the conflict between seniority and equality rights in the United States. In Chapter IV, we consider whether unmodified seniority rules constitute unjustified adverse impact discrimination under the following Canadian laws: (1) laws on the duty of fair representation of labour unions; (2) human rights acts; and (3) the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. At the end of Chapter IV, and in Chapter V, we describe changes which could be made to correct present injustices. Some, like the adoption of proactive employment equity laws with vigorous sanctions and powerful implementing agencies, aim at correcting the lack of enforcement. Other proposed changes involve a broad range of modifications to seniority systems to reduce or eliminate their negative impact on women, as well as alternatives to seniority-based layoffs. Our conclusion is that if such changes were made, the seniority principle could at last become the essential protector of vulnerable workers it was originally meant to be.

Il conclut en parlant des transformations technologiques et notre régime de relations industrielles. INTRODUCTION : BASIC CHARACTERISRICS OF RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANCESAlthough {{there is}} a great variety of opinions as to what the term « technological change » specifically means, there seems to be general agreement on at least two basic points: first, it is that the kinds of technological change we have experienced in the last decade have been introduced at a more rapid rate than those introduced in earlier years; second, it is that current technological change has far-reaching effects on industry's manpower requirements. In more concrete terms, the introduction of technological change in industry is generally associated with a substantial {{increase in the number of}} skilled, technical and professional occupations, and a slower growth rate for the semi-skilled and unskilled occupational groups. If technological change, rapidly introduced, means that many workers, young and old, with little or much seniority, in good or poor health, with much or little potential, may rapidly become useless, how can the parties to collective bargaining design ways in which the effects of technological change on the labour force can be cushioned? Also, to what extent and in what ways are collective agreements today responding to technological change?IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ON THE TECHNIQUES OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND INDUSTRIAL RELATIONSThe first question involves both the techniques of collective bargaining and industrial relations, and the substance of collective agreements as well. In a context of technological change, the techniques of collective bargaining are bound to be subject to significant changes. For it is one thing to negotiate a short-term objective at the bargaining table, such as a wage increase, a higher overtime premium rate, or a more generous cost-of-living allowance. But it is an entirely different matter for labour and management to discuss and negotiate about the long-term employment effects that the introduction of technological change will have in a given plant or company. During the negotiation involving short-term goals, such as wage increases or more generous cost-of-living allowances, the parties to collective bargaining usually use statistics as weapons designed to support predetermined positions, and research in these cases, is directed at bringing together these statistics which will support those rigid positions. There is in these situations, very little, if any, problem-solving research. On the other hand, negotiations and discussions with regard to long-term problems such as those associated with the introduction of technological changes, obviously cannot be solved by the strategic and superficial use of statistics. It is quite obvious that basic and important questions, such as training or retraining programs, or policies designed to ensure the mobility of those employees no longer needed in a given firm, call for more than short and usually tense bargaining sessions — if these questions are to be usefully examined. They require new techniques and new channels for labour-management consultation, as distinct from labour-management bargaining. Because some current and important labour-management issues call for consultation rather than bargaining in the traditional sense, there might, of course, be a temptation to believe that objective labour-management consultation should gradually replace collective bargaining as a way of determining working conditions. A word of caution against such an over-simplified expectation is perhaps in order. Indeed, in our industrial relations system operating in an essentially private enterprise economy and in a context of free decision-making, tough-minded bargaining will always have a role to play. There will always be issues which, by their very nature, call for bargaining in the truest sense of the word rather than rational consultation. Furthermore, the process of collective bargaining, with its pressures, its tensions and its threats of possible conflicts, can inject a lot of realism in certain labour-management situations, and can induce people to act, people who otherwise would not move. It does not seem unrealistic for me to state that, even in some cases, the very principle of labour-management consultation and co-operation — and the principle of mutual respect which it implies — can be brought about as a result of a tense bargaining situation or even a work stoppage. For example, in March of last year, after a seven-month long work stoppage, the Quebec Iron and Titanium Company and the National Metal Trades' Federation embodied the principle of labour-management consultation in their agreement by setting up a joint Human Relations Committee which would study and recommend solutions to mutual problems arising out of technological change. This example is merely used to illustrate the fact that in certain situations taking place within our industrial relations context, labour-management consultation and collective bargaining in the traditional sense can usefully play supplementary roles. IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE ON THE SUBSTANCE OF COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTSTurning now to the impact that technological change can have on the substance of collective agreements, let us quote what two prominent observers and analysts of the Canadian labour scene had to say in this respect:It is obvious that many of the issues listed in the above statement will be effectively dealt with through labour-management consultation and research rather than tense bargaining sessions. For example, the widening of the <b>seniority</b> <b>unit</b> which, in cases of technological change, might enable displaced workers to transfer their seniority — related rights to other departments and plants, is a typical development that calls for more than an exchange of statistics at the bargaining table! In fact, it requires the joint labour-management examination of how seniority provisions are applied in the industrial establishments involved. Furthermore, if the widened <b>seniority</b> <b>unit</b> is to cover several plants or firms, its effective functioning may very well call for inter-company and inter-union consultation, a procedure which might, to a certain extent, dislocate the traditionnally plant-wide bargaining relationship. SOME RECENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SETTLEMENTS OF SIGNIFICANCEAt this point our second question should be asked: to what extent and in what ways are collective agreements to-day responding to the challenge of technological change? There are, of course, unquestionable signs that in some situations the parties to collective bargaining on this continent have responded to the challenge of technological change in a positive manner. There is, for example, the Long-Range Sharing Plan that went into effect on March 1, 1963 at the Fontana, California plant on the Kaiser Steel Corporation. This plan was developed over three years as a result of research conducted by a tripartite committee composed of company, steelworkers and public representatives. The Long-Range Sharing Plan is designed to promote employment and income security for production, maintenance, clerical and technical workers affected by advance in technology. There was also the agreement reached in 1962 between the major Canadian railway companies and the unions representing their non-operating employees. This agreement provided for the establishment of a job security fund which would be used to cushion in a variety of ways the adverse effects faced by long-service employees whose jobs are eliminated by technological change. SHIFT IN GOVERNMENT POLICY AS IT AFFECTS INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. THE NEW MAINPOWER CONSULTATIVE SERVICE IN THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF LABOUR. There has also been in recent years, as a result of the impact of technological change on occupations and employment, a significant shift of government policy as it affects industrial relations. While, in the postwar period, the emphasis was on providing assistance to the parties so that they could reach agreement and settle their disputes, recent steps have been taken to bring labour and management together in order to discuss jointly their long-term problems in a broad economic context. May we draw attention here to the recently established Manpower Consultative Service in the Federal Department of Labour. There is no doubt that this Service could have a significant impact in the field of labour-management relations. Indeed, one of the key principles behind the establishment of the new Service is that apropriate steps must be taken well in advance of worker displacement resulting from industrial change. Another equally important principle is that where {{there is a}} union, a joint union-management approach should be followed with respect to research, assessment and plans for dealing with the adjustment process to industrial change. Of significance also, is the fact that the Federal Government will be prepared through this new Service to provide financial assistance to employers and unions for research on manpower development in advance of technological change. There is no doubt that the type of research involved here is of the objective kind; it is not the type of research that is geared to provide pleasing answers either to labour or to management, or to support rigid positions at the bargaining table. TO WHAT EXTENT ARE COLLECTIVE AGREEMENTS TODAY RESPONDING TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE? IMPLICATIONS FOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RESEARCHIt will be admitted that the various signs reviewed above of positive response to technological change, as encouraging as they are, still leave our general question largely unanswered. This question was: to what extent and in what ways are collective agreements today responding to the challenge of technological change? It is strongly suggested here that if this question is to be usefully answered, a new research approach is needed in the field of collective bargaining and industrial relations. By new research approach, it is meant a shift from an analysis of collective agreements only, to an analysis of agreements supplemented by field research. For example, in our recent study on collective agreement provisions in major manufacturing establishments, 2 provisions concerning « technological change » could not be tabulated. Indeed, it was discovered that the matters arising out of technological change were often dealt with in a variety of provisions that made no direct reference to technological change as such. What this actually means is that a major development such as changes in technology cannot b e examined in a study of collective agreements, based on documents only. However, there are many agreement provisions that raise a number of questions with respect to technological change. For example, seniority provisions on layoff were found in almost all of the establishments covered by the study mentioned above. 3 Some of those provisions were formulated in this manner :This type of clause was, of course, classified as one which provides that the senior employees will be retained provided their qualifications (or ability) to perform available jobs are sufficient. However, what is the true meaning of such a seniority provision in a context of technological change? What would be management and union policies followed in applying the seniority provision in cases of technological change? And, in the provision itself, what would « reasonable time » really mean? Would « reasonable time » be defined by management alone? Or by both union and management? Also, in cases of changing occupational requirements, would it be the policy of management to give an advance notice to the employees who may become affected by these changes so as to give these workers « reasonable time » to learn the new jobs to which they would be assigned? … One can immediately realize that these questions — as vital as they are — cannot be usefully answered on the basis of an analysis of collective agreements only. It is only through an analysis of agreements supplemented by field study that meaningful information could be supplied. Similarly, the mere reading of a training or retraining provision in a collective agreement does not, cannot, provide enough information as to what impact such provision has on the skills of the work-force in any particular establishment. Which are the workers who benefit from this provision? How are these workers selected? The answers to these questions are, of course, not to be found in the agreement but rather in the establishment where the agreement applies. CONCLUSION: TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND OUR INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS SYSTEMIn this article, a great deal of attention has been devoted to technological change as a development which can have dramatic and far-reaching effects on industrial relations and on the labour force. But technological change is also a major development through which our firms and industries and, indeed, our economy as a whole can effectively meet the challenge of increasing competition from foreign countries. It is, therefore, vitally important that the proper research techniques be applied to determine not only how the hardships that can result from the introduction of technological change can be cushioned, but also what adjustments can be brought to our industrial relations system so that technological change can become an instrument for economic expansion and increased human welfare.

In a more recent study onProvisions in Collective Agreements covering office employees in Canadian manufacturing industries (1967), 86 % of the agreements studied had a provision regarding seniority on promotion, while 97 % of the agreements examined had a provision regarding seniority on lay-off. So much for the incidence {{of some of the}} most important seniority provisions ; it should perhaps be emphasized that these data are for the manufacturing sector only. However, our definite impression is that the figures just quoted represent a fairly accurate picture of the incidence of seniority provisions in a number of Canadian industrial and occupational sectors. Let us now turn to the substance of seniority provisions and proceed somewhat systematically with various concepts. 1. We would broadly define seniority as the status acquired by an employee at his (her) place of employment through his (her) length of service. This definition, at brief as it is, raises some questions on our minds. It will be understood that only some of these questions can be raised here. How is seniority acquired ? How is it lost ? For example, is an employee going to accumulate seniority starting with his (her) first day of employment with the company, or is he (she) going to start accumulating seniority once he (she) has successfully completed his (her) probationary period ? Once the employee's probationary period is successfully completed, is the length of this period going to be credited to the employee in terms of seniority ? What happens to the employee's seniority when for example she or he is on temporary lay-off? How long can the employee retain the seniority he or she had accumulated prior to being laid-off ? What happens to her seniority when an employee goes on maternity leave ? Does she retain it ? Or does she not only retain it, but continue to accumulate it while she is on leave ? Or can she accumulate seniority only during a certain period of her leave ? More generally, could there be some types of leave during which continued accumulation of seniority would be provided for, while seniority accumulated prior to the taking of the leave would simply be retained during other types of leave? Does an employee who has had to leave the company through no fault of his (her) own, or has simply decided to leave the company, automatically lose his (her) seniority ? 4 These are a few of the many questions that can be raised. 2. For the purpose of analyzing seniority provisions, we have considered two major types of seniority concepts : the first one, straight seniority, means that length of service is the only factor to be considered ; for example, employees would be promoted on the basis of their length of service alone ; in our own experience, this type of seniority is very seldom found in collective agreements in relation to promotions and lay-offs. Which type of seniority concept is, then, more frequently found ?Contingent or modified seniority is far more prevalent in the agreements we have analyzed ; and it simply means that other factors than length of service (such as ability to do the job, performance, punctuality, etc.) are to be considered along with length of service. Perhaps two brief examples here may be more helpful than a lengthy explanation. Here are, then, two examples of collective agreement provisions based in our view on the concept of contingent or modified seniority :Example 1  : « In cases of promotions, [...] ., the skills, ability and efficiency of the employees shall be the governing factor and where these things are equal, seniority shall be the governing factor [...] .  »Example 2  : « In the event of reduction of staff and rehiring of employees seniority shall apply provided the employée with the greater amount of seniority can satisfactorily perform the job he is assigned to, or can learn the job within reasonable time [...] .  »These two provisions, illustrating the concept of contingent or modified seniority, are also an illustration of two subconcepts. Example 1 was indeed based on what could be called the concept ofequal ability, meaning that seniority will govern if there is equality in ability (and other factors, if any) to perform the job ; example 2 was based, on the other hand, on the concept ofsufficient ability, meaning that seniority will govern if the employee has sufficient ability to perform the job. Fields of seniority recognition 3. The two provisions just cited also provided examples of areas where seniority would be taken into account — or what might be called « fields of seniority recognition ». Example 1 had to do with the problem of staff reduction and rehiring, while example 2 dealt with promotions. There can of course be other fields of seniority recognition : transfers, choice of vacation time, choice of working time, to mention a few. There is also the range of length-of-service related benefits such as graduated vacation plans, sick leave, etc., that one finds in collective agreements. <b>Seniority</b> <b>Units</b> 4. A brief word should now perhaps be said about seniority units; in other words (and to proceed descriptively) one can have occupation-wide, department-wide, plant-wide, company-wide (in multi-plant company), etc., <b>seniority</b> <b>units.</b> Without wanting to go into too many details, our understanding of the <b>seniority</b> <b>unit</b> it the unit within which the years of service of the employee are considered : for example, an employee may have been fifteen years, in the plant, but only 7 years in department X of the plant. It could be stated, therefore, that such an employee has fifteen years' plant seniority, and 7 years' seniority in department X. These may be very important distinction since the seniority of the employee (together with other factors, depending on that the provision says) might be considered on a plant-wide basis in cases of lay-offs for example ; and his seniority might be considered on a department-wide basis in cases of promotions. One example will be provided here of the latter type of provisions, and one example of the former 5. Enough has perhaps been stated at this point to suggest that seniority provisions can indeed be very important to employees : in terms not only of promotional opportunities, but also in terms of job protection, work satisfaction, etc. Seniority provisions in a context of changing technologyYet when we read a seniority provision, we always tend to place it — perhaps as should be done — in the world of work of 1970, which is one of fast changing technology. In relation to this very point, and before concluding, a few questions will be raised. When a seniority clause provides that « in cases of promotions, [...] . the skills, ability and efficiency of the employees shall be the governing factor and where these things are equal, seniority shall be the governing factor [...] .  » some questions are raised in our minds and these questions are simply submitted here for consideration. In a context of a changing technology resulting in new skill requirements, what would be the real meaning of « equal ability » as between senior and younger employees, in organizations where senior employees — set in their habits and perhaps in skills in need of updating — would be competing for promotion with younger employees freshly graduated from recognized institutes of technology and science, and mastering the knowledge required for an effective performance in those jobs open for promotion ? Furthermore, in these situations, what would be attitude of an employee's organization towards changes in technology, an organization whose membership might be considered « senior » in terms of length of service ? Or, what would be the attitude of an employees' organization with a younger membership towards displaced older employees ? And what would be the attitude of management naturally — as it should — preoccupied with efficiency ?CONCLUSIONThese were some questions that we had wished to raise by way of conclusion. It is hoped that it has been demonstrated in this article that to discuss collective agreements and seniority provisions is not to be involved in theoretical dissertations. Collective agreements and their seniority provisions, as well as their other provisions, are not only close to and part of, the work lives of hundreds of thousands of Canadians. They can also have an impact on the total of their lives. * The remarks contained in this article, are derived from a statement made by the author to theInstitute on Collective Bargaining of theRegistered Nurses' Association of Ontario (Toronto, November, 1968), are personal in nature and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Canada Department of Labour of which, at the time of the presentation of this statement, the author was an officer, nor do they necessarily reflect the Pay Research Bureau of which since July 1, 1969, the author is Assistant-Director (Research). 1 Importance of Collective Agreements in Canada — an address to the Richelieu Club of Hull (Que.), by Félix QUINET, January 16, 1968, pp. 3 - 4. 2 This figure is quoted fromImportance of Collective Agreements in Canada — an address to the Richelieu Club of Hull (Que.), by Félix QUINET, January 16, 1968, pp. 3 - 4. 3 It might perhaps be in order to suggest here that collective agreements may also make contributions in equally important contexts as that of the response to technological change. To illustrate this point, a couple of questions might be raised : When employees with a grievance realize that the complaints which they make are studied closely by an impartial arbitrator, because of the collective agreement, will these employees not have a very concrete and practical concept of the working of justice ? Is it unrealistic to believe that it is possible for a grievance procedure within a collective agreement applying to teachers, to facilitate in certain cases, the examination of questions which are intimately bound up with the salutary but delicate exercice of academic freedom ? Furthermore, is it far-fetched to think that, in certain cases, the workings of collective agreements concerning teachers could offer a concrete idea of the nature of academic freedom ? In our opinion, these are some of the unquestionably positive aspects of collective agreements that do not seem to receive their fair share of attention from the public to-day. 4 In this respect, it has often been argued that the ability of employees to transfer seniority-related rights and benefits from one bargaining unit to another would be encouraging a higher degree of labour mobility. It should indeed be borne in mind that an employee might think twice before moving to a better paid job and/or to a job more in line with his ability, if by moving, this employee would lose all seniority-related rights and benefits accumulated over the years.
