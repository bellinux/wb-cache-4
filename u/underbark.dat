50|$|Beavers are herbivores, and {{prefer the}} wood of quaking aspen, cottonwood, willow, alder, birch, maple and cherry trees. They also eat sedges, pondweed, and water lilies. Beavers do not hibernate, but rather they store sticks and logs in a pile in their ponds, eating the <b>underbark.</b> The dams they build flood areas of {{surrounding}} forest, giving the beaver safe access to an important food supply, which is the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees. They prefer aspen and poplar, but will also take birch, maple, willow, alder, black cherry, red oak, beech, ash, hornbeam and occasionally pine and spruce. They will also eat cattails, water lilies and other aquatic vegetation, especially in the early spring. Indian rhinoceros are grazers. Their diets consist almost entirely of grasses, but they also eat leaves, branches of shrubs and trees, fruits, and submerged and floating aquatic plants.They feed in the mornings and evenings. They use their prehensile lips to grasp grass stems, bend the stem down, bite off the top, and then eat the grass.

50|$|Ulmus laevis {{is similar}} in stature to the wych elm, if rather less symmetric, with a looser branch {{structure}} and less neatly rounded crown. It typically reaches a height and breadth of > 30 m, with a trunk < 2 m d.b.h. The extensive shallow root system ultimately forms distinctive high buttresses {{around the base of}} the trunk. The bark is smooth at first, then in early maturity breaks into thin grey scales, which separate with age into a network of grey-brown scales and reddish-brown <b>underbark,</b> and finally is deeply fissured in old age like other elms. The leaves are deciduous, alternate, simple ovate with a markedly lop-sided base, < 10 cm long and < 7 cm broad, comparatively thin, often almost papery in texture and very translucent, smooth above with a downy underside. The leaves are shed earlier in autumn than other species of European elm. However, the tree is most reliably distinguished from other European elms by its long flower stems, averaging 20 mm. Moreover, the apetalous wind-pollinated flowers are distinctively cream-coloured, appearing before the leaves in early spring in clusters of 15-30; they are 3-4 mm across. The fruit is a winged samara < 15 mm long by 10 mm broad with a ciliate margin, the single round 5 mm seed maturing in late spring. The seeds have a generally high rate of germination, 45-60% for Serbian trees examined by Stilinović.|$|E

Generally, the level of resistance of all clonal lines declined with increasing temperature. RR 2 had consistently higher mortality than SS 1, and is therefore not considered resistant. Lesion development was also measured in detached stems of RR 1 and a susceptible clonal line (SS 2) each inoculated <b>underbark</b> with four different P. cinnamomi isolates. Stems were assessed for lesion development at 20, 25 and 30 °C for 4 days. For all four isolates, detached stems of RR 1 generally had smaller lesions than those of SS 2, particularly at 30 °C.

Taper models are used to estimate the volume and value of wood products from harvesting trees. Teak (Tectona grandis L. f.) is highly valued {{as one of the}} world's most preferred timbers and a teak taper equation is required to inform optimal harvesting strategies given the limited plantation resource available in Thailand. Teak taper equations were developed and evaluated based on 331 sample trees collected in 2014 from eight plantations in northern Thailand aged from 10 to 46  yr using two taper model formulations—the Kozak variable-exponent taper model and the Goodwin cubic polynomial model comprising hyperbolic and parabolic terms. Variants based on both model types were fitted using nonlinear regression analysis with diameter at breast height, total tree height and height of girth measurement as the independent variables to estimate diameter <b>underbark</b> at the nominated height. Goodness-of-fit and leave-one-out cross validation with lack-of-fit statistical testing combined with extensive graphical analysis of residuals were used to select the best model. A Goodwin model variant (named FIO-teak 1 as the first plantation teak taper model known to be published in Thailand) provided the best estimates of volume and diameter <b>underbark.</b> A simple case study confirmed that FIO-teak 1 in combination with the Farm Forestry Toolbox software package could assist teak plantation managers in decision making associated with optimizing log grade value based on standing tree inventory data...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScFor (Forest and Wood Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a set of models that will allow the {{determination}} of volume for Tectona grandis trees and stands grown in plantation form in Tanzania. As a secondary objective, models describing tree and dominant stand height were developed. Total volume and volume ratio models were fitted that respectively predict total tree volume and merchantable volume. In order to allow the calculation of volume for different product classes and dimensions, taper models were fitted. All the data were collected by non-destructive sampling methods using a Barr and Stroud optical dendrometer. This proved to be an accurate and inexpensive method of collecting data for developing volume and taper models. Sampling stratification was based on age and site quality and as wide a range as possible was covered to ensure adequate representation of all growing sites and ages present in Tanzanian teak plantations. A total of 2617 individual observations were made from 222 trees at three teak plantations. Several models were selected from the literature to describe teak volume and shape. Results indicated that the Schumacher and Hall (1933) volume equation best describes total volume over and <b>underbark</b> to a fixed upper limit of 7. 5 cm. Merchantable volume to upper stem diameter and height limits were best described by respectively the Burkhart (1977) volume ratio model and the Cao and Burkhart (1980) modification thereof. Many of the fitted taper models were unable to adequately describe stem shape over the whole stem, mainly due to the large range in tree sizes and ages used in model fitting. The variable form taper model by Perez, Burkhart and Stiff (1990) provided the best results according to various criteria and is recommended for predicting teak <b>underbark</b> diameters to various heights and, if only a single model is required, the merchantable volume. Top height growth of teak stands was adequately described by the generalized Schumacher (1939) model with the value of the exponent k estimated from the sample data. From this a series of anamorphic site index curves were developed. Suitable height-dbh curves were obtained by a simple linear model and predictions improved by including stand age and site index as predictor variables...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Tree taper {{models are}} {{required}} for estimating the dimensions of products from trees (e. g., log under-bark diameters and volumes). Typically, taper models are parameterised and validated using <b>underbark</b> diameters taken along the stems {{of a large number}} of trees destructively sampled from the population of interest (application population). Such data collection is costly and time-consuming. Sometimes a limited data set from the application population may exist for estimating a preliminary taper model, or a taper model developed for a similar population may exist. However, the prediction accuracy of these models is unclear. This paper suggests a sequential accuracy testing approach to validate tree taper models under these specific situations. The prediction accuracy of the preliminary or existing taper model is tested using new stem diameter data from trees sampled progressively from the application population. At each stage of sampling, the prediction accuracy, measured by the observed cumulative squared errors, is evaluated against requirements specified by the users. Two parametric sequential accuracy tests are suggested for making decisions on the applicability of the tested models. Data collection stops once the decision to accept the tested model is reached. Otherwise, dat...|$|E
40|$|Cankering of marri in the {{southern}} forest of Western Australia is causing concern as it is increasing considerably in severity and geographic range. The causal agent(s) {{is yet to be}} determined. Samples of tissue were collected from lesion margins of cankered trees in state forest and on private property in Brunswick Junction, Perup and Balingup. Samples were surface sterilised and plated onto PDA, and pure cultures obtained were identified. Fungi most frequently associated with marri cankers were C. eucalypticola, Endothiella sp and Favostroma sp. Ten saplings at Jarrahdale were <b>underbark</b> inoculated with isolates of Cytospora eucalypticola, Endothiella sp., or Favostroma sp. Isolates of Endothiella sp. and Cytospora sp. caused significantly long and wide lesions over a period of four months, and one of the two Favostroma sp. isolates caused significantly long but not wide lesions. There were significant differences in the pathogenicity of Endothiella sp. isolates with one isolate causing lesions up to 20 cm long, and girdling marri stems (65 mm mean circumference) in four of the ten replicates. It is possible that these fungi may be more pathogenic to trees under stress, and there is a pressing need for further research into the cause and extent of the organism(s) responsible for marri decline and death...|$|E

Thirty-six B. grandis trees were killed by <b>underbark</b> inoculation with P. cinnamomi l 0 cm below ground level. To assess distribution and survival of the pathogen, 4 dead trees were harvested at the time of death and a further 4 at each of 12 and 18 months after death.

P. cinnamomi colonisation of standing dead trees declined over time. The pathogen was isolated from 54 % of sample cores 2 months after death, and only 2. 4 % after 12 months.

40|$|Small {{community-based}} {{biomass energy}} systems sourcing feedstocks from local small-scale forests {{are common in}} the northern hemisphere but are few in Australia. Fine-grained analyses of feedstock availability are an important precursor to increased investment in these systems in Australia. This study presents estimates of the potential biomass for energy supply from hardwood plantations within the Sunshine Coast Council region of southeast Queensland. The region’s 1, 120 ha of private farm forestry, corporate-owned and joint venture hardwood plantations are predominantly small-scale (> ha) Gympie Messmate (Eucalyptus cloeziana) monocultures. Plantation age-class and corresponding area, productivity and management history findings and informed harvest-related assumptions underpin a 20 -year forecast of biomass yields from a suggested plantation harvest schedule. The biomass yields are <b>underbark</b> stem-wood quantities assumed to be unmerchantable for higher-value solid-wood products. Future thinning (at age 12 years) and clearfell harvests (age 25 years) could provide minimum woody biomass yields of 30 and 108 GMt/ha respectively. Closer to 200 GMt/ha may be available from clearfell harvests of poorly-managed farm forestry plantations. The forecast annually available biomass supply is highly variable and mostly of small quantities. Biomass energy plants seeking a sustainable supply of feedstock must therefore access additional locally-available waste biomass. Further research is required to identify and quantify these sources. Field trials are also required to understand better the likely product mixes and available volumes of biomass for energy from the region’s various hardwood plantations and to test for efficient integrated biomass harvest and supply chain systems for the sizes and terrains that are characteristic of these plantations...|$|E

Although {{phosphite}} stimulates resistance to P. cinnamomi, {{this is the first}} histological study of its effect on Eucalyptus marginata, an economically important forest tree in Western Australia. Clonal lines of E. marginata, considered resistant and susceptible to P. cinnamomi, were <b>underbark</b> inoculated with P. cinnamomi. 4 days later, they were treated with 0, 2. 5, 5 or 10 g L- 1 phosphite. Transverse hand sections were stained for suberin and lignin, and histological responses to infection were examined. Defence responses were stimulated at all phosphite concentrations in both clonal lines, and the genotypic difference in lesion length was eliminated within 8 days of treatment. In the resistant line, suberin production was stimulated while in the susceptible line both lignin and suberin were stimulated. By 2 days after treatment, phosphite stimulated a faster rate of suberin production in the resistant line than the susceptible line, but by 4 days after treatment, {{there was no difference in}} the increase between the lines. Damage caused by P. cinnamomi was found to extend furthest in the cortex and outer phloem in transverse sections in both genotypes. In the presence of P. cinnamomi, phosphite stimulated mitosis as part of the defence response, with meristematic activity involved in the compartmentalisation of damaged tissue (formation of periderm) and closure of healthy tissue (callus). Phytotoxicity had a detrimental effect in healthy tissues and this was more apparent in the resistant line, where it did not provide the best protection from lesion extension and plant mortality, suggesting phytotoxicity could disrupt defence responses. Phosphite increases the capacity of susceptible and resistant E. marginata clonal lines to wall-off and contain P. cinnamomi colonisation through lignin and suberin deposition, and increased meristematic activity...|$|E
40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi is an {{introduced}} soilborne phytopathogen to Western Australia (WA) and {{impacts on}} 2000 {{of the approximately}} 9000 plant species indigenous in the southwest of WA. Amongst these is Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah), the dominant and economically important hardwood timber species of the jarrah forest. This thesis aimed to investigate the morphological, pathogenic and genotypic variation in two local WA populations of P. cinnamomi isolates. The populations were selected from areas where jarrah clonal lines selected for resistance to P. cinnamomi {{may be used in}} the rehabilitation of infested jarrah forest and rehabilitated bauxite minesites in the southwest of WA. Resistance against a range of isolates using different inoculation methods. Seventy-three isolates of P. cinnamomi were collected from diseased jarrah and Corymbia calophylla (marri) trees from two populations located 70 km apart and these were examined for phenotypic and genotypic variation. Microsatellite DNA analysis showed that all isolates were of the same clonal lineage. In P. cinnamomi for the first time I show that there is a broad and continuous variation in the morphology and pathology between two populations of one clonal lineage, and that all phenotypes varied independently from one another. No relationship was found between morphological and pathogenic characters. The ability of isolates in both populations to cause deaths ranged from killing all plants within 59 days to plants being symptomless 182 days after inoculation. Single and multiple paragynous antheridia formed along with amphigynous ones in mating studies with all WA isolates and a sample of worldwide isolates. Developmental studies and cytological examination showed fertilisation tubes developed asynchronously or synchronously from both antheridial types and indicated that either antheridial type contributed a nucleus for fertilisation of the oosphere. This is the first report of paragynous antheridial associations in P. cinnamomi. Antheridial variation is a characteristic that needs to be adjusted in the taxonomic Phytophthora identification keys.

40|$|Continuous forest {{inventory}} (CFI) {{is an effective}} method for studying forest changes over time; it provides growth and yield information which forest planners and managers can use for planning and managing forests to meet long-term sustained yield. This thesis reports results from a 30 year series of successive CFI measurement at Mt. Cole State Forest in west-central Victoria, commencing in 1963. With an area of 12, 352 ha, Mt. Cole State Forest consists of three sub areas; {{the northern and southern}} Blocks totalling 11, 250 ha, and the Mt. Lonarch Block comprised of 1, 102 ha. Permanent sample plots (CFI plots) were first established in the Mt. Cole Blocks in 1963 and these have been measured on seven occasions, including the most recent 1994 assessment. During this period, various changes to the inventory data-base have occurred, which have impacted on the analysis and interpretation of the data. Since 1983 the forest area of the Mt. Cole Blocks have been classified according to land use and management zoning, resulting in a reduction of the net productive area available for sawlog production to 2, 758 ha. This area has also been stratified into four homogenous areas (strata) and the number of CFI plots has been reduced from an initial 114 to 66 plots. In the latest (1994) remeasurement, the 66 permanent sample plots for the four strata of the Northern and Southern Mt. Cole Blocks were rechecked and the data has been analysed to determine current growth and yield, and to estimate future volume growth and an available cut for the forest. The above analyses show that the structure and yield of the forest have changed from time to time, with a trend towards decreasing levels of available growing stock over time. The current (1994) growing stock levels of the Mt. Cole Blocks are approximately 80, 676 m 2 � 27 % (P= 0. 95) or 28. 6 � 3. 7 m 2 /ha for basal area, and 237, 684 m 3 � 36 % (P= 0. 95) or 83. 7 � 13. 9 m 3 /ha for 'sawlog plus potential sawlog volume'. The current available sawlog volume is approximately 177, 672 m 3 � 44 % (P= 0. 95) or 63. 5 � 12. 5 m 3 /ha. Additional analyses of periodic and annual growth rates of the growing stock for each stratum and the whole forest (Mt. Cole Blocks) show that the average diameter increment (<b>underbark)</b> of the forest is approximately 0. 51 � 0. 03 cm/yr; the net annual increment including ingrowth (Gn+i) of the growing stock in the Mt. Cole Blocks is approximately 0. 63 � 0. 11 m 2 /ha/yr for basal area, 2. 16 � 0. 75 m 3 /ha/yr for sawlog, and 1. 78 � 0. 68 m 3 /ha/yr for sawlog plus potential sawlog. The net annual changes in growing stock levels (Gd) are approximately 0. 11 � 0. 29 m 2 /ha/yr for basal area, - 0. 15 � 1. 52 m 3 /ha/yr for sawlog, and - 0. 65 � 1. 52 m 3 /ha/yr for sawlog plus potential sawlog. Models for predicting the current and future growing stock levels were developed using multiple regression based on the three parameters of initial basal area (BO), initial volume (Yo), and the interval of time between successive measurements (t). Regulating forests to obtain long-term sustained yields requires a continuous flow of information on growth and yield and the development of comprehensive management strategies based on this information. In this study, such growth and yield information have been used to determine an annual available cut for the Mt. Cole Blocks of approximately 5, 364 � 1, 854 m 3 /yr.
