50|$|Located on Main Street in Salt Lake City's Exchange Place Historic District, the {{courthouse}} helped introduce the Classical Revival style to Utah. The original building was constructed between 1902 and 1905 with a U-shaped plan. The two additions, completed in 1912 and 1932, closed {{the end of}} the U and added another <b>U-shaped</b> <b>section.</b> Together they form a plan with a figure-eight shape, enclosing a pair of light courts. When the last addition was constructed, the Classical Revival style was reinterpreted as a form of modern classicism that was prevalent for many public buildings of the 1930s.|$|E
50|$|The Marion Colored High School is a {{historic}} school building at {{the northwest corner of}} Arkansas Highway 77 and Gannt Street in Sunset, Arkansas. It is a single-story brick structure, roughly in an H shape, with hipped roofs on the wings. The oldest portion of the building, a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>section,</b> was built in 1924 with funding from the Rosenwald Fund, and was extended to its present shape sometime before 1940. The original construction is of load-bearing brick, while the added wings are frame construction finished in a matching brick veneer. It was the first school built for African-American students in the area, originally serving grades 1-8. In 1937 the school acquired high school status, and served students from four states in the region, prompting its enlargement. In 1955 it was remodeled for use exclusively as a high school. It is now closed, and only used for special events.|$|E

This kind of composite beam takes thick steel plate as bottom plate and thinner cold-formed thin-walled steel as web which are connected through a <b>u-shaped</b> <b>section</b> by welding, and then concrete are poured in the u-shaped. In this paper an experimental study was conducted on six full size simple supported U-section steel-encased concrete composite beams. The relationships of the load-deflection curves of the composite beams were obtained.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the flame stabilization mechanism and the conditions leading to the blowoff of a laminar premixed flame anchored downstream of a heat-conducting perforated-plate/multi-hole burner, with overall nearly adiabatic conditions. We use unsteady, fully resolved, two-dimensional simulations with detailed chemical kinetics and species transport for methane-air combustion. Results show a bell-shaped flame stabilizing above the burner plate hole, with a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>section</b> anchored between neighboring holes. The base of the positively curved <b>U-shaped</b> <b>section</b> of the flame is positioned near the stagnation point, at a location where the flame displacement speed {{is equal to the}} flow speed. This location is determined by the combined effect of heat loss and flame stretch on the flame displacement speed. As the mass flow rate of the reactants is increased, the flame displacement speed at this location varies non-monotonically. As the inlet velocity is increased, the recirculation zone grows slowly, the flame moves downstream, and the heat loss to the burner decreases, strengthening the flame and increasing its displacement speed. As the inlet velocity is raised, the stagnation point moves downstream, and the flame length grows to accommodate the reactants mass flow. Concomitantly, the radius of curvature of the flame base decreases until it reaches an almost constant value, comparable to the flame thickness. While the heat loss decreases, the higher flame curvature dominates thereby reducing the displacement speed of the flame base. For a stable flame, the gradient of the flame base displacement speed normal to the flame is higher than the gradient of the flow speed along the same direction, leading to dynamic stability. As inlet velocity is raised further, the former decreases while the latter increases until the stability condition is violated, leading to blowoff. The flame speed during blow off is determined by the feedback between the growing recirculation zone and the cooling burner plate. © 2011 The Combustion Institute...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of thin-walled open section beams {{can be performed}} by means of Vlasov's theory of the sectorial areas. It is well-known {{that this type of}} profiles, when subjected to torsional actions, are characterised by the warping deformation and, consequently, by a further stress state whose intensity is comparable with that produced by mere flexural deformations. In the literature many papers are focused on the structural behaviour of these elements, but, to the Author's best knowledge, none proposed an experimental technique to evaluate first-hand this particular behaviour. In order to verify the classical theory of the sectorial areas, in the present paper an experiment regarding a thin-walled open section profile subjected to flexural and torsional loads is performed. With the help of a specific optical device, suitable for precision measurements, the warping displacements of a <b>U-shaped</b> <b>section</b> are easily acquired. These are compared to those derived, first, from an analytical formulation, originally devised to deal with vertical thin-walled bracings belonging to the structural core of a tall building, and, secondly, from a FE program, in which the steel profile is modelled by means of thin-shell elements. The numerical comparison confirms the reliability of the analytical formulation...|$|E
40|$|Mount Etna is {{the largest}} active volcano of Europe and the highest {{mountain}} (about 3, 330 m a. s. l.) of peninsular and insular Italy; moreover, during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 25, 000 ÷ 14, 000 years BP) it was some hundreds meters higher than today. Since other mountains of the Apennines were covered by glaciers during the Upper Pleistocene, several authors hypothesized that a glacial cover could have been also present on Mount Etna during the LGM, being the estimated limit of perpetual snow around 2, 500 m a. s. l. {{at that time and}} latitude. We have carried out a morphological survey in a portion of the volcanic edifice where rocks older than the LGM outcrop. This portion includes Punta Lucia, on the NW slope, and Serra delle Concazze, on the NE slope.

30|$|U-shaped {{thin-walled}} {{concrete bridge}} beams usually suffer the combined actions of flexure, shear and torsion, but no research about {{the behavior of}} U-shaped thin-walled RC beams under combined actions {{has been reported in}} literature. Three large specimens of U-shaped thin-walled RC beams were tested under different torque–bending moment ratios (T–M ratios) of 1 : 5, 1 : 1 and 1 : 0 to investigate the mechanical responses such as crack patterns, reinforcement strains, failure modes and ductility. The testing results showed that ductile flexural failures occurred for all three of the U-shaped thin-walled beam specimens, although the combined shear effect of circulatory torque, warping torque and shear force increased as the T–M ratio increased from 1 : 5 via 1 : 1 to 1 : 0, reflected by diagonal cracks and stirrup strains. More specifically, basically symmetrical flexural failure was dominated by the bending moment when the T–M ratio was 1 : 5; flexural failure of the loaded half of the U-shaped thin-walled section was dominated by the combined action of the bending moment and warping moment, while {{there were only a few}} cracks on the other half of the <b>U-shaped</b> <b>section</b> when the T–M ratio was 1 : 1; and anti-symmetrical flexural failure was dominated by the warping moment when the T–M ratio was 1 : 0 (pure torsion). A simple method to calculate the ultimate load of such U-shaped thin-walled RC beams under different T–M ratios was suggested, and the calculating results were corresponding well with the experimental results.|$|E

40|$|Pressure-energized {{seal rings}} {{intended}} to withstand flows better than do conventional pressure-energized seal rings have been conceived. The concept applies, more specifically, to seal rings used on some valve stems, pistons, and the like. A conventional pressure-energized seal ring generally has a <b>U-shaped</b> cross <b>section</b> {{and consists of}} an elastomer or other suitable polymer with an embedded metal energizing spring (see Figure 1). The working fluid from the high-pressure side that one seeks to seal is allowed into the U-shaped cavity, so that the pressure pushes {{the sides of the}} seal ring tighter against the gland and body sealing surfaces, thereby increasing the degree of sealing. Unfortunately, when the seal ring is exposed to flow of the working fluid, under some conditions, the flow grabs the lip of the <b>U-shaped</b> cross <b>section</b> and ejects or deforms the seal ring so that, thereafter, a proper seal is not obtained. Figure 2 depicts one of several alternative seal rings according to the present concept. One element of the concept is to modify the <b>U-shaped</b> cross <b>section</b> from that of the corresponding conventional seal ring to eliminate the exposed lip and prevent entry of the working fluid into the U-shaped cavity. Unlike in the conventional seal, pressurized fluid would not push the seal ring directly against the both gland and body sealing surfaces. Instead, the pressure would directly push the seal ring against a gland sealing surface only. In so doing, the pressure would squash the seal ring into a smaller volume bounded by the gland and body sealing surfaces, and would thereby indirectly press the seal ring more tightly against the body sealing surface. To enhance the desired squashing deformation, a spring having an approximately parallelogram cross section would be embedded in the modified U-shaped cavity. As the pressure pushed two corners of the approximate parallelogram closer together along the axis of the seal ring, the other two corners of the approximate parallelogram would be pushed farther apart along a radius of the ring, thereby causing the polymeric ring material to push radially harder against the body sealing surface. From the radially innermost corner of the approximate parallelogram, the spring material would extend radially, then axially into recesses in the seal gland. These extensions would help to restrain the seal ring against ejection. A seat retainer would hold the sealing ring in the gland and form a mechanical compression seal to prevent or at least reduce leakage of pressurized fluid into the cavity behind the seal. However, because there would likely be a little leakage, the cavity behind the seal should be vented to the low pressure side to prevent buildup of pressure in the cavity over time; otherwise, the built-up pressure could cause ejection of the seal ring when the pressure on the high-pressure side was reduced. Polymeric seal-ring materials {{may not be able to}} withstand working conditions in applications that involve abrasive and/or hot working fluids. For such applications, all-metal seal rings may be preferred. The bottom part of Figure 2 shows one example of an alternative gland configuration with an all-metal seal ring...|$|R
40|$|At {{middle to}} high latitudes, many alpine valleys have {{been shaped by}} glaciers {{associated}} with periods of Pleistocene glaciation. Present glaciated valleys are characterised by broadened valley floors and <b>U-shaped</b> cross <b>sections,</b> continuously formed by glacial activity from initially V-shaped, fluvial cross sections. Sinks Canyon (Wind River Range, USA) is a glaciated valley characterised by a typical <b>U-shaped</b> cross <b>section,</b> containing till from several glacial advances over a range of at least 1 Ma. The morphostratigraphic records indicate a fourfold difference in ice surface elevation between the youngest and oldest glacial periods, which is not easily explained by the present-day valley topography. To assess possible evolution scenarios of Sinks Canyon, we modelled the palaeovalley topography using a geographic information system (GIS) filtering technique in combination with temporal reference points from relative and numerically dated glacial deposits. Ice thicknesses were calculated using the shallow ice approximation. In our model, the valley became shallower and the topography smoother with increasing years back in time. The results suggest that valley topography with ages between 640 and 1000 ka can clearly be distinguished from the present-day topography. Surfaces with ages of 130 – 200 ka (attributable to MIS 6; Bull Lake glaciation) still could be discerned from present-day topography, but with relatively high uncertainties. The method did not work for topography less than ~ 100 ka or older than ~ 1 Ma. Erosion depths were calculated using the differences between present-day elevation and the modelled surfaces. Calculated erosion rates were {{within the range of}} reference values for glacial erosion (0. 001 to 1 mm a⁻¹). Glacial erosion appears to have removed 0. 52 to 0. 72 mm a⁻¹ of rock within a time frame of 1 Ma, assuming 200 ka of aggregated glacial flow. If the glacial occupation was longer or the impact of fluvial erosion was not negligible (as assumed), then the calculated rate is lower. If the model assumes a less extended time of glacial flow (b 100 ka), the rate exceeds 1 mm a⁻¹. The method used for surface reconstruction and erosion rates calculation is highly dependent on (i) the reliability of the temporal anchor points and (ii) the assumption of physical glacier conditions (basal shear stress) ...|$|R
