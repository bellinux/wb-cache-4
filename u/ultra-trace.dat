40|$|To be able {{to detect}} {{explosives}} <b>ultra-traces</b> has become a societal need particularly to anticipate terrorist attacks. During the last decade, despite wellstudied heavy analytical techniques, more sensitive and portable new gas-chemosensors have been developed. The sensor principle is based on a sensitive material interacting with the gaseous analyte. These interactions can induce a variation of the intrinsic properties of the material. For example, it can be fluorescence quenching easily identified with a spectrofluorimeter.

40|$|A method {{based on}} {{automated}} dynamic headspace sampling followed by thermal desorption – capillary GC – MS {{was developed to}} monitor <b>ultra-traces</b> of vinyl chloride in water samples. The method shows excellent performance including a limit of quantification (LOQ) below 10 ng/L, good linearity (r 2 > 0. 999) in the 10 to 200 ng/L concentration range and an RSD below 10 % at all calibration levels. The method was applied to study the release of traces of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) in water from aged polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipes installed in water supply systems. A solution to avoid this leaching would be the insertion of a polyethylene pipe inside the PVC pipe provided that vinyl chloride does not permeate through polyethylene.

40|$|Abstract. Human {{activities}} {{have contributed to}} a deployment of environmental quality. In the last decades the problem of water preservation has gained increasing attention, and new policies {{have been developed for}} water resources remediation. Statistical techniques for data treatment are based on the organization of data in a bi-dimensional array; thus, some shades on the trend of the distribution tend to be ignored. Multiway techniques, where data are gathered in n directions, allow the analysis of the results through different directions at the same time. In particular, for 3 MPCA a principal components analysis is conducted using three modes and a “core ” matrix that allows assessing their interactions. The Guadalquivir River estuary {{has been used as a}} model system for the application of 3 MPCA in the study of long term evolution of pollutants. Nutrients and heavy metals <b>ultra-traces</b> level have been used to characterize the estuary. The 3 MPCA was used to assess the relationships within chemical variables, sampling stations and sampling campaigns...|$|R
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{based on}} solid phase extraction with a strongly acidic cation-exchanger Dowex 50 W× 8 - 200 was proposed to pre-concentrate and determine <b>ultra-traces</b> of Li in different floral honeys. When loading 10 % (m/v) honey solutions onto columns packed with the cation-exchanger, Li+ ions were retained on the resin along with K+ and Na+, while simple sugars were passed through columns and were entirely found in effluents. In turn, columns were washed {{with water and}} eluted with a 1. 0 mol L- 1 HCl solution to strip Li+ that was subsequently determined in respective eluates by flame optical emission spectrometry (FOES). The proposed method was characterized by a limit of detection (LOD) of 0. 05 ng g- 1 of Li and later used for analysis of several raw and commercial mono- and multi-flower honeys. It enabled to determine from 0. 4 to 5. 3 ng g- 1 of Li with precision being within 8 - 11 %. Accuracy of this sample pre-treatment procedure and analysis method was assessed applying spike recovery tests. Recoveries of added Li {{were found to be}} within 98 to 106 %, demonstrating trustworthiness of results achieved...|$|R

For the second method, drug residues from fingerprint impressions are extracted followed by analysis. The methodology of these hyphenated techniques toward forensic science applications is applied as to explore limits of detection, sensitivity, and selectivity of analytes as well as immediacy and efficiency of analysis.

40|$|Fingerprinting {{techniques}} {{based on}} elemental composition and multivariate {{statistical analysis of}} compositional data {{can be used for}} identification and classification of a specific agricultural product according to their geographical provenance. The analytical approach assumes that the elemental composition of an agricultural product such as for example, wine, coffee, tea, olive oil, and fruit juice will reflect the composition of the soil on which they are cultivated thanks to biogeochemical cycling. The geographically/geologically sensitive parameters like element traces composition are of significant relevance in order to identify the origin of some food products. In recent years, many serious diseases appear related to foodstuffs, so providing the motivation for the scientific community to work more intensively in this area. The aim of this PhD thesis has been to characterize the trace and <b>ultra-trace</b> elements content in cow milk samples and evaluate the chemometric techniques in order to investigate the potentiality of multi-element composition as a marker of geographical origin of milk samples coming from different region of production based on <b>ultra-trace</b> triple quadrupole ICP-MS. In this thesis, a brand new ICP-MS facility for <b>ultra-trace</b> elemental analysis was tested and set into operational conditions, including the optimization of several analytical methods for the determination of trace and <b>ultra-trace</b> elements such as Rare Earth elements in raw cow milk. 50 samples from different geographical origin were analyzed and the results evaluated with chemometric method, for the classification of cow milk samples from different origin.

40|$|International audienceThe {{evolution}} of the instrumentation in terms of separation and detection has allowed a real improvement of the sensitivity and the analysis time. However, the analysis of <b>ultra-traces</b> of toxins such as Ochratoxin A (OTA) from complex samples (foodstuff, biological fluids…) still requires a step of purification and of preconcentration before their chromatographic determination. In this context, extraction sorbents leading to a molecular recognition mechanism appear as powerful tools for the selective extraction of OTA and of its structural analogs {{in order to obtain}} more reliable and sensitive quantitative analyses of these compounds in complex media. Indeed, immunosorbents and oligosorbents that are based on the use of immobilized antibodies and of aptamers respectively and that are specific to OTA allow its selective clean-up from complex samples with high enrichment factors. Similar molecular recognition mechanisms can also be obtained by developing molecularly imprinted polymers whose synthesis leads to the formation of cavities that are specific to OTA thus mimicking the recognition site of the biomolecules. Therefore, the principle, the advantages, the limits of these different types of extraction tools and their complementary behaviors will be presented. The introduction of these selective tools in miniaturized devices will also be discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{environment}} {{and the health of}} populations have raised major preoccupations at national level as well as European one. REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of CHemicals) is a system voted by European Union which brings together more than forty directives in order to eliminate and replace more toxic chemical substances. In this context, the set up of such a system requests robust, reliable and reproducible analytical method to evaluate and detect at <b>ultra-traces</b> level priority substances in waters and soils. After targeting several substances listed on the annexe XVII of REACH, we have completed this selection by other priority pollutants for the environment of Rhône-Alpes region, like pesticides. Thus, the analytical method proposed allows the detection and the quantification by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS of 33 substances (10 alkylphenols, 5 triazole fungicides, 1 morpholino fungicides, 1 pyridazinone acaricide, 2 phthalates, bisphenol A, 2 carbamate insecticides, one ditiocarbamates pesticides residu, 2 organophosphorous pesticides and 8 organochlorines) in environmental matrices as complex as wastewater effluents and sludge. The extraction of analytes was led by Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) for aqueous samples and by Accelerated Solvent Extraction (ASE) which was totally optimized by experimental design about parameters. Both extracts were purified by the same way by SPE. The preparation to the validation give us the confirmation of low detection limits comprised between 7. 2 ppt and 1. 27 ppb in waters and between 5 ppb to 1. 7 ppm in sludge/soilsLYON 1 -BU.
