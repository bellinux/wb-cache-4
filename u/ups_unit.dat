40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{equipment}} for uninterruptible power supply (hereinafter referred to as UPS) and defines their security component. It carefully describes the three most widely used UPS units: waiting, corrective and linear. The device equipped with a waiting <b>UPS</b> <b>unit</b> filters power and loads it, thus charging batteries. Very similar to a waiting UPS is the corrective UPS, except that the latter regulates voltage fluctuations to the required value {{in the range of}} – 15 % + 20 % and therefore excludes work in battery mode. The linear <b>UPS</b> <b>unit</b> first of all converts AC power to DC. When necessary it charges batteries, but most of the power gets converted back to AC power. If the equipment for uninterruptible power supply fails and the system is not protected against possible problems in the electrical network, we need control over the <b>UPS</b> <b>unit.</b> That is why the thesis presents the CS 121 card and the UNMS program, which enable us to control the <b>UPS</b> <b>unit,</b> allowing us to monitor, configure and warn it. CS 121 cards can be integrated or external; both versions can be found in standard or truncated form. The CS 121 card is a microcomputer that allows monitoring and management of the <b>UPS</b> <b>unit,</b> transmission and management of the sensor (temperature, smoke, etc [...] .), web server, mail server and allows connection to other Generex’s products. UNMS 2 (which stands for Universal Network Management System) is a program for Windows, which allows online monitoring and management of the <b>UPS</b> <b>unit</b> and other devices. UNMS's website is dynamic, the data gets refreshed in real time. The program works with operating systems Windows XP, 2003, 2008 and 7. The free version allows connection of up to ten devices, the payable of up to 1500. Events initiated by the <b>UPS</b> <b>unit,</b> the CS 121 card or any other device connected to the UNMS program can be configured. Basic events are pre-prepared and can be modified to specific needs. A device, such as BACS, Sensor Manager, etc [...] ., has to be added. Since UNMS does not allow sending SMS messages in {{the last part of the}} thesis presents the development of the application PosljiSMS, written in the Python programming language, which can send SMS alerts. Python is a free, object-oriented programming language that works with most operating systems. This program was developed with the Eclipse development environment [6] and the PyDev plug-in [7]. Python requires the Python database [8]. PySerial [9] has to be installed to allow connection to the GSM module. Both are free online. SMS messages can be sent using a mobile phone or a GSM module (which stands for Global System for Mobile Communications). For this thesis the GSM module TC 31 i Cinterion has been chosen since it is reliable and supports AT commands. The RS 232 serial port enabled connection to the computer. DezurniSMS is a Java based program that determines which person on duty will receive the SMS message. The program DezurniSMS requires the Java Runtime Environment [4], which is free online. The user interface was developed with the NetBeans software [5]. The program selects the candidates that can receive SMS messages from a specific station. From the list of candidates for a particular station it opts for those who are currently on duty. If the SMS messages would get sent to everybody on duty it would cost a lot, it would test people’s patience and disturb their private lives. The goal of this study was to develop an application for sending SMS messages that with the UNMS program and the CS 121 card informs on the <b>UPS</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{incidents}} {{concerning the}} contamination of copper-conductor surfaces associated with uninterruptible power systems (UPS) were recently observed. Valve-regulated lead/acid (VRLA) batteries {{used in the}} UPSs for backup powering were diagnosed as a possible source of the contamination. One of the VRLA batteries from the <b>UPS</b> <b>unit</b> was subjected to overcharge in the laboratory, to simulate the incident. Overcharge currents greater than 10 A, coupled with battery temperatures over 60 degrees C, can cause a VRLA battery to release significant amounts of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. Under extreme conditions, hazardous levels of hydrogen sulfide could be generated. We conclude that the contamination was due to copper sulfide, Cu 2 S, and copper oxide, Cu 2 O, formed on copper surfaces {{as a consequence of}} hydrogen sulfide evolution and the high humidity inside the UPS enclosure resulting from battery venting...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{and analyses}} the parallel operation of Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS) units when loaded through long wiring cables having non-negligible inductance and resistance. This scenario is often encountered in practice, as the UPS power supplies are often located {{far from the}} load they are actually powering. The analysis demonstrates how long cable connections between the power supply system and the load deeply modify {{the behavior of the}} single <b>UPS</b> <b>unit.</b> More precisely, it is shown how the cable inductance interacts with the UPS closed-loop output impedance modifying the control loop gain, ultimately generating resonance phenomena which deteriorate or even compromise system stability and performances if suitable provisions are not taken at the design stage. Simulation and experimental results carried out on two paralleled three-phase, 40 kVA UPS units based on voltage-source inverters topologies confirm the validity of the theoretical discussion and the practical relevance of the phenomenon...|$|E

40|$|Grid-enabled {{vehicles}} (GEVs) such as plug-in {{electric vehicles}} present environmental and energy sustainability advantages compared to conventional vehicles. GEV runs solely on power generated {{by its own}} battery group, which supplies power to its electric motor. This battery group can be charged from external electric sources. Nowadays, the interaction of GEV with the power grid is unidirectional by the charging process. However, GEV can be operated bi-directionally by modifying its power unit. In such operating conditions, GEV can operate as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and satisfy a portion or the total energy demand of the consumption center independent from utility grid, which is known as vehicle-to-home (V 2 H). In this paper, a power unit is developed for GEVs in the laboratory to conduct simulation and experimental studies to test the performance of GEVs as a <b>UPS</b> <b>unit</b> in V 2 H mode {{at the time of}} need. The activation and deactivation of the power unit and islanding protection unit are examined when energy is interrupted...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes an {{autonomous}} decentralized control for a parallel connected {{uninterruptible power supply}} (UPS) system based on a fast power detection method using a FPGA based hardware controller for a single phase system. Each <b>UPS</b> <b>unit</b> detects only its output voltage and current without communications signal exchange and a quasi dq transfor-mation method is applied to detect the phase and amplitude of the output voltage and the output current for the single phase system. Fast power detection can be achieved based on a quasi dq transformation, which results in a realization of very fast transient response under rapid load change. In the proposed method, the entire control system is implemented in one FPGA chip. Complicated calculations are assigned to hardware calculation logic, and the parallel processing circuit {{makes it possible to}} realize minimized calculation time. Also, an Nios II CPU core is implemented in the same FPGA chip, and the software can be applied for non-time critical calculations. Applying this control system, {{an autonomous}} decentra-lized UPS system with very fast transient response is realized. Feasibility and stable operation are confirmed by means of an experimental setup with three UPSs connected in parallel. Also, rapid load change is applied and excellent performance of the system is confirmed in terms of transient response and stability...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{regards the}} {{implementation}} of a stand-alone photovoltaic plant in which battery storage is partially replaced by a micro-hydraulic system. The plant was installed on Donoussa Island in the Aegean Sea, Greece to cover basic electricity needs of the remote village of Merssini (13 houses). Lighting, TV set and refrigerator were considered basic electricity needs for each house. The photovoltaic array consists of 300 photovoltaic modules of 60 W-p each, for a combined 18 kW(p) total installed power. The micro-hydraulic system consists of a water pump of 6 kV A and a water turbine coupled with a DC generator of 7. 5 kW and two identical water reservoirs of 150 m(3) capacity each. During the day, the load is satisfied directly form the photovoltaic generator through an inverter (<b>UPS</b> <b>unit</b> of 25 kV A, 380 V- 3 phases alternative current), while any energy surplus is directed to the pump for pumping water from the low level reservoir (at about 100 m altitude from sea level), to the high level reservoir (at about 200 m altitude from sea level). During the night, water is turbined to the low level reservoir providing energy to the load. There is also a battery bank of 186 cells of 2 V nominal voltage in series, with a total capacity of 100 A h. The batteries cover primarily load peaks. The paper presents first results and experience gained from the system performance. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In Eastern Africa {{a stable}} supply of {{electricity}} from the grid cannot be taken for granted. It is therefore important to investigate possibilities {{on how to improve}} the supply for areas of the society that suffers the most from these flaws. A power outage during an ongoing operation at a hospital could in the worst case be fatal for the patient and therefore hospitals is one of the areas in the greatest need of help. The UPS technology has come far but has not yet become a common part in electric system for hospitals in the region. It is in the topic of how to design a UPS system with solar power for a hospital in this region of the world that this thesis focuses on. A strategy is presented for how to design and dimension all major parts of a UPS system with solar power. The strategy discussed UPS topology, UPS system configuration, solar power inclusion, batteries, installation and future expandability. If the strategy is followed correctly an efficient solution can be found for the majority of all hospitals in the region. The strategy was tested and improved during a case study at Kolandoto hospital in Tanzania. In the case study a UPS system was designed and installed with the purpose to supply three operations theatres and the wards at the hospital. The UPS system installed was a decentralised system with hybrid UPS/solar units what functions both as a solar inverter and a <b>UPS</b> <b>unit.</b> Solar power was installed to be able to supply the loads both during a power outage and during normal operations. The final tests of the systems revealed that the system was fully functional but slightly oversized...|$|E
