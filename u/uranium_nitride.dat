40|$|First {{principle}} calculation {{based on}} density functional theory (DFT) {{was used to}} evaluate some physical properties of <b>Uranium</b> <b>Nitrides.</b> Adsorption of oxygen O atom and O 2 molecule on/in (001) surfaces of both Uranium monoNitride (UN) and diNitride (UN 2) was then studied and compared mutually. To treat the strong correlation effects caused by 5 f Uranium valence electrons, Hubbard-U advanced (DFT + U) approach was employed to correct the exchange correlation functional GGA and PBE which are based on generalized gradient approximation. The functional are developed for the Vienna Abinitio Simulation Package (VASP) and were used with the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudo potentials. The structural and elastic-mechanical UN and UN 2 properties were calculated within DFT and DFT + U methods. Then, Potential Energy Surfaces (PES) concepts which correspond to the interaction between O atom (respectively O 2 molecule) and (001) on-surfaces / sub-surfaces <b>uranium</b> <b>nitrides</b> for several positions were determined to identify favorable adsorption sites. Physical properties calculation results of UN or UN 2 are in order of magnitude of other theoretical values and show an acceptable precision compared to experiments. Hubbard U value of the DFT + U formalism was optimized to achieve Antiferromagnetic (AFM) UN configuration and was effective at U  1. 625 eV. Optimization of UN 2 was accomplished to attain experimental cell parameter of 5. 31 A° and was reached for U  2. 6 eV. According to our calculation results, O 2 diffusion through UN(001) and UN 2 (001) clean surfaces have demonstrated dissociation of the molecule from a distance of approximately d  1. 5 Å. Favored on surface modes for O atom adsorption were found to be near the bridge site for UN(001) and UN 2 (001).

40|$|In {{this work}} a {{manufacturing}} method for UN, ZrN and (U,Zr) N pellets was established at the nuclear fuel laboratory at KTH Stockholm/Sweden, which consists of {{the production of}} nitride powders and their sintering into pellets by spark plasma sintering. The nitride powders were produced by the hydriding-nitriding route using pure metal as starting material. This synthesis was performed in a stream of the particular reaction gas. A synthesis control and monitoring system was developed, which can follow the reactions in real time by measuring the gas flow difference before and after the reaction chamber. With the help of this system the hydriding and nitriding reactions of uranium and zirconium were studied in detail. Fine nitride powders were obtained; however, the production of zirconium nitride involved one milling step of the brittle zirconium hydride. Additionally uranium and zirconium alloys with different zirconium contents were produced and synthesized to nitride powders. It was found that also the alloys could be reduced to fine powder, but only by cyclic hydriding-dehydriding. Pellets were sintered out of <b>uranium</b> <b>nitrides,</b> zirconium nitrides, mixed nitrides and alloy nitrides. These experiments showed that relative densities of more than  90 % can easily be achieved for all those powders.

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Reactions of laser-ablated U atoms with N 2 {{molecules}} upon code-position {{in excess}} argon or neon at 4 K gave intense NUN and weak UN absorptions. Annealing produced progressions of new absorptions for the UN 2 (N 2) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and UN(N 2) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 complexes. The neon-to-argon matrix shift decreases with increasing NN ligation {{and therefore the}} number of noble gas atoms left in the primary coordination sphere around the NUN molecule. Small matrix shifts are observed when the secondary coordination layers around the primary UN 2 (N 2) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and UN(N 2) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 complexes are changed from neon-to-argon to nitrogen. Electronic structure, energy, and frequency calculations provide support for the identification of these complexes and the characterization of the NUN and UN core molecules as terminal <b>uranium</b> <b>nitrides.</b> Code-position of U with pure nitrogen produced the saturated U(NN) 7 complex, which UV irradiation converted to the NUN(NN) 5 complex with slightly lower frequencies than found in solid argon.

The metal being used for these reactions has a noticeable brown/black oxide coating that prevents the formation of UI 3 (NH 3) x. Stirring of U metal fragments with dissolved iodine in ammonia for 24 hours revealed a thickening of the oxide coating, which presumably is a result of O 2 or H 2 O contamination in the solvent. Procedures for cleaning the metal prior to the reaction are under development. Two measures are being taken in order to use the most purified solvent possible; the highest grade ammonia available is being obtained and several procedures are being developed to dry and deoxygenate the solvent.

This is an author's peer-reviewed final manuscript, as accepted by the publisher. The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier and can be found at: [URL] interest in fast nuclear reactors is creating a need for better understanding of fission gas bubble behavior in non-oxide fuels. Collisions between fission fragments and their subsequent cascades can knock fission gas atoms out of bubbles and back into the fuel lattice, resulting in a loss term for the bubble. By assuming these collisions can be treated as binary collisions, we calculated a re-solution parameter as a function of bubble radius. The calculations showed that there is a sharp decrease as bubble size increases until about 100 nm when the re-solution parameter stays nearly constant. The bubble size dependence may explain the large bubble size distribution found in some <b>uranium</b> carbide and <b>nitride</b> fuels. Furthermore, our model shows ion cascades created in the fuel result in many more implanted fission gas atoms than collisions directly with fission fragments. Utilization of our calculated re-solution parameter can be used to find a re-solution rate for future bubble behavior simulations...|$|R

50|$|According to Hyperion, the <b>uranium</b> <b>nitride</b> fuel {{incorporated}} in the design is generally similar in physical characteristics and neutronics to the standard ceramic uranium oxide fuel that is used at present in modern light water nuclear reactors. However, it has certain beneficial traits - higher thermal conductivity - and thus less retained heat energy - that make it preferable over oxide fuels when used at temperature regimes that are greater than the 250 to 300 C temperatures found in light water reactors. By operating at higher temperatures, steam plants can operate at a higher thermal efficiency. The presentation by Hyperion at the ANS 2009 conference mentions {{the use of the}} Doppler inherent negative temperature coefficient of reactivity in this reactor as a means of control. Nuclear scientist Alexander Sesonske avers that nitride fuels have both received very little development (as of 1973) and seem to have a very favorable combination of physical properties - especially in fast reactors. Whether this carries over to lead-bismuth cooled reactors is a question not answered in the reviewed literature, though the Soviet Union has worked with this type of reactor before in naval service; in particular, the Alfa class submarine - well known in the West for its high speed operation - was driven by such a lead-bismuth reactor which is known to have worked very effectively.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} the nuclear fuel cycle {{includes}} the {{study of the}} behaviour of nuclear materials both under normal conditions and under accident conditions. For example, there has been much work on how uranium dioxide based fuel interacts with the zirconium alloy tubing used to cover it. During use, the fuel swells due to thermal expansion and then starts to react with the surface of the zirconium alloy, forming a new layer which contains both fuel and zirconium (from the cladding). Then, on the fuel side of this mixed layer, there is a layer of fuel which has a higher caesium to uranium ratio than most of the fuel. This is because xenon isotopes are formed as fission products that diffuse out of the lattice of the fuel into voids such as the narrow gap between the fuel and the cladding. After diffusing into these voids, it decays to caesium isotopes. Because of the thermal gradient which exists in the fuel during use, the volatile fission products tend to be driven from the centre of the pellet to the rim area. Below is a graph of the temperature of uranium metal, <b>uranium</b> <b>nitride</b> and uranium dioxide as a function of distance from the centre of a 20 mm diameter pellet with a rim temperature of 200 oC. The uranium dioxide (because of its poor thermal conductivity) will overheat at the centre of the pellet, while the other more thermally conductive forms of uranium remain below their melting points.|$|E
