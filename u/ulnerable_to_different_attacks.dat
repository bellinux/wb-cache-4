This work uses an agent-based system called Cougaar Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) developed at the ISSRL lab for wireless LAN, which was earlier used for detection of attacks in wired networks.

A detailed study of COG analysis of SoS has been carried out by using multi-entity Bayesian networks (MEBN) method. The MEBN can be converted into different domain specific Bayesian networks according <b>to</b> <b>different</b> inputs, which is very useful to tackle with the uncertain behaviors of SoS. Then the COG can be measured with Bayesian network inference. In the experiment, we build a COG analysis model of an alert SoS, which considers the repair and backup behaviors of radar system under attack. Degradations of COG are analyzed in the case study, which reflect the effectiveness of <b>different</b> inputs (<b>attack</b> strategies).
