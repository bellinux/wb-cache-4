25|$|Furthermore, {{the bishop}} of Utrecht, Frederik III van Blankenheim, had been very active {{in the north of}} late.

25|$|On 10 December 1941, Richter was hanged at Wandsworth Prison. A {{procedure}} that normally took around 15 seconds, took over 17 minutes. When Albert Pierrepoint, the executioner, entered Richter's cell to bind his wrists, Richter charged at the cell wall headfirst. After a struggle, Pierrepoint succeeded in binding Richter's wrists {{behind his back}} with a leather strap, but Richter's ferocious strength {{was so great that}} he split the leather strap and was free again. Four warders eventually subdued Richter and bundled him into the gallows chamber where a strap was fastened around his ankles, a hood placed over his head and the noose placed around his neck. Richter continued to fight and just as Pierrepoint pulled the lever that would open the trapdoors beneath Richter's feet, the condemned man jumped in the air. The noose slipped and almost came off Richter's head but caught <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> Richter had died instantly but not without a struggle.|$|E
500|$|Olds {{was known}} for the extravagantly waxed (and decidedly non-regulation) {{handlebar}} moustache he sported in Vietnam. It was a common superstition among airmen to grow a [...] "bulletproof mustache", but Olds also used his as [...] "a gesture of defiance. The kids on base loved it. Most everybody grew a mustache." [...] Olds started the mustache {{in the wake of}} the success of Operation Bolo and let it grow beyond regulation length because [...] "It became the middle finger I couldn't raise in the PR photographs. The mustache became my silent last word in the verbal battles...with higher headquarters on rules, targets, and fighting the war." [...] Returning home, however, marked the end of this flamboyance. When he reported to his first interview with Air Force Chief of Staff General John P. McConnell, McConnell walked up to him, stuck a finger <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and said, [...] "Take it off." [...] Olds replied, [...] "Yes, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|Bob Pretty wouldn't {{believe it}} at fust. He said that Smith was making game of 'im, and, when Smith held the paper <b>under</b> <b>'is</b> <b>nose,</b> {{he kept the}} {{handkerchief}} on his eyes and wouldn't look at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "He caught 'im {{up just as}} he 'ad undone {{the front}} door, and, {{catching}} hold of 'im by the back o' the neck, shook 'im till 'e was tired.

6000|$|... "And I hope," [...] said Ukridge, [...] "the {{experience}} will do him good. Sneaked a dog's dinner, Garnet, <b>under</b> <b>his</b> very <b>nose,</b> if you please. Naturally the dog lodged a protest." ...|$|R
500|$|Krusty is a hard-living {{entertainment}} veteran, sometimes {{depicted as}} a jaded, burned-out has-been, who has been down and out several times and remains addicted to gambling, cigarettes, alcohol, pornography, Percodan, Pepto-Bismol, and Xanax. He instantly becomes depressed {{as soon as the}} cameras stop rolling; Marge states in [...] "The Sweetest Apu", that, [...] "off camera, he's a desperately unhappy man". Krusty appeared to have used cocaine, one time emerging from a restaurant bathroom with white powder <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> but he explained that he was simply researching a part for a film, in which he played himself. In his book Planet Simpson, author Chris Turner describes Krusty as [...] "the wizened veteran, the total pro" [...] who lives the celebrity life. He is miserable but he needs his celebrity status. In [...] "Bart the Fink", Bart inadvertently reported Krusty for tax fraud to the Internal Revenue Service and as a result Krusty lost most of his money. Bart soon discovered that Krusty had faked his death and was living as Rory B. Bellows on a boat. Krusty declared that he was finished with the life of a celebrity and was unconvinced when Bart reminded him of his fans and his entourage. Finally, Bart told Krusty that leaving show business would mean losing his celebrity status, which convinced Krusty to return. Krusty has been described as [...] "the consummate showman who can't bear the possibility of not being on the air and not entertaining people." ...|$|E

6000|$|Noel Vanstone {{looked from}} the folded {{paper to the}} door, and from the door back to the folded paper, in unutterable astonishment. A mystery in <b>his</b> own house! <b>under</b> <b>his</b> own <b>nose!</b> What did it mean? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A capital measure, but do {{you mean}} that Edmund Kendal is going to let you and John Smith drain <b>his</b> pond <b>under</b> <b>his</b> very <b>nose,</b> and never find it out? I did not imagine him quite come to that.' ...|$|R

60|$|They overtook {{him just}} as he and Betsy were {{entering}} Costigan's Casino. They deflected him, and shoved the newspaper <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> Fuzzy could read--and more.|$|E

60|$|As Mrs. Hoggarty {{left the}} Rookery in Smithers's carriage, Mr. Brough, with his four greys, was {{entering}} the lodge-gate; and I {{should like to}} have seen the looks of these two gentlemen, as the one was carrying the other's prey off, {{out of his own}} very den, <b>under</b> <b>his</b> very <b>nose.</b>|$|R
50|$|He took {{a vial of}} ether {{and opened}} it. The {{audience}} smelled it wafting through the theatre. He placed the vial <b>under</b> <b>his</b> son's <b>nose,</b> and he went limp.

25|$|Vercingetorix {{therefore}} {{crossed the}} river Elave, and started marching {{up and down}} the bank, mirroring Caesar's movements and destroying all the bridges to keep him from crossing, the purpose presumably being to destroy part of his force as he attempted to cross.

60|$|She {{took her}} {{paper to the}} dog, and held it <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> He turned his head aside as in chagrin and mortification, and she impulsively kissed his velvety bulging forehead.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, you are tired; {{come out}} and rest, my dearest'; and with a masterful air Demi took her into the starlight, leaving Tom to stare after them winking as if a sky-rocket had {{suddenly}} gone off <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b>|$|E
60|$|When Sonny {{had finally}} {{come to an end}} of the recital, he {{crouched}} on all fours directly <b>under</b> <b>his</b> father's <b>nose</b> and began nibbling at some young raspberry leaves which were growing conveniently near at hand, looking very much as if he was waiting for an answer to his long story or explanation, whichever it may have been.|$|R

6000|$|... "Shall I {{find you}} here, Lady Lufton, {{when we have}} done?" [...] she said; and then started off among the dancers. When the work before one is dancing the proper thing for a gentleman to do is, at any rate, to ask a lady; this proper thing Lord Lufton had omitted, and now the prize was taken away from <b>under</b> <b>his</b> very <b>nose.</b>|$|R
60|$|As {{she placed}} the soup before the guest, who changed his {{attitude}} to a sitting one, he looked her full in the face, and his moustache went up <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and his nose came down over his moustache.|$|E
60|$|When Monsieur Rigaud laughed, {{a change}} {{took place in}} his face, that was more {{remarkable}} than prepossessing. His moustache went up <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> and his nose came down over his moustache, in a very sinister and cruel manner.|$|E

60|$|She made no answer, and {{the machine}} went on with its story. There was {{something}} curious in watching this utterance about himself, <b>under</b> <b>his</b> very <b>nose,</b> in language unintelligible to him. He conjectured whether it were inquiry, praise, or blame, with a sense that it might reasonably be the latter, {{as the result of}} his surreptitious look into that blue bedroom, possibly observed and reported by some servant of the house.|$|R
60|$|The big buck had not moved, nor tried to, {{after his}} last great effort.

No man on earth, I think, could have looked into them for a full moment and then raised his hand to slay.|$|R
50|$|In the episode, Basil is disgusted {{when two}} young lovers, Alan and Jean, begin 'hanky-pankying' <b>under</b> <b>his</b> very <b>nose</b> while {{checking}} in.

Meanwhile, another guest, Mrs Peignoir, has become attracted to Basil, and circumstances conspire {{to put him in}} apparently compromising situations whenever any of the aforementioned are around.|$|R
6000|$|... "Monastic!" [...] quoth he, {{in a sort}} of horror, {{and looking}} as if a bad smell had {{suddenly}} been thrust <b>under</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> He shrugged and pouted and had fresh recourse to his pomander. [...] "O, well! Friars have become popes before to-day." ...|$|E

60|$|He is very good, is {{the comic}} man. He can't bear villainy. To thwart villainy is his life's ambition, {{and in this}} noble object fortune backs him up grandly.

5000|$|Dredd and Alpha had {{previously}} met in [...] "Top Dog", published a year before, {{in which he}} and his partner-in-crime-fighting Wulf Sternhammer went {{back in time to}} Dredd's Mega-City One in order to capture two criminals wanted in their own time period.

6000|$|Near us is a type, too: {{a man who}} adorns his own tale, {{and points}} his own moral.

60|$|Fifanti ripped away {{silk and}} seals, and set himself to read.

Then I saw him turn a sickly leaden hue. He stared at the officer a moment and then at Giuliana. But I do not think that he saw either of them. His look was the blank look of one whose thoughts are very distant.|$|R
