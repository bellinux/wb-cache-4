2500|$|Historian F. S. L. Lyons characterised {{the initial}} {{response}} of the British government to the early less severe phase of the famine as [...] "prompt and relatively successful". Confronted by widespread crop failure in November 1845, Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel purchased £100,000 worth of maize and cornmeal secretly from America with Baring Brothers initially acting as his agents. The government hoped {{that they would not}} [...] "stifle private enterprise" [...] and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to poor weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846. The initial shipments were of <b>unground</b> dried kernels, but the few Irish mills in operation were not equipped for milling maize and a long and complicated milling process had to be adopted before the meal could be distributed. In addition, before the cornmeal could be consumed, it had to be [...] "very much" [...] cooked again, or eating it could result in severe bowel complaints. Due to its yellow colour, and initial unpopularity, it became known as [...] "Peel's brimstone".|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Downed conductors, tree {{branches}} touching conductors, and failing insulators often cause high-impedance faults in overhead distribution systems. The fault currents of these faults are {{much smaller than}} detection thresholds of traditional ground fault detection devices, so reliable detection of these highimpedance faults is challenging. Although fault currents can be much smaller in <b>ungrounded</b> systems than fault currents in multigrounded systems given similar fault conditions, fault detection for <b>ungrounded</b> systems is nevertheless easier. This paper contrasts the differences between high-impedance fault detections for <b>ungrounded</b> and multigrounded systems. The paper explains fault detection of <b>ungrounded</b> distribution systems {{and the issue of}} fault detection sensitivity. The paper also introduces a recent advance in faulted phase selection on these <b>ungrounded</b> systems and demonstrates this advance through a staged fault test example from a utility. I...|$|R
30|$|The {{generators}} {{supply the}} primary ship power system, which is predominately 60 Hz today. Low voltage ship power systems are often three-phase, delta-connected, <b>ungrounded</b> 60  Hz. Since {{the system is}} <b>ungrounded,</b> the system can continue to operate if a line to ground fault occurs. A disadvantage of <b>ungrounded</b> systems for ships is that fault-to-hull currents are small and difficult to detect and locate. For personnel safety reasons, MV systems always feature a high impedance grounding system.|$|R
60|$|On {{the table}} where I write there lie two paper-weights, {{preserving}} from {{the fate of the}} sibylline leaves the sheets of foolscap to which this essay is now being committed. One of them is a very rude flint hatchet, produced by merely chipping off flakes from its side by dexterous blows, and utterly unpolished or <b>unground</b> in any way. It belongs to the age of the very old master (or possibly even to a slightly earlier epoch), and it was sent me from Ightham, in Kent, by that indefatigable unearther of prehistoric memorials, Mr. Benjamin Harrison. That flint, which now serves me in the office of a paper-weight, is far ruder, simpler, and more ineffective than any weapon or implement at present in use among the lowest savages. Yet with it, I doubt not, some naked black fellow by the banks of the Thames has hunted the mammoth among unbroken forest two hundred thousand years ago and more; with it he has faced the angry cave bear and the original and only genuine British lion (for everybody knows that the existing mongrel heraldic beast is nothing better than a bastard modification of the leopard of the Plantagenets). Nay, I have very little doubt in my own mind that with it some æsthetic ancestor has brained and cut up for his use his next-door neighbour in the nearest cavern, and then carved upon his well-picked bones an interesting sketch of the entire performance. The Du Mauriers of that remote age, in fact, habitually drew their society pictures upon the personal remains of the mammoth or the man whom they wished to caricature in deathless bone-cuts. The other paper-weight is a polished neolithic tomahawk, belonging to the period of the mound-builders, who succeeded the Glacial Epoch, and it measures the distance between the two levels of civilisation with great accuracy. It is the military weapon of a trained barbaric warrior as opposed to the universal implement and utensil of a rude, solitary, savage hunter. Yet how curious it is that {{even in the midst of}} this 'so-called nineteenth century,' which perpetually proclaims itself an age of progress, men should still prefer to believe themselves inferior to their original ancestors, instead of being superior to them! The idea that man has risen is considered base, degrading, and positively wicked; the idea that he has fallen is considered to be immensely inspiring, ennobling, and beautiful. For myself, I have somehow always preferred the boast of the Homeric Glaucus that we indeed maintain ourselves to be much better men than ever were our fathers.|$|E

However, <b>ungrounded</b> and impedance grounded systems have specific issues that impact proper application of metering equipment. Voltage transformers are especially prone to misapplication. This paper is intended to provide a road map for proper application of IEDs in these circuits. The subject of grounding is explored to demonstrate the basic issues with <b>ungrounded</b> systems.

How-ever, <b>ungrounded</b> haptic feedback can give comparable results in boundary detection tests.
