Preface One way to improve and strengthen aid, according to a number of international aid agencies, is to support recipient governments to ‘take ownership ’ of aid activities. In arguing for a stronger ownership of development and aid processes, the focus has primarily been on recipient governments rather than the local populations in villages, towns and cities that are the <b>ultimate</b> <b>target</b> <b>group</b> an...|$|E
40|$|Over 90 % {{of deaths}} {{attributable}} to malaria are in African children under 5 years old. Yet, new treatments are often tested primarily in adult patients and extrapolations {{have proven to}} be sometimes invalid, especially in dosing regimens. For studies in severe malaria an additional complication is that the decline in severe malaria in adult patients precludes sufficiently powered trials in adults, before the intervention can be tested in the <b>ultimate</b> <b>target</b> <b>group,</b> paediatric severe malaria. In this paper we propose an alternative pathway to the development of drugs for use in paediatric severe malaria. We argue that following the classical phase I and II studies, small safety and efficacy studies using well-chosen surrogate endpoints in adult severe malaria be conducted, instead of larger mortality endpoint trials. If the drug appears safe and promising small pilot studies in paediatric severe malaria using the same endpoints can follow. Finally, with carefully observed safeguards in place to ensure high ethical standards, promising candidate interventions can be taken forward into mortality endpoint, well-powered, large paediatric studies in African children with severe malaria. Given the available research capacity, limited numbers of prudently selected interventions can be studied in phase III trials, and adaptive designs should be considered...|$|E

We are especially grateful to Mr Jerry Nxumalo and Mrs Gugulethu Hlophe who shared their rich and insightful experiences throughout the project period, and gave indepth comments on earlier versions of this report. The CEO of SWADE, Mr Doctor Lukhele, and SWADE staff, in particular Mr Sydney Dladla, Mr Ncamiso Mhlanga, Mr Musa Masilela, Mrs Nomfundo Motsa, and Mr Eugene Simelane are equally acknowledged for their ready availability to share and discuss their insights in the developments in Maplotini. Mr Ole Houmøller and Mrs Tania Diederiks of the SADC/Danida Water Sector Programme, who commissioned the present process documentation and impact assessment to the monitoring team of the International Water Management Institute, provided a remarkable space for learning by all parties, while guiding all of us with an innovative vision on how to do local-level Integrated Water Resource Management for improved livelihoods. Last but not least, we highly appreciate the time that the Maplotini stakeholders and authorities and the inhabitants as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>target</b> <b>group</b> of all the efforts, gave us to share their important points of view. The authors tried to reflect the process and impacts of the project as accurately as possible, but, obviously, they take full responsibility for any misquotation or incorrect interpretation.

40|$|The {{auditory}} steady-state response (ASSR) is an auditory {{evoked potential}} technique {{which can be}} used in difficult-to-test populations (infants, individuals with multiple handicaps, subjects who simulate hearing loss) to objectively estimate behavioural thresholds. The ASSR technique is gradually emerging in clinical settings because of some definite advantages over the commonly used click-evoked auditory brainstem response such as frequency-specific assessment of the auditory sensitivity, objective detection algorithms, higher stimulation levels, and multiple frequency stimulation. The main aim of this doctoral thesis is to assess the clinical usefulness of the auditory steady-state technique for an adult population using a commercially available multiple auditory steady-state response or the so-called clinical MASTER system. In particular, this research project focuses on two aspects consisting of optimization of the test efficiency and investigation of the clinical behaviour of the ASSR. The results demonstrate that the multiple ASSR technique accurately estimates pure-tone thresholds in adults with normal hearing and hearing loss using the AM²/FM stimulus. Investigation of the test-retest reliability demonstrates that in normal hearing adults a threshold difference of at least 20 dB is required to be 95 % confident that the change in ASSR thresholds represents a true threshold shift instead of measurement error typical to the ASSR technique. Additionally, the impact of degree, type and configurations of hearing loss on ASSR threshold accuracy was assessed. The effect of degree shows that moderate sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has lower difference thresholds than normal hearing and that {{it is very difficult to}} categorize ASSR thresholds as normal or mild SNHL for 500 Hz and as mild or moderate SNHL for 2000 Hz. The impact of type of hearing loss reveals that air-conduction ASSR thresholds accurately predict the degree of conductive hearing loss, except for 2000 Hz. Furthermore, flat configurations of sensorineural hearing loss results in lower difference thresholds than the sloping SNHL, especially for the lower frequencies. Evaluation of the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value reveals that the most appropriate cutoff point to differentiate normal hearing from hearing loss in adults is a 30 dB or lower criterion. The last study attempts to optimize the test efficiency of the ASSR technique by determining stopping criteria that can be used in a clinical setting and efforts are made to provide a framework by which a clinical audiologist can collect significant and non-significant response amplitude data to determine noise stop criteria for specific populations (infants and adults with varying degrees, types and configurations of hearing loss). In conclusion, the present thesis demonstrates that the multiple-ASSR technique accurately determines pure-tone thresholds using the novel proposed AM²/FM stimulus with a clinically acceptable test-retest reliability for normal hearing adults. Furthermore, distinguishing subjects with a mild degree of SNHL from normal hearing will be very difficult and air-conduction ASSR thresholds can be determined quite accurately in conductive hearing impaired patients. Finally, procedures to establish clinically efficient stopping criteria were proposed with a special focus on the framework to construct setting-specific noise-stop criteria. The next step will be investigating infants with varying degrees, types and configurations of hearing loss to establish the clinical usefulness for the <b>ultimate</b> <b>target</b> <b>group</b> of the ASSR technique...|$|E

The goal is to attract this <b>target</b> <b>group</b> {{to the events of}} the culture house. The event, Husets PULS 2013, is used as a case in this study. The quantitative method is used to gather information about the <b>target</b> <b>group’s</b> media- and culture habits. It is concluded that the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> do not know about Huset KBH. Furthermore the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> favours concerts, movies and theatre and it often uses Facebook, which is the <b>target</b> <b>group’s</b> preferred communication channel. The results are used in an analysis of the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> and {{on the basis of the}} analysis a facebook event is produced for the case, Husets PULS 2013.

This contributes to identify Huset KBHs opportunities and threats. It is concluded that communicating successfully to the <b>target</b> <b>group</b> involves an interaction with different communication channels.
