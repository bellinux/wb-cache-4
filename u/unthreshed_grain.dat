Furthermore, Jews had to wear special garment and hats and were allowed to trade in any goods except those that {{were considered to be}} of suspicious or dubious origin, such as wet cloth, <b>unthreshed</b> <b>grain</b> and untanned hide, as well as goods that had a particular Christian, liturgical character. Transactions of more than 4 fl had to be registered with the local authorities. The slaughter of animals according to Jewish rites and the selling of the meat itself were allowed. However, the tongue of each slaughtered cow as well as the innards of calves and sheep slaughtered according to Jewish rites had to be handed over to the authorities. Alternatively, 4 kr could be paid for each slaughtered animal. Jews were not allowed to buy and own property and to prevent any of their community from converting to Christianity. On the other hand, they were strictly forbidden to convert any Christians to Judaism.|$|E

The evolution of mechanical threshers to secure the ever growing consumption of cereal has been hindered by several factors which have lead to low performance of several developed threshers. It has been discovered and observed by various researchers that performance of cereal threshers is highly dependent on the value of its working parameters. This work gives an insight into influence of crop, machine and operating parameters on performance of cereal threshers using a computer aided software for simulation of these parameter values. The parameters were varied at six levels and the simulations were performed by varying each parameter while the rest parameters were kept constant. It was observed that threshing efficiency increased for all increasing values of cylinder speed and bulk density, decreased for all increasing values of feed rate and concave clearance, and increased for increasing values of moisture content up to 17 % and decreased after wards. Also threshing loss was found to increase for all increasing values of feed rate and concave clearance, decreased for all increasing values of cylinder speed and bulk density, and decreased for all increasing values of moisture content up to 17 % and then increased after wards, similar effects on the efficiency and losses was observed in the capacity and <b>unthreshed</b> <b>grain</b> cases respectively. Thresher capacity and rate of <b>unthreshed</b> <b>grain</b> also showed significant reactions as these parameters were varied...|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} {{portion of}} threshing losses and waste of rice {{takes place in}} threshing stage. One of the effective factors in threshing losses and waste of threshing units, threshers and harvesting machines, is the drum speed. In this research, effects of three factors including drum speed (five levels), crop moisture content (two levels) and rice common varieties (four varieties) on threshing losses and waste were studied. The thresher T 25 {{was used for the}} investigation. It has wire loop type tooth. Dependent factors included <b>unthreshed</b> <b>grains</b> percentage (threshing losses) and damaged grains percentage. The obtained data was analyzed by split–split plot test based on Complete Randomized Blocks Design. The mean values were compared using Duncan’s Multiple Range Test. The tests results revealed that significant effect of variety type and drum linear speed on threshing losses (P&lt; 0. 01). Furthermore, the effects of variety type, moisture content and drum speed on damaged grains were also significant. The optimum drum speed was 14 m/s. The most and the least of threshing losses belong to Hashemy and Binam varieties, respectively. Among the tested varieties, Binam variety showed the highest percentage of the damaged grains. In general, decreasing the crop moisture resulted in increasing the mean damaged grain...|$|R

But the threshing not going well, Where rice stalk is still difficult {{to get out of}} the thresher. The objective of this research is to modify machine type paddy thresher hammer. Modification is conducted by adding director channel in upper wall of threshing chamber and to change straw exiting channel near the feeder with size of 15 cm width and 19 cm height. By this method, paddy straw is expected to exit from threshing chamber and threshing process can run smoothly. Methods used is Modification tools, testing modification result, observation and data collection. Observations are made to percentages of threshed paddy <b>grain,</b> percentage of <b>unthreshed</b> paddy <b>grain,</b> good threshed paddy grain, percentage of damaged threshed paddy grain, threshing duration, and working capacity of the machine per hour...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- To {{achieve a}} {{productive}} model, the operation processes {{need to be}} modeled, the model have to be properly packaged and the results thereafter should be compared and verified with other conventional models to prove validity. This forms {{the structure of the}} cereal thresher model developed. To achieve this, the processes were modeled mathematically using the various thresher and crop parameters (velocity of cylinder, crop feed rate, concave clearance, crop flow rate etc) and in-cooperating the frictional factor. After which the submodels that characterizes performance was hence developed. The model was packaged using computer aided software based on VISUAL BASIC programming language. Using the model, the performance of the thresher was simulated and hence optimized based on minimum threshing loss. At 15 % moisture level, the minimal loss is 11. 78 %, capacity is 211. 52 kg/h and <b>unthreshed</b> <b>grain</b> flow rate of 0. 021 kg/s while other performance characteristics are 18 m/s, 0. 18 kg/s, 0. 02 m. On validation with published data of past researchers, the model was found generally to fit well, taking R 2 values which is highly significant at 0. 001...|$|E
40|$|Limitation {{of plant}} {{productivity}} {{by the low}} partial pressure of atmospheric CO 2 (Ca) experienced during the last glacial period is hypothesised {{to have been an}} important constraint on the origins of agriculture. In support of this hypothesis, previous work has shown that glacial Ca limits vegetative growth in the wild progenitors of both C 3 and C 4 founder crops. Here we present data showing that glacial Ca also reduces grain yield in both crop types. We grew four wild progenitors of C 3 (einkorn wheat and barley) and C 4 crops (foxtail and broomcorn millets) at glacial and post-glacial Ca, measuring grain yield, and the morphological and physiological components contributing to these yield changes. The C 3 species showed a significant increase in <b>unthreshed</b> <b>grain</b> yield of ~ 50 % with the increase in Ca, which matched the stimulation of photosynthesis, suggesting that increases in photosynthesis are directly translated into yield at sub-ambient levels of Ca. Increased yield was controlled by a higher rate of tillering, leading to a larger number of tillers bearing fertile spikes, and increases in seed number and size. The C 4 species showed smaller, but significant, increases in grain yield of 10 - 15 %, arising from larger seed numbers and sizes. Photosynthesis was enhanced by Ca in only one C 4 species and the effect diminished during development, suggesting that an indirect mechanism mediated by plant water relations could also be playing a role in the yield increase. Interestingly, the C 4 species at glacial Ca showed some evidence that photosynthetic capacity was upregulated to enhance carbon capture. Development under glacial Ca also impacted negatively on the subsequent germination and viability of seeds. These results suggest that the grain production of both C 3 and C 4 crop progenitors was limited by the atmospheric conditions of the last glacial period, with important implications for the origins of agriculture.
