25|$|In {{the context}} of Interlingua, an Anglicism is a uniquely English {{expression}} used when speaking or writing Interlingua. Many English expressions have penetrated into {{a wide variety of}} languages, making them good Interlingua expressions. Novice speakers sometimes assume that an English expression is correct Interlingua when in fact it is not sufficiently international. For example, a novice may use Lassa nos considerar le optiones to mean 'Let's consider the options', as in English. In Interlingua, however, this expression means 'Permit <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the options'. A more international expression is Que nos considera le optiones, literally 'That we consider the options'.|$|E
25|$|Bourdieu's {{ambition}} to unite these sociological traditions, {{which had been}} widely thought to be incompatible, was and remains controversial. The most important concept to grasp is habitus. Crudely put, the habitus is the system of dispositions which individuals have. Sociologists very often look at either social laws (structure) or the individual minds (agency) in which these laws are inscribed. Great sociological arguments have raged between {{those who argue that}} the former should be sociology's principal interest (structuralists) and those who argue the same for the latter (phenomenologists). When Bourdieu instead asks <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> dispositions, he is making a very subtle intervention in sociology. He has found a middle ground where social laws and individual minds meet and is arguing that our proper object of analysis should be this middle ground: dispositions.|$|E

25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he asks <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived {{all of her}} life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E

[...] The common critical consensus of HCE's fixed character is summarised by Bishop as being [...] "an older Protestant male, of Scandinavian lineage, connected with the pubkeeping business somewhere in the neighbourhood of Chapelizod, who has a wife, a daughter, and two sons." ...|$|E
500|$|Meghan O'Rouke, Slate Magazines culture {{critic and}} {{advisory}} editor, ultimately found The Kite Runner mediocre, writing, [...] "This {{is a novel}} simultaneously striving to deliver a large-scale informative portrait and to stage a small-scale redemptive drama, but its therapeutic allegory of recovery can only undermine its realist ambitions. People experience their lives {{against the backdrop of}} their culture, and while Hosseini wisely steers clear of merely exoticizing Afghanistan as a monolithically foreign place, he does so much work to make his novel emotionally accessible to the American reader that there is almost no room, in the end, for <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> for long what might differentiate Afghans and Americans." [...] Sarah Smith from The Guardian thought the novel started out well but began to falter towards the end. She felt that Hosseini was too focused on fully redeeming the protagonist in Part III and in doing so created too many unrealistic coincidences that allowed Amir the opportunity to undo his past wrongs.|$|E

2500|$|Friedrich Nietzsche savagely critiqued the English Utilitarians' {{focus on}} {{attaining}} the greatest happiness, stating [...] "Man does not strive for happiness, only the Englishman does." [...] Nietzsche meant that making happiness one's ultimate goal, {{the aim of}} one's existence, [...] "makes one contemptible;" [...] Nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher, more difficult goals than [...] "mere happiness." [...] Thus Nietzsche introduces the quasi-dystopic figure of the [...] "last man" [...] {{as a kind of}} thought experiment against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers; these small, [...] "last men" [...] who seek after only their own pleasure and health, avoiding all danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle are meant to seem contemptible to Nietzsche's reader. Nietzsche instead wants <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> the value of what is difficult, what can only be earned through struggle, difficulty, pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and unhappiness truly play in creating everything of great worth in life, including all the highest achievements of human culture, not least of all philosophy.|$|E

Deptula describes the background, rationale, and {{provides an example of}} how an effects-based approach to targeting was conducted in Desert Storm in the publication, [...] "Effects-Based Operations: Change in the Nature of Warfare." [...] The doctrine was developed with an aim of putting desired strategic effects first and then planning from the desired strategic objective back to the possible tactical level actions that could be taken to achieve the desired effect. [...] Contrary to conventional military approaches of force-on-force application that focused on attrition and annihilation, EBO focused on desired outcomes attempting to use a minimum of force. The approach was enabled by advancements in weaponry—particularly stealth and precision weapons—in conjunction with a planning approach based on specific effects rather than absolute destruction. Deptula, speaking at the Gulf War Air Campaign Tenth Anniversary Retrospective, on Jan 17, 2001 on One Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, defined the goal of EBO; [...] "If we focus on effects, the end of strategy, rather than force-on-force the traditional means to achieve it militarily, that enables <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>consider</b> different and perhaps more effective ways to accomplish the same goal quicker than in the past, with fewer resources and most importantly with fewer casualties." [...] Others have postulated that EBO could be interpreted as an emerging understanding that attacking a second-order target may have first order consequences for a variety of objectives, wherein the Commander's intent can be satisfied with a minimum of collateral damage or risk to his own forces.|$|E
