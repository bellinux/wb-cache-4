500|$|Jethro Tull's {{frontman}} {{and songwriter}} Ian Anderson {{was surprised when}} critics called the band's previous album, Aqualung (1971), a [...] "concept album". He rejected this, thinking {{it was simply a}} collection of songs, so in response decided to [...] "come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> really is the mother of all concept albums". Taking the surreal English humour of Monty Python as an influence, he began to write a piece that would combine complex music with a sense of humour, with the idea it would poke light-hearted fun at the band, the audience, and the music critics. He also intended to satirise the progressive rock genre that was popular at the time.|$|E

[...] In August 2008, Scudamore said that the League had [...] "a whole host of ideas, some more radical than others, but none quite as radical as the original concept". [...] In October 2008, he said Game 39 was still a possibility, although the timing of TV contracts meant {{it would be in}} the 2013–14 season at the earliest.

[...] In 1997, Spin wrote, [...] "Zooropa took U2 as far from the monastic mysticism of The Joshua Tree as they could go. It freed U2 from itself." [...] Edna Gundersen of USA Today said in 2002, [...] "the alien territory of Achtung Baby and Zooropa cemented U2's relevance and enhanced its cachet as intrepid explorers".

500|$|Former Rolling Stone {{associate}} editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as [...] "artists who {{broke through the}} constraints of their time period to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> was unique and original... n the form of popular music, {{no one will ever}} be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ..." [...] The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as [...] "an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roĺl with their own adolescent romanticism", and [...] "the first advance in popular music since the War". They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood movies, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Neil Gaiman. After Steven Moffat {{replaced}} Russell T Davies as the showrunner of Doctor Who, being a fan of Gaiman's blog, Moffat met with Gaiman and Gaiman had asked to write an episode. In an interview Gaiman stated [...] "I came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> {{was one of those}} things where you thought that nobody's done that before." [...] The episode was originally titled [...] "The House of Nothing" [...] before Gaiman sat down to write it, but that was changed to [...] "Bigger on the Inside". This title remained until about six weeks before the episode aired, but the crew was beginning to worry that [...] "Bigger on the Inside" [...] would give away the surprise that Idris was the TARDIS, so it was changed. [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] was also a fake title attached to the 1984 serial The Caves of Androzani; then-producer John Nathan-Turner had changed the title to that on his planning board in an attempt to weed out a suspected leak in his office.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{the opening}} of the stage curtain signals the {{beginning}} of a performance, while the closing signals the conclusion. As nearly no place they performed had such drapery, The Haters needed to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> else <b>that</b> would duplicate this function. The Haters started using pre-recorded sounds on tape. The sudden start of the noise let everyone in the audience know that the performance had just begun. Likewise, the abrupt end of the soundtrack unmistakably marked the finale.|$|R

500|$|Tim Miller, {{creative}} {{director for the}} title sequence, wanted to develop an abstract narrative that reflected the pivotal moments in the novel, {{as well as the}} character development of Lisbeth Salander. It was arduous for Miller to conceptualize the sequence abstractly, given that Salander's occupation was a distinctive part of her personality. His initial ideas were modeled after a keyboard. [...] "We were going to treat the keyboard like this giant city with massive fingers pressing down on the keys," [...] Miller explained, [...] "Then we transitioned to the liquid going through the giant obelisks of the keys." [...] Among Miller's many vignettes was [...] "The Hacker Inside", which revealed the character's inner disposition and melted them away. The futuristic qualities in the original designs provided for a much more cyberpunk appearance than the final product. In creating the [...] "cyber" [...] look for Salander, Miller said, [...] "Every time I would show David a design he would say, 'More Tandy!' It's the shitty little computers from Radio Shack, the Tandy computers. They probably had vacuum tubes in them, really old technology. And David would go 'More Tandy', until we ended <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> looked like we glued a bunch of computer parts found at a junkyard together." ...|$|E
500|$|Actresses Anita Gillette, Jan Hooks, Patti LuPone, and Elaine Stritch reprised {{their roles}} as Margaret Lemon, Verna Maroney, Sylvia Rossitano, and Colleen Donaghy, respectively, the mothers of the {{characters}} Liz Lemon, Jenna Maroney, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), and Jack Donaghy, respectively. John Lutz appears {{as the mother of}} his character, TGS writer J.D. Lutz, but it is unclear whether this is portrayed as a casting joke on the part of 30 Rock or whether the character of Lutz is impersonating his own mother within the show. In addition, actress Novella Nelson guest starred as herself as Tracy Jordan's fake [...] "mother" [...] for the first time. Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin played himself in the episode as it is revealed that he was in a relationship with Liz's mother. In an interview with TV Guide in discussion of his guest spot, Aldrin said [...] "That was wonderful, carrying on a conversation with very professional actors I greatly admired. I felt very honored to be paired <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> also has another connection to me. [...] That was a lot of fun." [...] Aldrin revealed that when first notified about the guest appearance he had to [...] "think about it a little bit", and he mistook 30 Rock with the show 3rd Rock from the Sun, a program that previously aired on NBC.|$|E
500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he got there and how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We had to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{logistics}} of an animated band going on tour proved problematic, with Jamie Hewlett {{saying in a}} mid-2001 interview: [...] "We've come to realize <b>that</b> we've come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that's</b> a bit {{ahead of its time}} and the technology doesn't exist to do everything we want to do, so the live show was something we had to really think hard about." [...] As a compromise between having a live and virtual stage presence, the band's musicians played behind a giant cinema screen, which projected music videos and visuals to the crowd. Lead singer Damon Albarn later expressed discomfort at this setup, confessing that he [...] "was frustrated" [...] behind the screen. Later still, Albarn called the screens [...] "obtuse", believing the human element of the band necessitated a change. In a 2010 interview, Albarn voiced distaste at the concept of hiding collaborators behind a screen on the then-upcoming Escape to Plastic Beach Tour: [...] "I couldn't entertain the idea of putting Lou Reed or Bobby Womack behind a screen. I'm not that daft." [...] Gorillaz Live was ultimately the only tour to have the musicians silhouetted behind a screen.|$|R

They work by activating the component of working memory involved in earworms, a storage and rehearsal cycle called the phonological loop. “If you fill it <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> else <b>that</b> occupies the same circuitry, there's not enough left to make the earworm,” Williamson says...|$|R

Where we're taking our production will never have been seen before by anybody, and that's an amazing thing {{to be able to}} say. For a band like U2 that really thrives on breaking new ground, it's a real thrill." [...] Lead singer Bono said the design was intended to overcome the staid traditional appearance of outdoor concerts where the stage was dominated by speaker stacks on either side: [...] "We have some magic, and we've got some beautiful objects we're going to take around the world, and we're inside that object." [...] He also said that the group's goal was for the show to not be too choreographed. Williams said the goal is to establish a physical proximity: [...] "The band is just sitting in the palm of the audience's hand." [...] At the conclusion of the tour, the intent was to leave the three structures {{in different parts of the}} globe and turn them into permanent concert venues. An auction of the stages was planned following the last concert.|$|R
500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. When you sit there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E

There's no such thing as pure good," [...] said Johansson. [...] "I love this character. [...] has come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>something</b> <b>that</b> is a mixture between my father, his father, and The Great Santini." [...] His evil side comes to the forefront when his marriage to Deb crumbles. Dan experiences rivalry with his brother throughout the early seasons.

In this dissertation I examined the functionality of creativity from an evolutionary perspective. If creativity is functional in terms of evolutionary fitness and if such evolutionary functionality motivates creativity, we should see that people become more creative if it helps them to achieve evolutionary goals...|$|R

Every song on Hold On to Me sounds like it could be a classic (and classy) radio staple, without sounding like a copy of anything else. Not only is Hold On to Mes literate songwriting (by Camilleri and lyricist Nick Smith) superb, but the playing is also uniformly excellent (and, at times, positively inspired), and vocalists Camilleri and Vika and Linda Bull are soulful and gritty throughout. Hold On to Me deserves to be remembered as more than just an Australian classic -- this is a record that deserves to be heard and hailed by music fans the world over." ...|$|R
