5000|$|Originally, some fight scenes {{had been}} sped up in places through <b>undercranking.</b> The United States release slowed these scenes {{down to a}} more normal pace.|$|E
50|$|The {{opposite}} of fast motion is slow motion. Cinematographers refer to fast motion as <b>undercranking</b> {{since it was}} originally achieved by cranking a handcranked camera slower than normal. Overcranking produces slow motion effects.|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{video cameras}} {{do not have}} {{mechanical}} shutters and allow setting shutter speed directly in time units. Professional video cameras often allow selecting shutter speed in terms of shutter angle instead of time units, especially those {{that are capable of}} overcranking or <b>undercranking.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... but he {{is perhaps}} best {{recalled}} as the star {{of a series of}} bizarre silent comedy shorts, The Mishaps of Musty Suffer. Two volumes of surviving Musty Suffer titles were restored by the American Library of Congress and released with music by Ben Model on DVD by <b>Undercrank</b> Productions in 2014 and 2015.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{being given}} a budget to reshoot scenes if required, Bell re-structured the film and cut it down to fifty-five minutes. He {{commissioned}} Ronnie Hazlehurst to write an original music score. To add comic effect and to replicate the feel of silent films, the film was also slightly <b>undercranked</b> to speed it up.|$|R
50|$|So a film {{recorded}} at 12 {{frames per second}} will appear to move twice as fast. Shooting at camera speeds between 8 and 22 frames per second usually falls into the <b>undercranked</b> fast motion category, with images shot at slower speeds more closely falling {{into the realm of}} time-lapse, although these distinctions of terminology have not been entirely established in all movie production circles.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposite}} of slow motion is fast motion. Cinematographers refer to fast motion as <b>undercranking</b> {{since it was}} originally achieved by cranking a handcranked camera slower than normal. It is often used for comic, or occasional stylistic effect. Extreme fast motion is known as time lapse photography; a frame of, say, a growing plant is taken very few hours; when the frames are played back at normal speed, the plant is seen to grow before the viewer's eyes.|$|E
50|$|Processes {{that would}} {{normally}} appear subtle to the human eye, e.g. {{the motion of the}} sun and stars in the sky or plant growth, become very pronounced. Time-lapse is the extreme version of the cinematography technique of <b>undercranking.</b> Stop motion animation is a comparable technique; a subject that does not actually move, such as a puppet, can repeatedly be moved manually by a small distance and photographed; the photographs can be played back as a film, showing the subject appearing to move.|$|E
50|$|Martial arts films contain many {{characters}} who are martial artists, and these roles are often played by actors who are real martial artists. If not, actors frequently train {{in preparation for}} their roles, or the action director may rely more on stylized action or film making tricks like camera angles, editing, doubles, <b>undercranking,</b> wire work, and computer-generated imagery. Trampolines and springboards {{can also be used}} to increase the height of jumps. These techniques are sometimes used by real martial artists as well, depending on the style of action in the film.|$|E
50|$|Theatrical {{features}} originally photographed at 24 frame/s {{are shown}} at 25 frame/s. While {{this is usually}} not noticed in the picture (but may be more noticeable during action speed, especially if footage was filmed <b>undercranked),</b> the 4% increase in playback speed causes a slightly noticeable increase in audio pitch by just over 0.679 semitones, which is sometimes corrected using a pitch shifter, though pitch shifting is a recent innovation and supersedes an alternative method of telecine for 25 frame/s formats.|$|R
50|$|Three similar {{films were}} also made {{at about the}} same time, in August 1896, by the Anglo-American filmmaker J. Stuart Blackton, as a series called Blackton Sketches; Blackton would later make another film in the same vein, The Enchanted Drawing (1900). Méliès {{returned}} to sketching on film in his 1903 short The Untamable Whiskers, in which the process of drawing comic faces on a blackboard was <b>undercranked</b> so as to seem to occur with great speed. Numerous political caricatures by Méliès, presumably similar to those made in the A Lightning Sketch films, survive {{in the collection of the}} Centre national du cinéma.|$|R
50|$|With adjustments, {{issues of}} frame lines and {{sprocket}} holes were resolved with each incoming print, but hand cranked film speed {{was also a}} nagging issue. Renovare would capture each frame, but a film could have been <b>undercranked</b> and exposed only for twelve frames per second. Playback on today’s film projectors might require 18 or 24 frame/s. Everything would appear comically fast. The solution was to expose a frame or every other frame twice, thereby making the action appear realistic. The reverse was true as well, with overcranked exposures, and frames {{would have to be}} removed to avoid slow motion films.|$|R
5000|$|The show often uses <b>undercranking</b> and sight gags {{to create}} what he called [...] "live animation", and he employs {{techniques}} like mime and parody. The show typically closes with a sped-up chase scene involving him and often a crew of scantily-clad women (usually with Hill being the one chased, due to silly predicaments that he himself caused), a takeoff on the stereotypical Keystone Kops chase scenes. Hill also composed and sang patter songs and often entertained his audience with lengthy high-speed double-entendre rhymes and songs, which he recited or sang in a single take.|$|E
50|$|Mars Needs Women is padded {{with long}} {{sequences}} taken from stock aviation footage (the North American X-15 spacecraft being launched from its Boeing NB-52B Stratofortress mother ship and General Dynamics F-111 fighter-bomber in particular). Due to poor lighting, {{parts of the}} film were made by <b>undercranking</b> the camera and having the actors move more slowly, sometimes shooting at 18 or 12 frames per second {{instead of the usual}} 24. Actors also stretched out scenes with long sequences with no dialogue, either walking or doing menial tasks. One lengthy scene involves the camera focused on a loudspeaker.|$|E
5000|$|The {{explosion}} is {{triggered by}} the attempts of a carnival man to stop the ride after crawling under the whirling carousel deck {{to get to the}} controls in the center. Although Hitchcock admitted to <b>undercranking</b> the shot (artificially accelerating the action), it was not a trick shot: the man actually had to crawl under the spinning ride, just inches from possible injury. [...] "Hitchcock told me that this scene was the most personally frightening moment for him in any of his films", writes biographer Charlotte Chandler. [...] "The man who crawled under the out-of-control carousel was not an actor or a stuntman, but a carousel operator who volunteered for the job. 'If the man had raised his head even slightly", Hitchcock said, [...] "it would have gone from being a suspense film into a horror film." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{performed}} in The Hazards of Helen for 69 episodes until the series ended in February 1917, after which Kalem tried producing another serial The Daughter of Daring, with {{a starring role}} for her. [...] One of her best stunts appeared in this serial: traveling at full speed on a motorcycle chasing after a runaway freight train, Gibson rode through a wooden gate, shattering it completely, up a station platform, and through the open doors of a boxcar on a siding, with her machine traveling through the air until it landed on a flatcar in a passing train. The trick was to <b>undercrank</b> the camera and execute it all with flawless timing.|$|R
5000|$|Harry B. Watson, Jr. (June 12, 1876 - October 1, 1965) was an American {{actor and}} comedian. Before his Vaudeville and Broadway stage career and making his films, {{he was a}} clown for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Among his Broadway shows were the George Gershwin musical Tip-Toes and five editions of the Ziegfeld Follies. The most high profile of his few feature films was the Marion Davies vehicle Zander the Great,but he is perhaps best {{recalled}} as the star {{of a series of}} bizarre silent comedy shorts, The Mishaps of Musty Suffer. Two volumes of surviving Musty Suffer titles were restored by the American Library of Congress and released with music by Ben Model on DVD by <b>Undercrank</b> Productions in 2014 and 2015.|$|R
5|$|There were consequences, as well, {{for other}} {{technological}} {{aspects of the}} cinema. Proper recording and playback of sound required exact standardization of camera and projector speed. Before sound, 16 frames per second (fps) was the supposed norm, but practice varied widely. Cameras were often <b>undercranked</b> or overcranked to improve exposures or for dramatic effect. Projectors were commonly run too fast to shorten running time and squeeze in extra shows. Variable frame rate, however, made sound unlistenable, and a new, strict standard of 24 fps was soon established. Sound also forced the abandonment of the noisy arc lights used for filming in studio interiors. The switch to quiet incandescent illumination in turn required a switch to more expensive film stock. The sensitivity of the new panchromatic film delivered superior image tonal quality and gave directors the freedom to shoot scenes at lower light levels than was previously practical.|$|R
5000|$|Les Nouveaux Messieurs by Robert de Flers and Francis de Croisset {{had opened}} in Paris in February 1925, with Gaby Morlay in the leading role, {{and it became}} the biggest success of the season, running for over 500 performances. Feyder and Charles Spaak made an {{adaptation}} which sought to dispense with the verbal humour of the play but to translate it into visual terms. The film uses relatively few intertitles and those are employed mainly to convey information. A number of technical devices are used (superimposition of images, [...] "flous" [...] or blurring of the image, <b>undercranking</b> or speeded-up motion) often to achieve comic effect. In one scene the delegates in parliament are arranged in a semicircle, and on them is superimposed a translucent filter which recedes like a fan closing, {{which is used to}} signify that {{more and more of the}} delegates are agreeing with the speaker.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most famous}} {{shot of the}} chase is made from a front bumper mount and shows a low-angle point of view shot of the streets racing by. Director of {{photography}} Owen Roizman, wrote in American Cinematographer magazine in 1972 that the camera was <b>undercranked</b> to 18 frames per second to enhance the sense of speed. Roizman's contention is borne out {{when you see a}} car at a red light whose muffler is pumping smoke at an accelerated rate. Other shots involved stunt drivers who were supposed to barely miss hitting the speeding car, but due to errors in timing, accidental collisions occurred and were left in the final film. Friedkin said that he used Santana's cover of Fleetwood Mac's song [...] "Black Magic Woman" [...] during editing to help shape the chase sequence; though the song does not appear in the film, [...] "it chase scene did have a sort of pre-ordained rhythm to it that came from the music." ...|$|R
5000|$|Until the {{standardization}} of the projection speed of 24 {{frames per second}} (fps) for sound films between 1926 and 1930, silent films were shot at variable speeds (or [...] "frame rates") anywhere from 12 to 40 fps, depending on the year and studio. [...] "Standard silent film speed" [...] is often said to be 16 fps {{as a result of}} the Lumière brothers' Cinématographe, but industry practice varied considerably; there was no actual standard. William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, an Edison employee, settled on the astonishingly fast 40 frames per second. Additionally, cameramen of the era insisted that their cranking technique was exactly 16 fps, but modern examination of the films shows this to be in error, that they often cranked faster. Unless carefully shown at their intended speeds silent films can appear unnaturally fast or slow. However, some scenes were intentionally <b>undercranked</b> during shooting to accelerate the action—particularly for comedies and action films.|$|R
