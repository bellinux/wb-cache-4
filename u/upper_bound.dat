25|$|More formally, real {{numbers have}} the two basic {{properties}} of being an ordered field, and having the least <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> property. The first says that real numbers comprise a field, with addition and multiplication as well as division by non-zero numbers, which can be totally ordered on a number line in a way compatible with addition and multiplication. The second says that, if a non-empty set of real numbers has an <b>upper</b> <b>bound,</b> then it has a real least <b>upper</b> <b>bound.</b> The second condition distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers: for example, the set of rational numbers whose square is less than 2 is a set with an <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> (e.g. 1.5) but no (rational) least upper bound: hence the rational numbers do not satisfy the least <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> property.|$|E

25|$|The last {{property}} is what differentiates the reals from the rationals. For example, {{the set of}} rationals with square less than 2 has a rational <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> (e.g., 1.5) but no rational least <b>upper</b> <b>bound,</b> because the square root of 2 is not rational.|$|E
25|$|The <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> is {{attained}} by generalizing the inductive method of enumerating polyominoes. Instead of adding one square at a time, one adds {{a cluster of}} squares at a time. This {{is often described as}} adding twigs. By proving that every n-omino is a sequence of twigs, and by proving limits on the combinations of possible twigs, one obtains an <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> on the number of n-ominoes. For example, in the algorithm outlined above, at each step we must choose a larger number, and at most three new numbers are added (since at most three unnumbered squares are adjacent to any numbered square). This can be used to obtain an <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> of 6.75. Using 2.8 million twigs, Klarner and Rivest obtained an <b>upper</b> <b>bound</b> of 4.65.|$|E
