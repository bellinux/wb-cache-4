This was despite a delay of 14 months in bringing the claim for relief and the claimant's illegality relating to its use of the premises. The commentary considers the issue of delay and also {{the question as to}} whether a tenant's illegal activities relating {{to the use of the}} premises can be taken into account in the exercise of the court's equitable jurisdiction whether or not to grant relief from forfeiture.
