5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single <b>User</b> <b>Mode,</b> achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
25|$|The Windows {{version of}} Virtual PC also uses dynamic recompilation, {{but only to}} {{translate}} x86 kernel mode and real mode code into x86 <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> code; original <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> and virtual 8086 mode code run natively.|$|E
25|$|Windows NT {{kernel mode}} has {{full access to}} the {{hardware}} and system resources of the computer and runs code in a protected memory area. It controls access to scheduling, thread prioritization, memory management and the interaction with hardware. The kernel mode stops <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> services and applications from accessing critical areas of the operating system {{that they should not}} have access to; <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> processes must ask the kernel mode to perform such operations on their behalf.|$|E
50|$|TriCore is a heterogeneous, {{asymmetric}} dual {{core architecture}} with a peripheral control processor that enables <b>user</b> <b>modes</b> and core system protection.|$|R
50|$|Recovery Console and {{recovery}} discs {{are different from}} single <b>user</b> <b>modes</b> in other operating systems because they are independent of the maintained operating system. This works more like chrooting into other environment with other kernel in Linux.|$|R

25|$|The GDI, {{which is}} a part of the Win32 and Win16 subsystems, is also a module that is loaded in <b>user</b> <b>mode,</b> unlike Windows NT where the GDI is loaded in kernel mode.|$|E
25|$|In a {{monolithic}} kernel, {{the operating system}} runs in supervisor mode and the applications run in <b>user</b> <b>mode.</b> Other types of operating systems, like those with an exokernel or microkernel, do not necessarily share this behavior.|$|E

50|$|The {{unrestricted}} mode {{is often}} called kernel mode, but many other designations exist (master mode, supervisor mode, privileged mode, etc.). Restricted modes are usually referred to as <b>user</b> <b>modes,</b> but are also known by many other names (slave mode, problem state, etc.).|$|R
30|$|Online {{presentation}} has two <b>user</b> <b>modes,</b> namely (1) Presenter Mode, and (2) Listener Mode. In presenter <b>mode,</b> the <b>user</b> has over-all {{control of}} slide change, cursor position, zooming function and annotation function. <b>Users</b> in listener <b>mode</b> can only monitor who {{have joined the}} presentation, but {{does not have the}} rights to control the slides. The listener’s presentation panel serves as a passive listener where it displays what is on the presenter’s presentation panel.|$|R
25|$|At {{power-on}} or reset, {{the system}} begins in supervisor mode. Once an operating system kernel {{has been loaded}} and started, the boundary between <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> and supervisor mode (also known as kernel mode) can be established.|$|E
25|$|There are {{at least}} five types of rootkit, ranging from those at the lowest level in {{firmware}} (with the highest privileges), through to the least privileged user-based variants that operate in Ring 3. Hybrid combinations of these may occur spanning, for example, <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> and kernel mode.|$|E
25|$|For audio professionals, a new WaveRT port driver {{has been}} {{introduced}} that strives to achieve real-time performance by using the multimedia class scheduler and supports audio applications that reduce the latency of audio streams. Consequently, <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> applications can completely govern streams of audio without any code execution in the kernel during runtime. WaveRT allows the <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> application {{direct access to the}} internal audio hardware buffers and sample position counters (data in the memory that is mapped to the audio hardware DMA engine). It allows applications to poll the current position in the DMA memory window that the hardware is accessing. WaveRT also supports the notion of a hardware generated clock notification event, similar to the ASIO API, so that applications need not poll for current position if they don't want to.|$|E
50|$|Shareaza {{has three}} <b>user</b> <b>modes.</b> The {{first one is}} for normal <b>users.</b> This <b>mode</b> is the default mode and {{provides}} a clean, trimmed GUI. Users {{will not be able}} to make major changes to settings in this mode, but will be able to make use of the most essential functions, like searching and downloading. The second mode is for power users. It provides more access to network and advanced settings, but can also break your connection to the networks. The third mode is the windowed mode. In this <b>mode,</b> <b>users</b> can see different tabs (windows) simultaneously, providing a lot of control about the things happening. This mode also makes it possible to personalize the look of the client to perfectly fit the needs of the respective user.|$|R

25|$|The CPU, {{and later}} the whole family, {{implements}} two levels of privilege. <b>User</b> <b>mode</b> gives access to everything except privileged instructions such as interrupt level controls. Supervisor privilege gives access to everything. An interrupt always becomes supervisory. The supervisor bit is stored in the status register, and is visible to user programs.|$|E
25|$|Linux and Windows are two {{operating}} systems that use supervisor/user mode. To perform specialized functions, <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> code must perform a system call into supervisor mode {{or even to}} the kernel space where trusted code of the operating system will perform the needed task and return the execution back to the userspace.|$|E
25|$|MIPS I has two {{instructions}} for software to signal an exception: System Call and Breakpoint. System Call {{is used by}} <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> software to make kernel calls; and Breakpoint is used to transfer control to a debugger via the kernel's exception handler. Both instructions have a 20-bit Code field that can contain operating environment-specific information for the exception handler.|$|E

25|$|The later {{evolution}} of the 68000 focused on more modern embedded control applications and on-chip peripherals. The 68EC000 chip and SCM68000 core expanded the address bus to 32 bits, removed the M6800 peripheral bus, and excluded the MOVE from SR instruction from <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> programs. In 1996, Motorola updated the standalone core with fully static circuitry, drawing only 2µW in low-power mode, calling it the MC68SEC000.|$|E
25|$|Programs and {{subsystems}} in <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> {{are limited}} in terms of to what system resources they have access, while the kernel mode has unrestricted access to the system memory and external devices. The Windows NT kernel {{is known as a}} hybrid kernel. The architecture comprises a simple kernel, hardware abstraction layer (HAL), drivers, and a range of services (collectively named Executive), which all exist in kernel mode.|$|E
25|$|After {{passing through}} WASAPI, all {{host-based}} audio processing, including custom audio processing, {{can take place}} (sample rate conversion, mixing, effects). Host-based processing modules {{are referred to as}} Audio Processing Objects, or APOs. All these components operate in <b>user</b> <b>mode.</b> The only portion of this architecture that runs in kernel mode is the audio driver (which contains the Port Class driver, the vendor Miniport driver and the vendor HAL).|$|E
50|$|The CPU {{contains}} eight general-purpose 16-bit registers (R0 to R7). Register R7 is {{the program}} counter (PC). Although any register {{can be used}} as a stack pointer, R6 is the stack pointer (SP) used for hardware interrupts and traps. R5 is often used to point to the current procedure call frame. To speed up context switching, some PDP-11 models provide separate stack pointers for Kernel, Supervisor, and <b>User</b> <b>modes,</b> which also have separate memory maps, and dual R1-R5 register sets.|$|R

50|$|Some CPU {{architectures}} support multiple <b>user</b> <b>modes,</b> {{often with}} a hierarchy of privileges. These architectures are often said to have ring-based security, wherein the hierarchy of privileges resembles a set of concentric rings, with the kernel mode in the center. Multics hardware was the first significant implementation of ring security, but many other hardware platforms have been designed along similar lines, including the Intel 80286 protected mode, and the IA-64 as well, though it is referred to by a different name in these cases.|$|R
25|$|To gain {{performance}} and determinism, some systems place functions that {{would likely be}} viewed as application logic, rather than as device drivers, in kernel mode; security applications (access control, firewalls, etc.) and operating system monitors are cited as examples. At least one embedded database management system, eXtremeDB Kernel Mode, has been developed specifically for kernel mode deployment, to provide a local database for kernel-based application functions, and to eliminate the context switches that would otherwise occur when kernel functions interact with a database system running in <b>user</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
25|$|Handles {{plug and}} play and {{supports}} device detection and installation at boot time. It also has the responsibility to stop and start devices on demand—this can happen when a bus (such as USB or IEEE 1394 FireWire) gains a new device and {{needs to have a}} device driver loaded to support it. Its bulk is actually implemented in <b>user</b> <b>mode,</b> in the Plug and Play Service, which handles the often complex tasks of installing the appropriate drivers, notifying services and applications of the arrival of new devices, and displaying GUI to the user.|$|E
25|$|MIPS is {{a reduced}} {{instruction}} set computer (RISC) instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by MIPS Technologies (formerly MIPS Computer Systems). The early MIPS architectures were 32-bit, with 64-bit versions added later. There are multiple versions of MIPS: including MIPS I, II, III, IV, and V; {{as well as}} five releases of MIPS32/64 (for 32- and 64-bit implementations, respectively). As of April 2017, the current version is MIPS32/64 Release 6. MIPS32/64 primarily differs from MIPS IV by defining the privileged kernel mode System Control Coprocessor in addition to the <b>user</b> <b>mode</b> architecture.|$|E
30|$|From {{the above}} results, {{we can see}} that under the {{circumstances}} of relatively stronger interference, MODE 1 is more suitable to be chosen when there is a long distance between the D 2 D <b>users.</b> <b>MODE</b> 2 is preferred when the D 2 D users are close enough to each other. Note that this strategy is a result of strong interference from the cellular users, but the outcome is a little bit different if the interference is weak, which {{can be seen from the}} analysis in the next section.|$|R

Changes were made at the University of Michigan in 1990 to allow user programs using 31-bit addresses to work smoothly: object modules could be flagged as supporting 31-bit addressing (or not), compilers and assemblers were changed to supply the correct flags, programs would switch between 24 and 31-bit addressing modes as needed when transitioning between system and <b>user</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|R
