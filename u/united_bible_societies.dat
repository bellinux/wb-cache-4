25|$|Kurt Aland (28 March 1915 – 13 April 1994) was a German theologian and biblical {{scholar who}} {{specialized}} in New Testament textual criticism. He founded the Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung (Institute for New Testament Textual Research) in Münster and served as its first director from 1959–83. He {{was one of the}} principal editors of Nestle-Aland - Novum Testamentum Graece for the Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft and The Greek New Testament for the <b>United</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>Societies.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{translation}} a {{wide range}} of manuscripts were reviewed. The Masoretic text, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Greek Septuagint or (LXX), the Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion, the Latin Vulgate, the Syriac Peshitta, the Aramaic Targums, and for the Psalms the Juxta Hebraica of Jerome were all consulted for the Old Testament. The Dead Sea Scrolls were occasionally followed where the Masoretic Text seemed inconsistent. The <b>United</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>Societies</b> Nestle-Aland Greek New Testament text was used for the New Testament.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} <b>United</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>Societies</b> 1905 {{edition of}} the New Testament of the Peshitta was based on editions prepared by Syriacists Philip E. Pusey (d.1880), George Gwilliam (d.1914) and John Gwyn. These editions comprised Gwilliam & Pusey's 1901 critical {{edition of the}} gospels, Gwilliam's critical edition of Acts, Gwilliam & Pinkerton's critical edition of Paul's Epistles and John Gwynn's critical edition of the General Epistles and later Revelation. This critical Peshitta text {{is based on a}} collation of more than seventy Peshitta and a few other Aramaic manuscripts. All 27 books of the common Western Canon of the New Testament are included in this British & Foreign Bible Society's 1905 Peshitta edition, as is the adultery pericope (John 7:53–8:11). The 1979 Syriac Bible, United Bible Society, uses the same text for its New Testament. The Online Bible reproduces the 1905 Syriac Peshitta NT in Hebrew characters.|$|E

25|$|The {{consensus}} within biblical scholarship, {{though not}} universal, {{is that the}} Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated into Syriac from Hebrew, probably in the 2nd century AD, and that the New Testament of the Peshitta was translated from the Greek. This New Testament, originally excluding certain disputed books (2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation), had become a standard by the early 5th century. The five excluded books were added in the Harklean Version (616 AD) of Thomas of Harqel. However, the 1905 <b>United</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>Society</b> Peshitta used new editions prepared by the Irish Syriacist John Gwynn for the missing books.|$|R

Most of missionaries were Norwegian and affiliated with the Norwegian Protestant Mission. Christianity had never really reached the commune and a large crowd had gathered in the main square to greet them, including the mayor, Sissoko. Hunters and musicians and dancing girls and horses turned the visit into a celebration which is a Khassonké custom at important events. The people of Tomora slaughtered two cows and about fifteen sheep to provide a feast. The <b>Bible</b> <b>Society</b> had been responsible for spreading Christianity in the area by establishing the Khassonké New Testament, translated by those they had educated in English into the Khassonké. The New Testament was brought in, wrapped in a large gift box and followed by a small church choir which performed Khassonké songs throughout the ceremony.|$|R

50|$|Since {{the mid-19th}} century, eclecticism, {{in which there}} is no a priori bias to a single manuscript, has been the {{dominant}} method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament (currently, the <b>United</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>Society,</b> 4th ed. and Nestle-Aland, 27th ed.). In textual criticism, eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the Alexandrian text-type, are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition. Modern translations of the New Testament are based on these copies.|$|R

5000|$|Following Atatürk's orthographic {{reforms in}} 1928, the Bible was rewritten in the Latin script-based new Turkish alphabet. This project was {{completed}} in 1941. However, as the Turkish authorities were determined to remove as many foreign words from Turkish as possible, the language consequently underwent a dramatic transformation. In just sixty years, the language went through the equivalent of three hundred years of changes, thus many foreign words found in the old Turkish Bible were no longer used. Because of this the <b>United</b> <b>Bible</b> <b>Society</b> and the Translation Trust joined together to produce a translation suited to the new language. This work is a colloquial version. The translators included Ali Şimşek, Behnan Konutgan and Mahmud Solgun. The translation consultants included the Rev. Dr. Manuel Jinbachian and Dr. Krijn van der Jagt. In 1989 the New Testament was published, one journalist saying the work [...] "flows like music." [...] The New Testament edition is called İNCİL: İncil'in Çağdaş Türkçe Çevirisi.
