40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{perceptions of}} sustainability and sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> among actors {{involved in the}} project of rebuilding Slussen in central Stockholm. Views on the suggested new traffic solution and what would make a sustainable solution, the concepts of sustainability and sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> and how these concepts are interpreted and applied as policy, are especially investigated. A semi-structured qualitative interview study has been carried out and the respondents include city officials, politicians, representatives of interest groups, consultants and researchers. Stockholm, European Green Capital in 2010, sets high goals for sustainability. As concept, sustainability is also frequently used in much of the city´s planning material such as the budget, environmental programme and <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>documents.</b> However, it has not been included in the goals of the Slussen project. Even though, interviewees representing the city view the project as a sustainability project whereas other respondents clearly question this view. The study suggests that a determining factor for this division is how the sustainability concept is defined (or not), also how car traffic is viewed in <b>urban</b> sustainable <b>development.</b> The thesis shows that instead of planning for sustainable transportation, traditional business-as-usual traffic planning has dominated the Slussen project. The main reasons are that the new traffic solution, although including new walking and cycling bridges as well as a new bus terminal, includes planning for increased car traffic, an eight lane bridge to provide for it and a high degree of separation instead of integration of transport modes. Many of the interviewees also perceive of the suggested new main bridge as a motorway and the walking bridge as being both socially and culturally unsustainable in its long and narrow design. The new traffic solution in itself is viewed as unsustainable since it would bring about the abandonment of a more than 300 year old tradition of double and equal bridges at Slussen. Finally, the study suggests that the planned new traffic solution would have both looked different and been perceived of as more sustainable if sustainability had been included in the project goals. However, this would only have been the case if the concept was properly defined and implemented...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{question}} whether {{and to what extent}} <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics make use of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts to tackle tasks and challenges posed by immigration and the presence of migrants in cities. As a start, relevant migration-related issues with a connection to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are expounded. This is followed by the analysis of six <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in terms of any migration and integration – related statements they may contain. The thesis consists of three chapters: in the first chapter, “migration” as the given central topic is identified and discussed following an examination of up-to-date specialist literature. There is a strong emphasis on the terminology used in current debates with particular attention given to the term “integration“. Another aspect of the first chapter is immigration in Germany: since its foundation, the Federal Republic of Germany has been a destination for immigrants; as a result, there are presently 12 million people from migrant backgrounds living in Germany. Among the main destinations were large West German cities, and within these cities specific districts which have consequently become rife with migration-related issues and problems. As a result, there are complex social, economic and spatial developments and phenomena which all have an impact on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics: Population development, segregation, the housing situation, the educational situation, their economic potential and chances, cultural impact of the presence of migrants. These aspects and the subject of integration and their relevance to <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> are the main topics of the professional debate. “Migration” with its complex spatial and content-related implications thus offers a cross- section view of <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> The second chapter addresses the subject of “urban development”. A brief retrospective highlights the general framework and paradigms of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> since the 1960 s and, above all, the use and implementation of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. The realisation here is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts do provide ideas and possibilities on how to handle migration-related issues and integrate these into <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics. Basic consideration of urban migration topics on one hand and <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics on the other hand have been the basis for developing a “migration evaluation” of selected current <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. Using a uniform investigation raster, it is explored how and to what extent these <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts contain statements on the migration-related topics mentioned above. The concluding examination in the third chapter returns to the initial questions: Is migration an integral part of current <b>urban</b> <b>development?</b> If so, how and to what extent? This will then lead to questions of whether the full potential of migration-related possibilities is being tapped and the restrictions and boundaries that apply. The overall conclusion is that <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics has so far failed to fully realise the importance of “migration” as an issue. <b>Urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts have been used with reserve to implement this issue in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics in an explicit, constructive and stringent manner. There {{can be no doubt that}} this is a difficult task. The appropriate consideration of issues of migration and integration in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts is met with various challenges: the complexity of this task cannot be ignored. However, this should by no means affect the comprehensibility of the problem; the significance of migration issues within <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and the real life impact of these issues on <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> should correspond; <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts should be closely linked with other (professional) conceptions in the context of migration and integration. Migrants should be involved in the process of creating <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts in order to tap their resources, knowledge and potential for <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> Finally, the thesis identifies existing gaps and areas in need of further research: <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts give but little indication of actual activity in the respective migration-related communal arenas; also, <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts are the result and expression of ongoing local politics debates, yet a discrepancy remains between the political aims and stances identified in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts and those discussed outside the realm of <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> concepts. This discrepancy requires further analysis. A third gap has been identified between local politics objectives and actual local activity beyond political agendas. The thesis closes on the note that not only is there a need for migration to be recognised as an urban development-relevant matter but that there is ample reasoning for the integration of migration as a task in <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> politics...|$|R

40|$|In {{the global}} {{knowledge}} economy, knowledge-intensive industries and knowledge workers are extensively {{seen as the}} primary factors to improve the welfare and competitiveness of cities. To attract and retain such industries and workers, cities produce knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies, and therefore such strategising has become an important development mechanism for cities and their economies. The paper discusses the critical connections between knowledge city foundations and integrated knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> mechanisms in both the local and regional level. In particular, the paper investigates Brisbane’s knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> strategies that support gentrification, attraction, and retention of investment and talent. Furthermore, the paper develops a knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> assessment framework to provide {{a clearer understanding of}} the local and regional policy frameworks, and relevant applications of Brisbane’s knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> experience, in becoming a prosperous knowledge city. The paper, with its knowledge-based <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> assessment framework, scrutinises Brisbane’s four development domains in detail: economy; society; institutional; built and natural environments.
