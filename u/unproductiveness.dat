60|$|The fine silks and cottons, the laces, {{and other}} {{ornamental}} luxuries {{of a rich}} country, may contribute very considerably to augment the exchangeable value of its annual produce; yet they contribute but {{in a very small}} degree to augment the mass of happiness in the society, and it appears to me that it is with some view to the real utility of the produce that we ought to estimate the productiveness or <b>unproductiveness</b> of different sorts of labour. The French economists consider all labour employed in manufactures as unproductive. Comparing it with the labour employed upon land, I should be perfectly disposed to agree with them, but not exactly for the reasons which they give. They say that labour employed upon land is productive because the produce, over and above completely paying the labourer and the farmer, affords a clear rent to the landlord, and that the labour employed upon a piece of lace is unproductive because it merely replaces the provisions that the workman had consumed, and the stock of his employer, without affording any clear rent whatever. But supposing the value of the wrought lace to be such as that, besides paying in the most complete manner the workman and his employer, it could afford a clear rent to a third person, it appears to me that, in comparison with the labour employed upon land, it would be still as unproductive as ever. Though, according to the reasoning used by the French economists, the man employed in the manufacture of lace would, in this case, seem to be a productive labourer. Yet according to their definition of the wealth of a state, he ought not to be considered in that light. He will have added nothing to the gross produce of the land: he has consumed a portion of this gross produce, and has left a bit of lace in return; and though he may sell this bit of lace for three times the quantity of provisions that he consumed whilst he was making it, and thus be a very productive labourer with regard to himself, yet he cannot be considered as having added by his labour to any essential part of the riches of the state. The clear rent, therefore, that a certain produce can afford, after paying the expenses of procuring it, {{does not appear to be}} the sole criterion, by which to judge of the productiveness or <b>unproductiveness</b> to a state of any particular species of labour.|$|E
60|$|All the crossed plants {{together}} produced thirty-three flower-stems, whilst the self-fertilised bore only thirteen. The {{number of}} the capsules were counted only on the plants in Pots 1 and 3, for the self-fertilised plants in Pot 2 produced none; therefore those on the crossed plants {{on the opposite side}} were not counted. Capsules not containing any good seeds were rejected. The crossed plants in the above two pots produced 206, and the self-fertilised in the same pots only 32 capsules; or as 100 to 15. Judging from the previous generations, the extreme <b>unproductiveness</b> of the self-fertilised plants in this experiment was wholly due to their having been subjected to unfavourable conditions, and to severe competition with the crossed plants; for had they grown separately in good soil, it is almost certain that they would have produced a large number of capsules. The seeds were counted in twenty capsules from the crossed plants, and they averaged 24.75; whilst in twenty capsules from the self-fertilised plants the average was 17.65; or as 100 to 71. Moreover, the seeds from the self-fertilised plants were not nearly so fine as those from the crossed plants. If we consider together the number of capsules produced and the average number of contained seeds, the fertility of the crossed plants to the self-fertilised plants was as 100 to 11. We thus see what a great effect, as far as fertility is concerned, was produced by a cross between the two varieties, which had been long exposed to different conditions, in comparison with self-fertilisation; the fertilisation having been in both cases of the legitimate order.|$|E
60|$|There {{is another}} subject on which some light is thrown by the facts given in this volume, namely, hybridisation. It is notorious that when {{distinct}} {{species of plants}} are crossed, they produce with the rarest exceptions fewer seeds than the normal number. This <b>unproductiveness</b> varies in different species up to sterility so complete that not even an empty capsule is formed; and all experimentalists have found that it is much influenced by the conditions to which the crossed species are subjected. The pollen of each species is strongly prepotent over {{that of any other}} species, so that if a plant's own pollen is placed on the stigma some time after foreign pollen has been applied to it, any effect from the latter is quite obliterated. It is also notorious that not only the parent species, but the hybrids raised from them are more or less sterile; and that their pollen is often in a more or less aborted condition. The degree of sterility of various hybrids does not always strictly correspond with the degree of difficulty in uniting the parent forms. When hybrids are capable of breeding inter se, their descendants are more or less sterile, and they often become still more sterile in the later generations; but then close interbreeding has hitherto been practised in all such cases. The more sterile hybrids are sometimes much dwarfed in stature, and have a feeble constitution. Other facts could be given, but these will suffice for us. Naturalists formerly attributed all these results to the difference between species being fundamentally distinct from that between the varieties of the same species; and this is still the verdict of some naturalists.|$|E

Introduction: Soils are unproductive for many reasons, among which are lack of moisture, absence of bacteria, excess of soluable salts, {{and some of}} the essential elements to plant growth. It is of this last requisite that we treat in this paper. Among the necessary chemical elements for plant growth, those that are most liable to be deficient in available form are: N. P. and K. Some soils are lacking in lime as is shown by their acidity. Since we are unable to tell the elements that are deficient in an unproductive soil by chemical analysis, we have to determine them by experimental work. A new method for determining the <b>unproductiveness</b> of soils is by the wire basket method. This is the method that we have used in conducting this experiment. This method is quicker than field tests and promises to be practical. The soil used in this experiment was taken from one of the poorer fields on the College Farm. It was put in good condition, different fertilizers added, placed in wire baskets, and five grains of wheat planted in each basket. After running the experiment for about four weeks the fertilizer requirement was determined by the growth of the wheat and the amount of moisture used. The baskets used were about three inches deep and three inches in diameter. They were filled with soil and then covered with paroffin. After the wheat was up the tops were sealed with paroffin and paper so as to prevent evaporizion...|$|E
40|$|The Irish {{have been}} relentlessly racialized in their {{diaspora}} settings, yet little historical work engages with “race” to understand Irish history {{on the island}} of Ireland. This article provides an interpretation of two key periods of Irish history—the second half of the sixteenth century and the period since 1996 —through the lens of racialization. I argue that Ireland's history is exceptional in its capacity to reveal key elements {{of the history of the}} development of race as an idea and a set of practices. The English colonization of Ireland was underpinned by a form of racism reliant on linking bodies to unchanging hierarchically stacked cultures, without reference to physical differences. For example, the putative <b>unproductiveness</b> of the Gaelic Irish not only placed them at a lower level of civilization than the industrious English but it also authorizes increasingly draconian ways of dealing with the Irish populace. The period since 1996, during which Ireland has become a country of immigration, illustrates how racism has undergone a transformation into the object of official state policies to eliminate it. Yet it flourishes as part of a globalized set of power relations that has brought immigrants to the developing Irish economy. In response to immigration the state simultaneously exerts neoliberal controls and reduces pathways to citizenship through residence while passing antiracism legislation. Today, the indigenous nomadic Travellers and asylum seekers are the ones that are seen as pathologically unproductive. Irish history thus demonstrates that race is not only about color but also very much about culture. It also illustrates notable elements of the West's journey from racism without race to racism without racists...|$|E

For those who survive, the brain injury-related consequences to their psychological well-being (e. g. feelings {{of anxiety and}} low mood, low self-esteem) and social environment (e. g. very limited social support, loss of relationships and friendships) are understood {{to be the ones}} that have the most effect on a young person’s life in the long term. The social environment, such as family and friends, is important {{for the development of a}} young person’s identity, independence and self-esteem. Most young people with an acquired brain injury rely on their families to help them to manage the long-term psychosocial consequences. It is understood that society tends to denigrate the <b>unproductiveness</b> and dependence of those young people who do not have a visible sign of the injury. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of young people aged 18 to 31 living with a brain injury who do not have visible impairments and who sustained their injury more than two years ago. Six men and two women who attended the young people’s group at Headway House in East London were interviewed. Thematic analysis within a critical-realist epistemology was undertaken to analyse the interviews for shared and distinct themes. Four main themes and four subthemes were identified, representing the participants’ experiences of how their brain injury had led to a range of inabilities, for example cognitive, physical, behavioural, communicative and personality, which changed their sense of self, their social relationships and their return to work or school. These changes consequently led to feelings of lost purpose and meaning in life and ultimately to feelings of low mood, frustration and exclusion. The participants felt supported by family and professional services and they described that acknowledgement of inabilities was necessary to make effective use of provided support. Yet, the participants felt that they were excluded by our society and left to their own devices to find themselves a meaningful place in society. Therefore, it is recommended that the general public and professionals would benefit from general education about the challenges young brain injury survivors face and the support they need...|$|E
40|$|Design studios, {{the core}} of {{architectural}} education, are the locus in which students develop design skills while being socialized into {{the culture of the}} architectural profession. This qualitative case study examines a first year design studio taught by an experienced professor inspired by cultural feminist principles and student-centered pedagogy. This study explores the questions: (1) How do the professor 2 ̆ 7 s pedagogical principles influence and shape the educational dynamic within the design studio? (2) How are students 2 ̆ 7 creative processes influenced by this professor 2 ̆ 7 s pedagogy? and, (3) What can be learned from this case study to make design studios supportive and positive learning environments?^ Answering these questions led to the following conclusions: (1) The professor 2 ̆ 7 s personal beliefs and professional values, love for teaching, and willingness to be a co-explorer of students 2 ̆ 7 ideas shaped a studio dynamic in which students 2 ̆ 7 individual needs and learning styles were acknowledged within the requirements of the School and Freshman Design Studios curricula. She consciously worked out conflicts between the program 2 ̆ 7 s traditional goals to architectural education (developing technically and aesthetically proficient, highly competitive architects) and her own student-centered, cultural feminist pedagogy (developing environmentally aware, socially just architects). (2) The priority given to students 2 ̆ 7 development as individuals meant sharing professorial authority and power. Her multidisciplinary background and experience promoted a creative pedagogy that empowered students as individuals and fostered a strong group identity through networking, thus increasing personal and collective responsibility for their work, self-awareness, confidence, and willingness to take risks in their approaches to design. Consequently, the studio dynamic evolved into a positive learning environment, supporting each student 2 ̆ 7 s creative process and the quality of their designs and learning. (3) This case study is an atypical learning environment for an introductory design studio within traditionally oriented professional degree programs. More in-depth studies are needed on the underlying premises of studios that create psychological climates leading to enhanced creativity and empowerment or to <b>unproductiveness</b> and frustration in students. Further, an interdisciplinary look at cultural politics could help build guidelines for better preparing architects to deal with the pressing demands for change in the profession and towards social justice. ...|$|E
40|$|Masters in Public Administration - MPAThe {{provision}} of quality services {{is important for}} the overall welfare of South Africans. However, the Apartheid legacy appears to have long lasting effects on the {{provision of}} quality services at local level, with a range of undesirable effects, especially for ordinary people at grassroots level. Nevertheless, this concern has been made possible the legacy of apartheid, which makes it practically impossible to address the immediate needs of ordinary South Africans. For over a decade, South African local government has been condemned for poor service delivery, which is as a result of inefficiency, <b>unproductiveness</b> and incompetency of the public servants. These factors have hindered the prospect of delivering quality services at the most efficient and effective level, hence the introduction of a long- term plan by the South African government to improve the productiveness of the local government, and this plan is known as Performance Management System (PMS). The introduction of performance management system is critical because it ensures that plans are being implemented, that they are having the desired development impact and that resources are being used efficiently. This thesis critically analyzes the implementation processes of Performance Management System at O. R. Tambo District Municipality. Its principal aims is to investigate the factors that hinder the effective implementation of performance management system at local government in South Africa, to assess the effectiveness of PMS at ORTDM, to identify and explore different theories on performance management system. This thesis also seeks to be a guide to effective public policy implementation and provide recommendation and clear analysis of the municipal activities which can help improve the current state of affairs at O. R Tambo District Municipality. This thesis therefore looks at the challenges that are faced by the Section 57 employees (i. e. Municipal manager, directors and assistant directors) in the implementation of Performance Management System within the O. R. Tambo District Municipality. It uses qualitative research methods to assess patterns of PMS in ORTDM. This enquiry produces descriptive data, based on the written and spoken words of the interviewees. This method allows the researcher to see the world from participant‟s point of view. This thesis begins by introducing the subject of Performance Management, giving the historical background of performance management, as well as the current state of O. R. Tambo District. The introduction of the topic is followed by a theoretical overview of the subject of performance management. This is followed by the research methodology used in this study. The findings are presented in the chapter following the research methodology chapter, giving a synopsis of what the interviewees disclosed during the interview process. The last chapter provides conclusions and recommendations on how do the municipality ensure that performance management is effectively implemented and it has desired outcomes...|$|E
40|$|So-called sin {{industries}} are often related to harmfulness, unethical business, and <b>unproductiveness.</b> Nowadays, the alcohol, gambling, and tobacco {{industries are}} most often considered {{to be part of}} sin industries, which is also the context of this study. However, the definition of a sin industry is always related to time and culture. Despite the controversies of sin industries, there are studies that have shown that corporate social responsibility (CSR) engagement is even more important for sin industries than for normal industries and that CSR has a positive effect on firm value in sin industries. With CSR this study refers to an ideology where company takes mostly voluntary actions towards various groups of stakeholders and the environment. In other words, the company goes beyond the legal norms and regulations. In particular, the purpose of this thesis is to find out how companies, operating in the online gambling industry, communicate about their CSR actions to consumers at their web pages. The online environment is essential for this study as online gambling environment is a source of many controversies in comparison to the traditional gambling halls and casinos. These include, for example, greater accessibility, anonymity, and availability of the service. This study uses qualitative textual analysis as its approach, more precisely the discourse analysis. In addition, as this study focuses on large international companies and their actions, also case study approach will be presented. The cases studied are Mybet, Unibet, and Bwin. Party. In order to study the subject, elements from discourse analysis are combined with insights of essential CSR theories, and the specific characteristics of the online gambling industry. As a background for the framework, this study uses the framework of Du & Vieira (2012). After analyzing the discourses of CSR communication and CSR practices, it seems that all of the case companies still do not use all the potential that the online environment provides in terms of CSR or stakeholder communication. There are large differences between different communication tools used at different web pages (gambling pages vs. corporation pages) and between the firms’ CSR profiles. Moreover, there are large differences in the CSR practices used in the web pages of the case companies. The findings of this study are partially alarming as the case companies represent the largest companies in the industry. There are major varieties between the companies’ CSR communication and clear shortcomings {{in some parts of the}} online communication. Moreover, the trust of the consumer was broken in some places. If this is the standard that the biggest players in the industry have set with regards to CSR communication, it is probable that the smaller players are performing even worse. Moreover, the regulators are most likely concentrating on the larger companies, so the smaller companies might have fewer incentives and pressure to perform according to the regulations or exceeding the legislation. The conclusions of this thesis provide insights to managers, regulators, and scholars. Suggestions for future studies are provided as well...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we define}} and discuss an artistic {{phenomenon}} {{related to the}} themes of urban form and architectural form; we describe the object (its final product, the work of art) of this particular phenomenon as having para-architectural features and propose to discuss the genealogy of this object-problem {{in the period of}} modernism and contemporary art. We also try to demonstrate that the practice behind the object in discussion, the practice that constructs and permeates the artistic condition of this object, is cross-representational: it is, we argue, a process of approximation, a neighboring effort towards the urban phenomenon produced by industrial and post-industrial societies. We studied and reflected upon an assorted group of objects that included: 1) the paramount of constructivist culture: the sotsgorod (socialist city) and its new way of life based on social condensers, the agit-prop of everyday routines, (the new beyt), American efficiency {{and the power of the}} Soviets; 2) the non-stop camping of libertarian and ludens engagement designed by Constant Niuwenhuis, a performative example of Henri Lefebvre concept of spaces of representation; 3) baudelairian poetics, its sense of life as a struggle between survival and <b>unproductiveness,</b> of urban space as simultaneously foreign and familiar; 4) the concept of unheimlich seen by surrealist artists (Paul Aragon, Max Ernst, André Breton, Georges Bataille) as a turning movement of the inner self developed through symbolic stimulus and where urban and architectonic space acquire a magnetism of belonging and disbelief; 5) the Hannoverian Merzbau as a primal editing site where one can perceive the Being as an environment, post-war german cultural and social predicaments in action, the modernist novelization of historical, patriarchic and sexual subjects; 6) the ruinments of the expressionist space subtractor and minimalist improviser called Gordon Matta-Clark; 7) the images of interference developed by Victor Burgin; 8) the contemporary works of Portuguese artists Angela Ferreira and Pedro Cabrita Reis. And due to that research we came to the following conclusion: The artistic field questions the space, its appropriation and transformation, through two chief approaches: i) taking space as an abstract entity, a trope of geometry, a figure-ground relation, but in fact mediating it through western aesthetics, class differentiation, serialization, property laws and bureaucracy. Or, instead: ii) assuming it as an anthropological and non-productive construction where metaphorical processes, poetic and visual analogies have their social and cultural income. For this matter the city (as a reality of routines and a positional and ideological mechanism) became the most audible content worked out by artistic modernity; we observe also that this same modernity explored in a productive sense the ambiguities and dialectics of the twofold house/home, i. e., it explored the synergies and pains of constructing an individual identity in a space of intimacy as well as the ups and downs of the aesthetic encapsulation of that process of subjectivity: the building as a nurturer of aesthetics and isolation.
