5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are <b>unlikely</b> to occur. The only {{reported}} hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata has resulted in germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely <b>unlikely</b> because the two species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|Date seed oil, {{extracted}} from date pits. Its low extraction rate {{and lack of}} other distinguishing characteristics make it an <b>unlikely</b> candidate for major use.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting The <b>Unlikely</b> Alliance (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, and Samoa Joe) against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko). The match {{duration}} was twelve minutes and twenty-nine seconds. Angle {{was forced to}} sit out of the match for five minutes, giving The <b>Unlikely</b> Alliance the three on two advantage.

5|$|A few historians {{believe that}} he later {{undertook}} a secret marriage to Elżbieta Szydłowska. However, according to Wirydianna Fiszerowa, a contemporary who knew them both, this rumour only spread {{after the death of}} Poniatowski, was generally disbelieved, and moreover, was circulated by Elżbieta herself, so the marriage is considered by most to be <b>unlikely.</b>|$|E

5|$|A new {{paper on}} the cranio-dental {{morphology}} of Allosaurus and how it worked has deemed the hatchet jaw attack <b>unlikely,</b> reinterpreting the unusually wide gape as an adaptation to allow Allosaurus to deliver a muscle-driven bite to large prey, with the weaker jaw muscles being a trade-off {{to allow for the}} widened gape.|$|E
5|$|Acute pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease is highly <b>unlikely</b> when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic sepsis (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} four Tests, Australia led the series 3–0, having won all but the Third Test, which was rain-affected. They had taken an <b>unlikely</b> win in the Fourth Test at Headingley, scoring 404/3 in their second innings, the highest ever score in a {{successful}} Test runchase.|$|E
5000|$|From Elizabeth Weitzman of The New York Daily News: It's both a {{compliment}} and a criticism {{to say that}} Michèle Ohayon's scrappy documentary ends much too quickly.

5|$|Also in the 1920s, Victor Moritz Goldschmidt {{and later}} Linus Pauling {{developed}} rules for eliminating chemically <b>unlikely</b> structures and {{for determining the}} relative sizes of atoms.

5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their relationship is unknown. It is <b>unlikely</b> that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E
