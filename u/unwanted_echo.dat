As a first step, hands-free communication is already supported in car telephony, desktop audio- and videoconferencing, and multimedia computers, where it provides extra convenience and/or safety. However, with increasing distance between the microphone and the local source, the signal-to-noise ratio of the microphone signal decreases and reverberation becomes increasingly objectionable. Here, microphone arrays (MAs) offer an extra directivity gain growing along the number of sensors, and digital array processing of the microphone signals allows time-variant control of spatial and spectral selectivity [3, 6].

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 In recent years, {{high speed}} data {{communications}} over twisted pair cables has gained tremendous demand. Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) was standardized for use over twisted pair cables.

Recently, there has been a great concern that the echo signal displays wide variations when the twisted pair cable is shared with a telephone. The amount of echo signal present in the receiver will directly influence the ADSL system performance. Hence, high performance echo canceller with good tracking capability is required. In this thesis, a new adaptation scheme called Modified Conjugate Gradient method is proposed and applied to ADSL echo canceller.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Echo {{cancellation}} is {{a common}} occurrence in telecommunication systems. For echo cancellation we use digital filter, it is Adaptive FIR filters are a class of filters that iteratively alter their parameters {{in order to minimize}} a function of the difference between a desired target output and their output. In the case of Echo in telecommunications, the optimal output is an echoed signal that accurately emulates the <b>unwanted</b> <b>echo</b> signal. This is then used to negate the echo in the return signal. This paper illustrates the ability of the RLS algorithms to extract useful information from a noisy signal. The information bearing signal is a sine wave that is corrupted by additive white gaussian noise. The adaptive noise cancellation system assumes the use of two microphones. A primary microphone picks up the noisy input signal, while a secondary microphone receives noise that is uncorrelated to the information bearing signal, but is correlated to the noise picked up by the primary microphone. The RLS algorithm was simulated using Matlab. This algorithm proved to be very effective and the error estimation signal is very small and the average of the MSE becomes to zero...|$|E

40|$|MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding) {{is a low}} frequency, pulse-limited radar sounder and {{altimeter}} {{selected by}} ESA as a payload of the Mars Express mission. Synthetic aperture technique is required to reduce the wide ground footprint (due to the low operating frequency and the small allowable antenna dimensions) and, thus, the <b>unwanted</b> <b>echo</b> from other surface objects. MARSIS primary objective is to detect, map and characterize subsurface material discontinuities in the upper crust of Mars. These may include boundaries of liquid water-bearing zones, icy layers and geologic structures. Past studies have shown polar caps stratifications, in terms of depth structure and composition, ground ice abundance and seasonal variations (thickness of seasonal deposits, thermal effects). MARSIS is the first instrument able to detect what lies {{beneath the surface of}} Mars. MARSIS operates with a very high fractional bandwidth: 1 MHz bandwidth allows a vertical resolution of 150 m in free space which corresponds to a lower resolution in the subsurface, depending on the electromagnetic wave propagation speed in the crust. The centre frequency of the pulses transmitted by MARSIS can be set to 1. 8 MHz, 3 MHz, 4 MHz and 5 MHz. On day side operations, it operates only in 4 MHz and 5 MHz due to the ionosphere plasma frequencies of Mars that reflects all the frequencies lower than 4 MHz. All the four carrier frequencies are available for subsurface sounding on night side. This paper propose {{a modified version of the}} well known stepped frequency processing to improve the vertical resolution of MARSIS in order to allow the detection of thinner interfaces that could not be discriminated by the present processing because of its coarse vertical resolution. In fact, range resolution in SAR images is inversely proportional to the transmitted signal bandwidth. Since there is a limit in the transmitted bandwidth that can be supported by the radar hardware, there is a limit in range resolution that can be achieved by processing the SAR data in conventional way. However, if the frequency band of the received signal is widened with a group of sub-pulses, close in frequency (e. g. 3 Mhz and 4 MHz), and properly combined, the composite signal increases the bandwidth and hence the improvement in range resolution can be achieved. The algorithm proposed modifies the standard stepped frequency processing introducing ionosphere effects compensation necessary for a correct data processing. Thanks to improved data set it will be possible to have either a deeper knowledge of the subsurface stratifications as well as additional information about the nature of the volume scattering useful in the data inversion process (estimation of the materials composing the surface and the subsurface by the estimation of the dielectric constants) ...|$|E

30|$|Thus, it {{is clear}} that the {{reduction}} and/or the control of the number of false alarms, which waste hardware resources, is of primary concern in radar signal processing. The main sources generating false targets are clutter (<b>unwanted</b> <b>echoes</b> from the environment), thermal noise, and intentional interferences also known as electronic countermeasures (ECM) (coherent and/or noise-like jammers). In this respect, several contributions presented here are aimed at mitigating the effects of these interfering signals [6 – 11]. Some of these describe algorithms which clean acquired data from intentional interference components and feed the following detection algorithms, whereas other papers devise detection algorithms providing the so-called constant false alarm rate (CFAR) property with respect to the clutter and thermal noise [9, 12]. The former techniques are classified as electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) (see also [13 – 17]). Further contributions deal with distributed systems (bistatic, multistatic, or sensor networks) [10, 12], which, due to the additional number of degrees of freedom, are more effective against the deleterious effects due to false alarms, stealth targets, shadowing, multipath, and intentional or unintentional interference. Finally, waveform design and compressive sensing techniques applied to MIMO radars [18 – 20] and signal reconstruction techniques [21 – 23] are also considered here.|$|R
40|$|When Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUTs) are {{coupled with}} water, they show high front-face {{acoustic}} reflectivity, {{due to the}} impedance mismatch between the transducer substrate material, typically based on silicon, and the propagation medium. During pulse-echo operation, surface reflectivity is responsible for multiple reflections of the received acoustic signals, which result {{in a set of}} <b>unwanted</b> <b>echoes.</b> In ultrasound imaging applications, this signal reverberation creates artifacts and reduces the image contrast. In this paper, a method to reduce front-face reflectivity is proposed, and a Reverberation Level (RL) index is introduced in order to quantify the unwanted reverberation of the signal returned to the transducer surface. The proposed method combines the increase of the bias voltage, the application of an optimized resistive load and the addition of a low-impedance acoustic backing to CMUTs realized by Reverse Fabrication Process (RFP). In this way, the mechanical energy conversion and transmission to the backing, as well as the electrical energy dissipation, are improved, thus reducing the energy reflection into the medium. The proposed method is analyzed by means of Finite Element simulations and is experimentally validated by characterizing single-element RFP-CMUTs, provided with different backing materials and electrical loads.

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{interferences}} for the pulsed radar system is the arrival of <b>unwanted</b> <b>echoes</b> after the transmission of a new pulse. The range ambiguity then appears if the current transmitted pulse does {{not contribute to the}} back-scattered signal received after the transmission of this pulse. These late arrival echoes can appear when there are strong reflectors located after the maximum range detected by the radar system, namely ambiguity range. These kinds of echoes induce shadows in the image, which can be misinterpreted. Removal of this kind of ambiguities is an important matter for SAR images. The fundamental and theoretical analysis on ambiguities have been already achieved [2]. The ambiguity treatment remains an important issue as the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) raises, whereas reasonable swath widths are required [4]. The use of a low PRF makes possible to mitigate range ambiguities but induces Doppler ambiguities degrading the azimuth resolution. To solve this trade-off, several ambiguity suppression techniques are proposed. For example, the use of alternating up and down chirp modulation is often presented [5]. Another technique is based on the azimuth phase coding to reduce the ambiguities [6]. Pulse block coding technique also makes possible to detect false targets due to the range ambiguity through matched filtering operations [7]. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals are also proposed to reduce the cross-correlation between each transmitted pulse [8]. Moreover, these OFDM signals are designed to optimize the imaging quality parameters using genetic algorithms [9, 10].|$|R

For that we have measured the electron spin dephasing time T m at different temperatures with the two-pulse primary echo and with the special Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill (CPMG) multiple microwave pulse sequence. Application of the CPMG protocol {{has led to a}} substantial increase of the spin coherence lifetime in both complexes as compared to the primary echo results. It shows the efficiency of the suppression of the electron spin decoherence channel in the studied complexes arising due to spectral diffusion induced by a random modulation of the hyperfine interaction with the nuclear spins. We argue that this method {{can be used as a}} test for the relevance of the spectral diffusion for the electron spin decoherence. Our results have revealed a prominent role of the opba 4 – and opbo n -Pr 2 4 – ligands for the dephasing of the Cu spins.

40|$|The {{end of the}} Cold War and the {{collapse}} of the Warsaw pact have resulted in a change of operational theatre for the naval forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In particular, the focus of Anti Submarine Warfare forces has shifted from tracking Soviet nuclear ballistic missile submarine in the deep waters of the Atlantic ocean to hunting smaller and quieter Diesel electric submarines in coastal water. In most scenarios, towed array sonars are the best sensor to detect, classify and localise submarines. The long passive towed array sonars used during the Cold war are more difficult to use in coastal waters and are being replaced by most Navies by Low Frequency Active Sonars (LFAS) using a towed source and shorter towed receiving array. These shorter towed arrays can be used in both active and passive modes. In passive mode, their reduced size offer limited performance compared to their longer equivalent. In active mode, they can detect submarines at long ranges in shallow waters but are plagued by false alarms caused by echoes from features of the seafloor. This thesis deals with algorithms improving Detection, Classification and Localisation for towed sonar arrays, with a specific focus on LFAS sonars. In Chapter 2, we derive, analyse and apply to measured data a method for improving detection performance with short passive towed arrays. An important issue in detection of quiet acoustic source with short towed arrays is the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and bearing resolution for targets emitting low frequency signals. One of the techniques believed to improve these characteristics is Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS). The method is based on the artificial enlargement of a sonar array by coherently integrating acoustic snapshots at different antenna positions. We first derive theoretical measures of performance of passive SAS and report on its application in combination with other signal-processing algorithms. Its theoretical performance is compared with that of the frequently used incoherent integration. The used passive SAS algorithm is the method known as Extended Towed Array Measurement (ETAM) or the overlap correlator. It is based on the correlation of data snapshots on overlapping hydrophones. Correlation is a key issue in this method and since it is affected by noisy targets, some gain can be expected from noise cancellation. The influence on the performance of ETAM of a method of tow ship noise cancelling at hydrophone level (Inverse Beam Forming, IBF) is analysed. This approach increases ETAM performance by removing a loud and highly correlated noise source, the tow ship, and thus enhancing the other targets in the beam pattern. The results of the algorithms applied to two experimental datasets show that they bring an improvement close to theoretical expectations. Port starboard discrimination and the successful combination of IBF with ETAM make this approach innovative. In Chapter 3, methods for improving the localisation of a source with a short towed array are analysed and applied to data, both simulated and measured at sea. Localisation performance with sonar towed array is related to the array length. The knowledge of the position of a given acoustic source gives a critical tactical advantage to a ship. There are a limited number of ways to estimate the range of a source with a towed passive sonar, most requiring the towing platform to execute a manoeuvre. These manoeuvres are undesirable as they take a lot of time, cause bending of the towed array and can even put the towing platform in harm’s way. We present a number of source position estimation methods for both broadband and narrowband sources suitable for short towed arrays. Recursive methods based on the extended Kalman filter are first examined. A new method based on the integration of time delay of arrival measurements along the sonar path is described. We derive theoretical performance indicators and show that this method gives the possibility to estimate the position and speed of a source without a manoeuvre. In Chapter 4, the Classification performance of a broadband waveform is analysed and measured on data collected at sea. Like any long-range active sonar system, LFAS produces a large amount of <b>unwanted</b> sea bottom <b>echoes</b> or clutter. These echoes give rise to false alarms that increase the computational load of target trackers and jeopardise the correct classification of each echo. The number of false alarms due to clutter can be reduced either through echo classification techniques or through Doppler filtering provided the targets of interest are in motion. Much research has been carried out on waveform investigation for the efficient use of bandwidth capabilities of modern sonar transmitters. Among the quantity of waveforms, Binary Phase Shift Keyed (BPSK) pulses have emerged as exhibiting cross-correlation properties relevant to Doppler filtering while maintaining a range resolution comparable to Frequency Modulated (FM) pulses. We have successfully applied a false alarm reduction technique using contacts obtained with an FM pulse subsequently processed by Doppler filtering with a BPSK pulse. The Doppler classification performance for this pulse is evaluated on an experimental dataset and a few limitations of BPSK are identified.
