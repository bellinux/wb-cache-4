He remarks that gynecology has been very enjoyable for him and that he has straightened <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> since leaving Faber. An attractive, blonde patient in her underwear then tells Otter she's ready for her examination. Otter politely cuts the interview off and goes into the exam room.|$|E
5|$|When Carey {{tries to}} open <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more, her sentiments are the {{equivalent}} of a Hallmark Precious Moments figurine. In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully pulls off the universality of the lyrics, and the tune will likely be a massive hit.|$|E

500|$|The {{comic strip}} was resurrected in July 1997, printed as short (usually two-page) {{features}} in the BBC's monthly Match of the Day magazine. These strips ran until the magazine's demise in May 2001. By then the strip's wholesome tone, often espousing the virtues of fair play and strong moral character, was beginning to seem old-fashioned. The editor of Roy of the Rovers comic, Barrie Tomlinson, has commented that [...] "everyone seemed to be growing <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more quickly, and they wanted stories that were more realistic".|$|E

As of December 2011, Kapadia is set to appear in her third non-Hindi and first Malayalam-language film, Bombay Mittayi, for which she started learning the language. She plays the wife of a celebrated Ghazal singer, played by Amar Singh, on whose behest she was offered the part. Her starring film What the Fish was released on 13 December 2013.|$|E

500|$|In a mixed review, Nick Catucci of The Village Voice {{felt that}} Furtado [...] "sauces <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> too luridly" [...] and lacks [...] "chemistry" [...] with Timbaland, writing that Loose [...] "isn't a love child, but a bump-and-grind that never finds a groove". Vibe [...] stated, [...] "she loses herself in Gwen Stefani–like posturing, as on “Glow,” and ethnic fusions like “No Hay Igual” or “Te Busqué." [...] In his {{consumer}} guide for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "B" [...] and named it [...] "dud of the month", indicating [...] "a bad record whose details rarely merit further thought." [...] Christgau viewed that its dance-oriented tracks [...] "might accomplish God's great plan on the dance-floor. But as songs they're not much".|$|E

After {{in the words of}} Deal, [...] "working it <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> in Joe's [...] Pro Tools thing," [...] "Bam Thwok" [...] was recorded in a DreamWorks-funded demo session. The band travelled to Stagg Street Studios, a studio in Los Angeles, California, to record the song with engineer Ben Mumphrey. Francis later said the recording session [...] "was very relaxed, a nice way to break the ice," [...] and admitted that [...] "it didn't feel like twelve years had passed." [...] The song was mixed by Mumphrey at Sound City Studios in late March.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} originally appeared for two episodes on 2 and 3 August2007, {{and then}} returned for four episodes between 7 and 11 January2008. Franks was asked to return again later in 2008 but could not make it, so Franks thought Rainie would not be seen again. She returned for the longer stint in 2010, starting on 3August. Franks {{did not expect to}} be asked to return in 2010, and said the call came as a surprise. She said it was [...] "ideal" [...] because it fitted in with another acting job she was undertaking at the time. She commented that Rainie would be [...] "unlikely to return without stirring <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of trouble". Rainie returned again on 12April2011 as a regular character, for Tanya's wedding to Greg Jessop, along with Tanya and Rainie's mother Cora, where Cora tries to build bridges between the sisters.|$|E
500|$|After the Pixies {{broke up}} in 1993, Santiago {{had stayed in}} touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later explained: [...] "He called me on my {{cellphone}} and I was in Cape Cod visiting family. He said in this coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, I wonder who started it?' I go, 'Charles, did you do that?' and he goes, 'Yeah.'" [...] Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and {{by the summer of}} 2004 the band had reunited. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, [...] "worked it <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> in Joey's Pro Tools thing", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E

Badler admitted that filming her first scenes were hard and she [...] "could not get it together". She said [...] "I noticed {{a few of the}} other new people. They all went through the same thing, where you have a day where you just go, 'Wow, I can't seem to function!'". Badler also said that occasionally there were no rehearsals and that it was [...] "very daunting" [...] and challenging. She added that the cast were [...] "really nice" [...] and that she got used to the quick pace of filming. Badler's debut episode aired on 22 June 2010. When Badler was asked if the door would be left open for Diana to return, she said [...] "Oh yes, absolutely.

500|$|The group {{employed}} Brian Eno and his assisting partner Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis—both of whom {{worked on}} Achtung Baby—to produce the sessions; long-time Eno collaborator Daniel Lanois was busy promoting his solo album and was unavailable. Similar to the Achtung Baby sessions, Eno worked two-week shifts. The group often gave him in-progress songs to adjust {{and to which}} he could add his own personality. Initially, the band {{did not have a}} clear plan for how they would release the material being written. At the time, Clayton said, [...] "I don't know if what we're doing here is the next U2 album or a bunch of rough sketches that in two years will turn into the demos for the next U2 album." [...] The Edge was a proponent of making an EP of new material to promote the upcoming leg of the tour, describing his mentality as thus: [...] "We've got a bit of time off. We've got some ideas hanging around from the last record, let's do an EP, maybe four new songs to spice the next phase of the tour <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit.</b> It'll be a fan thing. It'll be cool." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the game}} had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark {{received}} many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton {{explained that they}} [...] "wanted {{to bring her back}} in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> and make her more iconic." [...] However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, {{which was one of the}} first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, [...] "It was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don't get normally. We think we pulled it off, and because we pulled it off, other people might feel inspired to put the effort in, and we think that's a good thing." ...|$|E
