The structure required to study expected measure is both more and less restrictive than that used traditionally to study accuracy: The set of possible parameter values must be a measurable space, and the confidence sets must be measurable subsets of the set of parameters, but confidence sets with minimax expected measure can exist even when there is no <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> confidence set.

40|$|We {{begin with}} a decision-theoretic {{investigation}} into confidence sets that minimize expected volume at a given parameter value. Such sets are constructed by inverting a family of uniformly most powerful tests, and hence they also enjoy the optimality property of being <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate.</b> In addition, these sets possess Bayesian optimal volume properties and represent the first case (to our knowledge) of a frequentist 1 – α confidence set that possesses a Bayesian optimality property.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on the {{quantification}} of sampling variation in frequentist probabilistic forecasts. We propose a method of constructing confidence sets that respects the functional nature of the forecast distribution, and use animated graphics to visualize the impact of parameter uncertainty on the location, dispersion and shape of the distribution. The confidence sets are derived via the inversion of a Wald test and are asymptotically <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> and, hence, optimal in this sense. A wide range of linear and non-linear time series models - encompassing long memory, state space and mixture specifications - is used to demonstrate the procedure, based on artificially generated data. An empirical example in which distributional forecasts of both financial returns and its stochastic volatility are produced is then used to illustrate the practical importance of accommodating sampling variation in the manner proposed.

40|$|For {{a series}} system with {{exponentially}} distributed survival times for independent sub-systems, there exist optimum <b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> unbiased exact confidence bounds on {{the probability of}} system survival until a specified time; see Lentner & Buehler (1963) and the doctoral dissertation of A. H. El Mawaziny. Calculation of these optimum exact confidence bounds, however, must be performed iteratively {{by means of a}} high-speed com-puter. Moreover, their calculation can be extremely expensive in terms of computer time, and in certain cases there are serious problems of loss of precision as the number of sub-systems increases. An approximation is derived which can, if necessary, be evaluated by hand and which agrees with the optimum lower confidence bound on the probability of system survival to within about a unit in the second decimal place in the many and varied cases examined. Numerical examples are given and comparisons made with other approxi-mate confidence bounds.

40|$|If a known {{transformation}} of a random variable X is normally distributed with mean {mu} and variance {sigma}{sup 2 }, then the mean, variance, {{and any other}} distributional property of X can be {{expressed in terms of}} {mu} and {sigma}{sup 2 }. For example, if X is lognormally distributed, i. e., X {approx} {Lambda}({mu}, {sigma}{sup 2 }) or (equivalently) Y = log(X) {approx} N({mu}, {sigma}{sup 2 }), then the expected value, variance, median, and mode of X are, respectively, E(X) = exp({mu} + {sigma}{sup 2 }/ 2), var (X) = exp(2 {mu} + {sigma}{sup 2 }) (exp({sigma}{sup 2 }) - 1), med(X) = exp({mu}), and mode(X) = exp({mu} - {sigma}{sup 2 }). Exact and optimal (<b>uniformly</b> <b>most</b> <b>accurate</b> unbiased) confidence limit procedures have been developed for linear functions of {mu} and {sigma}{sup 2 } (Land, 1971, 1973) and, therefore, because confidence limits for a parameter are invariant under smooth, monotone transformations of that parameter, for the mean and mode of a lognormal distribution. In fact, the lognormal distribution is the only one whose mean can be expressed as a function of a non-trivial linear combination of {mu} and {sigma}{sup 2 } (Land, 1971), but other functions, including those arising in connection with other normalizing transformations, can be approximated locally by linear functions for which exact limits can be constructed that define approximate limits for the original parametric functions of interest (Land, 1974, 1988). Tables have been published to facilitate the calculation of confidence limits for arbitrary linear functions of {mu} and {sigma}{sup 2 } (Land, 1975), but their use is often tedious, requiring repeated interpolation and calculation. An unpublished Fortran program to compute confidence limits directly from sample estimates of p and u 2 has been available from the second author, and has been used by a number of investigators to analyze lognormal data sets. The present paper introduces a more efficient computational algorithm, and documents the program for prospective users. An option has been added which makes it easy for the user to generate tables of confidence limits. Finally, the accuracy of the program has been thoroughly evaluated in terms of coverage probabilities {{for a wide range of}} parameter values...|$|E
