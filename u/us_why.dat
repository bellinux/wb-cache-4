The two wrote that [...] "the episode sings when it reinvents the old and {{introduces}} the new." [...] However, Shearman and Pearson criticized the bringing back of Gibson Praise, noting that [...] "the return of Gibson Praise almost derails the episode altogether [...] he only manages to make an episode that seemed {{as if it was}} giving The X-Files a bold new beginning feel like it's about to offer more of the same old stooge." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a moderately positive review of the episode. He noted, [...] "In many ways, 'Within' reminded <b>us</b> <b>why</b> we tune into The X-Files every week. However, it also reminded <b>us</b> <b>why</b> the road ahead will be difficult.

500|$|The final {{blame for}} the {{military}} stalemate was determined to lie not in military preparation, supplies, leadership, or superior tactics by the Seminoles, but in Florida's impenetrable terrain. An army surgeon wrote: [...] "It {{is in fact a}} most hideous region to live in, a perfect paradise for Indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, and every other kind of loathsome reptile." [...] The land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of wonder or hatred. In 1870, an author described the mangrove forests as a [...] "waste of nature's grandest exhibition to have these carnivals of splendid vegetation occurring in isolated places where it is but seldom they are seen." [...] A band of hunters, naturalists, and collectors ventured through in 1885, taking along with them the 17-year-old grandson of an early resident of Miami.

DeWine also tried to depict McEwen as a carpetbagger, asking in television advertisements [...] "If Bob McEwen really cares about <b>us,</b> <b>why</b> has he spent the last twelve years living in Virginia?" [...] McEwen denied he had bounced any checks, repeating what he had claimed in 1992 and insisted that he had continued to reside in Ohio since he lost his re-election bid, noting he had never voted in Virginia nor held a Virginia drivers license. (McEwen did not live in the second district until April 11, when he bought a condominium in Anderson Township; but DeWine did not live in the district until he bought a home there on April 6.) DeWine quoted correspondence from the Highland County Board of Elections claiming the Board had cancelled McEwen's voter registration for living in Virginia.|$|E

500|$|Giving {{the album}} {{a rating of}} three-out-of-five-stars, Rob Sheffield wrote for Rolling Stone that the album [...] "has a rushed feel – a likable but low-personality version of her {{familiar}} bubble-pop solo mode". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found the album [...] "a bit of mess" [...] since [...] "there's {{a lot of ground}} for her to cover". He also noted that, [...] "By pursuing the twin inclinations to spill her heart while pushing musically forward, Stefani often mangles the mood." [...] However, Erlewine noted that despite the [...] "moments of emotional bloodletting or thirsty appeals {{to the top of the}} charts," [...] the album [...] "manages to be as fleet, giddy, and charming as Gwen Stefani ever is". Patrick Ryan of USA Today felt that [...] "espite the album title and Stefani's refreshingly candid press tour, it's sometimes hard to believe this is what her truth actually sounds like. But even if she's not being totally honest here, it's still more so than many of her pop peers." [...] Jillian Mapes of Pitchfork Media criticized the songs she perceived were tailor-made for Top 40 radio, calling them [...] "unremarkable" [...] saying they [...] "fail to match the unique specificity of her early solo hits". But she praised [...] "the ones in which she is audibly upset—sometimes pissed off, sometimes sad, but best-case scenario, both. [...] t's the fleeting moments like this—where she reminds <b>us</b> <b>why</b> we used to love her—that redeem 'This Is What the Truth Feels Like'." [...] In a mixed review, Theon Weber of Spin commented, [...] "n creating a schism between her punkish pep and her new-wave nostalgia, it leaves the former stranded and the latter generic." [...] Kate Hutchinson of The Guardian gave the album a rating of 2 out of 5 stars feeling the album to be [...] "calculated" [...] and a [...] "little more than careerist chart fodder".|$|E
500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot rarely does. It reminds <b>us</b> <b>why</b> we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isn’t just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we are and where we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966–69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E
