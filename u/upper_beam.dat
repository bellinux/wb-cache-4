50|$|The antenna {{used on the}} ASR-9 was a {{state of}} the art horned shaped {{reflector}} that forms two cosecant-squared beams to allow high elevation gain, as well as coverage up to forty-two degrees in elevation coverage. The two beams that pulse from the ASR-9 are nearly identical; however, a minimal displacement in height between the two beams causes a coverage change of approximately four degrees elevation. The <b>upper</b> <b>beam</b> on the ASR-9 is used primarily for short range reception, while the lower beam was mainly used for transmitting as well as long range reception. A combination of beam displacement, as well as a sharp underside cut off,  gave the ASR-9 a technological advantage when compared to previously installed ASR systems; the radar systems before the ASR-9 {{had not been able to}} reject ground clutter when transmitting with the <b>upper</b> <b>beam.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was a canard configuration monoplane whose structure made {{extensive use of}} a beam design patented by Fabre. This was a Warren truss girder with all members having a streamlined section. Two of these beams, one above the other and connected by three substantial struts, formed the fuselage of the aircraft. The wing, which had pronounced dihedral and whose leading edge was formed by an exposed Fabre beam, was mounted below {{the rear of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>beam,</b> and the Gnome Omega rotary engine driving a two-bladed pusher Chauvière propeller was mounted behind it. Additional bracing for the wings was provided by kingposts extending down from the leading edge at mid-span. There were two small foreplanes, which, like the wing, had exposed Fabre beams forming their leading edges, one mounted above the <b>upper</b> <b>beam</b> and the second on the strut connecting the two beams. A rectangular rear-mounted rudder was situated above the wing: below the wing there was a similar rectangular fixed surface extending down to the lower fuselage beam.
