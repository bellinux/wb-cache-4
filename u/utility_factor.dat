40|$|Abstract: The need {{to develop}} a {{decision}} support system to determine the most appropriate procurement route for a building project {{led to the development of}} various theoretical models. One of the foremost techniques was the multi-attribute utility approach (MAUA). In this technique, the arithmetic mean (averaging) method was used to fix the <b>utility</b> <b>factors</b> relating the procurement routes to each criterion. In this paper, the averaging method was subjected to further analysis using the outranking-satisfying technique to determine the correctness of the results derived from the averaging method used to fix the <b>utility</b> <b>factors</b> in the use of MAUA. The results showed that there is a significant difference between the rank-order of procurement methods against selection criteria by averaging and outranking-satisfying techniques.

40|$|The {{construction}} and repair of highways are becoming {{very important in}} these days of crumbling infrastructure. Costs for these projects have continued to increase. In order for contractors to stay competitive, it is essential that their construction operations be as productive as possible. Money for research usually does not exist for the average contractor. An inexpensive solution for production studies is process simulation, which can help improve the productivity of construction operations. This paper focuses on the paving cycle of a highway resurfacing project, using MicroCyclone simulation software. The process modelling using MicroCyclone is applied readily to any construction cyclic process, and aids the engineer in determining the most economical and efficient way to plan resources for processes. Different production parameters are measured and translated to a <b>utility</b> <b>factor</b> that indicates the performance of the system.
