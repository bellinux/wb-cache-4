25|$|A {{financial}} derivative is {{a financial}} instrument whose value {{is derived from}} a commodity termed an <b>underlier.</b> Derivatives are either exchange-traded or over-the-counter (OTC). An increasing number of derivatives are traded via clearing houses some with Central Counterparty Clearing, which provide clearing and settlement services on a futures exchange, as well as off-exchange in the OTC market.|$|E

However, when the change {{in the value of the}} <b>underlier</b> is not small, the second-order term, , cannot be ignored: see Convexity (finance).|$|E

50|$|Pin risk {{occurs when}} the market price of the <b>underlier</b> of an option {{contract}} {{at the time of}} the contract's expiration is close to the option's strike price. In this situation, the <b>underlier</b> is said to have pinned. The risk to the writer (seller) of the option is that they cannot predict with certainty whether the option will be exercised or not. So the writer cannot hedge his position precisely and may end up with a loss or gain. There is a chance that the price of the <b>underlier</b> may move adversely, resulting in an unanticipated loss to the writer. In other words, an option position may result in a large, undesired risky position in the <b>underlier</b> immediately after expiration, regardless of the actions of the writer.|$|E
50|$|Sellers of option {{contracts}} often hedge {{them to create}} delta neutral portfolios. The objective is to minimize risk due to {{the movement of the}} underlier's price, while implementing whatever strategy led to the sale of the options in the first place. For instance, a seller of a call may hedge by buying just enough of the <b>underlier</b> to create a delta neutral portfolio. As time passes, the option seller adjusts his hedge position by buying or selling some quantity of the <b>underlier</b> to counteract changes in the price of the <b>underlier.</b>|$|E
50|$|On the {{day that}} an option expires—for U.S. {{exchange}} traded equity options this is the Saturday following the third Friday of the month—if an option's <b>underlier</b> is close to pinning, the trader must pay close attention. A small movement of the underlier's price through the strike (e.g. from below the strike price to above, or vice versa) can have a large impact on the trader's net position in the <b>underlier</b> on the trading day after expiration. For instance, if an option goes from being in the money to out of the money, the trader must rapidly trade enough of the <b>underlier</b> so that the position after expiration will be flat.|$|E

50|$|Options market makers, or others, may form a delta neutral {{portfolio}} using related options {{instead of}} the underlying. The portfolio's delta (assuming the same <b>underlier)</b> is then {{the sum of all}} the individual options' deltas. This method can also be used when the <b>underlier</b> is difficult to trade, for instance when an underlying stock is hard to borrow and therefore cannot be sold short.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{one sees}} {{this type of}} {{situation}} often when the short leg is being bid up for a specific reason. For instance, the near option may include an upcoming event, such as an earnings announcement, that will, in all probability, cause the <b>underlier</b> price to move. After the event has passed, the market may expect the <b>underlier</b> to be relatively stable which results in a lower implied volatility for the subsequent period.|$|E
5000|$|Cash {{settlement}} - Cash-settled options do {{not require}} the actual delivery of the <b>underlier.</b> Instead, the market value, at the exercise date, of the <b>underlier</b> is compared to the strike price, and the difference (if in a favourable direction) is paid by the option seller to {{the owner of the}} option. An example of a cash-settled contract is most U.S.-listed exchange-traded index options. This settlement occurs the next business day following the trade.|$|E
5000|$|State prices find {{immediate}} application as {{a conceptual}} tool; {{but can also}} be applied to valuation problems. Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value (true in fact for [...] "every security" [...] ) as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices. These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the <b>underlyer,</b> or for other decision making relating to the <b>underlyer</b> itself. (Breeden and Litzenberger's work in 1978 [...] established the use of state prices in financial economics.) ...|$|R

50|$|However, {{the cost}} to the option buyer of exercising the option is not zero. For instance, the buyer's broker may charge {{transaction}} fees to exercise the option to buy or sell the <b>underlier.</b> If these costs are greater than the amount the option is in the money, the owner of the option may rationally choose not to exercise. Thus, the option seller may end up with an unexpected position in the <b>underlier</b> and thus risk losing value if the underlier's price then moves adversely before the option seller can eliminate this position, perhaps not until the next trading day. The costs of exercise differ from trader to trader, and therefore the option seller {{may not be able to}} predict whether the options will be exercised or not.|$|E
