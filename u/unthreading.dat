40|$|AbstractBackgroundFailure of {{pedicle screw}} {{is a major}} concern in spinal surgery. The {{threaded}} and <b>unthreaded</b> portions of the pedicle screw provide the ability to anchor and squeeze the surrounding bone, respectively. This study aimed to investigate the anchoring and squeezing effects of different design of the threaded/unthreaded portions of a pedicle screw to vertebrae. MethodsFour variations (one fully and three partially threaded, with a 1 / 3, 1 / 2, and 2 / 3 <b>unthreaded</b> designs at the proximal portion) of screws were used to measure pullout strength and withdrawn energy using synthetic and porcine specimens. The tests were conducted in static and dynamic fashions, in that the screws were axially extracted directly and after 150, 000 cycles of lateral bending. The load-displacement curves were recorded to gain insight into the peak load (pullout strength) and cumulative work (withdrawn energy). FindingsThe two testing results of the synthetic and porcine specimens consistently showed that the 1 / 3 <b>unthreaded</b> screw provides significantly higher pullout strength and withdrawn energy than the fully threaded screw. The withdrawn energy of the three <b>unthreaded</b> screws was significantly higher than that of the threaded counterpart. InterpretationThe holding power of a pedicle screw was the integration of the anchoring (cancellous core) and squeezing (compact pedicle) effects within the threaded and <b>unthreaded</b> portions. The current study recommends the 1 / 3 <b>unthreaded</b> screw as an optimal alternative for use as a shank-sliding mechanism to preserve the holding power within the pedicle isthmus...|$|R

Both multi- and single subunit RNA polymerases have evolved an 8 – 10 -base pair RNA-DNA hybrid {{as a part of a}} stably transcribing elongation complex. Through characterization of halted complexes that can readily carry out homopolymeric slippage synthesis, this study reveals that T 7 RNA polymerase elongation complexes containing only a 4 -base pair hybrid can nevertheless be more stable than those with the normal 8 -base pair hybrid. We propose that a key feature of this stability is the topological threading of RNA through the complex and/or around the DNA template strand.

40|$|Binuclear {{ruthenium}} complexes {{that bind}} DNA by threading intercalation {{have recently been}} found to exhibit an exceptional kinetic selectivity for long polymeric adenine?thymine (AT) DNA.

We find that, above a threshold AT tract length corresponding to one helix turn of B-DNA, a dramatic increase in threading intercalation rate occurs. In contrast, such length dependence is not observed for rates of <b>unthreading.</b> Intercalation by any mechanism that depends on the open end of the hairpin was found not to be important in the series of oligonucleotides used, as verified by including in the study a hairpin duplex cyclized by a copper-catalyzed “click” reaction. Our observations are interpreted in terms of a conformational pre-equilibrium, determined by the length of the AT tract. We finally find that mismatches or loops in the oligonucleotide facilitate the threading process, of interest for the development of mismatch-recognizing probes...|$|E
40|$|A new {{synthetic}} {{strategy for}} the preparation of cyclodextrin-based rotaxanes is described. The method is essentially based on the formation of stable inclusion complexes between a-CD and aliphatic chains. The interaction in aqueous media of compounds containing a long alkyl chain terminated in a bulky (ferrocenylmethyl) dimethylammonium group with a-CD leads to inclusion complexes in which the cyclodextrh is threaded by the alkyl chain. Functionalization of the other chain terminus with a wboxylic acid group allows trapping of the chain-threaded CD receptor via amidation reactions of the carboxylic functional group with bulky amines. The rotaxane products are asymmetric since the two terminal groups are different. This feature allows, for the first time, the detection of isomeric rotaxanes exhibiting the two possible orientations of the trapped CD. Rotaxanes are interesting supramolecular structures in which a cyclic component (the so-called bead) is threaded by a linear subunit (ref. 1). In order to prevent dissociation between the cyclic and linear components, the latter bears bulky tenninal groups that act as stoppers for the cyclic bead, sterically preventing its dissociation or <b>unthreading.</b> A schematic representation of a rotaxane is shown below. Formally, the bead is bound to the linear thread and the equilibrium associatio...|$|E

40|$|Hydrophobic {{self-assembly}} {{has been}} used to direct the synthesis of conjugated [2] and [3]rotaxanes (20 and 21) in aqueous solution, by Glaser coupling a water-soluble alkyne 3 {{in the presence of a}} cyclophane 6. No rotaxanes were formed when cyclodextrins were used instead of the cyclophane. NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry were used to probe the binding properties of the stopper unit 3. NMR ring current shifts and NOEs show that the cyclophane 6 binds mainly to the terminal phenylene unit of 3. In solution cyclodextrins bind less strongly than the cyclophane, whereas in the gas-phase cyclodextrins bind more strongly. The water-soluble rotaxanes are fully characterised by electrospray mass spectrometry, NMR and UV-VIS emission/absorption. Both rotaxanes tend to fragment, by <b>unthreading</b> and by dumbbell-cleavage, during electrospray ionisation, particularly at high cone voltages. The insulation of the conjugated dumbbell inside the [3]rotaxane results in increased fluorescence efficiency. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements show that these rotaxanes decompose during photolysis to give products with longer fluorescence lifetimes; the rate of this photodecomposition is slower for the [3]rotaxane than for the naked dumbbell. The extension of this synthetic approach to larger polyrotaxanes was explored by coupling alkyne 3 and diethynylbenzene 2 in the presence of cyclophane 6; this gives some longer [2] and [3]rotaxanes but higher polyrotaxanes are not formed...|$|E
40|$|Microcin J 25 is a 21 {{amino acid}} {{bacterial}} peptide that has potent antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, resulting from its interaction with RNA polymerase. The peptide was previously proposed {{to have a}} head-to-tail cyclized peptide backbone and a tight globular structure (Blond, A., Peduzzi, J., Goulard, C., Chiuchiolo, M. J., Barthelemy, M., Prigent, Y., Salomon, R. A., Farias, R. N., Moreno, F. & Rebuffat, S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999, 259, 747 - 755). It exhibits remarkable thermal stability for a peptide of its size lacking disulfide bonds and in part this was previously proposed to derive from its macrocyclic structure. We show here that in fact the peptide {{does not have a}} head-to-tail cyclic structure but rather a side chain to backbone cyclization between Glu 8 and the N-terminus. This creates an embedded ring that is threaded by the C-terminal tail of the molecule, forming a noose-like feature. The three-dimensional structure deduced from NMR data suggests that slippage of the noose is prevented by two aromatic residues flanking the embedded ring. <b>Unthreading</b> does not occur even when the molecule is enzymatically digested with thermolysin.

40|$|The {{interactions}} between the stereoisomers of the chiral bis-intercalator [mu -C 4 (cpdppz) (2) -(phen) (4) Ru- 2](4 +) and DNA reveal interesting dynamic discrimination properties. The two enantiomers Delta-Delta and Lambda-Lambda both form very strong complexes with calf thymus DNA with similar thermodynamic affinities. By contrast, they display considerable variations in their binding kinetics. The Delta-Delta enantiomer has higher affinity for calf thymus DNA than for [poly(dA-dT) ](2), and the association kinetics of the dimer to DNA, {{as well as to}} polynucleotides, requires a multiexponential fitting function. The dissociation reaction, on the other hand, could be described by a single exponential for [poly(dA-dT) ](2), whereas two exponentials were required for mixed-sequence DNA. To understand the key mechanistic steps of the reaction, the kinetics was studied at varied salt concentration for different choices of DNA and chirality of the threading complex. The enantiomers were found to have markedly different dissociation rates, the Lambda-Lambda enantiomer dissociating about an order of magnitude faster than the Delta-Delta enantiomer. Also. the salt dependence of the dissociation rate constants differed between the enantiomers, being stronger for the Lambda-Lambda enantiomer than for the Delta-Delta enantiomer. Since the dissociation reaction requires <b>unthreading</b> of bulky parts of the bis-intercalator through the DNA helix, a considerable conformational change of the DNA must be involved, possibly defining the rate-limiting step...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{structure}} of a two-chain peptide formed by {{the treatment of the}} potent antimicrobial peptide microcin J 25 (MccJ 25) with thermolysin has been characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The native peptide is 21 amino acids in size and has the remarkable structural feature of a ring formed by linkage of the side chain of Glu 8 to the N-terminus that is threaded by the C-terminal tail of the peptide. Thermolysin cleaves the peptide at the Phe 10 -Val 11 amide bond, but the threading of the C-terminus through the N-terminal ring is so tight that the resultant two chains remain associated both in the solution and in the gas phases. The three-dimensional {{structure of}} the thermolysin-cleaved peptide derived using NMR spectroscopy and simulated annealing calculations has a well-defined core that comprises the N-terminal ring and the threading C-terminal tail. In contrast to the well-defined core, the newly formed termini at residues Phe 10 and Val 11 are disordered in solution. The C-terminal tail is associated to the ring both by hydrogen bonds stabilizing a short beta-sheet and by hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, <b>unthreading</b> of the tail through the ring is prevented by the bulky side chains of Phe 19 and Tyr 20, which flank the octapeptide ring.

40|$|The semirigid binuclear {{ruthenium}} complex Delta,Delta-[mu-(11, 11 -bidppz) (phen) (4) Ru- 2](4 +) {{has been}} shown to rearrange slowly from an initial groove-bound nonluminescent state to a final intercalated emissive state by threading one of its bulky Ru(phen) (2) moieties through the DNA base stack. When this complex binds to poly[d(A-T) (2) ], a further increase in emission from the complex is observed after completion of the intercalation, assigned to reorganization of the intercalated complex. We here report a study of the threading process in poly[d(A-T) (2) ], in which the minor groove binding dye DAPI is used as an energy transfer probe molecule to assess the distribution of ruthenium complex during and also after the actual threading phase. The emission from DAPI is found to change with the same rate as the emission from the ruthenium complex, and furthermore, DAPI does not disturb the binding kinetics of the latter, justifying it as a good probe of both the threading and the reorganization processes. We conclude from the change in the emission from both DAPI and the ruthenium complex with time that DAPI-ruthenium interactions are most pronounced during the process of threading of the complex, suggesting that the complexes are initially threaded slightly anticooperatively and thereafter redistribute along the DNA to reach their thermodynamically most favorable distribution. The final distribution is characterized by a small but significant binding cooperativity, probably as a result of hydrophobic interactions between the complex ions despite their tetravalent positive charges. The mechanism of "shuffling" the complex along the DNA chain is discussed, i. e., whether the ruthenium complex remains threaded (requiring sequential base-pair openings) or if <b>unthreading</b> followed by lateral diffusion within the ionic atmosphere of the DNA and rethreading occurs...|$|E

Chapter 1 introduces the concepts of interpenetrated and interlocked compounds like pseudorotaxanes, rotaxanes, catenanes and also defines the molecular machines with representative examples of existing systems found throughout the literature. Chapter 2 presents a designing of metal coordination controlled molecular switch in which a chelating group has been incoorporated into the cationic dipyridyl ethane thread. In this chapter, pseudorotaxanes containing a tridentate terpyridine (terpy) group are designed in order to prove that the threading and <b>unthreading</b> of [2]pseudorotaxanes can be manipulated by controlling the coordination geometry of the terpy group attached to the thread. Chapter 3 presents a designing of another metal coordination controlled molecular machine named a mechanical flip-switch, using an unsymmetrical thread and unsymmetrical crown ether. The chapter provides the evidence that an unsymmetrical [2]rotaxane can exist in two distinct co-conformations and the relative ratio of these two co-conformations can be controlled by changing the coordination environment. Room temperature NMR method is established for the analysis. Chapter 4 describes the introduction of strong electrostatic ion-ion interactions to a coordination controlled flip-switch.

Now, chemists have invented a nanomachine that can achieve a similar feat. The artificial system {{is not about to}} displace nature’s ribosome, a complex of proteins and RNA. It is much simpler, and only about about one-tenth of the size — and, it is achingly slow, destroys the code it reads and can produce only very short chunks of protein, known as peptides. It does, however, show that some of the tactics of biology’s molecular machines can be adopted to make useful chemicals. “We were inspired by the ribosome, ” says synthetic chemist Dave Leigh at the University of Manchester, UK, who led the team behind the development. “But our machine is extremely primitive compared to the ribosome. ” Leigh’s system relies on a rotaxane — a large molecular ring threaded onto another molecule that acts as an axle. The axle is lined with three amino acids, and a chain of three more amino acids hangs from {{the outer edge of the}} ring. One of the amino acids attached to the ring is cysteine, which contains a crucial sulphur-containing thiol group 1. Heating the system prompts the thiol group to pluck an amino acid from the axle and transfer it to the end of the chain of amino acids attached to the ring. The ring can then move along the axle and repeat the same trick with the next two amino acids. <b>Unthreading</b> the ring and breaking off the newly-formed chain delivers a perfectly formed peptide made from all six amino acids. “It’s one of Dave’s best papers, ” says physical organic chemist Alan Rowan at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, who also works with rotaxanes. “It’s the first example of a rotaxane performing a sequential reaction, and that’s a big step forwards. ” Although Leigh’s rotaxane mimics the ribosome in its sequential building of peptides, the sulphur-assisted amino acid transfer is found elsewhere in With molecules for moving parts, this nanorobot links together amino acids (colored balls) by attaching them to a moving ring (blue) ...|$|E
