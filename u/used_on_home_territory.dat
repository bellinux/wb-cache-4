5000|$|Bryan Appleyard {{considers}} this {{book to be}} a demonstration of renewed confidence in the possibilities of physics. He also sees the book as a depiction of how the public believes in an especially optimistic view of the future.

50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} two seasons, however, {{the end of the}} season was not followed by the need to find a new pitch, in spite of the merger with Belle Vue. The club reconstituted itself as West Gorton Association Football Club, drawing up fixtures largely against the teams which St Mark's had been playing {{the previous}} season, as opposed to the calibre that Belle Vue had faced - though at this stage in the club's existence the difference in standard was small. The season saw West Gorton prove more successful on the pitch than its previous incarnations, winning their first four home games and not losing a single match at the Queens Road ground all season, scoring four times more goals than they conceded <b>on</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|R

5|$|As a final factor, Lee faced {{a new and}} {{formidable}} {{opponent in}} George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac fought well <b>on</b> its <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> Although new to his army command, Meade deployed his forces relatively effectively; relied on strong subordinates such as Winfield S. Hancock to make decisions where {{and when they were}} needed; took great advantage of defensive positions; nimbly shifted defensive resources on interior lines to parry strong threats; and, unlike some of his predecessors, stood his ground throughout the battle in the face of fierce Confederate attacks.|$|R
5000|$|As Blackburn {{continued}} {{in their attempts}} to return to the First Division, Eckersley continued to give good service to both club and country, collecting a total of 17 caps, as well as three [...] "B" [...] caps and representing the Football League on six occasions. His final England appearance came on 25 November 1953 in a friendly against Hungary. England lost the match 6-3, with Ferenc Puskás scoring twice and Nándor Hidegkuti converting a hat trick. This was England's second defeat by foreign opponents <b>on</b> <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> after Ireland, and the match changed the face of English football. As well as Eckersley, several other England players were never to represent their country, including Ramsey and Stan Mortensen. Eckersley had the ability to dribble {{all the way up to}} the opposition penalty area. With superb ball control, he was able to let a player pass him; he would then extend his left leg behind the opponent and nick the ball away without fouling the opposing player, thus earning him the [...] "telescopic leg" [...] tag.|$|R

We propose a phenomenological inquiry to explore the case of a recent urban (re) development project, Montreal's Quartier des spectacles, with regard to the impact of the spectacularization of space <b>on</b> residents' <b>home</b> <b>territories...</b>|$|R
5000|$|The White {{brothers}} {{remained in}} control of the park until the close of the 1929 season. That year the White Brothers had outbid Pat Collins, showman from the famous Collins fairground dynasty, for his lease on a highly profitable and major pleasure park at Evesham in the West Midlands, that served day trippers from metropolitan Birmingham and Wolverhampton. When the brothers returned from a period of touring with their mobile fair rides and tried to renew their own Barry Island lease, the following year in 1930, they were stunned to discover that Pat Collins had outbidden them <b>on</b> their <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|R

25|$|The medieval Bulgarian {{army was}} the primary {{military}} body of the First and the Second Bulgarian Empires. During the first decades after {{the foundation of the}} country, the army consisted of a Bulgar cavalry and a Slavic infantry. The core of the Bulgarian army was the heavy cavalry, which consisted of 12,000–30,000 heavily armed riders. At its height in the 9th and 10th centuries, {{it was one of the}} most formidable military forces in Europe and was feared by its enemies. There are several documented cases of Byzantine commanders abandoning an invasion because of a reluctance to confront the Bulgarian army <b>on</b> its <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b>|$|R

50|$|At around 3pm on Friday 15 November 2013 the Medway Queen {{departed}} Avonmouth towed by the tug Christine. Benefiting {{from the}} good weather the tow continued throughout the weekend with her arriving back <b>on</b> her <b>home</b> <b>territory</b> <b>on</b> the River Medway. Despite earlier delays in commencing the tow the weather remained kind to the 'Heroine of Dunkirk' as she made the entire journey around Lands End and along the South Coats of England in one go without the need to seek shelter along the way. The tug and tow finally arrived on the River Medway on Monday 18 November 2013. Due mainly to tidal restriction the Medway Queen was buoyed in Saltpan Reach until high tide the following day.|$|R
50|$|The French Revolution of 1789 {{revived the}} hopes of {{all members of the}} Whig party in Scotland and England, in their {{campaign}} for burgh and county reform. However, as the Revolution progressed and England witnessed the emergence of popular reform societies advocating Parliamentary reform, the aristocratic section of the Whigs began to fear the spread of revolutionary ideology <b>on</b> to <b>home</b> <b>territory.</b> It was in an attempt to forestall such a development that the younger generation of Foxite Whigs in Parliament and the Lords inaugurated in April 1792 the London Association of the Friends of the People. Led by the Scots Lords, Lauderdale and Buchan, this society enjoyed widespread initial support from leading Whigs throughout Britain.|$|R
