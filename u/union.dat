Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the <b>Union</b> left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the <b>Union</b> retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time for the <b>Union</b> army.

During this defeat for the <b>Union</b> army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E
