5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva <b>undergoes</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
5|$|Some {{practitioners}} do not emphasize {{belief in}} an afterlife, instead stressing {{the importance of}} behaviour and reputation in this world. In Icelandic Heathenry, there is no singular dogmatic belief about the afterlife. A common Heathen belief is that a human being has multiple souls, which are separate yet linked together. It is common to find a belief in four or five souls, two of which survive bodily death: one of these, the hugr, travels {{to the realm of}} the ancestors, while the other, the fetch, <b>undergoes</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> of reincarnation into a new body. In Heathen belief, there are various realms that the hugr can enter, based in part on the worth of the individual's earthly life; these include the hall of Valhalla, ruled over by Odin, or Sessrúmnir, the hall of Freyja. Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens, although one common belief is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan.|$|E
25|$|Naive {{cytotoxic}} T {{cells are}} activated when their T-cell receptor (TCR) strongly interacts with a peptide-bound MHC class I molecule. This affinity {{depends on the}} type and orientation of the antigen/MHC complex, and is what keeps the CTL and infected cell bound together. Once activated, the CTL <b>undergoes</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> called clonal selection, in which it gains functions and divides rapidly to produce an army of “armed” effector cells. Activated CTL then travels throughout the body searching for cells that bear that unique MHC Class I + peptide.|$|E

25|$|The late {{proteins}} {{form the}} capsid and the receptors {{on the surface}} of the virus. Packaging of the viral particles— including the genome, core and the capsid - occurs in the nucleus of the cell. Here, concatemers of the viral genome are separated by cleavage and are placed into pre-formed capsids. HSV-1 <b>undergoes</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> of primary and secondary envelopment. The primary envelope is acquired by budding into the inner nuclear membrane of the cell. This then fuses with the outer nuclear membrane releasing a naked capsid into the cytoplasm. The virus acquires its final envelope by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles.|$|E
25|$|The food <b>undergoes</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> of {{cryogenic}} freezing {{with liquid}} nitrogen. After {{the food is}} placed on the conveyor belt, it is sprayed with liquid nitrogen that boils on contact with the freezing food. This method of flash-freezing fresh foods is used to retain natural quality of the food. When the food is chilled through cryogenic freezing, small ice crystals are formed throughout the food that, in theory, can preserve the food indefinitely if stored safely. Cryogenic freezing is widely used as it is a method for rapid freezing, requires almost no dehydration, excludes oxygen thus decreasing oxidative spoilage, and causes less damage to individual freezing pieces. Due {{to the fact that the}} cost of operating cryogenic freezing is high, it is commonly used for high value food products such as TV dinners, which is a $4.5 billion industry a year that is continuing to grow with the constant introduction of new technology.|$|E

Whereas classic Brie takes eight weeks to make, Fromager d'Affinois can be made in two weeks. Ultrafiltration also results in a milk that retains more nutrients and proteins, and the cheese has a relatively high fat content of 60%.|$|E
