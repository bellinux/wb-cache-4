ABSTRACT: The importance of photon pair generation can never be overemphasized. It has {{formed the basis of}} most fundamental quantum optical experiments like Bell-experiments, quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping. However for considerable number of years Quantum Mechanics in general has remained largely theoretical and within the four corners of laboratories. Quantum Key Distribution {{is one of the first}} quantum applications to break this barrier. It provides us with <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secured</b> communication by providing us with efficient alternative to classical cryptography. This study forms part of the effort in realizing efficient way of generating photon pairs through the Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion process using a nonlinear crystal cut for type-I phase matching. After generating the photon pairs, the paper examined how they can be detected efficiently. We measured the rate of single photon generation (up to 200 kHz) as well as the rate at which they are detected in coincidence (150 coincidences per second). We further investigated a quantum interference effect (the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect) which classical wave theory has failed to describe. This effect has numerou...|$|R

Motivated by applications in wireless networks, we consider the problem of generating secret keys from {{a finite number of}} correlated observations under the source model. We investigate the relationship among the achievable secret key rate, the decoding error probability, and the number of observations. Based on the connection between secret key generation and dis tributed source coding problems, we present two key generation schemes. In the first scheme, length of the generated key varies depending on the the realization of the source sequence, and the generated key is conditionally perfectly secure. We characterize the penalty, due to the finiteness of the number of observations, in the key rate compared to that of the scheme with infinite number of observations. In the second scheme, length of the generated key is fixed, and the key is <b>unconditionally</b> perfectly <b>secure.</b> We characterize the additional penalty associated with these additional features in the achievable key rate.

Hanaoka et al. constructed <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> chaffing-and-winnowing schemes which achieve perfect secrecy in the sense of Shannon. Their schemes are constructed from <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> authentication codes. In this paper, we construct <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> chaffing-and-winnowing schemes from <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> authentication codes in which the authentication tags are very short. This could be a desirable feature, because certain types of <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> authentication codes can provide perfect secrecy if the length of an authentication tag is at least as long as the length of the plaintext. The use of such a code might be prohibited if encryption schemes are made illegal, so it is of interest to construct chaffing-and-winnowing schemes based on “short ” authentication tags. 1...|$|E

This parallel is then used to analyse an attack against commitment schemes that is the counterpart of the impersonation attack in an authentication system. To investigate the opposite direction, we start by defining an optimal commitment system and showing that this must be a resolvable design commitment scheme as proposed in the aforementioned paper. Then, a proof is given that the resolvable design commitment schemes are a composition of an authentication system and a cipher system and the conclusion follows that this is the case for all optimal commitment systems. We also show how to build optimal schemes from transversal designs that are easy to build and can be more efficiently implemented than the proposal in the previously cited paper...|$|E

40|$|<b>Unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> {{physical}} key distribution schemes are very slow, {{and it is}} practically impossible to use a one-time-pad based cipher to guarantee unconditional security for the encryption of data because using the key bits more than once gives out statistical information, for example via the known-plain-text-attack or by utilizing known components of the protocol and language statistics. Here we outline a protocol that reduces this speed problem and allows almost-one-time-pad based communication with an <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> {{physical key}} of finite length. The physical, <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> key is not used for data encryption but is employed in order to generate and share a new software-based key without any known-plain-text component. The software-only-based key distribution is then changed from computationally secure to <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure,</b> because the communicated key-exchange data (algorithm parameters, one-way functions of random numbers, etc.) are encrypted in an <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> way with a one-time-pad. For practical applications, this combined physical/software key distribution based communication looks favorable compared to the software-only and physical-only key distribution based communication whenever {{the speed of the}} physical key distribution is much lower than that of the software-based key distribution.

40|$|Abstract: In cryptology, secure {{channels}} {{enable the}} exchange of messages in a confidential and authenticated manner. The literature of cryptology is rich with proposals and analysis that address the secure communication over public (insecure) channels. In this work, we propose an informa-tion theoretically secure direction {{for the construction of}} secure channels. First, we propose a method of achieving <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> authentication with half the amount of key material required by traditional <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> message authentication codes (MACs). Key reduc-tion is achieved by utilizing the special structure of the authenticated encryption system. That is, authentication exploits the secrecy of the message to reduce the key material required for authen-tication. After the description of our method, since key material is the most important concern in <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> authentication, given the message is encrypted with a perfectly secret one-time pad cipher, we extend our method to achieve <b>unconditionally</b> <b>secure</b> authentication with almost free key material. That is, we propose a method for unconditionally authenticating arbi-trarily long messages with much shorter keys. Finally, we will show how the special structure of the authenticated encryption systems can be exploited to achieve provably secure authentication that is very efficient for the authentication of short messages...|$|E
