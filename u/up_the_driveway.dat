2500|$|... 1966 - (June 29) Pilot James P. Scott crash-lands his Piper Aztec {{twin-engine}} plane on front lawn of Burton Avenue home after losing an engine and skimming {{the top of}} a tree, which softened his landing. [...] The plane slid <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and struck the house. The residents were not at home, and the pilot survived.|$|E
60|$|After lunch {{the lads}} {{remained}} with Bert {{for about an}} hour and then took their departure for Roger's home, where they arrived some time before dark. As they rolled <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> a surprise awaited them.|$|E
60|$|<b>Up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> the Fawn and Altadena clattered {{neck and}} neck. Dick {{had not been}} {{disappointed}} in the figures he expected to see. From the rear, cries and laughter {{and the sound of}} many hoofs tokened {{that the rest of the}} party was close behind.|$|E
50|$|There {{is talk of}} {{unconfirmed}} supernatural sightings in {{the house}} {{as well as the}} grounds, with rumours of the ballroom being lit up and carriages drawing <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Around this time, Kasabian {{was drawn}} <b>up</b> from <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> by [...] "horrifying sounds." [...] She arrived outside the door. In a vain effort {{to halt the}} massacre, she falsely told Atkins that someone was coming.|$|R
60|$|It {{was late}} when we turned {{in between the}} white dates and made our way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> little <b>driveway</b> to <b>the</b> farmhouse. I bade her good night {{on the steps of}} the porch.|$|R
60|$|As {{he went on}} alone, {{his face}} grew grave and a vague worry came into his eyes. He began resolutely to whistle, but this dwindled away till it was a thin and very subdued little sound, which ceased {{altogether}} as he rode <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> to a large two-storied house.|$|E
6000|$|... "For my cousin, Mr. Colfax," [...] she answered, {{in another}} tone. And {{as she spoke}} she drew away from him, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> But she had {{scarcely}} taken five steps whey she turned again, her face burning defiance. [...] "They {{told me you were}} not coming," [...] she said almost fiercely. [...] "Why did you come?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the girl}} {{approached}} Uncle John, {{but he would}} not listen to her. He was too nervous to rest, he insisted, and she realized that he spoke truly. Just as she abandoned the argument they were all startled by the sound of wheels rolling <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and Arthur rushed to an open window and looked out.|$|E
50|$|The {{similarities}} between Scampton and Hemswell continue to cause confusion. It {{has been said}} that, {{at the end of}} the film actor Richard Todd can be seen walking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> main <b>driveway</b> at Hemswell past Gibson House in the direction of the hangar line; this scene was in fact shot at Scampton.|$|R
50|$|The {{phone rings}} again with no answer, {{and then the}} line is cut. No one can get a signal on their cell phones. The group decide to leave but when they run {{out to the car}} they see that it is missing. A van pulls <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> scaring <b>the</b> group back into the house. As {{everyone}} tries to get a signal on their phones again, all the power in the house goes out. Miriam finally gets a signal on her phone and dials 9-1-1, but the call drops out.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> new <b>driveway</b> for Lakes Highway, bisects Garegnano, {{leaving the}} Certosa di Garegnano {{on one side}} and the village of houses on the other. In fact, the old village of Garegnano, Garegnano Marcido, in the new {{geography}} then becomes part of Quartiere Varesina. This division between the two areas is even more clear with the construction of the flyover del Ghisallo in 1960. Quartiere Varesina encompasses, at the time of the dissolution of Musocco municipality, Garegnano Marcido village, the houses along Strada della Varesina from Cagnola to the railway, the historic core around the current Piazzale Santorre of Santarosa, <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of <b>the</b> newly inaugurated Lakes Highway, becoming an industrial suburb of Milan.|$|R
60|$|From the veranda, Frederick {{watched a}} man coming <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> By {{the roll of}} the sea in his walk, Frederick could guess for whom the {{stranger}} came. The face was swarthy with sun and wrinkled with age that was given the lie by the briskness of his movements and the alertness in the keen black eyes. In the lobe of each ear was a tiny circlet of gold.|$|E
6000|$|Before {{he could}} answer, {{she was already}} halfway up the garden path towards the house. He {{followed}} her as she ran panting through the breakfast room, the dining room, and drawing-room, and {{when they reached the}} hall, Starling, the butler, and two footmen were going out at the door. A voice--Mrs. Kame's--cried out, [...] "What is it?" [...] over the stairs, but they paid no heed. As they reached the steps they beheld the slight figure of Mrs. Rindge on a flying horse coming towards them <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> Her black straw hat had slipped {{to the back of her}} neck, her hair was awry, her childish face white as paper. Honora put her hand to her heart. There was no need to tell her the news--she had known these many hours.|$|E
6000|$|At home I found a {{note from}} Paul, asking me to come up immediately, and it was high noon when I came {{spinning}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> on my wheel. Paul called me from the tennis court, and I dismounted and went over. But the court was empty. As I stood there, gaping open-mouthed, a tennis ball struck me on the arm, and as I turned about, another whizzed past my ear. For aught I could see of my assailant, they came whirling at me from out of space, and right well was I peppered with them. But when the balls already flung at me began {{to come back for}} a second whack, I realized the situation. Seizing a racquet and keeping my eyes open, I quickly saw a rainbow flash appearing and disappearing and darting over the ground. I took out after it, and when I laid the racquet upon it for a half-dozen stout blows, Paul's voice rang out: ...|$|E
50|$|Most Mini-Z motors {{are already}} over powered. Batteries and motor {{are not the}} key to winning. This is unlike 1/10 scale racing where it is {{impossible}} to win without factory sponsorships that supply batteries that are handpicked from a production lot. Driving is a lot more important than equipment. A full-scale race course can be set <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of a home, and with the RCP tracks, it can be taken down in less than 15 minutes with help from a few racers. They are seen as {{a great way to get}} into RC racing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{car of the}} Turner family pulls <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> Learnatorium <b>driveway.</b> Timmy's father takes Francis, who is {{too large}} to fit down a [...] "child drop-off" [...] chute, and throws {{him out of the}} way so he can drop Timmy in. Timmy's parents are {{relieved}} as they can now do whatever they want.|$|R
5000|$|... "Continuing in the {{direction}} of the party, Brockman passes several more sober people walking in the wrong lane of travel, according to the statement. Due to the amount of traffic of River Road, Brockman's backup, Keipert, agreed to drive the people to their cars. Brockman turned his blue and red flashing lights as he got close to <b>the</b> gravel <b>driveway</b> leading to <b>the</b> field party, according to the statement. Youths were using the lights on their mobile phones to navigate back <b>up</b> from <b>the</b> shore of the Ohio River where two bonfires raged. Brockman stopped his cruiser in the westbound lane, just short of <b>the</b> gravel <b>driveway,</b> got out with his flashlight and walked to a car ready to pull out of <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> according to <b>the</b> statement. Illuminated by his cruiser's own headlights, Brockman talked to the driver. After determining he was safe to drive, Brockman instructed the man to move on. A man then stumbled toward a car parked next to Brockman's cruiser. After the man admitted to being only 20 but drunk, Brockman ordered him to [...] "stay put" [...] and not go anywhere, according to Tyler Brockman's written statement. Brockman then turned his attention to the next car coming <b>up</b> <b>the</b> gravel <b>driveway.</b> It was Samantha Ramsey's 2001 white Subaru." ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{before the}} traffic officer could pull him over, {{he had reached}} his destination, and had pulled up his parents {{driveway}} and entered the house. The traffic officer then parked his car <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and proceeded to talk to Howden.|$|E

As soon as Saba sees Irtiza she starts pushing him, and starts hitting him, she yells at him and says “Where have you been! You told me you will be home by the evening!” Irtiza tries to explain that he met with an accident, Saba gets more hyper after hearing this and says “All of you guys are planning to leave me, first Saman left and now even you are planning to leave me, all of {{you guys want to}} leave me here all alone!” She gets hyper and starts shoving him, Irtiza loses his cool and holds her and shouts “I am going nowhere! I am here with you!” ...|$|R
50|$|Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, {{arrested in}} Florida on an {{unrelated}} charge, has also informed on Jordan. Since {{the evidence against}} him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Jordan loses his mind and tries to run off with Skylar in his car, but he ends <b>up</b> crashing in <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> <b>The</b> next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him. The FBI discovers the note, and Jordan is arrested for breaching his cooperation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite this one breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves {{three years in a}} minimum security prison. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.|$|R
40|$|The {{students}} will achieve {{the objectives of}} learning how to look critically at advertisements to determine the hidden messages that are sometimes conveyed to the viewer. They will also determine how stereotypes and moral values are used in advertising to manipulate viewers. Students will develop critical skills {{that will allow them}} to be aware of how messages are presented to them, and as a result become more informed consumers. Sunshine State Standards VA.

As he walks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> Danny has his last line: [...] "But we did have a wonderful day." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the third}} and fourth seasons of the show, another {{instrumental}} theme by Hugo Montenegro was introduced that was played during the show's campy scenes. Simply titled [...] "Mischief", the theme was heard mainly on outdoor locations, showing the characters attempting to do something such as Jeannie learning to drive, Major Nelson arriving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> a monkey walking around, or reactions to Doctor Bellows. This theme featured the accompaniment of a sideshow organ, a trombone, and electric bass. It was introduced in the first episode of season 3, [...] "Fly Me to the Moon".|$|E
500|$|She went to {{the garage}} and saw Fischer's body lying face <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> She told her {{daughter}} Kathy to call 911, and her father, Buddy, who lived a few minutes away. Buddy dressed {{and headed toward the}} house. He took a shortcut off Texas highways 77 and 83 to reach the house, and recalled going over [...] at some point, and brushing off a few cars along the way by gesturing with his left hand. Once he reached Rancho Viejo, he ignored the entrance and drove instead through a field of palm trees. As he drew closer to Fischer's house, he heard police sirens at a distance. When he arrived, he saw his son's body holding a garden hose. The running water had covered the entire roadway with Fischer's blood. Witnesses, including Eric, recall seeing a short-bearded Hispanic man in his mid-20s driving a white, four-door vehicle with Mexican license plates speeding away after the attack. Kathy then phoned one of Fischer's closest friends before school started and asked him if he knew if Fischer had any enemies. Fischer's friend could not think of anyone who disliked him, and only recalled that he and Fischer had been in an altercation with a group of boys at a football game.|$|R
50|$|A line of {{palm trees}} follows <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> from <b>the</b> street entry <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> main entrance. A {{concrete}} entry stair complete with decorative sides, base piers and associated flower pots creates a grand entry from <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> to <b>the</b> entry terrace before ascending the timber and lace-worked gable (2012) onto the verandah.|$|R
50|$|The next night, Garcia interrogates Corey and Nurse Benson and accuses them of {{interfering in}} the {{investigation}} and causing Willis' death. Garcia is alerted by telephone that a local Chinese man, Lee Quong (Leonard Strong), has been shot and is claiming he has information on Steve Connolly. Garcia, Corey, and Benson race {{to the hospital to}} interrogate Quong. In another flashback, Quong relates how he was the butler and cook at a magnificent nearby home which Walsh purchased as a gift for Radoff. Walsh installed Connolly in the house as her bodyguard. Unwittingly, he put the two lovers together, and their relationship intensified. In the flashback, Quong relates that he eavesdropped on Connolly and Radoff as they made plans to run away and get married. Connolly went to the garage and backed <b>the</b> car <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steeply inclined <b>driveway.</b> Unbeknownst to Connolly, Walsh came home early and overheard Connolly professing his love to Radoff. Walsh released the parking brake on the car, and it rolled down <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and injured Connolly — crushing several of the vertebrae in his back. The flashback ends. Quong says he was shot by Lou Walsh after Walsh realized Quong had seen him commit murder. Quong dies before he can reveal the address of the home.|$|R
5000|$|Lisa's biking home shot is cut, and instead, upon Marge and Maggie honking their horns, {{there is}} a [...] "whip-pan" [...] across the town, {{featuring}} {{a significant number of}} secondary characters, towards the Simpsons' house. Instead of Lisa arriving first, Homer arrives first and has to dodge her (saying [...] "D'oh!") after he gets out of his car as she cycles <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and bikes towards the front door. Finally, the last shot of the family television features a totally different design for the television, which has a more retro look than Season 1's.|$|E

Police dug <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and patio of Ponte's former New Bedford home with a backhoe, but were unable to find evidence linking Ponte to any crime. On the morning of May 15, Ponte was arrested for shoplifting and was found with four cans of sardines and a block of cheese stolen from a Price Rite store in New Bedford. On January 27, 2010, Ponte {{was found dead in}} his New Bedford home. The Bristol County District Attorney's office has discounted foul play as a cause of death.|$|E
