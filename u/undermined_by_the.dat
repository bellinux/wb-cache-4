5|$|Little else {{is known}} about his childhood, {{although}} there is a persistent tradition that he was educated by his maternal great-grandfather Jean de St. Rémy — a tradition which is somewhat <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the latter disappears from the historical record after 1504, when the child was only one year old.|$|E
5|$|City College's Tudor and Gothic-style building, {{designed}} by Baltimore City Hall architect George A Frederick, lasted until 1892, {{when it was}} <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> construction of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station, and collapsed. Several years of political in-fighting and the change to a reformist city administration delayed {{construction of a new}} structure. Designed by the architects Baldwin and Pennington, the new structure was not completed until 1899.|$|E

Rathom and Rooseevelt had what the New York Times characterized as a [...] "tart exchange of telegrams" [...] over the issue of who in Washington authorized the improper methods used at Newport. Roosevelt said Rathom's [...] "attack on the navy was disingenuous and dishonorable." [...] Rathom asserted his sole interest was [...] "the protection of the honor of the United States Navy, which officials of the navy have sought to <b>undermine</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> most bestial and dishonorable methods known to man." ...|$|R
5|$|Repairs {{were made}} to the castle between 1610 and 1611 by the captain, Sir George Bampfield, at a cost of £211. A survey in 1623 carried out by Sir Richard Morryson showed the castle to be {{equipped}} with ten iron guns – one culverin, five demi-culverins, two sakers, a minion and a falcon – and garrisoned by its captain, five gunners and three soldiers. It was in a poor condition, and one corner of the gun platform had been <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sea; Morryson's team estimated the likely costs of repairs to amount to £459.|$|E
5|$|Rowlands {{argues that}} {{the problem with the}} book's central {{approach}} is that it assumes that all interests have a clear relation to welfare and thus moral considerability; an assumption which, he argues, is partially <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> introduction of biological interests. Jon Jensen, who reviewed the book for Ethics and the Environment, raised a similar worry, arguing that Varner did not sufficiently justify his claim that biological interests are inherently morally significant.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} pipeline transport – {{responsible for a}} high percentage of oil and natural gas transportation – is often <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> general public {{due to the lack of}} visibility of this mode. Generally held to be safer and more economical and reliable than the other modes of transport, this mode has many advantages over rival modes, such as trucks and railways. Examples of modern pipeline transport include Alashankou-Dushanzi Crude Oil Pipeline and Iran-Armenia Natural Gas Pipeline. International pipeline transport projects, like the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, presently connect modern nation states– in this case, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey– through pipeline networks.|$|E

5|$|According to Domhoff, {{many people}} {{seem to believe that}} the United States is ruled from behind the scenes by a conspiratorial elite with secret desires, i.e., by a small secretive group that wants to change the {{government}} system or put the country under the control of a world government. In the past the conspirators were usually said to be crypto-communists who were intent upon bringing the United States under a common world government with the Soviet Union, but the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 undercut that theory. Domhoff notes that most conspiracy theorists changed their focus to the United Nations as the likely controlling force in a New World Order, an idea which is <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> powerlessness of the U.N. and the unwillingness of even moderates within the American Establishment to give it anything but a limited role.|$|E
5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The high costs of maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended {{to turn it into a}} railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May the Germans had {{occupied}} {{almost all of}} North Brabant. SS-Standarte Deutschland, quickly advancing to the Western Scheldt, reached the Bath Position. This cut off the retreat of 27e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d'Infanterie, which was subsequently destroyed defending Bergen-op-Zoom. The morale of the defenders of the Bath Position, already shaken by stories from Dutch troops fleeing to the west, was severely <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> news that Winkelman had surrendered; many concluded that it was useless for Zealand to continue resisting as the last remaining province. A first preparatory artillery bombardment on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to desert their troops, who then also fled.|$|E

25|$|This {{middle section}} stood on six arches, while both sides had smaller arches (one {{on the right}} and two on the left) which served as spillways in case the river overflowed. At its normal level, the river flowed between the three central arches, {{constrained}} by double-wedge-shaped reinforcements of masonry, placed at the two outer pillars and intended to prevent their <b>undermining</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> river. These masonry structures were - according to the archaeological record - markedly higher on the upstream side (8.15m) than on the downstream (4.76m). In addition, wedge-shaped breakwaters were added on the piers, although not all piers feature them on both sides. The clear spans of the three central arches have been determined at 23.52m for the central arch and 14.95m for the two flanking arches, while the two piers supporting the central arch were measured at 9.60m.|$|R

5|$|The Maryland State Highway Administration {{plans to}} rebuild the portion of MD 24 that passes through Rocks State Park, which has been <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{adjacent}} Deer Creek. The project was originally proposed in late 2009 and initially called for the route to be relocated further from the creek. The project was put on hold due to opposition from area residents and environmentalists. The Maryland State Highway Administration later proposed reconstructing the road along its current alignment while stabilizing the creek. Work on this project, which is projected to cost $13.3 million, is expected to start as soon as May 2014 and will require closing the road.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Destructoid's Maurice Tan enjoyed the story despite it not adding {{anything to the}} overall experience of Human Revolution and noted that the major choices lacked impact. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found no strong narrative hook, feeling it existed more to plug the main game's narrative gap. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd praised the story for its emotive moments and strong voice acting. Official Xbox Magazines Edwin Evans-Thirlwell found the plot <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> villain and some poor dialogue. Tom Francis of PC Gamer, while giving minimal comment on the story as a whole, noted {{that it had a}} strong conclusion.|$|E
5|$|The RSGS {{supported}} these proposals, {{as did the}} Royal Society of Edinburgh, the University of Edinburgh, {{and other}} Scottish organisations. However, the timing was wrong; the Royal Geographical Society in London was fully occupied with Captain Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, and showed no interest in Bruce's plans. No rich private benefactors came forward, and persistent and intensive lobbying of the government for financial backing failed. Bruce suspected that his efforts were, as usual, being <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> aged but still influential Markham. Finally accepting that his venture would not take place, he gave generous support and advice to Ernest Shackleton, who in 1913 announced plans, similar to Bruce's, for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. Shackleton not only received £10,000 from the government, but raised large sums from private sources, including £24,000 from Scottish industrialist Sir James Caird of Dundee.|$|E

5|$|The {{operation}} restored {{confidence in}} the British forces operating in Sierra Leone, which had been <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> capture of the Royal Irish patrol. After the operation, the British government increased its support of UNAMSIL and its efforts to bring the civil war to an end, both politically, through the United Nations Security Council, and through the provision of staff officers to support UNAMSIL. The successful use of 1 PARA in Operation Barras influenced {{the creation of the}} Special Forces Support Group—a permanent unit, initially built around 1 PARA, whose role is to act as a force multiplier for British special forces on large or complex operations.|$|E
5|$|It {{was hoped}} by Stuart and Rainer that the Batavian {{governor}} Johan Van Angelbeek might {{be persuaded to}} allow a peaceful occupation of Ceylon by British forces, {{especially in light of}} the Kew Letters from William of Orange, which advocated cooperation with British forces. A Major Agnew was sent ashore at Colombo to negotiate and his attempts to persuade Van Angelbeek to allow 300 British troops to land at Fort Oostenberg, which overlooked Trincomalee, were successful. On arrival off the port on the eastern coast of Ceylon on 1 August however the commander of the defences refused to acknowledge the instruction, citing problems with the wording of the instructions. For two days attempts were made to convince the Batavian commander, the British position partially <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> destruction of Diomede in Trincomalee harbour after striking an uncharted rock. Although all of the crew and passengers were saved, large quantities of military stores sank with the frigate.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} years, Şahin continued {{to try and}} reform the Khanate. Support for his reform programme remained low, and it was seriously <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> decision of Empress Catherine to resettle the Crimean Pontic Greeks on the northern shores of the Azov Sea, outside the Khanate. That community, which was Christian, were {{an essential part of}} the Crimean merchant class, and had most readily supported Şahin's reforms. This resettlement caused significant damage to the Crimean economy, and further weakened the position of the Khan. Recognising defeat in Crimea, the Ottoman Empire signed the Convention of Aynali Kavak in early 1779. In the agreement, the Ottomans recognised Şahin as Khan of Crimea, promised no further intervention in Crimea, and conceded that Crimea was under Russian influence. Crimeans could no longer expect support from the Ottomans. Şahin's reforms proceeded, gradually removing Tatars from positions of political influence. For a brief period, Crimea remained peaceful.|$|E
40|$|London {{is being}} {{successfully}} regenerated at present, yet poverty and social exclusion are increasing.

We illustrate the relevance of this hypothesis by means of an economic experiment in which we compare the efficiency of two performance evaluation schemes. ...|$|R

5|$|Sherman {{spent two}} months in the {{territory}} and was the primary author of the 1,188-page report filed on conditions there when they returned in April 1856. The report explained what anti-administration members already feared: that the principle of local control was being seriously <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> invasion of Missourians who, while not intending to settle there, used violence to coerce the Kansans to elect pro-slavery members to the territorial legislature. The House took no action on the reports, but they were widely distributed as campaign documents. That July, Sherman proposed an amendment to an army appropriation act to bar use of federal troops to enforce the acts of the Kansas territorial legislature, which many now viewed as an illegitimate body. The amendment narrowly passed the House, but was removed by the Senate; the House ultimately agreed to the change. In spite of this defeat, however, Sherman had achieved considerable prominence for a freshman representative.|$|E
5|$|Republicans were {{generally}} successful {{in state and}} local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900. McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second. The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899. McKinley initially favored Elihu Root, who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him. He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and Cornelius N. Bliss, but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, Theodore Roosevelt. After a stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had his eye on the presidency. Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904. McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor. The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas C. Platt, who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president.|$|E
5|$|Rowley's first co-ordinated {{action was}} {{prompted}} by the return of Caroline with her prizes. Sheltering under the guns of Saint-Paul harbour, Caroline made an inviting target for an expeditionary force from Rodriguez in practice for the anticipated invasion of the whole island. On 21 September, a force of over 600 soldiers, sailors and Royal Marines under Keating and Willoughby landed on Île Bonaparte and marched around the town's seaward fortifications, storming them from the rear at first light. Capturing each in succession and routing opposition from French militia, the force secured the gun batteries overlooking the port, allowing Rowley to bring his squadron directly into the harbour and bombard the shipping anchored within. The French naval officers, outnumbered and unsupported, drove their ships on shore and abandoned them, allowing the British to seize and carry off Caroline, the two captured East Indiamen {{and a number of}} smaller vessels. French attempts to recapture the town were <b>undermined</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> failure of the island's commander, General Nicolas Des Bruslys, to engage the British with his main force. Des Bruslys later committed suicide. With the garrison leaderless, a truce was agreed that granted the British five days in control of the town. In this time they were able to remove all government supplies and demolish the town's government buildings. Rowley and his force eventually departed from Saint-Paul on 28 September. As a reward for their services, Willoughby was promoted to command Nereide and Corbet sent back to Britain in Caroline, renamed HMS Bourbonaise.|$|E
