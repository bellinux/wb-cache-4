5|$|Swimwear and <b>underwear</b> {{have similar}} design considerations, both being form-fitting garments. The main {{difference}} is that, unlike <b>underwear,</b> swimwear {{is open to}} public view. The swimsuit was, and is, following <b>underwear</b> styles, and {{at about the same}} time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, <b>underwear</b> underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{types of}} <b>underwear</b> are {{described}} as bikini <b>underwear</b> and designed for men and women. For women, bikini or bikini-style <b>underwear</b> is <b>underwear</b> that is similar in size and form to a regular bikini. It can refer to virtually any undergarment that provides less coverage to the midriff than traditional <b>underwear,</b> panties or knickers, especially suited to clothing such as crop tops. For men, bikini briefs are undergarments that are smaller and more revealing than men's regular briefs. Men's bikini briefs can be low- or high-side that are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch {{but not at the}} waistband, with no fabric {{on the side of the}} legs.|$|E
5|$|The bikini design became {{common in}} most Western {{countries}} by the mid-1960s as beachwear, swimwear and <b>underwear.</b> By the late 20th century {{it had become}} common as sportswear in sports such as beach volleyball and bodybuilding. Variations of the term are used to describe stylistic variations for promotional purposes and industry classifications, including monokini, microkini, tankini, trikini, pubikini, and skirtini. A man's brief swimsuit may also {{be referred to as}} a bikini. Similarly, a variety of men's and women's <b>underwear</b> types are described as bikini <b>underwear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{missing person}} cases are {{normally}} handled by {{local and state}} police, the FBI joined the investigation ten days after she disappeared. The FBI interviewed family from Massachusetts, and the Haverhill police chief disclosed that the search was now nationwide. Ten days after her disappearance, New Hampshire Fish and Game conducted a second ground and air search, using a helicopter with a thermal imaging camera, tracking dogs and cadaver dogs. Murray's older sister discovered a ripped white pair of women's <b>underwear</b> lying in the snow on a secluded trail near French Pond Road on February 26, but DNA tests found that the <b>underwear</b> {{did not belong to}} Murray.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1970s, the new sloggi brand was introduced, {{under which}} <b>underwear</b> and other {{products}} with high cotton content were marketed. The company moved its headquarters from Germany to Switzerland in 1977, and its holding has since been headquartered in Bad Zurzach. By 1986, sales increased to 996 million Swiss francs and the number of employees fell slightly to 19,000 employees. At the same time, sales began in the People's Republic of China and beginning in 1988, individual Triumph products were manufactured under license in East Germany for the local market. This included swimwear in addition to <b>underwear.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the wartime}} years, Canadian apparel {{manufacturers}} {{were subject to}} quotas on materials. Elastics were unavailable, affecting the comfort and design of women's <b>underwear.</b> The diagonal slash offered a better fitting brassiere without elastics, and became a competitive advantage.|$|E
5|$|Putting on socks {{resembles a}} {{commutative}} operation since which sock {{is put on}} first is unimportant. Either way, the result (having both socks on), is the same. In contrast, putting on <b>underwear</b> and trousers is not commutative.|$|E
5|$|The club's initial {{sponsors}} were Indian telecommunications corporation Aircel, {{while its}} partners were Kolkata-based <b>underwear</b> brand Lux Cozi and insurance firm Apollo Munich. In October 2015, Kolkata-based Birla Tyres agreed {{a deal to}} be the principal sponsors for the club's second and third seasons.|$|E
5|$|Whale tail is the Y-shaped {{waistband}} of a thong or G-string when visible above the waistline of low-rise jeans, shorts, or a skirt {{that resembles a}} whale's tail. Intentionally or unintentionally, a whale tail is exposed above the trousers mostly when sitting or bending, or even while standing. The frequency or occasion depends on the style of trousers, the style of <b>underwear,</b> {{and the way they}} are worn. Displaying whale tails became popular in the early 2000s, together with the rise of low-rise jeans and thong <b>underwear.</b> The trend, popularized by a number of female celebrities including Christina Aguilera, Victoria Beckham, Mariah Carey, Paris Hilton and Britney Spears, waned within the decade.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{were made}} to {{photograph}} the corpse for the naval identity card Martin would have to carry, but the results were unsatisfactory, and {{it was obvious that}} the images were of a cadaver. Montagu and Cholmondeley conducted a search for people who resembled the corpse, finding Captain Ronnie Reed of MI5; Reed agreed to be photographed for the identity card, wearing Royal Marine uniform. As the three cards and passes needed looked too new for a long-serving officer, they were issued as recent replacements for lost originals. Montagu spent the next few weeks rubbing all three cards on his trousers to provide a used sheen to them. To provide a used look to the uniform, it was worn by Cholmondeley, who was about the same build. The only non-issue part to the uniform was the <b>underwear,</b> which was in short supply in war-rationed Britain, so a pair of good-quality woollen <b>underwear,</b> owned by the late Herbert Fisher, the Warden of New College, Oxford, was used.|$|E
5|$|Eric Stratton â€“ Gynecologist, Beverly Hills, California. Otter is {{depicted}} as still being the affable, suave gentleman {{he was in his}} college days. He remarks that gynecology has been very enjoyable for him and that he has straightened up a bit since leaving Faber. An attractive, blonde patient in her <b>underwear</b> then tells Otter she's ready for her examination. Otter politely cuts the interview off and goes into the exam room.|$|E
5|$|McKellen is {{an honorary}} board member for the New York and Washington, DC based {{organization}} Only Make Believe. Only Make Believe creates and performs interactive plays in children's hospitals and care facilities. He was honoured by the organisation in 2012 and hosted their annual Make Believe on Broadway Gala in November 2013. He garnered publicity for the organisation by stripping {{down to his}} Lord of the Rings <b>underwear</b> on stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} {{consists of}} items created between 1900 and 1940 and includes {{day and evening}} dresses, coats, <b>underwear</b> and stockings, swimwear, shoes, hats and gloves, baby and children's clothes. In addition, the extended collection includes Tinne's jewellery, her servants' clothes and also some soft furnishings. To provide context, Tinne's collection of fashion magazines and sewing patterns are {{also included in the}} collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} alleges than in Nakuru forty five {{cases of}} sexual violence were reported including rapes, forced male circumcisions and penile amputation. Rapes were also reported in Naivasha, as were forced circumcisions of Luo men. One witness claims that Naivasha's men {{were forced to}} remove their <b>underwear</b> to confirm their ethnicity and forcibly circumcised if their uncircumcised penis identified them as Luo.|$|E
5|$|The third {{match was}} between Tyson Tomko and Stevie Richards, the {{man dressed in}} women's clothing. Tomko quickly gained the {{advantage}} after stripping off all of the clothes on Richards, leaving Richards left {{wearing a pair of}} woman's <b>underwear.</b> Tomko continued his attack on Richards by delivering a swinging neckbreaker and winning the match via pinfall.|$|E
5|$|A bikini {{is usually}} a women's {{abbreviated}} two-piece swimsuit with a bra top for the chest and <b>underwear</b> cut below the navel. The basic design is simple: two triangles of fabric on top cover the woman's breasts and two triangles of fabric on the bottom cover the groin in front and the buttocks in back. The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing thong or G-string design.|$|E
5|$|About 20 {{minutes before}} the plane landed, on its final descent, he {{secretly}} ignited a small explosive device consisting of a mix of plastic explosive powder and acid. Abdulmutallab apparently had a packet of the plastic explosive sewn to his <b>underwear,</b> and injected liquid acid from a syringe into the packet to cause a chemical reaction. While {{there was a small}} explosion and fire, the device failed to detonate properly. Passengers heard popping noises resembling firecrackers, smelled an odor, and saw the suspect's pants, leg and the wall of the plane on fire.|$|E
5|$|About a {{month before}} the race took place, in February 2015, the race organisers {{published}} a publicity poster for the race. This poster showed a woman, with her dress raised and <b>underwear</b> with the race logo visible. A cyclist's gloved hand was reaching out apparently to pinch the woman's bottom. The poster bore the caption Wie knijpt ze in Harelbeke? ("Who squeezes them in Harelbeke?"). This was a reference to Peter Sagan's actions after the 2013 Tour of Flanders, when he pinched the bottom of Maja Leye during the podium ceremony after the race.|$|E
5|$|Days later, Lebowski {{contacts}} the Dude {{stating that}} Bunny has been kidnapped. Lebowski wants the Dude {{to deliver a}} briefcase containing a million-dollar ransom {{and see if he}} can recognize the culprits. Later, a different pair of thugs appear in the Dude's apartment, knock him unconscious, and take Lebowski's rug. When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange delivery of the ransom, Walter instead gives the kidnappers a fake ransom, namely, a briefcase filled with dirty <b>underwear.</b> The kidnappers grab the fake ransom and leave. Later that night, the Dude's car is stolen, with the real ransom money briefcase still inside.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s HOM, the French {{manufacturer}} of upscale <b>underwear</b> for men, was purchased {{and has since}} continued as a trademark within the company. The headquarters was located in Marseille. In early 2015, HOM was sold to the Austrian Huber Group, as Triumph wanted to streamline its portfolio. ValisÃ¨re is the label for upper segment products, which beginning in 2007 became also available in Germany and was used primarily for luxury lingerie. Since 2014, Triumph International no longer uses the ValisÃ¨re brand in the European market. Instead, the company focuses on Triumph Essence in the premium segment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Triumph International {{launched}} the sloggi cotton <b>underwear</b> brand, at first only for female customers and later also with products for men (sloggi Men) and swimwear (sloggi swim). Since the 1980s, Triumph International {{has also been}} targeting young customers aged up to 25 years old with the BeeDees brand. The products are characterized by accessories and patterned fabrics. In addition to sloggi and BeeDees, the company has also been marketing sports bras under Triaction since the late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March, Ellen DeGeneres had Grace, Keir, Ceitlin, and Cecelia {{as guests}} on her show. After {{revealing}} that {{she sees the}} dress as white and gold, DeGeneres presented each of them with gifts of <b>underwear</b> patterned after the dress but combining both colour schemes, and show sponsors also gave the Johnstons a gift of $10,000 and a honeymoon trip to Grenada, as they had left their honeymoon early {{to participate in the}} show.|$|E
5|$|On March 2, she {{was told}} that her request for removal of POI statusâ€”which entailed among other things {{sleeping}} wearing only boxer shortsâ€”had been denied. Her lawyer said Manning joked to the guards that, {{if she wanted to}} harm herself, she could do so with her <b>underwear</b> or her flip-flops. The comment resulted in Manning being ordered to strip naked in her cell that night and sleep without clothing. On the following morning only, Manning stood naked for inspection. Following her lawyer's protest and media attention, Manning was issued a sleeping garment on or before March 11.|$|E
5|$|The leading {{industries}} in the city's economy are: food processing (production of meat products, fruit and vegetable products, the production of spirits, the production of frozen food, grain processing), electrical engineering (production tools and equipment for machine tools, production of electric heaters, manufacture and production mixers household appliances). There is also a developed machine industry (electronics, machinery and metal), plastic processing (production of household appliances), textiles (textiles and upholstery, manufacture of <b>underwear,</b> clothing accessories, footwear and backpacks), Wood (production plywood and furniture) building materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was filmed on April 3, 2008, at the Sunbeam Studios in London, co-directed by fashion {{photographer}} Tom Munro and Nathan Rissman. The video was shot during Madonna's photo shoot with Elle magazine, for its May cover girl issue. Madonna's retro-chic {{look in the}} video {{was inspired by the}} photoshoot. The video featured a guest appearance from rapper Pharrell Williams; he was portrayed alongside Madonna, singing to the camera in front of various backdrops. Madonna wore thigh-high PVC boots, visible <b>underwear</b> and sheer tops in the video. The dresses were designed by several fashion brands, including Chanel and Roberto Cavalli.|$|E
5|$|Though child-sized bikinis {{appeared}} in the 1950s, in many European countries, swimsuits under size 11 are commonly not sold with a top part, but in the United States, Britain, and Canada, {{it has often been}} considered unacceptable for girls in late childhood (ages 7â€“11) to go topless. Several incidents of families being evicted from public pools due to their child being topless have been reported. In 2002, clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch came under criticism for selling child-sized thong bikinis and <b>underwear.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{measures}} {{have not been}} confirmed to affect UTI frequency including: urinating immediately after intercourse, the type of <b>underwear</b> used, personal hygiene methods used after urinating or defecating, or whether a person typically bathes or showers. There is similarly a lack of evidence surrounding the effect of holding one's urine, tampon use, and douching. In those with frequent urinary tract infections who use spermicide or a diaphragm {{as a method of}} contraception, they are advised to use alternative methods. In those with benign prostatic hyperplasia urinating in a sitting position appears to improve bladder emptying which might decrease urinary tract infections in this group.|$|E
5|$|After roll call, the Kommando, or work details, {{walked to}} {{their place of}} work, five abreast, wearing striped camp fatigues, no <b>underwear,</b> and ill-fitting wooden shoes without socks. A prisoner's {{orchestra}} (such as the Women's Orchestra of Auschwitz) was forced to play cheerful music as the workers left the camp. Kapos {{were responsible for the}} prisoners' behavior while they worked, as was an SS escort. The working day lasted 12 hours during the summer and a little less in the winter. Much of the work took place outdoors at construction sites, gravel pits, and lumber yards. No rest periods were allowed. One prisoner was assigned to the latrines to measure the time the workers took to empty their bladders and bowels.|$|E
5|$|Callie takes Sofia to {{live with}} Meredith and Derek, Zola, and Baby Bailey {{for a while before}} kicking Arizona out of their {{apartment}} and celebrates by dancing in her <b>underwear.</b> Callie also left Arizona at therapy, telling her that {{she was the only one}} that needed to go. After being hit by a lawsuit, her father, Carlos, visits and tells Callie that he cheated on her mother but she took him back and Callie wouldn't be here if her mother didn't give Carlos a second chance. Callie goes to Arizona's apartment and invites her to come back home. Callie finds out during surgery that Arizona was sleeping with Leah, a second year resident, while separated. Although angry at Arizona, Callie still agrees to work things out.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Unlocked in 2014, Stan {{commenced}} working on Alesta the subsequent year at a Romanian music camp organized by Romanian composer Marius Moga; there she collaborated with three recording studios simultaneously. The title of the record is an abbreviation of Stan's stage name, also meaning 'ready' in Turkish. The accompanying artwork for the Japanese and other versions of the album show Stan posing {{in front of a}} black backdrop, with lettering displayed in white or red above her head. Editions of Alesta released by Ego Records and Warner Bros. Records featured a photograph with her laying over a motorcycle sporting a blonde wig, white <b>underwear</b> and a distorted pair of blue jeans.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Tony {{married the}} family's {{housekeeper}} Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario. Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him. They {{would have a}} strained relationship for many years afterward. She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high grade point average, and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the monkey bars during recess, and pull up her skirt during classâ€”all so that the boys could see her <b>underwear.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2001, Lita and Trish Stratus {{joined forces}} to combat Stacy Keibler and Torrie Wilson, members of The Alliance: Extreme Championship Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling wrestlers who were invading the WWF as part of The Invasion storyline. At the Invasion {{pay-per-view}} on July 22, Lita and Stratus defeated Keibler and Wilson in the first ever tag team bra and panties match by stripping their opponents to their <b>underwear.</b> Throughout The Invasion, Lita, Stratus, and Jacqueline feuded with Alliance members Keibler, Wilson, Ivory, and Mighty Molly.

5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear <b>underwear</b> beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo DavidsonA United States Air Force {{astronaut}} who accidentally opens {{a portal}} to another world inhabited by talking human-like apes and is captured by them. Leo leads a rebellion of the planet's humans. Wahlberg had {{backed out of}} a commitment to Ocean's Eleven to take this role in Planet of the Apes. (Matt Damon was eventually cast in the Ocean's Eleven role.) Whereas other actors contending for the Leo Davidson role {{wanted to see the}} script before signing a contract, Wahlberg signed on after a five-minute meeting with Burton. To avoid evoking associations with his previous work as an <b>underwear</b> model, Wahlberg did not wear a loincloth, even though Heston had worn one in the original film.|$|E
5|$|Most men {{typically}} just {{wear the}} towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, {{it is perfectly}} acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, {{is the first step}} in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear <b>underwear</b> or fetish-wear, but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear flip flops or sandals, sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an elastic band which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.|$|E
