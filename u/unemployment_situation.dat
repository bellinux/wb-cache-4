5|$|While a few former bal maidens found {{alternative}} employment at local factories, and large numbers emigrated, the <b>unemployment</b> <b>situation</b> in Cornwall remained bad. As {{early as the}} 1860s, charitable schemes had begun for training former bal maidens as domestic servants, and as the textile industry of the North of England boomed a concerted {{effort was made to}} recruit Cornish women to work in the mills. Large numbers of women took up these offers; the 1891 census showed 17,757 Cornish women living in Devon (the majority working in domestic service), 10,005 in London and the surrounding suburbs of Middlesex, and 4,439 in Lancashire. In addition, the towns growing around the newly discovered mines of South Australia suffered a serious gender imbalance and made concerted efforts to recruit Cornish women.|$|E
40|$|The social {{effects of}} youth {{unemployment}} must {{be described in}} connection with the special <b>unemployment</b> <b>situations</b> which this condition implies for youths. Periods of joblessness are in general short and alternate with job programmes or educational programmes, a situation which can be characterised as a 'permanent impermanence'. Unemployment must also be seen in light of its occurrence during a central stage of a youth's development. The social effects are primarily of three kinds: those limited to the individual welfare, those concerning the individual's connection to his group and those concerning the individual's relationship with society. The first mentioned is most commonly expressed psychosomatically or socio-medically, the second socio-psychologically and the third socio-culturally or societally. ...|$|R
40|$|Subsidised {{energy prices}} in pre-transition Hungary {{had led to}} {{excessive}} energy intensity in the agricultural sector. Transition has resulted in steep input price increases. In this study, Allen and Morishima elasticities of substitution are estimated to {{study the effects of}} these price changes on energy use, chemical input use, capital formation and employment. Panel data methods, Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) and instrument exogeneity tests are used to specify and estimate technology and substitution elasticities. Results indicate that indirect price policy may be effective in controlling energy consumption. The sustained increases in energy and chemical input prices have worked together to restrict energy and chemical input use, and the substitutability between energy, capital and labour has prevented the capital shrinkage and agricultural <b>unemployment</b> <b>situations</b> from being worse. The Hungarian push towards lower energy intensity may be best pursued through sustained energy price increases rather than capital subsidies. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|For entrepreneurship, growth drives towards {{economic}} growth, public, private, {{and nongovernmental}} organizations are taking various measures to promote entrepreneurship in different countries. Universities and colleges have implemented various postgraduate, undergraduate, and diploma courses on small business management and entrepreneurship (Plant and Ren, 2010; Nishantha, 2008). In developing countries, the role of entrepreneurship for development {{is more important than}} developed countries as far as the creation of self-employment opportunities and reduction of <b>unemployment</b> <b>situations</b> are concerned (Nishantha, 2008). Currently, the rate of unemployment among high schools and university graduates remains proportionally higher than the rate for less educated workers. Then, providing employment opportunities for all graduates is a crucial issue (Ummah, 2009). One of the ways {{to solve the problem of}} unemployment is bringing further graduate entrepreneurship. Graduate entrepreneurship is a process taken by a graduate to start a business in terms of an individual career orientation (Olufunso, 2010). The world needs graduates who are innovative, dynamic, smart, daring, efficient, determined, modern, and employable or, in one word, entrepreneurial.|$|R

Agribusiness management field is of very recent origin and gaining rapid popularity among students as carrier choice. The agribusiness program is planned to develop management workforce to cater agricultural Industry {{which serves as a}} good option for the students willing to perform in corporate sector. Agribusiness {{management education}} has great opportunities of employment for agrigraduates in private, governmental and cooperative sector. Agribusiness students can get jobs for various posts such as sales executives, credit officers, agri experts, warehousing managers, financing officers, food managers and logistic managers in national and Multinational Corporation. Agribusiness professionals have bright future in academic field due to new emerging discipline and lack of agribusiness faculty in the country. Agribusiness sector also helps in fighting against the Poverty, Hunger, Malnutrition and <b>unemployment</b> <b>situations</b> in the economy. This review paper explores the potential opportunities in agribusiness management education which helps in employment generation and entrepreneurship development. Thus, Agribusiness management sector will change more in the next decade than it did in the last century...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Israel economy {{went into a}} {{downturn}} due to the crashing of the global dot-com bubble which bankrupted many startups established {{during the height of}} the bubble.

[...] Afterwards Israel managed to create a remarkable recovery by opening up new markets to Israeli exporters farther afield, such as in the rapidly growing countries of East Asia. As well as a rebound in the tech sector with the gradual bottoming out of the dotcom crash and global increase in internet usage worldwide which created a demand for software, and a demand post-9/11 in Security and defense products.

30|$|The German {{success story}} is in stark {{contrast}} to the situation in the United States, which now has to worry about persistent long-term unemployment. More than 20 years ago the phenomenon of successive, recession-related waves of unemployment that ended up accumulating was considered to be entirely a European problem (Blanchard and Summers, [1986]). Among the countries in Europe, Germany served as the prime example for the pattern of high and rising <b>unemployment.</b> The <b>situation</b> has remarkably changed since the 1990 s when the impressive employment growth in the United States was frequently characterized as an “employment miracle” (Krueger and Pischke, [1997]). We argue that this striking change is mainly due to successful labor market reforms in European countries such as in Germany and due to demographic changes. The Great Recession has merely acted as a shock that made the change apparent.|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{economic}} recessions {{show that}} immigrant workers may experience {{longer periods of}} <b>unemployment,</b> a <b>situation</b> that may lead employees to presenteeism, the act of working {{in spite of a}} health problem. This study explored perceptions about the factors that lead to presenteeism in immigrant workers considering the context of economic crisis. Methods: Six focus group discussions were held (February 2012), with men and women from Colombia, Ecuador, and Morocco (n[*]=[*] 44) living in Spain and selected by theoretical sample. A qualitative content analysis was performed. Results: Four categories were identified as factors that influence the occurrence of presenteeism in a context of economic crisis: poor employment conditions, fear of unemployment, employer/employee relationship, and difficulties in finding temporary replacement workers. Furthermore, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and mental problems were related to presenteeism. Conclusions: It is important to develop strategies to protect workers from negative working conditions that are associated with deterioration of health.
