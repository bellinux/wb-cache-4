5|$|Live at the BBC, {{the first}} {{official}} release of <b>unissued</b> Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the Anthology project. Anthology {{was the culmination of}} work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title The Long and Winding Road. Documenting their history in the band's own words, the Anthology project included the release of several <b>unissued</b> Beatles recordings. McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 2003, I Want You was reissued by Motown as a two-disc {{expanded}} edition release, featuring 24-bit digital remastering of {{the original}} album's recordings, previously <b>unissued</b> material, and a 24-page booklet, which contains the original LP liner notes by Marvin Gaye, as well as comprehensive essays by writers including David Ritz.|$|E
5|$|On September 18, 2001, Let's Get It On was reissued by Motown as a two-disc deluxe edition release, {{featuring}} 24-bit digital remastering of {{the original}} album's recordings, previously <b>unissued</b> material and a 24-page booklet which contains the original LP liner notes by Marvin Gaye, as well as essays from Gaye biographers David Ritz and Ben Edmonds.|$|E
5|$|The fourth disc of Collaborations is a DVD {{containing}} previously <b>unissued</b> film of {{a performance}} by the Music Festival from India, recorded at London's Royal Albert Hall in September 1974. Filmed by director Stuart Cooper, the footage required substantial restoration for its 2010 release. An audio-only track on the DVD, prepared by Anoushka Shankar and Paul Hicks, provides a more complete record of the concert.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a large {{quantity}} of <b>unissued</b> Morgan dollars {{was discovered in}} the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value, and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began at}} London's Abbey Road Studios in May 1970, with {{extensive}} overdubbing and mixing continuing through October. Among the large cast of backing musicians were Eric Clapton and Delaney & Bonnie's Friends band – three of whom formed Derek and the Dominos with Clapton during the recording – {{as well as}} Ringo Starr, Gary Wright, Preston, Klaus Voormann, John Barham, Badfinger and Pete Drake. The sessions produced a double album's worth of extra material, most of which remains <b>unissued.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 2010 box set Collaborations was one {{of several}} reissue {{projects}} celebrating Shankar's 90th birthday. It compiles three studio albums that he and Harrison worked on together between 1973 and 1996: Shankar Family & Friends (1974), Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India (1976) and Chants of India (1997). The first two of these albums had long been out of print, and their inclusion in the box set marked the debut CD release for both titles. Disc four contains a previously <b>unissued</b> concert film from 1974, titled Music Festival from India – Live at the Royal Albert Hall.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the leaders}} of Kentucky's Confederate {{government}} had remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Governor Hawes' return. They finally departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2. Bragg had been disappointed {{with the number of}} soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained <b>unissued.</b> Desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act to boost recruitment, Bragg decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort. On October 4, 1862, Hawes was inaugurated as governor by the Confederate legislative council. In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their guard down, and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Buell's artillery.|$|E
5|$|The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, {{the soundtrack}} album for the still-uncompleted film, was {{released}} by Virgin Records on 24 February 1979. It is mostly composed of tracks credited to the Sex Pistols: There are the new recordings with vocals by Jones, Vicious, Cook, and Ronnie Biggs, as well as Edward Tudor-Pole, briefly considered as a permanent replacement for Rotten. McLaren himself takes the mic {{for a couple of}} numbers. Several tracks feature Rotten's vocals from early, <b>unissued</b> sessions, in some cases with re-recorded backing by Jones and Cook. There is one live cut, from the band's final concert in San Francisco. The album is completed by a couple of tracks in which other artists cover Sex Pistols classics. Four Top Ten singles were culled from the Swindle recordings, one more than had appeared on Never Mind the Bollocks.|$|E

25|$|Around 1962–63, one of Dolphy's working bands {{included}} the young pianist Herbie Hancock, {{who can be}} heard on The Illinois Concert and Gaslight 1962 and the <b>unissued</b> Town Hall concert with poet Ree Dragonette.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, East Germany {{prepared}} special military banknotes {{intended to}} be used in international missions of the National People’s Army (NVA), but they were never issued. These military notes consist of the 1955 series (DN B13 – DN B17) handstamped with the coat of arms and—in some cases—overprinted Musternote (Sample Note) or Militärgeld (Military Money). Preparations were made to introduce them in 1980, but this never occurred. Instead, in 1990 and 1991, these and other old and <b>unissued</b> East German notes and coins were stored in bunkers in massive sandstone caverns in the Thekenberge near Halberstadt. However, a pair of local citizens gained entry to this cache over the next decade and stole some of its contents, including the <b>unissued</b> military notes dated 1955, as well as two <b>unissued</b> notes dated 1985. In response to this theft, the remaining paper money was incinerated between April and 25 June 2002. Only a few genuine military banknotes exist; however, an abundance of 1955 series banknotes survived, as did the coat of arms handstamp. Many military banknotes have since been fabricated and it’s impossible to distinguish them from genuine notes.|$|E
25|$|Workshop Jazz Records: Motown's jazz subsidiary, active from 1962 to 1964. Notable Workshop Jazz artists {{included}} the George Bohannon Trio, Earl Washington All Stars, and Four Tops (whose recordings for the label went <b>unissued</b> for 30 years). The Workshop Jazz catalog is currently managed by Verve Records.|$|E
25|$|Before Japanese occupation, the {{predominant}} bank of China's northern provinces (including Suiyuan, Chahar and Shanxi) was the Charhar Commercial Bank. When the Japanese invaded, the bank evacuated the area taking {{all of its}} capital and all <b>unissued</b> currency. The Japanese military government quickly established the Channan Commercial Bank to replace its note issuing functions.|$|E
25|$|Most of the band's {{original}} albums {{have been}} re-released {{in recent years}} and a 4-CD set (Odds & Sods - Mis-takes & Out-takes) featuring many previously <b>unissued</b> versions of tracks was released in August 2005. This includes material from the unreleased (and thought to be lost) Manfred Mann Chapter III Volume 3 album and the first Earth Band album, Stepping Sideways. The fourth CD in the package includes both unreleased studio material and live performances.|$|E
25|$|In November 1977, Fantasy {{appointed}} long-time Stax {{writer and}} producer David Porter {{to head up}} a revived version of the Stax label, which was relaunched in January 1978. Porter signed several new acts to Stax, including Fat Larry's Band, Rick Dees and Sho Nuff, and re-signed mid-1970s Stax acts Rance Allen, Soul Children and Shirley Brown. Porter was also responsible for overseeing compilations of previously <b>unissued</b> material by Isaac Hayes, Randy Brown, the Bar-Kays, Albert King and the Emotions.|$|E
25|$|When his third, {{breakthrough}} album, That Nigger's Crazy (1974), was released, Laff, which claimed {{ownership of}} Pryor's recording rights, almost {{succeeded in getting}} an injunction to prevent the album from being sold. Negotiations led to Pryor's release from his Laff contract. In return for this concession, Laff was enabled to release previously <b>unissued</b> material, recorded between 1968 and 1973, at will. That Nigger's Crazy was a commercial and critical success; it was eventually certified gold by the RIAA and won the Grammy Award for Best Comedic Recording at the 1975 Grammy Awards.|$|E
25|$|The first Reichsmark {{banknotes}} {{were introduced}} by the Reichsbank and state banks {{such as those of}} Bavaria, Saxony and Baden. The first Reichsbank issue of 1924 came in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 1000 Reichsmark. This was followed by a second issue in the same denominations, dated between 1929 and 1936. A 20 Reichsmark note was introduced in 1939, using a design taken from an <b>unissued</b> Austrian 100 schilling banknote type. Five Reichsmark notes were issued in 1942. Throughout this period, the Rentenbank also issued banknotes denominated in Rentenmark, mostly in low denominations.|$|E
25|$|The House of Love ({{the band}}'s 1988 debut album) was reissued on CD in 2007. This {{led to the}} band being invited to play the album live in its {{entirety}} {{as part of the}} Don't Look Back concert series. In 2009, Live at the BBC featured selections from the band's post-Bickers in concert recordings from 1990 to 1992. In November 2012, Cherry Red announced the release of an 3-CD deluxe edition of their debut self-titled album, adding all the remaining Creation recordings and a whole disc of <b>unissued</b> demos and alternative versions.|$|E
25|$|The {{first in}} the series, an {{expanded}} version of Game Theory's 1982 debut album Blaze of Glory, was released in September 2014, on CD and on pink vinyl. The reissue was supplemented with 15 bonus tracks (four from Alternate Learning, and 11 previously <b>unissued</b> recordings). Omnivore's November 2014 expanded reissue of Dead Center, on CD only, included material from the Game Theory EPs Pointed Accounts of People You Know (1983) and Distortion (1984), which Omnivore reissued on vinyl only. The reissue of Real Nighttime (1985), the first of Game Theory's albums to be produced by Mitch Easter, was released in March 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{first in}} the series, an {{expanded}} version of Game Theory's 1982 debut album Blaze of Glory, was released in September 2014, on CD and vinyl. In addition to the 12 original tracks, the reissue was supplemented with 15 bonus tracks (four from Alternate Learning, and 11 previously <b>unissued</b> recordings). The first pressing of the reissued vinyl LP was on translucent pink vinyl, with black to follow. The reissue also included a booklet with essays and remembrances from band members and colleagues, including Steve Wynn of The Dream Syndicate. The booklet also included previously unreleased images by photographer Robert Toren, some of which appeared in Omnivore's promotional video for the release launch.|$|E
25|$|Although {{many of his}} {{original}} LP albums are still <b>unissued</b> on CD, Travis' posthumous discography continues to grow, {{due in large part}} to the efforts of independent labels. A live concert album Merle Travis in Boston 1959 released by Rounder Records in 1993 documents Travis' singing and guitar work still at its peak. A major retrospective of Travis' work and career (Guitar Rags and a Too Fast Past, five CDs with an 80-page booklet authored by Rich Kienzle, who interviewed many of Travis's contemporaries) was produced by Bear Family Records in 1994, and includes much previously unreleased material. The Country Routes label has issued several transcriptions of his radio broadcasts of the 1940s and 1950s. Several recent DVDs published by Vestapol and Bear Family have collected many of his music videos and television appearances. He was an honoree of the two-hour television special An Evening of Country Greats: A Hall of Fame Celebration in 1996, and two classic Travis performances were included in the four-part PBS television documentary American Roots Music in 2001, available in CD and DVD formats.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the country}} {{artists who have}} covered the song, Olivia Newton-John {{released}} a version on her Olivia album in 1972. Drake himself recorded [...] "Behind That Locked Door", as well as Harrison's [...] "Isn't It a Pity" [...] and [...] "Something", although the recordings remained <b>unissued</b> until {{the release of the}} Pete Drake album, nine years after his death in July 1988. Christian alt rock band the Choir covered the song on their 1989 album Wide-Eyed Wonder.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{efforts to}} stop the merger were stepped up at Reading by Roger Smee, a former Reading player, {{born and raised in}} the town, who had become a millionaire in the {{construction}} industry. Smee, who strongly opposed the merger plan, had read the club's accounts the previous year, and so was aware of how the team's stock was allocated. He knew that Waller and his boardroom allies, Leslie Davies and John Briggs, had not held a controlling interest in the club in 1982 and that a large number of Reading shares had then been noted as <b>unissued.</b> His interest was therefore piqued when the Thames Valley Royals deal was declared [...] "irrevocable" [...] on the basis that Waller's faction controlled the majority of the shares in Reading. [...] "A year ago they didn't have a majority," [...] Smee later said, [...] "so how on earth have they issued these shares to themselves while Reading was a public company? That would be against the law." [...] Smee contacted Roy Tranter, a director at Reading who opposed the merger, and Tranter's legal team filed a complaint with the High Court objecting to the sale of the <b>unissued</b> shares.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, Morrison {{released}} The Healing Game. The album received mixed reviews, {{with the}} lyrics being described as [...] "tired" [...] and [...] "dull", though critic Greil Marcus praised the musical {{complexity of the}} album by saying: [...] "It carries the listener into a musical home so perfect and complete {{he or she might}} have forgotten that music could call up such a place, and then populate it with people, acts, wishes, fears." [...] The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously <b>unissued</b> studio recordings in a two-disc set, The Philosopher's Stone. His next release, 1999's Back on Top, achieved a modest success, being his highest charting album in the US since 1978's Wavelength.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} other four of the band's first five albums, Porcupine was remastered and reissued on CD in 2003 – these {{releases}} were marketed as 25th anniversary editions. Seven bonus tracks {{were added to the}} album: [...] "Fuel" [...] was the second B-side track on the 12-inch version of [...] "The Back of Love"; alternate versions of [...] "The Cutter", [...] "My White Devil", [...] "Porcupine", [...] "Ripeness" [...] and [...] "Gods Will Be Gods" [...] which were all early versions recorded during the album's sessions; and [...] "Never Stop (Discotheque)" [...] the 12-inch version of the non-album single which was released after Porcupine. The alternate versions of [...] "My White Devil", [...] "Porcupine" [...] and [...] "Ripeness" [...] had all previously been <b>unissued.</b> The reissued album was produced by Andy Zax and Bill Inglot.|$|E
500|$|All Things Must Pass was {{released}} on 27 November 1970 in the United States, and on 30 November in Britain, with the rare distinction of having the same Apple catalogue number (STCH 639) in both countries. Often credited as rock's first triple album, {{it was the first}} triple set of previously <b>unissued</b> music by a single act, the multi-artist [...] live album having preceded it by six months. Adding to the commercial appeal of Harrison's songs, Clayson writes, All Things Must Pass appeared at a time when religion and spirituality had become [...] "a turn-of-the-decade craze" [...] among Western youth, just as the Twist had been in 1960. Another factor behind the album's first weeks of release was Harrison's meeting with McCartney in New York, the failure of which led to McCartney filing suit in London's High Court to dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership.|$|E
500|$|In February 1971, Ronnie Spector {{recorded}} [...] "You" [...] in London for {{a proposed}} solo album on the Beatles' Apple record label, but the recording remained <b>unissued.</b> Four years later, Harrison returned to this backing track while making his final album for Apple Records, in Los Angeles. The released recording features the 1971 contributions from Leon Russell, Jim Gordon and others, with further instrumentation and vocals overdubbed in 1975, notably {{a series of}} saxophone solos by Jim Horn. On release, the song was well received {{by the majority of}} music critics, who viewed it as a return to form for Harrison after his disappointing 1974 North American tour and the accompanying Dark Horse album. Dave Marsh of Rolling Stone hailed it as Harrison's best work since his 1970–71 hit song [...] "My Sweet Lord"; author Ian Inglis describes [...] "You" [...] as [...] "a near-perfect pop song".|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Edge of the Ocean" [...] is an indie pop and trip hop song. Tom Topkoff, {{writing for}} Hybrid, {{called it a}} [...] "captivating and escapist tune". A {{reviewer}} from Crashdown described the single as [...] "romantic". Chuck Campbell of The Daily News stated that [...] "Durand's childlike vocals are as inviting as the waves of an incoming tide". [...] "Edge of the Ocean" [...] was released as Long Distances third single on July 10, 2001, and was serviced to adult alternative radio on the same day; a CD sampler featuring the track and several other songs on Nettwerk was handed out during Coldplay's world concert series, Parachutes Tour (2000–01). The US release included two previously <b>unissued</b> tracks, [...] "Hideaway" [...] and [...] "Only a Fool Would Say That". The single was not released elsewhere until 2002, when it was released as a CD single in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Although it did {{not enter}} any charts, Thom Jurek from AllMusic praised Soundtrack to the Apocalypse, {{rewarding}} the box set with {{four out of five}} stars. Jurek said it had [...] "a whopping four CDs and one DVD." [...] Jurek noted that discs one and two [...] "feature tracks from Reign in Blood, and all the albums that proceed from it, and includes bonus cuts previously only released in Japan, and cuts from soundtracks." [...] He also said that the third disc [...] "is, appropriately, titled 'Shit You Never Heard' because that's what it is— sixteen tracks that have been <b>unissued</b> anywhere— from rehearsals, to in-concert recordings, demos, and one 'No Remorse,' a collaboration with Atari Teenage Riot, from the Spawn soundtrack," [...] and that the fourth disc are [...] "an electronic press kit video for Diabolus in Musica, and an appearance at the Kerrang magazine awards." [...] Adrien Begrand from PopMatters favoured the album, lauding the packaging but stating that [...] "like any other CD box set that has come out in recent years, the band seems torn about whom to appeal to, longtime fans, or newcomers." [...] Begrand noted that the first disc [...] "is especially great, as it captures Slayer at the peak of their career, starting with the classic 1986 album Reign in Blood." [...] PR Newswire said it was [...] "a Slayer fan's ultimate experience," [...] and The Dallas Morning News called it [...] "a fat new audiovisual box set." ...|$|E
500|$|Reading {{supporters}} marched {{from the}} town centre to Elm Park in protest against the merger before the team's match against Millwall on 30 April. Two days later, Oxford and Reading met at Manor Road in what the Glasgow Herald commented might be [...] "the last Thames Valley derby". Oxford fans held another protest march before the game, which Reading won 2–1. At the High Court on 3 May, Mr Justice Harman sided with Tranter and Smee, and handed down a new injunction forbidding trading in Reading stock until 13 June 1983. Following a Reading board meeting on 12 May, Waller, Davies and Briggs resigned their positions, and returned the disputed <b>unissued</b> shares to the club. The Reading Evening Post saw this {{as the end of}} the episode, and jubilantly bannered the news across its front page on 13 May: [...] "We've won! Merger off". The next day, Reading played Wrexham at home on the last day of the League season, needing to win to have any chance of avoiding relegation to the Fourth Division; they won 1–0, but still went down because of results elsewhere. The club held an extraordinary meeting of shareholders in July 1983, at which a vote was taken to decide between Maxwell's takeover bid and a rival offer from Smee, supported by Tranter. The latter proposition narrowly won, and Smee took over as chairman of Reading, putting an end to the planned merger.|$|E
