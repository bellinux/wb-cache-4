2500|$|Carlisle {{were often}} {{referred}} to as 'The Foxes' due to the local connection with huntsman John Peel. In 1970 the club badge changed to reflect this and featured a golden fox jumping over the abbreviation C.U.F.C. The fox further became part of the club's image with a mounted stuffed fox named Olga (an anagram of [...] "goal") which is traditionally carried onto the pitch by the mascot before the match. Later versions of this badge featured a fox's head with a castle (representing Carlisle Castle) and a fox jumping through a ring of stars, somewhat resembling the European <b>Union</b> <b>emblem.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the United Kingdom, several other nations have variants of the White Ensign with their own national flags in the canton, with the St George's Cross sometimes being replaced by a naval badge omitting the cross altogether. Yachts of the Royal Irish Yacht Club fly a white ensign with an Irish tricolour in the first quadrant and defaced by the crowned harp from the Heraldic Badge of Ireland. The Flag of the British Antarctic Territory and the Commissioners' flag of the Northern Lighthouse Board place the <b>Union</b> <b>emblem</b> {{in the first quarter}} of a white field, omitting the overall red St George's Cross, but are not ensigns for use at sea.|$|E
40|$|The Edwardian {{postcard}} {{has been}} described as the Twitter of its age. Earlier regarded as an insignificant pop-cultural trifle, it has, over the last two decades, begun to receive serious academic attention. This attention has, however, been unevenly spread, and often relies on a forty-year-old narrative of the postcard’s history that locates the postcard as the product of a set of discrete occurrences within postal history. This thesis argues that the lack of a contemporary, broadly contextualised history distorts our understanding of the postcard’s place within Edwardian society. It centres its critique around a genre of greetings postcard that is disadvantaged by the current approach: Hands Across The Sea (HATS). These multimodal cards’ designs normally contain the clasped hands symbol and utilise imagery and verse that is ostensibly old-fashioned, nostalgic and sentimental – qualities that sit uncomfortably within the academic tendency to frame the postcard as a quintessentially modern medium. Yet advertisements show that Edwardians within the British diaspora were prepared to pay up to six times more for these cards than for normal tourist views. This discrepancy between contemporary and Edwardian estimation of the card, it is argued, is itself significant. To explain how the HATS card could be valued thus, the study fundamentally re-situates the history of the postcard, using a wide-ranging, contextualist approach that is both interdisciplinary and multi-methodological. It initially uses the heuristic of exploring the HATS phrase and symbolism to negotiate nineteenth century culture and to identify the connotations HATS carried for postcard users. Over the course of a century HATS would develop out of Anglo-Saxonist liberal discourse to be adopted by trade unions, and to rhetorically exemplify both Anglo-American and Colonial relationships. Culturally, however, its use in such areas as melodrama and the trade <b>union</b> <b>emblem</b> is shown to be of unexpected significance for postcard study. Located primarily at the intersect between design history and history, the thesis draws on business history, sociology and anthropology to connect or reframe the postcard’s relationship to discourses such as taste, gift-giving, consumerism, collecting, anonymity, design, printing and material culture. The transnational Victorian print culture of lithographic ‘Art Publishing’, its business networks and its customers’ collecting practices, it turns out, all prefigured major aspects of the postcard’s development, most significantly via the Christmas card. The thesis then re-examines the history of the postcard, using new evidence from postcard retailing to posit three distinct historical waves of postcard fashion. Following view and actress card phases, the HATS card is shown to be a central element in a revitalisation of the greetings genre which occurred as Edwardians sought ‘better’ cards. A detailed study of six hundred HATS cards collected in New Zealand then examines the dynamics of a genre that {{played a key role in}} the transnational maintenance of family and friendship networks among immigrants. It explores how this popular cultural item evolved with no clear initiator, and challenges the middle-class attitudes to authorship, originality and the commonplace that have prevented recognition of HATS’ significance. Ultimately, the thesis’s richly contextualised account of the trajectory of this entangled phenomenon aims to provide an improved historical underpinning for future postcard studies. In addition to showing that ‘Hands across the Sea’ represents a paradigmatic aspect of late Victorian and Edwardian culture, it concludes that the postcard’s history is emblematic of contradictory progressive and nostalgic currents that co-existed in Edwardian society, but that there is far more continuity with earlier practices and visual culture than the current postcard literature acknowledges...|$|E
5000|$|A {{frequent}} motto {{within the}} U.S labor movement, the phrase is an historically significant slogan. Used by the earliest U.S labor unions {{such as the}} American Federation of Labor and other precursors to the modern AFL-CIO, the motto {{continues to be a}} traditional and defining statement of purpose on contemporary labor <b>union</b> <b>emblems</b> including the International Union of Operating Engineers and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. The motto also appears on the original 1925 flag of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the labor union of African-American Pullman Company porters founded by civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph. The College of Engineering, Guindy in Chennai, India and founded in the year 1794 has the phrase [...] "Labor Omnia Vincit" [...] in its logo. This may be the earliest adoption of the phrase by any organization.|$|R

50|$|The trident of Vladimir is {{also used}} by the National Alliance of Russian Solidarists, founded in 1930 by Russian emigrants in Belgrade. According to article 7 of the modern charter of the <b>union,</b> “the <b>emblem</b> of the {{movement}} is the native symbol of the great knyaz Saint Vladimir, {{the founder of the}} Russian state, depicted {{in the form of a}} golden trident on a white, blue, and red field, or in black and white with no field”.|$|R
50|$|In 1624 he {{collaborated with}} the Brussels Jesuit Father Herman Hugo (1588-1629) in the {{production}} of 'the 17th century's most popular devotional book,' Pia Desideria - a work indicating three paths to salvation, through purification, illumination and <b>union,</b> an <b>Emblem</b> book which ran through many editions and versions. It consisted of a series of 45 emblems by Bolswert with accompanying verses by Hugo, subjects for meditation on the theme of spiritual love. Hugo had been teacher at the Jesuit College in Antwerp and rector of the Jesuit College in Brussels, and became army chaplain to Ambrogio Spinola in Spain. The 45 plates were reproduced in the last three volumes of the Emblems of Francis Quarles first published in 1635.|$|R

From top to bottom these images are: a native Amerindian, first mayor Diego de Olguín, Carlos V of Spain, the Royal Decree which gave San Salvador its name, Mayor Antonio Gutiérrez, the priest José Matías Delgado, the seal of liberation of 1811, the 1821 independence seal, the shield of the Municipal Freedom <b>Union,</b> the national <b>emblem,</b> and God.|$|R
50|$|On May 6, 1889, the Machinsts {{held their}} first major {{convention}} in Atlanta. Talbot was elected the Grand Master Machinist (later {{known as the}} international president), and William L. Dawley was elected as Grand Secretary (now known as Grand Secretary-Treasurer). The Organization's name was changed to the National Association of Machinists (NAM) and a constitution was drawn up. The NAM began publishing the 16-page Machinists Monthly Journal. Also in 1889, Frank French designed an <b>emblem</b> for the <b>union.</b> The <b>emblem</b> consisted of a flywheel, a friction joint caliper, and a machinist's square with the initials of the organization. According to French, the flywheel represented the on-going power of the union once it started, and the caliper signified an extended invitation to all persons of civilized countries. The square signified that IAM was square and honest.|$|R
50|$|The National Emblem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is {{the coat}} of arms of North Korea, officially known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The current version adopted in 1993 {{is based on a}} design that was used since the {{foundation}} of the republic in 1948. Two previous versions were briefly in use in the late 1940s. Prominent features on the emblem are a red star, a hydroelectric plant (the Sup'ung dam) and Mount Paektu. The design bears similarities to the emblem of the Soviet <b>Union</b> and other <b>emblems</b> of the socialist heraldic style.|$|R
5000|$|The Audi emblem is four {{overlapping}} rings {{that represent}} the four marques of Auto <b>Union.</b> The Audi <b>emblem</b> symbolises the amalgamation of Audi with DKW, Horch and Wanderer: the first ring from the left represents Audi, the second represents DKW, third is Horch, and the fourth and last ring Wanderer.The design is popularly {{believed to have been}} the idea of Klaus von Oertzen, the director of sales at Wanderer - when Berlin was chosen as the host city for the 1936 Summer Olympics and that a form of the Olympic logo symbolized the newly established Auto Union's desire to succeed. [...] Somewhat ironically, the International Olympic Committee later sued Audi in the International Trademark Court in 1995, where they lost.|$|R
