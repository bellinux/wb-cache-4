5000|$|In the 21st century, the {{physiology}} <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> and the neurological {{delay is}} thought to involve autoassociative memory, a neural mechanism crucial to intelligence. Briefly explained, autoassociative memory retrieves previously stored representations that most closely conform to any current incoming pattern (level II in the general semantics diagram) arriving from the senses. According to the memory-prediction model for intelligence, if the stored representations resolve the arriving patterns, this constitutes [...] "understanding", and brain activity shifts from evaluation to triggering motor responses. When the retrieved representations do not sufficiently resolve newly arrived patterns, evaluating persists, engaging higher layers of the cortex in an ongoing pursuit of resolution. The additional time required for signals to travel {{up and down the}} cortical hierarchy constitutes what general semantics calls a [...] "beneficial neurological delay".|$|E

It has been argued that this shift can be detected in the correlations between serial and discrete naming of alphanumeric symbols (digits and letters) and words. In the current study, we examined the relations between alphanumeric symbol naming and reading of monosyllabic and multisyllabic words and nonwords in two languages that differ in orthographic consistency: English and Dutch. A sample of 92 English-speaking Canadian children and 101 Dutch children, all in Grade 5, were assessed on discrete and serial naming of digits and letters and on serial and discrete naming of monosyllabic and multisyllabic words and nonwords. Results showed that discrete naming of alphanumeric symbols closely resembled discrete reading of monosyllabic words, suggesting that these words are processed in parallel in both languages. Both serial and parallel reading processes were found to <b>underlie</b> <b>identification</b> of multisyllabic words as well as monosyllabic nonwords.

Observers named objects presented in rapid serial visual presentation streams containing either manipulable or nonmanipulable objects. In half the streams, 1 object was repeated. Overall accuracy was lower when streams contained 2 different manipulable objects than when they contained only nonmanipulable objects or a single manipulable object. In addition, nonmanipulable objects induced repetition blindness, whereas manipulable objects were associated with a repetition advantage. These findings suggest that motor information plays a direct role in object identification. Manipulable objects are vulnerable to interference from other objects associated with conflicting motor programs, but they show better individuation of repeated objects associated with the same action.

Unlike the original Itkis-Reyzin scheme, our construction can be instantiated under different decisional complexity assumptions and has a much tighter security reduction.

40|$|Our recent {{functional}} MRI and event-related potential {{studies suggest}} that neural mechanisms <b>underlying</b> <b>identifications</b> of environmental and personal risks are characterized by distinct neural structures and time courses. The current work further investigated the role of non-phase locked activity in dissociation of the neural processes of environmental and personal risks. We recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) from healthy adults when they identified risky and safe environmental or personal events depicted in words or phrases. Event-related synchronization (ERS) and desynchronization (ERD) in association with risky and safe environmental and personal events were calculated using Morlet's wavelet analysis. We found that, relative to the identification of safe environmental events, the identification of risky environmental events induced increased theta band power at 260 - 380 Â ms over the frontal cortex and increased alpha band power after 700 Â ms with a wide scalp distribution. Moreover, theta band powers associated with the identification of risky environmental events correlated positively with subjective ratings of the risk degree of environmental events. In contrast, the identification of risky personal events was linked to decreased alpha band power at 740 - 900 Â ms with a wide scalp distribution compared with the identification of safe personal events. Our findings indicate that theta and alpha band neural oscillations are involved in differentiation between environmental and personal risks. Â© 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|I {{propose to}} {{summarize}} {{some of the}} conclusions presented in this paper. One of my main points was the suggestion {{that in the first}} few months of life anxiety is predominantly experienced as fear of persecution and that this contributes to certain mechanisms and defenses which characterize the paranoid and schizoid positions. Outstanding among these defenses is the mechanism of splitting internal and external objects, emotions, and the ego. These mechanisms and defenses are part of normal development and at the same time form the basis for later schizophrenic illness. I described the processes <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> by projection as a combination of splitting off parts of the self and projecting them on to another person, and some of the effects this identification has on normal and schizoid object relations. The onset of the depressive position is the juncture at which by regression schizoid mechanisms may be reinforced.

30|$|While {{matching}} {{methods are}} common in the international literature, this paper {{is one of the}} few studies of its kind for Canada to use both longitudinal data and propensity score matching on the difference in wages before and after employer supported course enrollment. Propensity score matching was employed to account for potential biases due to selection into employer supported course enrollment related to the observable characteristics of the respondent. A relatively rich and relevant set of pre-treatment covariates included in the confidential versions of the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) of Statistics Canada were used in the specification of the propensity scores model. A variety of statistical tests were implemented satisfactorily to assess the internal validity of the estimates. We found no support issues in the SLID data for the estimated probability of employer-supported training participation for both men and women.

40|$|We used psychophysical and {{functional}} MRI (fMRI) adaptation {{to examine how}} and where the visual configural cues <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> of facial ethnicity, gender, and identity are processed. We found that the cortical regions showing selectivity to these cues are distributed widely across the inferior occipital cortex, fusiform areas, and the cingulate gyrus.

Traditional face area localizer scans isolate regions defined by stronger fMRI responses to a random series of face images than {{to a series of}} non-face images. Because these scans present a random assortment of face images, they presumably produce the strongest responses within regions containing neurons that are face-sensitive but not highly tuned for face type. These areas might be expected to show only weak selective adaptation effects. In contrast, the largest responses to our selective adaptation paradigm would be expected within areas containing more selectively tuned neurons that might be expected to show only a sparse collective response to a series of random faces. Many aspects of face processing (e. g., prosopagnosia, recognition, and configural vs. featural processing) are likely to rely heavily on regions containing high proportions of neurons that show selective tuning for faces...|$|E

40|$|Being {{able to read}} is very {{important}} in our literate society. Many studies, therefore, have examined childrenâs reading skills to improve our understanding of reading development. In general, there have been two types of studies. On the one hand, there is a line of research that focuses {{on the development of the}} reading system. According to prominent theories of reading development, there is a gradual shift in the reading processes <b>underlying</b> word <b>identification</b> from initial serial reading strategies, such as sounding out letters one-by-one, toward the ability to process letters in parallel and retrieve whole word pronunciations from memory. On the other hand, there are studies that examined cognitive skills that foster reading performance. Phonological skills, more specifically phonological awareness and rapid naming, for example, have been shown to be important predictors of reading development. The majority of these studies, however, focused on the relation of cognitive skills with the outcome of the reading system in terms of reading speed or accuracy. Surprisingly few studies have focused on the relations with the processes <b>underlying</b> word <b>identification.</b> The studies in the current dissertation were aimed at bridging the gap between studies that focused on the development of reading processes, and studies that examined cognitive skills that foster reading development. The findings of the current studies have important implications for our understanding of the nature of the relations of visual attention span and rapid naming with reading.

Hogg focused on the motivational processes <b>underlying</b> group <b>identification</b> and argued that self-uncertainty is a primary motive for identification with groups. To feel uncertain is an aversive psychological state and most people are motivated to reduce this sense of uncertainty. Put simply, by identifying with a social group, people derive a sense of meaning and belonging. This subjective group membership in turn provides prescriptive norms and guidelines for appropriate behaviour (âthis is what we doâ) that help individuals to navigate an uncertain world.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the channels <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> of second-order letters using a critical-band masking paradigm. We find that observers use a single 1 â 1. 5 octave-wide channel for this task. This channelâs best spatial frequency (c/letter) {{did not change}} across different noise conditions (indicating the inability of observers to switch channels to improve signal-to-noise ratio) or across different letter sizes (indicating scale invariance), for a fixed carrier frequency (c/letter). However, the channelâs best spatial frequency does change with stimulus carrier frequency (both in c/letter); one {{is proportional to the}} other. Following Majaj et al. (Majaj, N. J., Pelli, D.

That is, for luminance-defined letters, stroke frequency is the number of lines (strokes) across each letter divided by letter width. For second-order letters, letter texture stroke frequency is the number of carrier cycles (luminance lines) within the letter ink area divided by the letter width. Unlike the nonlinear dependence found for first-order letters (implying scale-dependent processing), for second-order letters the channel frequency is half the letter texture stroke frequency (suggesting scale-invariant processing) ...|$|E
40|$|Theories on visual {{awareness}} claim that predicted stimuli reach awareness faster than unpredicted ones. In the current study, we disentangle whether prior {{information about the}} upcoming stimulus affects {{visual awareness}} of stimulus location (i. e. individuation) by modulating processing efficiency or threshold setting. Analogous research on stimulus identification revealed that prior information modulates threshold setting. However, as identification and individuation are two functionally and neurally distinct processes, the mechanisms <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> cannot simply be extrapolated directly to individuation. The goal {{of this study was}} therefore to investigate how individuation is influenced by prior information about the upcoming stimulus. To do so, a drift diffusion model was fitted to estimate the processing efficiency and threshold setting for predicted versus unpredicted stimuli in a cued individuation paradigm. Participants were asked to locate a picture, following a cue that was congruent, incongruent or neutral with respect to the picture's identity. Pictures were individuated faster in the congruent and neutral condition compared to the incongruent condition. In the diffusion model analysis, the processing efficiency was not significantly different across conditions. However, the threshold setting was significantly higher following an incongruent cue compared to both congruent and neutral cues. Our results indicate that predictive information about the upcoming stimulus influences visual awareness by shifting the threshold for individuation rather than by enhancing processing efficiency.

40|$|What may broadly {{be defined}} as the âsocial {{identity}} traditionâ in intergroup relations has recently seen a renewed interest on motivational approaches, portraying intergroup phenomena as determined by some powerful social psychological motives. Our aim in this chapter is to examine the predictive power of some of these motivational accounts in three empirical studies. In Study 1, a cross-sectional survey, we used structural equation models to test a model where each of three motivations (i. e., self-enhancement, uncertainty reduction, need for inclusion and for distinctiveness) independently influences ingroup identification. Studies 2 and 3 are relevant to the functional model of social identities, in which several functions are suggested as <b>underlying</b> <b>identification</b> and intergroup processes. In Study 2, an experiment performed on a natural group, identity functions (e. g., materialistic vs. socio-emotional) were manipulated while holding constant group membership. In Study 3, which is longitudinal, we analyzed whether identity functions change over a group life-span. Our findings suggest that identification may depend on the satisfaction of different needs. All three motivations, in Study 1, influenced the processes linked to social identity and, thus, intergroup attitudes and behaviors. In Study 2, it was found that emphasizing one class of functions or another affected the relationship between identification and ingroup bias. Study 3 showed that different functions underpinned social identity processes, being responsive to the situational constraints and demands over the life-span of the group.
