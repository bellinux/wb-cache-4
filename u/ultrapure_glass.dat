40|$|Multicomponent, homogeneous, noncrystalline oxide gels can be {{prepared}} by the sol-gel process and these gels are promising starting materials for melting glasses in the space environment. The sol-gel process referred to here {{is based on the}} polymerization reaction of alkoxysilane with other metal alkoxy compounds or suitable metal salts. Many of the alkoxysilanes or other metal alkoxides are liquids and thus can be purified by distillation. The use of gels offers several advantages such as high purity and lower melting times and temperatures. The sol-gel process is studied for utilization in the preparation of multicomponent <b>ultrapure</b> <b>glass</b> batches for subsequent containerless melting of the batches in space to prepare glass blanks for optical waveguides...|$|E
40|$|Glass rods or fibers are {{prepared}} from a polycrystalline rod by heating a short {{section of the}} rod in a first furnace to form a molten zone of the rod, heating a second short section of the rod in a second furnace to form a second molten zone and gradually moving the furnaces apart from one another to form an elongated molten float zone, which is cooled in its midsection to produce a glass rod between the molten zones. In another embodiment a single moving furnace assembly and a precursor rod with compositional gradient sections, are used, and the moving furnace traverses the rod so that the molten portion is drawn out to a degree whereby a fiber of <b>ultrapure</b> <b>glass</b> is formed...|$|E
40|$|A Space Station {{analysis}} {{study is}} being performed for NASA which identifies cost-effective Space Station options {{that can provide}} a space facility capable of performing space construction, space manufacturing, cosmological research, earth services, and other functions. A space construction base concept {{for the construction of}} large structures, such as those needed to implement satellite solar power for earth usage, will be used as a basis for discussing requirements that impact the design selection, level of integration, and operation of environmental control and life support systems (ECLSS). The space construction base configuration also provides a basic Space Station facility that can accommodate biological manufacturing modules, <b>ultrapure</b> <b>glasses</b> manufacturing modules, and modules for other services in a building-block fashion. Examples of special problems that could dictate hardware required to augment the basic ECLSS for autonomous modules will be highlighted. Additionally, overall intravehicular (IVA) and extravehicular (EVA) activities and requirements that could impact the basic station ECLSS degree of closure are discussed...|$|R
40|$|NASA's {{materials}} processing in space- (MPS) program involves both ground and space-based research and looks to frequent and cost effective {{access to the}} space environment for necessary progress. The first generation payloads for research are under active design and development. They will be hosted by the Space Shuttle/Spacelab on Earth orbital flights in the early 1980 's. hese missions {{will focus on the}} acquisition of materials behavior research data, the potential enhancement of Earth based technology, and the implementation of space based processing for specialized, high value materials. Some materials to be studied in these payloads may provide future breakthroughs for stronger alloys, <b>ultrapure</b> <b>glasses,</b> superior electronic components, and new or better chemicals. An operational 25 kW power system is expected to be operational to support sustained, systematic space processing activity beyond shuttle capability for second generation payload systems for SPACELAB and free flyer missions to study solidification and crystal growth and to process metal/alloys, glasses/ceramics, and chemicals and biologicals...|$|R
40|$|The {{benefits}} of processing glasses in a low-gravity space environment are examined. Containerless processing, {{the absence of}} gravity driven convection, and lack of sedimentation are seen as potential advantages. Potential applications include the formation of glass-ceramics with a high content of active elements for ferromagnetic devices, the production of <b>ultrapure</b> chalcogenide <b>glasses</b> for laser windows and IR fiber optics, and improved glass products for use in optical systems and laser fusion targets...|$|R
40|$|Containerless melting {{of glasses}} in {{space for the}} {{preparation}} of <b>ultrapure</b> homogeneous <b>glass</b> for optical waveguides is discussed. The homogenization of the glass using conventional raw materials is normally achieved on Earth either by the gravity induced convection currents or by the mechanical stirring of the melt. Because {{of the absence of}} gravity induced convection currents, the homogenization of glass using convectional raw materials is difficult in the space environment. Multicomponent, homogeneous, noncrystalline oxide gels can be prepared by the sol-gel process and these gels are promising starting materials for melting glasses in the space environment. The sol-gel process is based on the polymerization reaction of alkoxysilane with other metal alkoxy compounds or suitable metal salts.

40|$|The alkali-borosilicate {{system was}} {{selected}} as the glass system for the preparation of <b>ultrapure</b> low loss <b>glasses</b> suitable for optical communication. The effect of different oxide contents on the absorption loss was critically reviewed. One composition was chosen to develop the gel preparation procedure in the alkali-borosilicate system. In addition, several procedures for the preparation of gels based on two different approaches were developed. The influence of different preparation parameters were investigated qualitatively. Several conclusions are drawn from the results...|$|R
40|$|The containerless melting of high-purity {{multicomponent}} homogeneous gels and gel monoliths {{offers a}} unique approach to making <b>ultrapure</b> multicomponent optical <b>glasses</b> in the reduced gravity environment of space. Procedures for preparing and characterizing gels and gel-derived glasses {{in the system}} Na 2 O-B 2 O 3 -SiO 2 are described. Preparation {{is based on the}} polymerization reactions of alkoxysilane with trimethyl borate or boric acid and a suitable sodium compound. The chemistry of the gelling process is discussed in terms of process parameters and the gel compositions. The physicochemical nature of gels prepared by three different procedures was found to be significantly different. Infrared absorption spectra indicate finite differences in the molecular structures of the different gels. The melting of the gel powders and the transformation of porous gel monoliths to transparent 'glass' without melting are described...|$|R
