2500|$|Late in 2010, Nina {{revealed}} {{that she was}} recording a studio album set for release in mid-January 2011. It was originally set {{to be the first}} of her two-album recording deal with her new label, Universal Records. After a couple of push-backs, Stay Alive was finally released on November 19, 2011. In choosing such title for the album, she explained, [...] "It's like some people are saying that I'm gone [...] So I’m here to say that I’m still here and staying alive." [...] She called the album [...] "special" [...] {{due to the fact that}} she contributed from its musical production to the cover art design." [...] Stay Alive was a universal acclaim, being called [...] "futuristic and edgy" [...] by critics who also predicted that it [...] "may set new trends in Filipino music," [...] tagging Nina as the new [...] "dance diva." [...] Philippine Entertainment Portal praised the album, stating [...] "Stay Alive is a testament to Nina's evolution as an artist and determination to be a better performer." [...] "Dance" [...] was released on October 6, 2011 as the lead single from the album. Nina explained, [...] "The carrier single is a dance song for it to be different from my previous albums." [...] The song is described as [...] "an upbeat track with a catchy melody." [...] Its music video was released on December 9, and features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes while performing a dance routine. Due to lack of promotion, the song failed to achieve commercial success. On January 30, 2012, [...] "However Much Love" [...] was released as a radio-only pre-Valentine single. The song was critically acclaimed, being called a [...] "standout" [...] by Abby Mendoza of Philippine Entertainment Portal. It also performed well commercially, becoming Nina's first chart-topper since 2008. On February 13, she staged a pre-Valentine concert entitled <b>Update</b> <b>Your</b> Status... at the Music Museum, which supported the album. In the same month, she expressed disappointment with the album's lack of promotion, saying [...] " [...] always have a meeting, but no actions are initiated. They give us schedules that are not really followed. When it's already okay, then they cancel it." [...] On April 14, she staged another concert at the Music Museum, entitled Timeless: Tribute to a Diva, which was dedicated to late pop diva Whitney Houston. [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from Stay Alive, accompanied by a lyric video.|$|E
