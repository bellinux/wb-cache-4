Although it considered relocating, financial constraints led them in 1867 to ask member and architect Charles D. Gambrill (1832-1880) to enlarge the current structure. Gambrill's plans called for internal alterations, an expansion to the rear to accommodate an art gallery on the second floor and a billiard room on the main floor, a mansard roof, and a new <b>unified,</b> brick <b>exterior</b> trimmed with Lockport limestone.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to {{constructive}} module theory of polynomial graded commutative algebras over a field. It treats the theory of Groebner bases (GB), standard bases (SB) and syzygies as well as algorithms and their implementations. Graded commutative algebras naturally <b>unify</b> <b>exterior</b> and commutative polynomial algebras. They are graded non-commutative, associative unital algebras over fields and may contain zero-divisors. In this thesis {{we try to make}} the most use out of _a priori_ knowledge about their characteristic (super-commutative) structure in developing direct symbolic methods, algorithms and implementations, which are intrinsic to graded commutative algebras and practically efficient. For our symbolic treatment we represent them as polynomial algebras and redefine the product rule in order to allow super-commutative structures and, in particular, to allow zero-divisors. Using this representation we give a nice characterization of a GB and an algorithm for its computation. We can also tackle central localizations of graded commutative algebras by allowing commutative variables to be _local_, generalizing Mora algorithm (in a similar fashion as G. M. Greuel and G. Pfister by allowing local or mixed monomial orderings) and working with SBs. In this general setting we prove a generalized Buchberger's criterion, which shows that syzygies of leading terms play the utmost important role in SB and syzygy module computations. Furthermore, we develop a variation of the La Scala-Stillman free resolution algorithm, which we can formulate particularly close to our implementation. On the implementation side we have further developed the Singular non-commutative subsystem Plural in order to allow polynomial arithmetic and more involved non-commutative basic Computer Algebra computations (e. g. S-polynomial, GB) to be easily implementable for specific algebras. At the moment graded commutative algebra-related algorithms are implemented in this framework. Benchmarks show that our new algorithms and implementation are practically efficient. The developed framework has a lot of applications in various branches of mathematics and theoretical physics. They include computation of sheaf cohomology, coordinate-free verification of affine geometry theorems and computation of cohomology rings of p-groups, which are partially described in this thesis. ...|$|R
