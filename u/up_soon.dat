Later in the war, the rest of her armament was removed. She was reassigned for service as a seaplane depot ship at Brindisi.

She is initially forgiven, but after an argument about work, Hahn resigns from Seattle Grace, ending their relationship. New pediatric surgeon Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) kisses her, and they begin dating.
