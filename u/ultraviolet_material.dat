In particular, the growth and characterization of AlGaN alloys are discussed in detail. It was shown that AlGaN could be made n-type for x up to 1 (pure AlN). Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) studies carried out on these materials have shown that Si-doping reduces the effect of carrier localization in AlxGa 1 −xN alloys and a sharp drop in carrier localization energy occurs when the Si doping concentration increases above 1 × 1018 cm− 3, which directly correlates with the observed electrical properties. For the Mg-doped AlxGa 1 −xN alloys, p-type conduction was achieved for x up to 0. 27. From the Mg acceptor activation energy as a function of Al content, the resistivity of Mg-doped AlxGa 1 −xN with high Al contents can be estimated. For example, the projected resistivity of AlxGa 1 −xN (x= 0. 45) is around 2. 2 × 104 Ω-cm.

5000|$|Hull {{first came}} up with the idea in 1983 when he was using UV light to harden {{tabletop}} coatings. But on July 16, 1984 Alain Le Méhauté, Olivier de Witte and Jean Claude André filed their patent for the stereolithography process. It was three weeks before Chuck Hull filed his own patent for stereolithography. The application of French inventors were abandoned by the French General Electric Company (now Alcatel-Alsthom) and CILAS (The Laser Consortium). The claimed reason was “for lack of business perspective”. Hull coined the term “stereolithography” in his [...] entitled “Apparatus for Production of Three-Dimensional Objects by Stereolithography” issued on March 11, 1986. He defined stereolithography as a method and apparatus for making solid objects by successively “printing” thin layers of the <b>ultraviolet</b> curable <b>material</b> one on top of the other. In Hull’s patent, a concentrated beam of ultraviolet light is focused onto the surface of a vat filled with liquid photopolymer. The light beam, moving under computer control, draws each layer of the object onto the surface of the liquid. Wherever the beam strikes the surface, the photopolymer polymerizes/crosslinks and changes to a solid. An advanced CAD/CAM/CAE software mathematically slices the computer model of the object into a large number of thin layers. The process then builds the object layer by layer starting with the bottom layer, on an elevator that is lowered slightly after solidification of each layer.|$|R

In accordance with the forthcoming European standard the UV protection factor (UPF) of the fabrics was determined spectrophotometrically. Results Seventy-eight (33 %) fabrics had UPF 15 and 30 (30 +).
