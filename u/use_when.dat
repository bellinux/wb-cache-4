5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and {{they can also be}} dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later <b>use.</b> <b>When</b> cooked, some apple cultivars easily form a puree known as apple sauce. Apples are also made into apple butter and apple jelly. They are also used (cooked) in meat dishes.|$|E

5|$|At Great Lakes, Collier went {{regularly}} {{to observe the}} practices of the station's service football team, the Great Lakes Bluejackets. There he met Paul Brown, who had left a head coaching job at Ohio State University {{to serve in the}} Navy and lead the Bluejackets team. Collier took notes and hoped to pick up some football knowledge he could <b>use</b> <b>when</b> he returned to Paris. Brown, however, noticed Collier's dedication and brought him onto his staff as a volunteer assistant.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 14, O'Hara {{joined the}} Abbey Theatre. Though she was mentored by playwright Lennox Robinson, she found her time at the theatre disappointing. In 1934, {{at the age of}} 15, she won the first Dramatic Prize of the {{national}} competition of the performing arts, the Dublin Feis Award, for her performance as Portia in The Merchant of Venice. She trained as a shorthand typist, working for Crumlin Laundry before joining Eveready Battery Company, where she worked as a typist and bookkeeper. She later put her skills to <b>use</b> <b>when</b> she typed the script of The Quiet Man for John Ford.|$|E
5|$|By far {{the most}} {{expensive}} variant in the BA range, the Fairmont Ghia featured leather upholstery, wood grain highlights, full power options and a unique suspension assembly. The premium sound system, which incorporated a full-colour LCD screen, was standard, and the centre console stack was characterised by an analogue clock. Reverse parking sensors were available {{for the first time}} in the BA, standard on the Ghia. The sensors feature an automatic turn-off function for <b>use</b> <b>when</b> towing a boat or trailer for example.|$|E

5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh <b>use</b> <b>when</b> its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet flavour when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|In general, insulin {{is given}} at 0.1unit/kg per hour {{to reduce the}} blood sugars and {{suppress}} ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which dose to <b>use</b> <b>when</b> blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids {{generally}} have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by {{resting on the}} breast and pushing themselves forward, often {{with the help of}} their wings. The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little <b>use</b> <b>when</b> on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The bomb sight {{was also}} {{supplied}} with the Emergency Computor, a simple circular slide rule for <b>use</b> <b>when</b> the main computor stopped working. In {{this case the}} bomb aimer would dial in the same basic parameters on the various disks, and read out the proper sighting angle at the bottom. Wind had to be estimated and calculated by hand. The angles were then entered manually into the sight; the drive cables were clutched out, the aiming angle entered using the operating handle, and the drift angle set by a small locking screw.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{technologies}} in use {{to achieve the}} flashing effect. These include flashing a light bulb or LED, flashing or rotating halogen, and strobe lights, which are usually brighter than incandescent lights. Each of these can be programmed to flash singly or in groups, and can be programmed to flash in patterns (such as a left -> right pattern for <b>use</b> <b>when</b> the ambulance is parked on the left hand side of the road, indicating to other road users that they should move to the right (away from the ambulance)). Incandescent and LED lights may also be programmed to burn steadily, without flashing, which is required in some provinces.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the need}} for an {{improved}} CSBS was known in the 1930s, little work on developing such a sight was carried out. That was because an entirely new class of tachometric bombsights were being developed, which offered dramatically improved accuracy and automated much of the setup. The RAF was working on the Automatic Bomb Sight along these lines but development was slow and it had not been accepted for <b>use</b> <b>when</b> the war started. Hearing of a similar development by the US Navy, the Air Ministry began extensive negotiations in an effort to gain a licence for the Norden bombsight. The Navy constantly refused these requests, based on arguments about secrecy and various political issues. As the war started, revised versions of the CSBS, the Mk. VII and Mk. IX remained universal and the Mk. X, a more extensive improvement, was in mass production and being readied for service entry.|$|E
5|$|Altrincham {{is one of}} the few {{towns in}} North West England with an ice rink, and has had an ice hockey team since 1961, when Altrincham Ice Rink was built in Broadheath. The Altrincham Aces (later renamed the Trafford Metros) played from 1961 until 2003, when Altrincham Ice Rink closed. The town then had a three-year period without a rink or ice hockey team, until {{construction}} of the 2,500 capacity Altrincham Ice Dome was completed. Manchester Phoenix, a club having a professional presence in the English Premier Ice Hockey League and an extensive junior development aspect, relocated to the Ice Dome during the 2006–07 season, having withdrawn from competition two years earlier due to the high cost of playing matches at Manchester's MEN Arena. In 2009 the Manchester Phoenix English National Ice Hockey League team was renamed Trafford Metros, bringing the old Altrincham team's name back into <b>use.</b> <b>When</b> not being used by Phoenix the Altrincham Ice Dome is open to the public for ice skating.|$|E
5|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} weakness of these ships lay in {{their inability to}} generate sufficient electric current to power the multitude of auxiliary motors on which their advanced machinery and complex gun mountings were dependent. Their DC electrical supply was only 115V, whereas larger cruisers with power-operated turrets had a 230V system. Electrical power was generated by two Alsthom turbo-generators rated at only 120kW with two small diesel generators rated at 44/52kW for <b>use</b> <b>when</b> the ship was alongside. The latter provided only for the ship's minimum lighting and electricity needs, and fires had to be lit {{in at least one}} of the boilers in order to train the turrets or elevate the guns for practice or maintenance. Many of the auxiliary motors themselves were also seriously underpowered, particularly the servomotors for the gun mountings (which were slow to train and elevate) and for the rudder which contributed to the ship's poor maneuverability. In technological terms Mogador and Volta were ships with the armament of a light cruiser in the hull of a destroyer; the contre-torpilleur as a type had been pushed past the limits of its capabilities.|$|E

5|$|Donald Gray, who {{had found}} himself typecast after {{appearing}} in the lead role in Saber of London, a detective series, was having to resort to voice work to support his acting career. The South African actor was selected for three regular roles: Colonel White, Captain Black and the Mysterons. After his mind is hijacked in the pilot episode, Black speaks with the same voice that the Mysterons are heard to <b>use</b> <b>when</b> transmitting threats to Earth. For his portrayals of Black and his Mysteron masters, Gray's voice was electronically deepened, by running the tape at high speed whilst he was recording his lines and playing it back at normal speed, to produce a haunting effect.|$|E
5|$|Hose Company #12, {{and later}} Hose Company #11, hired the first African-American firefighters in the city. One of these {{stations}} was located at 20th and Lake Streets. One {{of the first}} African-American firefighters in Omaha was James C. Greer, Sr. {{who was a member}} of the Omaha Fire Department from May 5, 1906, to August 1, 1933, and was a captain in the department for many years. Horse-drawn wagons were in <b>use</b> <b>when</b> he was assigned to the old No. 11 Station at Thirtieth and Spaulding Streets. He later served at the No. 4 Station at Sixteenth and Izard Streets. He retired as senior captain from the Omaha Fire Department in 1933. His son Richard N. Greer served as a volunteer for the fire department in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 1847, Ezra Cornell of Ithaca, New York {{worked to}} expand telegraphic {{communication}} through the New York and Lake Erie Railroad right-of-way with the Western Union Telegraph Company, saving a telegraph line he built from New York City to Fredonia. The new telegraph {{was an instant}} hit, and was commonly used for gossip and casual chatting. The then-superintendent of the New York and Lake Erie, Charles Minot, looked to expand this new technology with the railroad. He developed a system using telegraphs for train dispatches, for <b>use</b> <b>when</b> trains would want to pass one another along the line, such as at stations. Two-letter telegraph codes were designated, and the new modern system was set up. For the ten years of the new railroad's existence, passengers had been disgusted as trains waited for hours as another train had to pass them. This new system would relieve this issue.|$|E
