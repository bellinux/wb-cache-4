50|$|A nationwide, two-year {{pilot scheme}} was {{launched}} in Finland on 1st January 2017. In total, 2,000 participants, who were randomly selected among those receiving unemployment benefits aged 25-58, are now entitled to an unconditional income of €560 per month, {{regardless of whether they}} have a paid job or not. The experiment is supposed to test whether the implementation of basic <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> could help to fight automation, long-term unemployment and lower wages. Especially people who are entrepreneurially minded, {{but at the same time}} afraid of not having financial security when starting their own businesses should be encouraged to engage in economic activity. In addition, launching the program of basic income nationwide could decrease bureaucratic costs associated with the Finnish current welfare system, which is both very complex and expensive to run.|$|E
50|$|Chile has {{maintained}} a dual {{health care system in}} which its citizens can voluntarily opt for coverage by either the public National Health Insurance Fund or any of the country's private health insurance companies. 68% of the population is covered by the public fund and 18% by private companies. The remaining 14% is covered by other not-for-profit agencies or has no specific coverage. The system's duality has led to increasing inequalities prompting the Chilean government to introduce major reforms in health care provision. Chile's health care system is funded by a <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> tax deduction equal to 7% of every worker's wage. Many private health insurance companies encourage people to pay a variable extra on top of the 7% premium to upgrade their basic health plans. Because of this arrangement, the public and private health subsystems have existed almost completely separate from each other rather than coordinating to achieve common health objectives.|$|E
5000|$|In Denmark, {{the public}} pension {{consists}} of two tiers. The first tier provides a <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> to people {{over the age of}} 65. This pension is paid to anyone that meets its qualifications, regardless of a retiree’s contributions. As of 2015, the maximum amount a person could receive was DKK 70,896( [...] USD $10,081). However, it is means tested, so it can be adjusted for higher income individuals. Normally, the pension is reduced by 30 percent of any income that exceeds DKK 301200. To receive this pension, recipients must have had lived in Denmark for 40 years while they were between the ages between 15 and 65. If a resident has spent less the 40 years in Denmark, then he or she can still receive the pension, just at a proportionately reduced rate. Funding for this pension isn’t base on contributions, rather funds are secured from general tax revenue collected by the state.|$|E

5000|$|De Keyzer is, {{among other}} things, a strong {{proponent of the}} {{principle}} of a basic <b>universal</b> <b>income.</b> In a recent article in leading Dutch-language business newspaper De Tijd he argued, [...] "A guaranteed basic income provides a solution for people with few job skills. Nowadays a lot of relatively uneducated people have too little to offer in order to warrant even the gross minimum wage. Today someone who is able to deliver only 700 euros of added value per month will not find an official job because an employer would be obliged to pay him or her not less than the gross national minimum wage of 1500 euros. This means that people with low educational qualifications remain unemployed, living on a social security allowance of 1100 euros. Setting a guaranteed basic income of 800 euros would solve the problem for both employers and the unemployed. The undereducated can get a job and will have much more left over for themselves {{at the end of the}} month than someone who is not working at all. Meanwhile the employer can afford to hire such people at a wage level that makes them worth their pay." ...|$|E
5000|$|Montebourg's months-long {{position}} in second place, however, was challenged by {{a surge of}} support for Benoît Hamon, with the primary becoming a three-man race between Valls, Hamon, and Montebourg by mid-January. Hamon's strongly left-wing program of legalizing cannabis, taxing robots to fund a universal basic income, and reducing the 35-hour workweek to 32 hours, attracted many left-wing voters disillusioned by the Socialists' turn toward business-friendly policies, championed under Hollande's presidency {{by the likes of}} Valls and Macron. The former education minister's late rise was likened to that of François Fillon in the primary of the centre-right Republicans party, his rise propelled by his championing of left-wing values and vision of a society that spends less time working, enjoys higher pay, and emphasizes the importance GDP growth less. Hamon has also decried [...] "neoconservatives" [...] and [...] "even those on the left" [...] who wished to restrict the rights of French Muslims, a less-than-subtle denunciation of Valls's hardline stance on immigration. His proposal for a <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> has been his signature policy; in the final primary debate, he insisted that it [...] "creates work" [...] and [...] "allows employees to reduce their workdays, and it can further contract and eradicate poverty," [...] and post-debate polls indicated left-wing voters consistently viewed Hamon as being the most convincing candidate.|$|E

40|$|The {{major problem}} facing Australian people without paid {{employment}} (or sufficient paid work) {{is not the}} absence of work but {{the absence of a}} decent income support mechanism. There are many ways of providing sufficient paid employment to all who desire it. Identifying ways to surmount the obstacles to full employment are by no means intellectually challenging. Langmore and Quiggan (1994) set out a detailed blueprint to reduce unemployment to 3 %. Governments, since 1974, have failed in this important task. The last Labor Government at least presented a coherent plan to train unemployed people and reduce the level of unemployment to 5 % {{by the end of this}} century (Keating 1994).

40|$|Overview: This {{report to}} the Mitchell Institute {{presents}} the outcomes of modelling the potential costs of an income contingent loan (ICL) that would form a core element of a tertiary education entitlement, as proposed in the February 2015 Mitchell Institute paper Financing tertiary education in Australia – the reform imperative and rethinking student entitlements by Mitchell Professorial Fellow Peter Noonan and Mitchell Policy Analyst Sarah Pilcher. This report, Feasibility and design of a tertiary education entitlement in Australia: Modelling and costing a <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> contingent loan, models the costs of a single income contingent loans scheme for higher education and vocational education and training (VET) students.  It seeks to quantify the largely hidden subsidies involved in income contingent loans through unpaid debt {{and the difference between}} the rate at which debt is indexed and the costs to government of borrowing to finance student debt.   Feasibility and design of a tertiary education entitlement in Australia: Modelling and costing a <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> contingent loan has been prepared by Dr Timothy Higgins and Professor Bruce Chapman, two of Australia’s leading experts on the design of income contingent loans. Background Feasibility and design of a tertiary education entitlement in Australia presents the outcomes of various financial modelling of the potential costs of applying an income contingent loan scheme to include all tertiary education students in Australia.  The modelling maps students’ projected incomes by qualification level, finding significant variation in lifetime incomes across VET and higher education qualifications. At present, there are a range of different income contingent loan schemes operating in Australia’s higher education and VET sectors. Under such schemes, students are not required to pay the upfront cost of their course. Instead, they are able to take out a loan with the government and repay the loan through the taxation system once they enter the workforce and their incomes reach a certain threshold. But these loans are not available to all students. In the VET system, those studying for Certificate III and most Certificate IV VET courses, for example, early childhood education, aged care, and hospitality, {{do not have access to}} an income contingent loan. These students must pay the cost of their course upfront – a potential barrier as fees for many of these courses are increasing.   The Mitchell Institute will draw on the Higgins and Chapman report to finalise its proposal for an integrated tertiary education funding system in Australia...|$|E
40|$|This paper surveys {{many aspects}} {{and issues of}} child labor, {{including}} its causes and effects as well as policies associated with it. Child labor {{has come to be}} considered an expression of poverty, both a cause and an effect of underdevelopment. Child labor cannot be viewed in isolation from educational, health, fertility, and technological issues; and is not necessarily an aberration but a rational household response to an adverse economic environment. With this in mind, the following proposition was supported - that forbidding children to work or making school attendance compulsory without changing the economic environment may, if effectively enforced, leave children worse off. There is a tendency to believe that income redistribution from the rich to the poor is more powerful for reducing child labor than a <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> rise. It is also indicated that child labor cuts across policy boundaries: health, education, labor market, capital security, criminal law, international peace keeping, income growth, and distribution all have a bearing on child labor. Therefore, reducing child labor cannot be regarded as just another policy issue. Child Labor,Street Children,Youth and Governance,Children and Youth,Health Monitoring&Evaluation...|$|E

40|$|To what extents are recent labour upsurges {{defensive}} struggles? I use {{the experience}} of the Argentinean Movement of Unemployed Workers (also called the Piquetero movement) as my empirical basis for discussing the contribution of unemployed workers to the current reshaping of the labour question. I offer an alternative interpretation of the Piquetero experience of resistance that emphasises their critique and alternative visions, and the transformations and alternatives that the movement put forward at a time when ‘labour’ was said to be defeated. The struggles of the unemployed workers in Argentina during the 1990 s should not be classified as a defensive struggle for inclusion in the labour market or as a demand for social security (although these demands were significant in the Piqueteros’ agenda), but rather as advancing significant changes at identity/organizational, socioeconomic and political institutional levels — changes that deserve special attention in terms of their significance for the reshaping of the labour question in the twenty-first century.

40|$|Public {{provision}} of private goods {{such as education}} is usually viewed {{as a form of}} redistribution in kind. However, does it arise when income redistribution is feasible as well? In this paper I analyse a two-dimensional model of political decision making. Society has to choose both the tax rate and the allocation of the revenues between income redistribution and public {{provision of}} education. The political process that I analyse involves endogenous parties. Parties have a unique role in the model; I assume that parties increase the commitment ability of politicians and, as a result, increase the ability of different groups in society to compromise with one another. I find that public provision of education arises as an anti-majoritarian outcome; public provision of education arises only when those who benefit from education, e. g., voters with children, are a minority. The reason is that when education is consumed only by a minority, such redistribution in kind is 'cheap' relative to <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> redistribution, i. e., it can be effectively provided even with low taxes. Public provision of education arises then as a political compromise offered by the party of the poor who benefit from education and the rich voters who prefer low taxes. Thus, when those who benefit from education are a minority, it is publicly provided. When those who benefit from education are a majority, they have to buy private education, since there is no public provision of this good. Education, redistribution, political parties. ...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the indispensability {{of the reform}} of Polish tax system. The author begins with the economic, social and political conditions of such a reform. The above background serves him for presenting the shortcomings of the present tax system. The need of tax reform with respect to socialized economy, non-socialized economy and the population has been stressed. As far as the taxes levied on socialized economy are concerned, the author postulates to replace the turnover tax with the value added tax, what would result in limiting fiscal stringency of the former. As to the income tax, the author suggests to reduce its fiscal effects. They limit the self-financing capabilities of enterprises, especially their investment capacities. With respect to taxes levied on non-socialized economy, the postulate of simplifying the forms of their assessment and collection has been put forth. The present forms are not always understandable for taxpayers and, in consequence, difficult to apply. Besides, in this way they limit the scope of private economic activity. The author formulates also the argument about the need of preparing the conception of <b>universal</b> <b>income</b> tax levied on the population. In that context he suggests {{taking into account the}} methods of shaping the level of income and prices. He ends his consideration with the thesis pointing to the urgent necessity of reforming the tax system.
