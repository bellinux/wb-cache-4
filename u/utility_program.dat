It lets you submit play counts from the player to Last.fm, view charts on what you've played and create recently added playlists. Zenses was designed and developed for use with Creative's [...] media player; however it should also work with most other MTP compatible devices. A {{new version of the}} application is currently in development by Adam Livesley.|$|E
2500|$|Disk {{formatting}} {{is usually}} {{done by a}} <b>utility</b> <b>program</b> supplied by the computer OS manufacturer; generally, it sets up a file storage directory system on the disk, and initializes its sectors and tracks. Areas of the disk unusable for storage due to flaws can be locked (marked as [...] "bad sectors") so that the operating system does not attempt to use them. This was time consuming so many environments had quick formatting which skipped the error checking process. When floppy disks were often used, disks pre-formatted for popular computers were sold. The unformatted capacity of a floppy disk {{does not include the}} sector and track headings of a formatted disk; the difference in storage between them depends on the drive's application. Floppy disk drive and media manufacturers specify the unformatted capacity (for example, 2 MB for a standard 3½-inch HD floppy). It is implied that this should not be exceeded, since doing so will most likely result in performance problems. DMF was introduced permitting 1.68 MB to fit onto an otherwise standard 3½-inch disk; utilities then appeared allowing disks to be formatted as such.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Residential Energy Consumption Survey {{undertaken}} by the Energy Information Administration in 1990 to estimate the statistical association between household income and participation in electric <b>utility</b> energy conservation <b>programs</b> and the association between participation and the electricity consumption. The results indicate that utility rebates, energy audits, load management programs and other conservation measures tend to be undertaken at greater frequency by high income households than by low income households. Participants in conservation programs tend to occupy relatively new and energy efficient residences and undertake conservation measures other than <b>utility</b> <b>programs,</b> which suggests that <b>utility</b> sponsored <b>programs</b> are substitutes for other conservation investments. Electricity consumption during 1990 is not significantly less for households participating in <b>utility</b> <b>programs</b> than for nonparticipants, which also implies that <b>utility</b> conservation <b>programs</b> are displacing other conservation investments. Apparently, <b>utility</b> <b>programs</b> are not avoiding costs of new construction and instead are transferring wealth, particularly to high income participating households...|$|R
