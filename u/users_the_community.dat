40|$|This {{creative}} project {{explains the}} process of creating and administering a university historic resource district. Objectives of this district are protection, planning, and promotion of important campus elements, both manmade and natural. The aim of the university historic resource district is the preservation of historic structures, stimulation of pride, and the possibility of the resolution of preservation - based conflicts. The campus is first inventoried to identify the resources available. Once completed, the inventoried information is evaluated. Findings are then mapped and areas of prime concentration identified. Guidelines are then established, providing a basis to improve and protect the campus character. Preservation of the dominant characteristics and unifying elements of the campus is the main focus of the guidelines. The district would be administered by an advisory committee with broad representation. The committee would review projects that the university proposes and make recommendations based on guidelines or relevant criteria. The university district is predicated on the theory that by allowing outside involvement and arriving at decisions through consensus, university users will not feel powerless toward campus decisions. The resulting cooperative effort would be beneficial to the university <b>users,</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> at large, and the university administrators. Department of ArchitectureThesis (M. S.

Applied {{in the field}} of handheld computing, toolkits are a very powerful instrument to meet the growing demand for customized mobile applications. In this paper, the theoretical principles and functionalities of user interaction toolkits are translated into a technical software concept for mobile phone games. The presented toolkit is a new internet based application allowing users to create a customized game on their desktop computer and to transfer it to handheld devices. In contrast to well known open source software development projects, no programming expertise is required. Thus, participation of innovative users is comparatively easy. In line with the open source concept, but as an extending feature to the toolkit approach, the presented solution is embedded in an online community. Thus, contributions by innovative users can be stored in a library leading to a continuously growing information pool of available components. Games and components can be passed on easily between customers, facilitating the adoption of other users ’ contributions as well as collaborative development between <b>users.</b> <b>The</b> <b>community</b> feature of the toolkit does not only provide the common toolset of online communities allowing for user-to-user communication, e. g. chats and bulletin boards, or text based contributions, e. g. recommendations, product evaluations and voting tools, but it also enables users to exchange and jointly develop actual product prototypes.

40|$|Motivation: Annotations are a {{key feature}} of many {{biological}} databases, used to convey our knowledge of a sequence to the reader. Ideally, annotations are curated manually, however manual curation is costly, time consuming and requires expert knowledge and training. Given these issues and the exponential increase of data, many databases implement automated annotation pipelines {{in an attempt to}} avoid un-annotated entries. Both manual and automated annotations vary in quality between databases and annotators, making assessment of annotation reliability problematic for <b>users.</b> <b>The</b> <b>community</b> lacks a generic measure for determining annotation quality and correctness, which we look at addressing within this article. Specifically we investigate word reuse within bulk textual annotations and relate this to Zipf's Principle of Least Effort. We use UniProt Knowledge Base (UniProtKB) as a case study to demonstrate this approach since it allows us to compare annotation change, both over time and between automated and manually curated annotations. Results: By applying power-law distributions to word reuse in annotation, we show clear trends in UniProtKB over time, which are consistent with existing studies of quality on free text English. Further, we show a clear distinction between manual and automated analysis and investigate cohorts of protein records as they mature. These results suggest that this approach holds distinct promise as a mechanism for judging annotation quality.

40|$|Issued {{jointly by}} the Health and Social Care Board and Public Health AgencyThe Health and Social Care Board and the Public Health Agency have today launched, for public {{consultation}}, a new Community Development Strategy. The consultation period will run for 12 weeks from Friday 10 June until Friday 2 September 2011. The Board and Agency want to see strong, resilient communities where everyone has good health and wellbeing, places where people look {{out for each other}} and have community pride in where they live. Residents from deprived areas in Northern Ireland experience;lower life expectancy;higher rates of emergency admission to hospital;higher rates of lung cancer;higher rates of suicide; andhigher rates of smoking and alcohol related deaths. The kinds of health and social care issues which can be improved by community development approaches include depression; isolation; falls amongst elderly people; child protection; teenage pregnancy; childhood asthma; postnatal depression; drug and alcohol abuse; and ultimately also long term conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cancer. The Board and Agency seek a number of benefits from implementing this strategy such as; a reduction in health and wellbeing inequalities, which also means addressing the social factors that affect health; strengthening partnership working with service <b>users,</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> and voluntary sectors and other organisations; strengthening families and communities; supporting volunteering and making best use of our resources. John Compton, Chief Executive of the Health and Social Care Board said: "Community development is an important way to improving health and wellbeing - driving a message that 2 ̆ 7 prevention is better than cure 2 ̆ 7 between different groups and communities, and helping to ensure the most effective use of the health and social care budget. "Now more than ever we need to work in partnership with families and communities to achieve better health and wellbeing for those living in Northern Ireland. No one organisation can meet this challenge on its own and strong partnerships are needed. "Chief Executive of the Public Health Agency, Eddie Rooney added: "Every health and social care organisation should incorporate a community development approach into their programmes, and this strategy assists them to do so. "The Board and Agency have jointly held pre-consultation workshops {{over the past few months}} across Northern Ireland on their Community Development Strategy and have engaged widely with the community and voluntary sectors. We are now keen to receive feedback from individuals, families and the wider community as your views are very important to us - they will help shape the future of community development across the province," he said.

40|$|Games are {{fundamentally}} a social activity. The {{effects of this}} foundation can be felt at every level - from the social negotiation of rules, through cooperation and collaboration between players during the game, {{to the effects of}} relationships and social status on play. Social effects can change the way the game is played, but the mechanics of games can also affect the patterns of social behaviours of the players. The arrangement of game mechanics and interfaces together defines a "social architecture". This architecture is not limited to directly social mechanics such as trading and messaging - the game design itself has a holistic effect on social activity. This dissertation frames games around these social aspects, and focuses on analysis of the patterns that emerge from these playful interactions. Firstly, a model is defined to understand games based on the social effects of play, and these effects explored based on the varying impact they have on the play experience. Mischief and deviance is also investigated as forces that challenge these social effects in and around games. Based on interaction data gathered from server logs of experimental social games, social network analysis is used as a tool to uncover the macroscopic social architectures formed by each design. This allows the use of quantitative methods {{to understand the nature of}} the relationship between game design and the social patterns that emerge around games in play. Key findings confirm that social activity follows a heavy-tailed distribution - a small number of "hardcore" players are responsible for a disproportionately large number of interactions in the community of the game. Further than this, the connections between active hardcore and the rest of the player base show that without the hardcore <b>users,</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> of games as "small worlds" would collapse, with large numbers of players being separated from the society within a game. The emergence of grouping behaviour is investigated based on the effect of social feedback. Following findings of social psychology in non-game environments, evidence is provided that highlights the effect of socio-contextual feedback on players forming strongly bound tribal groups within games. The communities formed through the play of games can be described in terms of network graphs - webs of interactions flowing around a network of players. Social network analyses of social games show the emergence of patterns of reciprocity, clustering and tribal behaviours among the players. The evidence also shows that the collections of game mechanics, or social architectures, of games have a predictable effect on the wider social patterns of the players. As such, this suggests games can be specifically engineered for social effects based on changes in the patterns of interactions, and issues around mechanical or interface elements can be identified based on anomalies observed in the network graph of player interactions. Together, this dissertation provides a link between the theoretical ideas around social play to the measurable effects of social behaviours of players within games. It proves that game designs, as mechanical systems, have a demonstrable effect on the social patterns of play, and that these patterns can be examined and used to engineer better game designs for the benefit of social experience...|$|E
