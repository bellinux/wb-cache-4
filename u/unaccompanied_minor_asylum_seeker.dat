40|$|Unaccompanied minor {{asylum seekers}} in the Netherlands are {{currently}} housed on either a large- or small-scale reception, {{provided by the}} Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum seekers (COA). Next year, large scale reception will be closed: all unaccompanied minor asylum seekers will be received in small-scale receptions, ranging from 12 to 20 young people. At small-scale receptions employees often work alone day and night, which can cause problems when they face aggression during work. There {{is a lack of}} knowledge concerning which factors influence employees’ safety when working with unaccompanied minor asylum seekers. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine employees’ experiences with safety when working alone, and to analyze which circumstances provide safe or rather unsafe working conditions. Therefore, 13 employees from different small- and large- scale receptions were interviewed. The findings showed that the participants in general do not appreciate working alone: most employees prefer working with a colleague, due to limited possibilities of responding to crises situations. Factors that influenced the experience of safety positively were a good team ambiance, active leadership and sufficient opportunities for training employees. Negative circumstances contained violent incidents towards employees, either verbal or non-verbal violence, and employees’ opportunities to transfer a <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> when necessary. Finally, none of the employees believes it responsible to work alone when a small-scale reception provides housing for more than 12 young people...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an ethnographic {{case study on}} project Safety Net, which {{provides}} psychosocial peer support for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in the Helsinki metropolitan area. About 150 underage <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> unaccompanied by family arrive in Finland yearly. Project Safety Net peer tutors visit the group homes that the children live in, and {{provide an opportunity for}} them to share their experiences in their own languages. The aims of this research were to understand the circumstances of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> and to gain insight into {{the ways in which the}} provided peer support works. This study also critically considers how child <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> are represented in the practices and rhetoric of the Finnish asylum process, and how project Safety Net relates to these representations. Methods used in this research included participant observation, interviews, and group discussions. The data was analyzed thematically and systematically. For <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> factors that increase the need for support were found to be separation from family, the inherent temporariness of the <b>asylum</b> <b>seeker</b> status and a concern for the future, language difficulties, a feeling of isolation, and developmental issues related to adolescence...|$|R
40|$|<b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> receive little {{attention}} {{by the media}} and the general public, which is why I decided to look into and clarify their situation in Slovenia. In the theoretical part legal issues concerning refugee policy, the origin, numbers and vulnerability of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Slovenia {{and the rest of the}} world are explained. Furthermore the topic of participation is presented from different points of view. The second, empirical part of the thesis is aimed to find out which institutions work with <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> and what kind of work they do. Another goal is to find out what participation possibilities <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> in everyday life and in legal issues actually have and what participation means to them. <b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> are placed in an asylum home on the outskirts of Ljubljana, which provides them with basic care under the auspices of the Ministry of Home affairs. The centre for social work is responsible for assigning legal guardians to minors and the NGO Slovene Philanthropy offers psychosocial support. <b>Minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> are therefore integrated in institutions and organisations and limited by their restrictions and offers. Formally it is possible for them to influence their life and make decisions about it, but changes come slowly and when they do, they are small. In the conclusion a suggestion is offered and discussed on how to work with <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in a more appropriate way. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this study was}} to explore how social network {{variables}} and social skills influence acculturation in a group of immigrants who came to Norway as <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> Acculturation, as measured by ethnic and host culture competence, is seen as a resource for the individual, and a necessity in order to be successful and have a sense of belonging in a given culture. Sixty-two youth who came to Norway as <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> (UMAs) between the years 2000 - 2006 were recruited from 10 municipalities in Norway. The participants completed the questionnaire in group sessions in their local communities. In accordance with assumptions, analyses revealed relatively strong relationships between culture competence, social network variables and social skills. The study confirmed prior findings of an association between ethnic culture competence and relationships with peers of the same ethnical background. In contrast, the finding that the acquisition of host culture competence was dependent on number of Norwegian friends and social support from family abroad contradicted earlier findings. Social skills significantly predicted both ethnic and host culture competence. The results indicate that social skills are an important factor in acculturation, and that social networks may be of varying importance for different groups of immigrants in the acquisition of culture competence. Future studies should include this approach in longitudinal studies with larger samples to test whether the findings can be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} aggression and the relation to moral disengagement among youth {{who came to}} Norway as <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> The aim was to examine if exposure to trauma and acculturation-related hassles predicted reactive aggression and proactive affiliation-related aggression, and if moral disengagement mediated these relations. The study was based on self-report questionnaire data from 577 youth, where 474 were males and 103 were females. They participated in the second wave of a mixed-method longitudinal study of the sociocultural integration and mental health of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> after resettlement, {{carried out by the}} Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). The participants originated mainly from Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq and Sri Lanka. At the time of the data collection, they had on average been resettled for 4. 63 years (SD = 2. 40), and their mean age was 20. 09 years (SD = 2. 61). Findings showed that the participants reported low levels of aggression. Males displayed higher levels of proactive affiliation-related aggression than females, while the gender difference for reactive aggression was non-significant. In-group hassles and perceived discrimination predicted proactive affiliation-related aggression. Moral disengagement partly mediated the relation between perceived discrimination and proactive affiliation-related aggression. Perceived discrimination was the only significant predictor of reactive aggression, but moral disengagement did not mediate the relation. The results derived from this study indicate that hassles after resettlement contributed more to aggression than pre-migration trauma. The study supports the harmful effects of discrimination, which was the most important acculturation-related contributor to aggression in this group of young refugees. The findings are discussed in light of interventions to reduce discrimination and its harmful consequences...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} how <b>unaccompanied</b> refugee <b>minors</b> {{cope with}} {{difficulties in the}} process of adaptation. More specifically, the first aim was to identify whether they face difficulties in their everyday lives in Norway, and to explore the nature of these difficulties. The second aim was to look at the coping strategies they may apply in relation to the problems. A qualitative, descriptive, phenomenological design was applied. Ten Somali boys coming to Norway as <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> were interviewed with the Private Theory Interview. They were recruited from six municipalities {{in the eastern part of}} Norway and had stayed between two and seven years in Norway at the time of the interview. Results show that this group of <b>unaccompanied</b> refugee <b>minors</b> strives with problems of poor economy, longing for their families in Somalia and discriminating treatment from others. Further findings show that they apply a wide spectre of coping strategies, mostly adaptive coping strategies, and that there are differences in the ways they cope with different problems. Informants seem to choose appropriate coping strategies to fit each specific difficulty they face. Findings indicate the importance of acknowledging unaccompanied refugee minors’ resources, to be attentive to their needs and at the same time be cautious not to make them passive...|$|R

40|$|According to the Lisbon {{strategy}} for a knowledge society, entering school plays {{a significant role}} for any young immigrant. In Belgium, this issue is very worrying, as equity between native born students and those of foreign origin seems to be lacking. Finally, the situation in French-speaking Belgium is even more difficult than in the Flemish part of the country. Also, this paper aims to explore the strategies in place to welcome and integrate these children. It portrays specific guidance devices for young newcomers and analyzes possible correlations between them and the rate of academic success. In light of particularities of the Belgian educational system especially linked {{to the fact that we}} are in a federal state with different languages of reference, our study covers the portion of the federal state where French is the official language. The targeted group is that of newcomers of age to attend secondary school. The method of analysis and synthesis of available information includes both quantitative and qualitative data. Our approach was based on the description and analysis of the context of recognition and knowledge acquisition of young students of foreign origin in secondary education. Our analysis focuses on: accessibility to education and equality of success; adequacy to requirements, consistency and efficiency, as well as effectiveness of the education system; the relevance and specific training of teachers adapted to the newcomers; sustainability of the results: the insertion and future integration of youth; and finally, various linguistic, social and psychological dimensions, as well as citizenship. The report identifies some key elements of the context of schooling for young newcomers and offers brief elements of understanding of the history of immigration in this region. Specific and general practices for integration and schooling of young migrants, including accompanied or <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> are described. Finally, these elements are analyzed in terms of accessibility standards to school education, criteria for adequacy of such education to the specificity of immigrant children and finally, criteria for system effectiveness, and practical tracks are proposed...|$|R

40|$|In 2015, the Netherlands {{were confronted}} with a strong {{increase}} in asylum applications. This high number of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> arriving in the country increased {{the pressure on the}} reception centres of The Central Agency for the Reception of <b>Asylum</b> <b>Seekers</b> (COA). At the same time, an increasing number of incidents of violence and aggression were reported in the reception centres for <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> (for example in the regular asylum seekers’ centres (azc), in the reception locations for <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> (amv), and in the emergency accommodation). A safe and manageable living environment is of high significance for the residents living in the reception locations, {{as well as for the}} COA‐employees and the society as a whole. Therefore, it is necessary to gain deeper insight into the nature of these incidents and to understand how they can be prevented or handled effectively. Furthermore, it is important to determine the extent to which COA‐employees feel equipped to deal with these incidents. Accordingly, the aim of this research report was to answer the following questions: 1) What is the nature of incidents of violence and aggression in asylum seekers’ centres?; 2) To what extent do COA‐employees feel fully equipped to prevent or handle these incidents of violence and aggression in COA reception locations, and; 3) How could (new) insights be implemented to help prevent or effectively resolve incidents of violence and aggression in the future? These questions were studied in this research project by means of four different methods: 1.) A review of the psychological literature into the characteristics of different types of aggression on the one hand, and determinants of aggression on the other hand; 2.) A statistical analysis of all incidents of violence and aggression that were registered in COA reception locations in 2016; 3.) An analysis of critical incidents, based on a survey in which 125 COA‐employees were asked to describe the incidents they felt they were able to handle effectively as well as incidents they did not feel well‐ equipped to deal with. These accounts were afterwards coded on content and type of aggression; and 4.) Interviews with 19 COA‐employees working at different types of reception locations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{explored}} inter-personal and communicative {{aspects of}} the interviews with <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minor</b> <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> The aim was to explore how child-specific aspects are {{being taken care of}} through the interview form and guardian’s support. Six persons voluntarily engaged as guardians of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> were individually interviewed with the purpose to address the research question. Data material was collected using qualitative, semi-structured interviews. The research material was analyzed and discussed {{in the light of the}} dialogical perspective on communication. Children's specific status as informants and all children's right to express their views as emphasized in the Convention on the Rights of the Child were central in this study. The study showed that the guardian's role was a significant one with respect to the formal and emotional preparation of the child for the asylum interview, support during the interview, and the follow-up of the child after the interview. The results indicated that guardians could contribute to a profound background for the <b>minor’s</b> <b>asylum</b> claim. The quality of the rapport between the interviewer and the child proved to be varying, from caring and less formal to businesslike and impersonal. Report writing and interpreter-mediated character of the interview tended to challenge the rapport building. The study showed that the communicative process could be described as schematic and highly structured, which limited the interviewer's possibilities to follow the minor's initiative. When open-ended questions were asked, children seemed to narrate their asylum stories on the layer of action and that of context, while the emotional layer stayed untouched. This indicates the possible weakness of the asylum interview with respect to its purpose, which is getting a profound and complete understanding of the child's situation from the child's perspective. The child's right to express his or her views is about a fundamental right of the child to be heard and influence decision-making. However, conducting interviews with children in a way that enables them to come forward with their views proves to be challenging. With a dialogical perspective on communication, it is possible and realistic to take care of both child-specific and legal {{aspects of the}} asylum interview. The study indicates that communication skills, which are likely to include personal elements such as skills to establish a rapport and communicate, is an important area for further development. More research on the processes in the asylum interview is needed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> are {{children}} under the age of 18 who do not have their parents or legal guardian present at the time they make a refugee protection claim in Canada. like adult refugee claimants, <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> seeking <b>asylum</b> in Canada have to prove both subjective and objective fear for the well-founded fear to be accorded Convention refugee status under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). However, a child refugee claimant may not be able to express subjective fear of persecution in the same manner as an adult refugee claimant. Inference of lack of subjective fear that can be drawn from the pre-application conduct of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> could lead to negative refugee determination. <b>Unaccompanied</b> <b>minors,</b> being not able to establish their subjective fear, though there may be objective evidence of a risk of persecution, may face denial of refugee protection.

My objective is to demonstrate that the requirement of subjective fear for the well-founded fear in section 96 of the IRPA has to be eliminated in the case of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors.</b> This will be met by showing that unaccompanied minors' right to equality under section 15 of the Canadian Charter is violated by requiring them to prove both their subjective fear and objective fear, and that this violation is not reasonable and not demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society under section 1 of the Charter.

From the social workers accounts it becomes clear that large parts of the Italian migration system needs improvement and that the current laws and regulations are not applied all over Italy due to the lack of economic resources and overall knowledge in the matter, all over the country.

40|$|THESIS 8274 This PhD study {{explores the}} {{experiences}} of asylum-seeking teenagers who have arrived in Ireland unaccompanied by parents or guardians (<b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors).</b> The arrival {{of these young people}} is a very recent phenomenon in the Irish context, beginning only in the mid- 1990 s, and reflects a change from an overall pattern of emigration from Ireland to a new pattern of immigration into the country. To date, relatively little research has been conducted in relation to the lives of these immigrants, including <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> generally and <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> specifically. The literature that has emerged - both nationally and internationally - has often neglected the ?ordinary? lives of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> prior to their departure from home. In addition, in discussions of the losses and changes that these young people encounter, their own individual perspectives have often been disregarded.

40|$|The {{findings}} of these visits to detention centres by Amnesty International is that indefinite and prolonged detention of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in Australia is a failed policy that contravenes human rights standards. The most serious and damaging conditions faced by <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in immigration detention are {{the length of}} time and the indefinite nature of their imprisonment. Among the <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> who had been in detention for extended periods, self harm and attempted suicides were talked about as a fact of life. The use of sleeping pills and other medication was also widespread. The Christmas Island Northwest Point Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) is overwhelmingly and unacceptably prison-like. The facility is too harsh to house people who have not committed a crime. Addingto the restrictive environment is the new behaviour management regime in the White compound. The Curtin IDC in Western Australia should be immediately closed for immigration detention purposes. Theremote and isolated location of the centre, as well as the extremely hot and dusty physical conditions,exacerbates the existing problems with detaining <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers.</b> Findings documented from Perth IDC, Northern IDC, Wickham Point IDC, Phosphate Hill APOD and Darwin Airport Lodge APODs 1, 2 and 3, are all illustrative of a failed system. Given the human rights abuses inherent in indefnite detention, and the excessive costs of transporting basic infrastructure, supplies and staff to such extremely inaccessible locations, Amnesty International remains appalled that this policy has continued for so long.   Recommendations In order for Australia to meet international human rights standards, Amnesty International recommends thefollowing: 1. A maximum 30 day time limit is placed on the detention of <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> so that all <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> are moved into the community once health, character and identity checks are complete. 2. Immigration detention centres that are remote and isolated be shut down as soon as possible. 3. The shift towards processing <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> in the community is expedited, with long-term detainees, families and <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> moved out as a priority. 4. In all detention centres, but particularly remote ones, <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> ability to communicate with the outside world must be significantly improved. Specifically, increases in access to both outbound and inbound telephones, Internet, external activities, and visits from the Australian community...|$|R

40|$|Objectives <b>Asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> are {{considered}} to be a particularly vulnerable group with respect to HIV. Data on the HIV prevalence among <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers,</b> however, are scarce. The aim {{of this study is to}} map the HIV prevalence among <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> who gave birth in The Netherlands. Methods We used a nationwide electronic medical records database from the community health services for <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> (MOA). The study population consisted of 4, 854 women and girls who delivered in asylum reception between 2000 and 2008. A unique electronic health data base was used and case allocation was based on ICPC-codes. Results The number of women and girls that was HIV positive during their last pregnancy was 80, of which 79 originated fromsub-Saharan Africa. The prevalence for women from this region of origin (3. 4 %) was high compared to women from all other regions of origin (0. 04 %; OR = 90. 2; 95 % CI 12. 5 - 648. 8). The highest HIV prevalence rates were found for women from Rwanda (17. 0 %) and Cameroon (13. 2 %). HIV prevalence rates were higher among women who arrived in reception without partner (OR = 1. 82; 95 % CI 0. 75 - 4. 44) and <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>minors</b> (OR = 2. 59; 95 % CI 0. 79 - 8. 49), compared to women who arrived in reception with partner. Conclusions We conclude that, among asylum-seeking women from sub-Saharan Africa giving birth in The Netherlands, the HIV prevalence is high compared to the host population. For women from other regions of origin, the prevalence is at the same level as in the host population. The high HIV prevalence underlines the importance of preventive interventions and voluntary HIV testing for sub-Saharan African <b>asylum</b> <b>seekers</b> as from shortly after arriva...|$|R
