50|$|The ligands for GPR84 suggest also a {{relationship}} between inflammation and fatty acid sensing or regulation. Medium-chain free fatty acid (FFA) with carbon chain lengths of C9 to C14. Capric acid (C10:0), <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C11:0) and lauric acid (C12:0) are the most potent described endogeneous agonists of GPR84. Not activated by short-chain and long-chain saturated and unsaturated FFAs induced in monocytes/macrophages by LPS. In addition, the activation of GPR84 in monocytes/macrophages amplifies LPS stimulated IL-12 p40 production in a concentration dependent manner. IL-12 {{plays an important role}} in promoting cell mediated immunity to eradicate pathogens by inducing and maintaining T helper 1 responses and inhibiting T helper 2 responses. Medium chain FFAs inhibited forskolin-induced cAMP production and stimulated 35SGTPgammaS binding in a GPR84-dependent manner. The EC50 values for medium-chain FFAs capric acid, <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> and lauric acid at GPR84 (4, 8, and 9 mM, respectively, in the cAMP assay). These results suggest that GPR84 activation by medium-chain FFAs is coupled to a pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o pathway. Besides medium-chain FFAs diindolylmethane was also described as GPR84 agonist. However, the target selectivity of this molecule is also questionable because diindolylmethane is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor modulator, too. Interestingly, the patent literature mentions that besides medium chain FFAs other substances as 2,5-Dihydroxy-3-undecyl(1,4)benzoquinon, Icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraynoic acid and 5S,6R-Dihydroxy-icosa-7,9,11,14-tetraenoic acid (5S,6RdiHETE) are also ligands of GPR84. These two latest molecules say against the statement that long chain FFAs are not ligands of GPR84. Based on these results it is probable that besides medium chain FFAs some long chain FFAs can also be endogeneous ligands of GPR84. Further work is needed to confirm this hypothesis.|$|E

Brade and C. Galanos, Eur. J. Biochem. 122 : 233 - 237, 1982). Sequential precipitations of LPS with water and acetone from the phenol phase yielded LPS which differed in that water-precipitable material (LPS-H 2 O; 0. 1 to 0. 4 % of the dry weight of the cells) was rough-type LPS, whereas acetone-precipitable material (LPS-Ac; 4. 6 to 5. 8 % of the dry weight) contained both rough-type LPS and high-molecular-weight material resembling smooth LPS. The LPS were chemically characterized, and they contained D-glucosamine, 4 -amino- 4 -deoxy-L-arabinose, 3 -deoxy-D-manno- 2 -octulosonic acid, D-fucose, D-galactose, D-glucose, D-mannose, and phosphate. D-Fucose was present mostly in LPS-Ac, suggesting {{that it is a}} constituent of the O antigen. The major fatty acids were ester- and amide-linked (R) - 3 -hydroxytridecanoic and ester-linked <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acids,</b> with minor amounts of ester-linked tridecanoic and (R) - 3 -hydroxyundecanoic acids. The chemical compositions of LPS-H 2 O and LPS-Ac suggested that they differ not only in their smooth or rough nature but also in the structure of their core regions. This may explain their different precipitabilities from the extraction mixture. The extraction method was also shown to be applicable to the isolation of smooth-type LPS from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Extraction of two Typhimurium strains carrying chemically different O antigens resulted in high yields (8 % of the dry weight) of LPS. Strain SH 2183, which contains the relatively hydrophobic O- 4, 5, 12 antigen yielded almost exclusively LPS-Ac, whereas the LPS of strain SH 5770, which has a hydrophilic O- 6, 7 antigen, was exclusively LPS-H 2 O.

40|$|Parasitic {{nematodes}} {{of humans}} and plants secrete a structurally novel type of fatty acid- and retinol-binding protein, FAR, into the tissues they occupy. These proteins may interfere with intercellular lipid signaling to manipulate the defense reactions of the host or acquire essential lipids for the parasites. The genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans encodes eight FAR-like proteins (Ce-FAR- 1 to - 8). These fall into three discrete groups as indicated by phylogenetic sequence comparisons and intron positions, the proteins from parasitic nematodes falling into group A. Recombinant Ce-FAR- 1 to - 7 were produced inEscherichia coli and tested for lipid binding in fluorescence-based assays. Ce-FAR- 1 to - 6 bound DAUDA (11 -((5 -dimethylaminonaphthalene- 1 -sulfonyl) amino) <b>undecanoic</b> acid),cis-parinaric <b>acid,</b> and retinol with dissociation constants in the micromolar range, whereas Ce-FAR- 7 bound the latter two lipids relatively poorly. Each protein produced a characteristic shift in peak fluorescence emission of DAUDA, and one (Ce-FAR- 5) produced a shift greater than has been observed previously for any lipid-binding protein. Selected Ce-FAR proteins were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) and differential scanning calorimetry, {{were found to be}} helix-rich, and exhibited high thermal stability (transition midpoint, 82. 7 [*]°C). CD and secondary structure predictions, however, both indicated that Ce-FAR- 7 possesses substantially less helix than the other FAR proteins. The genes encoding the Ce-FAR proteins were found to be transcribed differentially through the life cycle of C. elegans, such that Ce-far- 4 was transcribed at highest levels in the fourth larval stage, and Ce-far- 3 and - 7 predominated in males...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{quantitative}} assay for {{the transmission}} of European foulbrood (EFB) in artificially raised larvae was developed. This assay {{was used to determine}} the concentration of oxytetracycline (OTC) required to prevent larvae from developing EFB and whether 8 fatty <b>acids</b> (<b>undecanoic,</b> lauric [dodecanoic], myristic, myristoleic, ricinoleic, ricinelaidic, homo-y-linolenic and 13, 16, 19 -docosatrienoic acids) which had previously been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of Melissococcus plutonius cultures, could protect larvae from developing EFB. The larval assay involved grafting individual larva (less than 24 hours old) into a single well in a micro-titre plate. Each larva was fed 10 μL of basic larval diet (BLD) containing 500 000 M. plutonius organisms. After 3 days the larvae were also fed 60 000 Paenibacillus alvei spores (a common secondary invader associated with EFB) in 10 μL BLD. The combination of these two organisms was required to reliably produce symptoms typical of that seen in field cases of EFB. Most larvae infected using this protocol died from EFB. To determine the efficacy of OTC, EFB infected larvae were fed 0, 1, 2. 5, 5 10 or 20 μg/mL of OTC. Treatment with 1 μg/mL lowered the mortality rate from 93. 75 % to 69. 5 %. Treatments with 2. 5 μg/mL to 10 μg/mL reduced the mortality rate further whereas treatment with 20 μg/mL reduced the rate to the same as the negative control.

The amount of PHA synthesized from the degradation of 10 -cis-heptadecenoic, tridecanoic, <b>undecanoic,</b> or nonanoic <b>acids</b> was equivalent or slightly reduced in the pte 1 Delta strain compared with wild type. In contrast, a strong reduction in PHA synthesized from heptanoic acid and 8 -methyl-nonanoic acid was observed for the pte 1 Delta strain compared with wild type. The poor catabolism of 8 -methyl-nonanoic acid via beta-oxidation in pte 1 Delta negatively impacted the degradation of 10 -cis-heptadecenoic acid and reduced the ability of the cells to efficiently grow in medium containing such fatty acids. An increase in the proportion of the short chain 3 -hydroxyacid monomers was observed in PHA synthesized in pte 1 Delta cells grown on a variety of fatty acids, indicating a reduction in the metabolism of short chain acyl-CoAs in these cells. A purified histidine-tagged Pte 1 p showed high activity toward short and medium chain length acyl-CoAs, including butyryl-CoA, decanoyl-CoA and 8 -methyl-nonanoyl-CoA.

40|$|The {{similarity}} {{of the pattern}} of methyl ketones obtained from the steam distillates at atmospheric pressure of cheeses made under controlled aseptic conditions, despite the wide differences in bacterial flora, led to the suspicion that the methyl ketones were being formed as artifacts. This was confirmed by steam distilling cheeses from 1 day to 13 months old when the qualitative patterns and quantitative amounts differed little with {{the age of the}} cheese. Evidence was produced to show that the greater part of these methyl ketones must be formed during the heat treatment of milk fat. The maximum quantities of methyl ketones obtainable from cheese and from milk fat, determined by exhaustive steam distillation at atmospheric pressure, averaged from 14 p. p. m. for 2 -undecanone to 46 p. p. m. for 2 -pentadecanone. Some artifact formation of methyl ketones also occurred, although to a greatly reduced extent, when dairy products containing milk fat were steam distilled under reduced pressure at 40 °. As methyl ketones in low concentrations could be extracted from mature cheese at room temperature by solvents or by flushing cheese suspension with nitrogen, milk fat appears to contain precursors which break down to methyl ketones slowly during cheese ripening, this breakdown being accelerated at higher temperatures. Two possible modes of formation of the methyl ketones with an odd number of carbon atoms, found in limiting quantity in the steam distillates of Cheddar cheese, were considered:- (a) From precursors, probably β-keto acids, bound in milk fat. (b) The β-oxidation of free fatty acids, formed by the lipolysis of milk triglycerides, and subsequent decarboxylation of the β-keto acids formed. The use of radioactive milk fat from a lactating cow which had been injected intravenously with carboxy- 14 C acetate allowed a direct comparison to be made between the labelling patterns of fatty acids and the corresponding methyl ketones from the same milk source. The {{similarity of}} the labelling patterns suggests that the C 6 to C 16 β-keto acids and the corresponding fatty acids have a common precursor (or that one is the precursor of the other) and are together incorporated into the triglycerides. Only butyric acid of the C 4 to C 16 fatty acids in all 3 milkings had a higher specific activity than the corresponding methyl ketone. This suggests that the acetone found in steam distillates of milk fat is formed from a compound (probably D-β-hydroxybutyrate), derived almost entirely from a precursor other than acetate. The finding that the saturated C 18 acid in all 3 samples of radioactive milk fat had an extremely low activity was in agreement with the fact that no C 17 methyl ketone was detected in any of the numerous steam distillates from milk fat or cheese. This supports the generally accepted view that, in the biosynthesis of milk fat, the fatty acids up to c 16 acid are synthesised from an acetate pool, whereas C 18 acids and above are obtained from the blood triglycerides. The possibility that methyl ketones were being formed in Cheddar cheese from the β-oxidation of free fatty acids, as well as from a slow breakdown of bound β-keto acids in milk fat, was shown to be improbable. Triglycerides of <b>acids</b> (<b>undecanoic,</b> nonanoic, and heptanoic), which occur normally only in traces in milk fat, were synthesised and incorporated in Cheddar cheeses. On steam distillation of these cheeses when mature, no methyl ketones corresponding to the acids in the added triglycerides were obtained, although the normal range of methyl ketones with an odd number of carbon atoms was found in the distillates. A detailed study of the metabolism of fatty acids and synthetic triglycerides by spores and mycelium of Penicillium roqueforti was undertaken, this fungus being chosen as a general representative of lipolytic organisms that might be of importance in producing Cheddar flavour. The effect of the growth medium, pH of solution, concentration of acid and inorganic ions on both oxygen uptake and methyl ketone formation was determined. The rate of methyl ketone formation suggested the synthesis of adaptive β-keto acid decarboxylases after a lag period of 1 to 2 hours. An hypothesis based upon the possible toxicity of the C 6 to C 12 β-keto acids can explain a number of the experimental results: (1) Only one methyl ketone was formed (2) The most toxic acids were those which gave the least amount of methyl ketone (3) Concentrations of the C 8 to C 12 fatty acids that markedly inhibited the respiration of mycelium were nevertheless oxidised to considerable quantities of the corresponding methyl ketone. The relationship between the toxic action of fatty acids and chain length was found to be dependent upon pH. The chain length of the most toxic acid increased with pH, being C 10 acid at pH 2. 5 and C 12 at pH's 5. 2 and 6. 0. At pH 6. 8 none of the acids from C 4 to C 18 inhibited oxygen uptake but C 14 acid was the most toxic acid at pH 8. 0. There appeared to be no sharp dividing line between the metabolic activity, with respect to fatty acids, of spores and mycelium. Mycelium oxidised fatty acids rapidly giving varying amounts of methyl ketone but considerably more CO 2 than spores. In general spores formed higher amounts of methyl ketones than mycelium but showed also a slight but definite ability to form CO 2 from octanoic acid. Evidence for a β-oxidation mechanism in the fungal metabolism of fatty acids was obtained by the use of 1 -C 14 and 2 -C 14 octanoic acids. A relatively slow movement of intermediates through the T. C. A. cycle was also indicated. High concentrations of triglycerides were oxidised slowly by spores to methyl ketones when equivalent concentrations of the free acid (up to 66 μmoles/ml) inhibited methyl ketone formation. It seems probable that the very slow rate of formation of methyl ketones is due to the inhibitory effect of the ketones themselves on the lipases. Methyl carbinols were not detected in significant amounts as products of the metabolism of methyl ketones, evidence being obtained on the contrary that the carbinols were possibly precursors of the ketones during the oxidation of fatty acids by spores. Cell free extracts obtained from mycelium were able to oxidise low concentrations of octanoic acid (0. 5 μ-moles/ml or less) after a lag of up to 3 hours. The supplementation of the extracts with several coenzymes, known to be associated with fatty acid oxidation, or with T. C. A. cycle intermediates were unable, however, to decrease the lag before oxidation started. No methyl ketones were detected after the oxidation of fatty acids by cell-free extracts but were formed when cell debris from the Hughes Press was used. This suggests that the β-keto acid decarboxylases were tightly bound to the cell walls...|$|R

The voltammetric and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements reveal that the electron transfer at the MWNT-modified surface is faster than that observed at a MWNT-free alkyl monolayer. We have also demonstrated {{that it is possible}} to prepare MWNT micropatterns using this surface amidation reaction and a "reagentless" UV photolithography technique. Following this approach, MWNT patterns surrounded by n-dodecyl areas have been produced and the local electrochemical properties of these micropatterned surfaces have been examined by scanning electrochemical microscopy. In particular, it is demonstrated that the MWNT patterns allow a faster charge transfer which is consistent with the results obtained for the uniformly modified surfaces...|$|E

Bacteriol. 86 : 1231 – 1235. 1963. —A Flavobacterium sp. {{isolated from}} soil and grown in media containing 4 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) butyric acid metabolized ω-linked 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyalkyl carboxylic acids {{in the series}} from 3 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) propionic acid through 11 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenoxy) <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> rapidly and without a preliminary induction phase. There was no detectable oxidation of 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid. Phenols and the fatty acids corresponding to the aliphatic side chains were liberated during the decomposition of the dichlorophenoxy alkanoates from propionate to octanoate. The data indicate that the initial step in the degradation of ω-linked 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyalkyl carboxylic acids by the bacterium involves a cleavage of the ether linkage, a new mechanism for the microbial metabolism of these compounds...|$|E
40|$|An aqueous normal phase HPLC method {{coupled with}} UV or ESI/MS {{detection}} {{was used for}} the determination {{of a wide variety of}} nucleotides, essential in metabolomics studies. Fifteen nucleotides were tested in clinically relevant mixtures at levels of 100 g/mL for UV detection and 1 g/mL for ESI-MS detection. Analysis times for all protocols developed were less than 20 min. The chromatographic conditions were changed to achieve optimized retention and separation of the nucleotides studied. The aqueous normal phase-HPLC methods were developed utilizing two columns, one having a minimally modified hydride surface another having an <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> moiety on a hydride surface. Volatile, low ionic strength mobile phases were used. Negative ion mode ESI-MS at near neutral pH mobile phase, combined with a TOF detector provided a highly sensitive and specific method, which is equally suitable for quadrupole and ion trap instruments. © 2010 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Rat liver fatty acid-binding {{protein is}} able to {{accommodate}} {{a wide range of}} non-polar anions in addition to long-chain fatty acids. The two arginine residues of rat liver fatty acid-binding protein, Arg 122 and Arg 126, have been mutated and the effect of mutation on ligand binding investigated. No significant decrease in affinity for the fluorescent fatty acid analogue, 11 -(5 -dimethylaminonaphthalenesulphonyl amino) <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid,</b> or oleate was observed. However, the apparent affinity for oleoyl-CoA was slightly increased with the mutations Ala 122 and Gln 122 such that oleoyl-CoA rather than oleate became the preferred ligand for these mutants. Small changes in protein stability were observed with the Arg 122 mutations. The lack of notable ionic involvement of the conserved internal residue Arg 122 in ligand binding is consistent with the hypothesis that the mode of ligand binding in liver fatty acid-binding protein is markedly different from that of other members of this lipid-binding protein family...|$|E

40|$|Differential {{scanning}} calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray powder diffraction (PXRD) {{have been}} used to determine the phase behavior of the binary mixtures of <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (A) and undecylamine (B) in the bulk. In addition, we report DSC data that indicates very similar behavior for the solid monolayers of these materials adsorbed on the surface of graphite. The two species are found to form a series of stoichiometric complexes of the type AB, A 2 B, and A 3 B on the acid rich side of the phase diagram. Interestingly, no similar series of complexes is evident on the amine rich side. As a result of this complexation, the solid monolayers of the binary mixtures exhibit a very pronounced enhancement in stability relative to the pure adsorbates. © 2011 American Chemical Society.

40|$|In {{order to}} know the {{antifungal}} characteristics of saturated fatty acids having 6 to 12 carbons, their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) were estimated against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Fatty acids from C 6 to C 11 exhibited increasing activity with chain length, but C 12 fatty acid did not show activity at all. In relation to antifungal modes of actions fatty acids investigated showed on inhibitory activity toward the plasma membrane H+-ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Their inhibitions to the glucose-induced acidification and ATP hydrolysis caused by the proton pump {{were found to be}} in common with antifungal activities. At the test concentration of 1 nM, hexanoic acid (C 6) showed the lowest inhibition of about 30 % while <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (C 11) showed the strongest inhibition of over 90 %. In addition, as seen with antifungal activity the inhibitory activity of dodecanoic acid (C 12) was suddenly reduced to less than 50 %. ope...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{microbial}} utilization of long-chain methyl ketones was under-taken. In general, enrichment culture experiments revealed that soil microorganisms capable of utilizing these compounds as growth substrates are ubiquitous. Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria were the prominent organisms exhibiting this capability. In particular, a strain of Pseudomonas isolated from soil degraded 2 -tridecanone into several products that were recovered from cell-free culture fluid. These products were identified by gas-liquid chromatography as 2 -tridecanol, 1 -undecanol, 1 -decanol, and <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid.</b> A large amount of the substrate was converted to 1 -undecanol. This compound was characterized further by classical methods of organic analysis. Unequivocal identification of 1 -undecanol has established that some unique mechanism that involves subterminal oxidation must exist to degrade 2 -tridecanone. No such mechanism has been reported for the biological degradation of long-chain, aliphatic, methyl ketones. A pathway for utilization of 2 -tridecanone was proposed that is consistent with, but not confirmed by, the data presented...|$|E

40|$|SU- 8, an epoxy based {{negative}} photoresist polymer {{has found}} {{wide range of}} applications {{in the field of}} microfabrication based biosensors. SU- 8 surfaces need to be modified in order to immobilize bioreceptors. We studied the possibility of grafting desired functional groups by means of simple chemical treatments under normal laboratory conditions. These chemical treatments involve the use of crosslinkers that are expected to react with epoxy groups or hydroxyl groups generated by acid/alkali treatment. Here, a comparison of the results obtained on surface modification using glycine and 11 -mercapto <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> as crosslinkers is presented. Human Immunoglobin G (HIgG) was covalently immobilized to carboxylic acid on SU- 8 surface using carbodiimide/succinimide chemistry. The activity of immobilized HIgG was verified by using fluorescence imaging of FITC tagged goat anti HIgG bound to the surface. Fluorescence imaging was used to determine the chemistry best suited to functionalize SU- 8 surface for biosensor applications...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} codendrimers {{constituted}} {{by the first}} five generations of poly(propylene imine) (PPI) ionically substituted with 2 H, 2 H, 3 H, 3 H- perfluoroundecanoic acid (af) and <b>undecanoic</b> <b>acid</b> (ac) in a fixed ratio (1 : 3) (af:ac) have been synthesized and their supramolecular organization has been investigated both in the liquid crystalline state and on a surface. Incompatibility generated by combining fluorinated and perhydrogenated chains in the same molecule causes a peculiar mesomorphic behavior depending on the generation of the codendrimers. Thus smectic A, frustrated smectic A or rectangular columnar mesophases have been detected. Despite their different liquid crystalline organization, they are capable to self-assemble in homogeneous molecular length layers on a surface, namely mica as revealed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments.
