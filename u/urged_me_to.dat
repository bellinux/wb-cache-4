500|$|Hanna {{stated that}} he would accept no office in the McKinley administration, as he feared it {{would be seen as}} a reward for his {{political}} efforts. [...] He had long wished to be a senator, speaking of this desire as early as 1892. [...] Senator Sherman, now aged almost 74, faced a difficult re-election battle with the Democrats and the Foraker faction in 1898. [...] On January 4, 1897, McKinley offered Sherman the office of Secretary of State; he immediately accepted. [...] The poor record Sherman posted prior to his departure from office in 1898 led to attacks on Hanna, suggesting that a senile man had been placed in a key Cabinet position to accommodate him. Foraker, in his memoirs, strongly implied that Sherman was moved out of the way to allow Hanna to have his Senate seat. [...] An embittered Sherman stated in a letter after his departure as secretary, [...] "When [...] <b>urged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> accept the position of Secretary of State, I accepted with some reluctance and largely to promote the wishes of Mark Hanna. [...] The result was that I lost the position both of Senator and Secretary... They deprived me of the high office of Senator by the temporary appointment as Secretary of State." ...|$|E
500|$|The school’s {{refusal to}} play Ward in the Georgia Tech game later {{became part of}} the public legacy of President Gerald R. Ford. Ward {{recalled}} that he met “my man Jerry” during freshman orientation in 1932, and the two became friends and roommates when the football team traveled for road games. When Ford learned that the school had capitulated to Georgia Tech, some accounts indicate that he [...] "quit the team" [...] or threatened to quit in order [...] "to make a statement and take a stand because Willis Ward was his friend." [...] Ford wrote about the Georgia Tech incident in his autobiography, recalling that he felt the decision to keep Willis out of the game was [...] "morally wrong." [...] “I went to Willis himself. He <b>urged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> play. [...] ‘Look,’ he said, ‘the team’s having a bad year. We’ve lost two games already and we probably won’t win any more. You’ve got to play Saturday. You owe it to the team.’ [...] I decided he was right. That Saturday afternoon, we hit like never before and beat Georgia Tech 9–2.” [...] Years later, Ford wrote that the Ward incident had influenced his thinking about race. Ford noted: “His sacrifice led me to question how educational administrators could capitulate to raw prejudice.” [...] Ford used the story to voice his support for U-M’s affirmative action admissions policy saying, “Do we really want to risk turning back the clock to an era when the Willis Wards were isolated and penalized for the color of their skin, their economic standing or national ancestry?” ...|$|E

In private that evening, and on several other occasions, he <b>urged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> run for a Senate seat either in California or Wisconsin. He wasn't alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|Baldwin {{announced}} on April 10, {{two weeks before}} the national convention was held in Kansas City, Missouri, that he would make himself available for the party's nomination at the convention, while [...] "not 'running,'" [...] but continuing to seek God's will. [...] A Nolan Chart writer conveyed speculation that Baldwin's availability may have been responsive to the sudden candidacy of former ambassador Alan Keyes, who strongly favored the Iraq War. Baldwin, a noninterventionist, admitted others [...] "have <b>urged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> place my name in nomination." [...] In a convention speech, party founder Howard Phillips endorsed Baldwin and controversially referred to Keyes as a neocon and a too-recent Republican.|$|E
2500|$|Cao Xing {{refused to}} betray Lü Bu {{so he turned}} against Hao Meng and fought with his superior. During the fight, Hao Meng injured Cao Xing with his spear, but Cao managed to cut off one of Hao's arms with his sword. By then, Gao Shun had shown up to attack Hao Meng's camp and he {{beheaded}} Hao. Cao Xing was placed on a stretcher and sent to Xiapi to meet Lü Bu. Lü Bu asked him, [...] "Hao Meng was instigated by Yuan Shu. Who else {{is involved in the}} plot?" [...] Cao Xing replied, [...] "Chen Gong is an accomplice." [...] At that time, Chen Gong was nearby and he gave an obvious angry expression when his name was mentioned. Lü Bu felt that Chen Gong was his key adviser so he refused to believe the accusation. Cao Xing said, [...] "Hao Meng often <b>urged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> rebel, but I said that you, General, are like a god and cannot be defeated. Unfortunately, Hao Meng refused to believe what I told him." [...] Lü Bu then exclaimed, [...] "You're a true soldier!" [...] He treated Cao Xing well and placed him in charge of Hao Meng's men after he had recovered.|$|E

[...] My father had the task of taking all this to Zarrouk to obtain my grandfather's freedom. He {{made his way to the}} encampment where a number of tents stood. [...] Above one of them flew a flag. [...] This was the tent of General Zarrouk, who took all our fortune and freed his prisoners. Ten days later, my grandfather died from the appalling treatment he had suffered. My father did not escape unscathed either. He was conscripted into Zarrouk's army where he served for nineteen years, the longest and hardest years of his life. [...] He <b>urged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> study. [...] 'I don't want you to be brought down to the level of a beast of burden one day' he said. 'I don't want to see you like me, condemned to wear a uniform all your days.'

2500|$|Teimuraz I’s {{literary}} works addresses {{a wide range}} of topics and includes his original poems as well as translations and adaptations from Persian. This king-poet had such a universal knowledge of Persian and Georgian literature and was so proud of his innovations into the Georgian poetry, that, in his old age, Teimuraz proclaimed himself the greatest poet of Georgia and thought himself superior to the celebrated medieval Georgian author Shota Rustaveli. Although no such claim has ever been accepted by the critics of Georgian literature, {{there can be no doubt}} that his courtly and rather mannered lyricism had a certain influence on the 17th-19th-century Georgian poetry. Educated at the Safavid court, he was proficiently fluent in Persian, and his poetic language was full of Persian imagery and allusions, loanwords, and phraseology. Commenting on his interest in Persian poetry, he wrote: [...] "The sweetness of Persian speech <b>urged</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> compose the music of verse." [...] During his first creative period, 1629–34, when he was relatively secure on his throne, Teimuraz translated and adapted from Persian the romances of Layla and Majnun (Georgian: ლეილმაჯნუნიანი, Leilmajnuniani), Yusuf and Zulaikha (იოსებზილიხანიანი, Iosebzilikhaniani), The Rose and the Nightingale (ვარდბულბულიანი, Vardbulbuliani), and The Candle and the Moth (შამიფარვანიანი, Shamiparvaniani).|$|E
