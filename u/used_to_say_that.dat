5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of traditional architecture. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Microsoft {{released}} Windows 98 Second Edition, {{an interim}} release whose notable features were {{the addition of}} Internet Connection Sharing and improved WDM audio and modem support. Internet Connection Sharing {{is a form of}} network address translation, allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single Internet connection. Windows 98 Second Edition has certain improvements over the original release. Hardware support through device drivers was increased. Many minor problems present in the original Windows 98 were found and fixed which make it, according to many, the most stable release of Windows 9x family—to the extent that commentators <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Windows 98's beta version was more stable than Windows 95's final (gamma) version.|$|E

Rivers, and in after years he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he counted it his chief claim to fame that he had {{diverted}} Dr. Rivers from psychology to anthropology. In April 1898, the expedition arrived at its field of work and spent over {{a year in the}} Torres Strait Islands, and Borneo, and brought home a large collection of ethnographical specimens, some of which are now in the British Museum, but the bulk of them for one of the glories of the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, University of Cambridge. The University of Cambridge later passed the wax cylinder recordings to the British Library. The main results of the expedition are published in The Reports of the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits.|$|E
25|$|It is affectionate {{with its}} family, and gentle with the {{children}} {{and friends of the}} family. Although wary of strangers, they can accept them when it is clear that no harm is meant, but is instinctively very protective of its family, home and possessions. The Komondor is very good with other family pets, often very protective over them, but is intolerant to trespassing animals and is not a good dog for an apartment. The dog is vigilant and will rest in the daytime, {{keeping an eye on the}} surroundings, but at night is constantly moving, patrolling the place, moving up and down around the whole area. The dogs usually knock down intruders and keep them down until the owner arrives. Hungarian Komondor breeders <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> an intruder may be allowed to enter the property guarded by a Komondor, but he will not be allowed to come out again.|$|E

500|$|His contemporaries <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Lasker used a [...] "psychological" [...] {{approach}} to the game, and even that he sometimes deliberately played inferior moves to confuse opponents. Recent analysis, however, indicates that he was {{ahead of his time}} and used a more flexible approach than his contemporaries, which mystified many of them. Lasker knew contemporary analyses of openings well but disagreed with many of them. He published chess magazines and five chess books, but later players and commentators found it difficult to draw lessons from his methods.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone writer Paul Nelson wrote: [...] "Red Headed Stranger is {{extraordinarily}} ambitious, cool, tightly controlled.... Hemingway, who perfected {{an art of}} sharp outlines and clipped phrases, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the full power of his composition was accessible only between the lines; and Nelson, on this LP, ties precise, evocative lyrics to not quite remembered, never really forgotten folk melodies to create a similar effect, haunting yet utterly unsentimental. That he did not write much of the material makes his accomplishment no less singular." [...] Meanwhile, critic Robert Christgau wrote, [...] "Some of the individual pieces are quite nice, but the gestalt is the concept album at its most counterproductive—the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts unnecessarily ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{study of}} nature {{translated}} into {{his use of}} ruled geometrical forms such as the hyperbolic paraboloid, the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the cone, which reflect the forms Gaudí found in nature. Ruled surfaces are forms generated by a straight line known as the generatrix, as it moves over one or several lines known as directrices. Gaudí found abundant examples of them in nature, for instance in rushes, reeds and bones; he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{there is no better}} structure than the trunk of a tree or a human skeleton. These forms are at the same time functional and aesthetic, and Gaudí discovered how to adapt the language of nature to the structural forms of architecture. He used to equate the helicoid form to movement and the hyperboloid to light. Concerning ruled surfaces, he said: ...|$|E

500|$|Before his Berkeley {{professorship}} began, Oppenheimer {{was diagnosed}} with a mild case of tuberculosis and spent some weeks with his brother Frank at a ranch in New Mexico, which he leased and eventually purchased. When he heard the ranch was available for lease, he exclaimed, [...] "Hot dog!", and later called it Perro Caliente, literally [...] "hot dog" [...] in Spanish. Later he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> [...] "physics and desert country" [...] were his [...] "two great loves". He recovered from the tuberculosis and returned to Berkeley, where he prospered as an advisor and collaborator to a generation of physicists who admired him for his intellectual virtuosity and broad interests. His students and colleagues saw him as mesmerizing: hypnotic in private interaction, but often frigid in more public settings. His associates fell into two camps: one that saw him as an aloof and impressive genius and aesthete, the other that saw him as a pretentious and insecure poseur. His students almost always fell into the former category, adopting his walk, speech, and other mannerisms, and even his inclination for reading entire texts in their original languages. Hans Bethe said of him: ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{linguists}} {{and philosophers}} of language have criticized Fodor's self-proclaimed [...] "extreme" [...] concept nativism. Kent Bach, for example, takes Fodor {{to task for}} his criticisms of lexical semantics and polysemy. Fodor claims {{that there is no}} lexical structure to such verbs as [...] "keep", [...] "get", [...] "make" [...] and [...] "put". He suggests that, alternatively, [...] "keep" [...] simply expresses the concept KEEP (Fodor capitalizes concepts to distinguish them from properties, names or other such entities). If there is a straightforward one-to-one mapping between individual words and concepts, [...] "keep your clothes on", [...] "keep your receipt" [...] and [...] "keep washing your hands" [...] will all share the same concept of KEEP under Fodor's theory. This concept presumably locks on to the unique external property of keeping. But, if this is true, then RETAIN must pick out a different property in RETAIN YOUR RECEIPT, since one can't retain one's clothes on or retain washing one's hands. Fodor's theory also has a problem explaining how the concept FAST contributes, differently, to the contents of FAST CAR, FAST DRIVER, FAST TRACK, and FAST TIME. Whether or not the differing interpretations of [...] "fast" [...] in these sentences are specified in the semantics of English, or are the result of pragmatic inference, is a matter of debate. Fodor's own response to this kind of criticism is expressed bluntly in Concepts: [...] "People sometimes <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> exist must be ambiguous because look at the difference between 'chairs exist' and 'numbers exist'. A familiar reply goes: the difference between the existence of chairs and the existence of numbers seems, on reflection, strikingly like the difference between numbers and chairs. Since you have the latter to explain the former, you don't also need 'exist' to be polysemic." ...|$|E

40|$|There {{is a sad}} {{dissociation}} {{between the}} crucial role that research plays in improving health and the general lack of recognition of its role, importance and priority in public health policies.
