50|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that the disaster {{was due to the}} above-mentioned configuration change on the Atlas C, in addition to several weight-saving modifications unique to Missile 9C. When the Atlas was assembled at Convair, workmen attached a helium vent line to a port {{near the bottom of the}} RP-1 tank, below the anti-slosh baffles. On the Atlas B missiles, the vernier helium tank was mounted in a higher location resulting in a different fuel tank attachment point above the baffles. Helium pressure gas from the vernier propellant tanks leaked into the sustainer RP-1 turbopump, leading to cavitation which caused propellant <b>unloading,</b> <b>pump</b> overspeed, and rupture of the propellant lines. This then caused the fire that led to vehicle destruction. It was not clear whether the fire had been started by rupture of a LOX duct due to sudden pressure change from the helium venting or rubbing of the turbopump blades against the metal casing due to overspeed caused by the pump running without propellant in it. The accident was ultimately ruled to be the result of poor engineering judgement in attaching the vernier helium vent line to the bottom of the RP-1 tank.|$|E
50|$|The {{advantage}} of water ballast {{is that the}} tanks can be emptied, reducing draft or {{the weight of the}} boat (e.g. for transport on ground) and water added back in (in small boats, simply by opening up the valves and letting the water flow in) after the boat is launched or cargo <b>unloaded.</b> <b>Pumps</b> {{can also be used to}} empty the leeward ballast tank and fill the windward tank as the boat tacks, and the quantity of ballast can be varied to keep the boat at the optimum angle of heel. On empty cargo vessels water is added to ballast tanks to increase propeller immersion, to improve steering, and to control trim and draft.|$|R

40|$|Closed chest {{massage and}} {{tracheal}} intubation are not enough. The 70 % success rate promised by Kouwenhoven 31 {{years ago is}} not realised. Coronary perfusion pressure is the main goal. To achieve this a proposal of a combined new CPR is advocated which encompass the following items besides closed chest massage and tracheal intubation: (a) use of high dose methoxamine (instead of epinephrine), (b) use of continuous abdominal pressure (instead of intermittent pressure), (c) <b>unloading</b> the <b>pump,</b> which means no use of any intravenous fluids, and (d) intracardiac injection of medications until restarting of spontaneous circulation.

40|$|Early use of {{mechanical}} circulatory support, e. g. veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or left ventricular <b>unloading</b> by microaxial <b>pump</b> in refractory cardiogenic shock is recommended in current guidelines. Development of acquired von Willebrand Syndrome (AVWS) {{in patients with}} left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) and ECMO has been reported. There is {{an increasing number of}} patients treated with the Impella® CP microaxial pump for left ventricular unloading. However, the prevalence of AVWS in these high risk patients is unknown and needs to be determined. We therefore screened 21 patients (68 ± 11 years) treated with Impella® (17 for cardiogenic shock, 4 for protected PCI) for the presence of AVWS by determining von Willebrand factor multimers, VWF collagen binding capacity and VWF antigen. During the time course of Impella® support, 20 / 21 patients (95 %) developed AVWS (mean duration of support: 135 ± 114 hours, mean time from device implantation to first diagnosis of AVWS: 10. 6 ± 10. 8 hours). Our data indicate that AVWS is a common phenomenon during left ventricular <b>unloading</b> via microaxial <b>pump</b> support. Thus, AVWS has to be considered as contributing factor for potential bleeding complications in this high risk patient population, especially in the context of dual antiplatelet therapy...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundIn counterpulsation, diastolic {{augmentation}} increases coronary {{blood flow}} and systolic unloading reduces left ventricular afterload. We present {{a new approach}} with wave intensity analysis to revisit and explain counterpulsation principles. MethodsIn an acute porcine model, a standard intra-aortic balloon pump was placed in descending aorta in 4 pigs. We measured pressure and velocity with probes in left anterior descending artery and aorta during and without intra-aortic balloon pump assistance. Wave intensities of aortic and left coronary waves were derived from pressure and flow measurements with synchronization correction. ResultsWe identified predominating waves in counterpulsation. In the aorta, during diastolic augmentation, intra-aortic balloon inflation generated a backward compression wave, with a “pushing” effect toward the aortic root that translated to a forward compression wave into coronary circulation. During systolic <b>unloading,</b> intra-aortic balloon <b>pump</b> deflation generated a backward expansion wave that “sucked” blood from left coronary bed into the aorta. While this backward expansion wave translated to reduced left ventricular afterload, the “sucking” effect resulted in left coronary blood steal, as demonstrated by a forward expansion wave in left anterior descending coronary flow. The waves were sensitive to inflation and deflation timing, with just 25 ms delay from standard deflation timing leading to weaker forward expansion wave and less coronary regurgitation. ConclusionsIntra-aortic balloon pumps generate backward-traveling waves that predominantly drive aortic and coronary blood flow during counterpulsation. Wave intensity analysis of arterial circulations may provide a mechanism to explain diastolic augmentation and systolic unloading of intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation...|$|R
