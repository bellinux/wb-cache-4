This paper aims to delineate the recent progress of urban studies based on emergy, and casts back the threads in terms of Aristotelian causality. The applications of emergy to <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> can thereby be divided into four categories, which may provide a new perspective for the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> planning and management...|$|R
40|$|A {{characteristic}} of the Romanian <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> has been the alternation of the periods of order and turbulence. Order is dominant {{in the short term}} but over the longer term is no absolute stability in the dynamics of the city. Instability, at the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> level, is determined by the dynamic relationship between cities which upset the local, regional and national hierarchies, producing a disorder similar to the turbulence and even chaos. Thus the evolution of the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> in Romania in the last decades has seen the alternation of periods of stability and instability, even if on the whole there is a relatively constant hierarchy and configuration at different levels. Thus the new national <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> {{is the result of a}} chain of fluctuation affecting the inner evolutions of each city, and the categories of cities as a whole. <b>urban</b> <b>system,</b> urbanization, evolution, stability, instability...|$|R

In locomotives that are powered by high voltage alternating current, a transformer in the locomotive converts the high voltage, low current power to low voltage, high current {{used in the}} traction motors that power the wheels. Modern locomotives may use three-phase AC induction motors or direct current motors. Under certain conditions, electric locomotives are the most powerful traction. They are also the cheapest to run and provide less noise and no local air pollution. However, they require high capital investments both for the overhead lines and the supporting infrastructure, {{as well as the}} generating station that is needed to produce electricity. Accordingly, electric traction is used on <b>urban</b> <b>systems,</b> lines with high traffic and for high-speed rail.|$|E

40|$|The central {{question}} posed {{in this thesis}} is as follows: why did the apartheid <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> change over time and in space during the 1980 s? Based on {{a case study of}} Langa Uitenhage, the changes in this local <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> are explained in terms of the complex and irreducible relations of power that exist within the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> between three primary sub-systems that interacted at the local level, namely the state agencies (especially local governments and the security forces), community- and workplace-based social movements, and formal business sector, particularly the local branches of large-scale national and multi-national corporations. The primary findings of the thesis are as follows: (i) Uitenhage's <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> changed over time and in space {{as a result of the}} complex interactions and transactions between the elements of this local <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> and as a result of the dynamic interplay between this local <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> and the wider non-local urban, socio-economic and political systems within which Uitenhage's local <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> was embedded. (ii) Local urban politics can be explained as the organised expression of those interactions and transactions that resulted from conflicting conceptions of urban meaning and the corresponding urban functions and urban forms that flowed from different urban meanings. (iii) The dynamics of local urban politics cannot be explained as the epiphenomena of underlying structural contradictions. There were key moments when certain interactions occurred that decisively changed the qualitative nature of the relationships between the elements of the local <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> as a whole. Herein lies the importance of such occurances as police massacres of peaceful demonstrators, violent crowd attacks on representatives of the state, local-level negotiations and mass detentions. (iv) This local case study contributes to an explanation of <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> change and the dynamics of urban politics. However, the case study has not been designed to generate another general theory of urban sysem change or urban politics. It only demonstrated the usefulness of systems theory as a guide for case study research...|$|R

The topic is important in terms of spatial arrangements and the settlement, as it represents a network of cities and settlement and their interactions, with regard to the hierarchy of cities and settlements of various sizes and functions. In the first part of work, theoretical part, we define the topic based on existing literature, presents the established definitions of <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> and its components; present a well-established theory of central places and the concept of polycentricity. In the second part of work, we use milestones in history, an overview of studies, adopted spatial planning legislation and adopted strategies to present the development of a polycentric <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> and the design of settlements in Slovenia since the end of the 2 nd World War. With the analysis and critical assessment of the development of the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> and an analysis of progress in the development of the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> in Slovenia, we present a conformity assessment of the development of a polycentric settlement concept, according to the objectives, which were set in the adopted legislation and the adopted strategies.

40|$|Some classifications of city soils {{together}} with possibilities of operative tracking {{of the ecological}} state of <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> soil cover were considered. Data analysis of complex ecological monitoring of the soil cover was performed towards structural-functional organization of <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> and soils of city principal basic industrial enterprises and territories adjacent to artillery base complex near Novobogdanovka. The use of modern classifications of urban soils allows us to monitor the ecological state of soil of <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> and take proper measures for its optimization. The most representative indicators of the ecological status of soils for <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> are pH and heavy metals. All components of <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> must be considered as integrated structural and functional formation, where the main structural components are the administrative and territorial units - regions, and functional - industrial, residential and recreational areas of the city.

40|$|Based on archaeological data, {{this paper}} argues {{that at the}} start of the {{imperial}} period Roman North Italy had at most four cities which exceeded Pompeii in terms of physical size. Rank-size analysis shows that in this period the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> of Roman North Italy also had a far less hierarchical appearance than the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> of the same region {{at the start of}} the seventeenth century. The <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> of Roman Italy as a whole was dominated by the primate city of Rome, but if Rome is eliminated from the picture, the rank-size distribution for peninsular Italy also looks decidedly non-hierarchical. The most likely explanation is that, with the obvious exception of Rome, which was sustained by the resources of a vast empire, Roman Italy had a "modular" <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> which offered limited scope for the accumulation of resources in unusually large cities.

40|$|The {{concept of}} "spatial entropy" {{developed}} by Michael Batty (1974) was primarily {{used to test}} different hypotheses concerning the distribution and density of population in great cities like New York, London, Los Angeles. Subsequently spatial entropy was adapted in urban and regional studies, where two types of research have been outlined: - "descriptive statistics" and "MaxEnt" method (Esmer 2005). Three characteristic elements related to the three components of sustainable development (society, economy and environment) have been considered to shape the degree of entropy for the <b>urban</b> <b>system</b> Marghita, namely: population, turnover and green spaces.

40|$|A {{dominant}} {{demographic trend}} {{of the last few}} decades has been the declining size of house-holds in Western industrialized countries. Following closely upon the Baby Boom, the development became a major topic of discussion for almost two decades. The basis for, and consequences of, these changes have been well covered in the demographic literature, but their spatial implications have received less attention. Yet the, phenomenon has had a pro-found spatial impact at every level of the <b>urban</b> <b>system.</b> Recent statistics indicate that house-hold size continues to decline, but does so at a rapidly decreasing rate. The present paper considers the spatial repercussions of this trend. More specifically, the paper has three aims.
