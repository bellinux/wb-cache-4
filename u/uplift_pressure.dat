The validity of the numerical model is verified initially by comparison with the results of an analytical solution proposed by Muskat. Sub-sequently, the numerical model is tested by comparing its results to those of a well-documented case history, the Isamu Ikeda dam, in operation in northern Brazil.

5000|$|By 1977, {{construction}} on the dam had reached an advanced stage where it could begin to impound its reservoir. While filling with water, cracks {{began to appear in}} the dam on its upstream heel when the reservoir level was 42 m below its maximum operating level of 1902 m above sea level. <b>Uplift</b> <b>pressure</b> on the dam had unexpectedly increased as well and engineers worried that the structure's grout curtain had been damaged. Because the dam is in a [...] "U"-shaped valley instead of the usual [...] "V"-shaped for arch dams, hydrostatic pressure is exceptionally strong on the center-bottom (heel) upstream portion of the dam. As excessive water leaked into lower areas of the dam, the water level was drawn down and engineers increased drainage. In 1979, the grout curtain was strengthened and another full impoundment was unsuccessfully attempted. Between 1980 and 1981, a polyurethane resin grout was used to re-grout joints and they were frozen during the next impoundment attempt, allowing them to thaw naturally. As remedial works progressed, cracks near the abutments (flanks) of the dam formed as well; on the downstream side and in a horizontal direction. A plastic sheet-covered concrete blanket was laid on the upstream valley floor behind the dam between 1981 and 1983. In the next few years, the sheets had to be repaired and the grout curtain re-grouted. In 1984, the reservoir was able reach 90 percent full. In 1979 and 1983, it had temporarily reached its maximum level as well but it could not be safely sustained. In 1984, the reservoir levels were limited to 15 - 20 m below maximum, and at those levels it was able to operate safely though at reduced capacities.|$|E
40|$|Uplift water {{pressure}} {{is one of}} the dominating forces with signicant impact acting on a dam. It is usually measured with piezometers installed along the dam. However, the value of the pressure along the dam is often hard to measure due to the limited number of piezometers available (Bernstone et al., 2009). Furthermore, <b>uplift</b> <b>pressure</b> can oscillate substantially in a single hole both with time and also spatially under the dam due to the combination of rock mass characteristics in the foundation, loads and temperature variations. There is still a lack of information regarding the magnitude and variation of the <b>uplift</b> <b>pressure.</b> The aim of this thesis is to investigate the spatial variation of the <b>uplift</b> <b>pressure</b> based on <b>uplift</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements taken from Storfinnforsen and Ramsele dams. The aim is also to investigate how the <b>uplift</b> <b>pressure</b> depends on the rock mass conditions. The two dams Storfinnforsen and Ramsele provides a unique opportunity due to the signicant amount of piezometers, 270 in total, installed along the rock foundation for the new monitoring programme at the monoliths of both dams.

40|$|Failure of a {{concrete}} gravity dam during an earthquake could {{occur as a}} sliding instability along an earthquake-induced crack, possibly assisted by <b>uplift</b> <b>pressures</b> from water flowing into the crack.

Several schemes for reducing the potential for cracking during earthquake loading are investigated by finite element simulations: use of a sliding plane {{at the base of the}} dam, modification of the cross-sectional shape, use of a joint in the upper part of the clam, prestressing, and hydrodynamic isolation. The sliding plane, modified cross-section, and upper joint may only be applicable to new construction, while prestressing and hydrodynamic isolation could also be used to upgrade existing dams.

40|$|Water {{penetration}} {{from beneath}} of built structures on permeable soils causes uplift force along the contact of structure with foundation. This uplift force reduces hydraulic structure stability. Typically, these instabilities occur due to under-pressure development (uplift force), gradual inner degradation of foundation material (piping) or sand boil phenomenon. Thus, it seems necessary {{to calculate the}} pressure applied to the contact surface of the dam. One method for preventing piping phenomenon, reduction in exit gradient as well as decrease of uplift force beneath diversion dams includes implementation of weep hole.
