5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. Not only are the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>luggage</b> on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E
25|$|An {{air cargo}} complex was {{commissioned}} on 1 February 1978 for processing of import, export, and transshipment cargo, {{in addition to}} <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>luggage,</b> which is the second gateway air cargo terminal in the country after the one at Kolkata airport. The first passenger terminal was built at the north-east side of the airfield, which lies in the suburb of Meenambakkam due to which it {{was referred to as}} Meenambakkam Airport. A new terminal complex was subsequently built at Tirusulam, further south near Pallavaram to which, passenger operations were shifted. The new domestic terminal was commissioned in 1985 and the international terminal was commissioned in 1989. The old terminal building is now used as a cargo terminal and is the base for the Indian courier company Blue Dart. On 23 September 1999, a centre for flowers, fruits and vegetables was commissioned at the cargo terminal. The new international departure terminal was commissioned in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The {{transport}} of goods in the state depends mainly on lorrys, mini trucks and auto rickshaws. APS RTC, as {{a joint venture with}} ALLOY NITRIDES LIMITED was established in the year 1976, used for transportation of <b>unaccompanied</b> <b>luggage,</b> parcel/packets by their buses.|$|E
2500|$|The Clipper Maid of the Seas {{operated}} the transatlantic leg of Flight 103, which had originated at Frankfurt Airport, West Germany, on a Boeing 727. Both Pan Am and TWA routinely changed {{the type of}} aircraft operating different legs of a flight. PA103 was bookable as a single Frankfurt-New York itinerary, though a scheduled change of aircraft took place in London. At London Heathrow Airport, passengers and their luggage on the feeder flight transferred directly onto the Boeing 747, along with <b>unaccompanied</b> interline <b>luggage.</b> The aircraft pushed back from the terminal at 18:04 and took off from runway 27R at 18:25, en route for New York JFK Airport and on to Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. [...] Contrary to many popular accounts of the disaster, the flight, which had a scheduled gate departure time of 18:00, left Heathrow airport on time.|$|R
