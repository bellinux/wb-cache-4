5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to <b>uranium</b> (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of <b>uranium</b> in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted <b>uranium</b> weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process <b>uranium</b> ore, or enrich <b>uranium</b> for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to <b>uranium.</b> Houses or structures that are over <b>uranium</b> deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible exposure limit for <b>uranium</b> exposure in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, <b>uranium</b> is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|Between 1946 and 1952, <b>uranium</b> {{compounds}} were {{extracted from}} locally mined graptolitic argillite at the Sillamäe Processing Plant (now: Silmet). More than 60tonnes of <b>uranium</b> compounds (corresponding to 22.5tonnes of elemental <b>uranium)</b> were produced. Some sources note that <b>uranium</b> produced in Sillamäe {{was used for}} construction of the first Soviet atomic bomb; however, this information is not confirmed by the archive materials.|$|E
5|$|Depleted <b>uranium</b> is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted <b>uranium</b> include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted <b>uranium</b> is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted <b>uranium</b> is chemical poisoning by <b>uranium</b> oxide rather than radioactivity (<b>uranium</b> being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Ranger <b>Uranium</b> Mine in the Northern Territory and the Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam mine in South Australia {{continued}} to operate, but Nabarlek <b>Uranium</b> Mine had closed. A third <b>uranium</b> mine, Beverley <b>Uranium</b> Mine in SA, was also operating. Several advanced projects, such as Honeymoon in SA, Jabiluka in the Northern Territory and Yeelirrie in WA were on hold {{because of political}} and indigenous opposition.|$|E
5|$|Incorporated <b>uranium</b> becomes uranyl ions, which {{accumulate}} in bone, liver, kidney, and reproductive tissues. <b>Uranium</b> can be decontaminated from steel surfaces and aquifers.|$|E
5|$|Most {{ingested}} <b>uranium</b> is excreted during digestion. Only 0.5% {{is absorbed}} when insoluble forms of <b>uranium,</b> {{such as its}} oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble <b>uranium</b> compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble <b>uranium</b> compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed <b>uranium</b> tends to bioaccumulate and stay {{for many years in}} bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. <b>Uranium</b> is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by <b>uranium</b> cannot penetrate the skin.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{are banned}} in Queensland and Tasmania. <b>Uranium</b> mining was previously prohibited in New South Wales under the <b>Uranium</b> Prohibition Act of 1986, however in 2012 Premier Barry O'Farrell amended the legislation to allow prospecting and mining of <b>uranium</b> in that State.|$|E
5|$|Smith's metallurgists {{found ways}} of {{fabricating}} boron, producing beryllium bricks, and heat-treating steel. They {{also had to}} work with <b>uranium.</b> Frank Spedding had developed a large-scale process for producing pure <b>uranium</b> metal at the Ames Laboratory which was fine for producing tons of feed for the nuclear reactors, but enriched <b>uranium</b> could not be handled in this way, as it would form a critical mass. Smith was initially asked to produce cubes of <b>uranium</b> hydride, which he did, but the 1950s <b>uranium</b> hydride bomb tests were found to be inefficient, and the idea was set aside for the duration, although further work was carried out after the war. By July 1944, they were producing pure <b>uranium</b> metal in 200g amounts with a newly devised process.|$|E
5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the <b>uranium</b> metal. At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because <b>uranium</b> corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce <b>uranium</b> metal, they tried reducing <b>uranium</b> oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, <b>uranium</b> did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the <b>uranium</b> with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten <b>uranium</b> could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with <b>uranium,</b> this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>uranium</b> {{was the focus}} of multiple studies by the Ames Project. The properties of the various <b>uranium</b> oxides and <b>uranium</b> hydride were investigated. The latter of was particular interest because at one point the Los Alamos Laboratory considered using it in an atomic bomb instead of metallic <b>uranium,</b> but the idea was found to be inefficient, and was shelved. A process was developed to recovery depleted <b>uranium</b> metal from the <b>uranium</b> tetrafluoride left over from the electromagnetic isotope separation process and <b>uranium</b> hexafluoride left over from the gaseous diffusion process. This was operated as a pilot plant that produced kilogram quantities, before being turned over to the Manhattan Project's SAM Laboratories for implementation on an industrial scale at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and isolation of radium in <b>uranium</b> ore (pitchblende) by Marie Curie sparked {{the development of}} <b>uranium</b> mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of <b>uranium</b> as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of <b>uranium</b> to extract one gram of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making <b>uranium</b> glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, <b>uranium</b> tile glazes accounted {{for the bulk of}} the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, mauve, black, blue, red and other colors.|$|E
5|$|The major {{application}} of <b>uranium</b> {{in the military}} sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of depleted <b>uranium</b> (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as titanium or molybdenum. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and pyrophoricity of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable vehicle armor can also be hardened with depleted <b>uranium</b> plates. The use of depleted <b>uranium</b> became politically and environmentally contentious after {{the use of such}} munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning <b>uranium</b> compounds left in the soil (see Gulf War Syndrome).|$|E
5|$|The <b>uranium</b> {{fraction}} diagrams in {{the presence}} of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the <b>uranium</b> is converted to a hydrated <b>uranium</b> oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uranium</b> is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert <b>uranium</b> into a dissolved state. Treating the solution {{with a solution}} of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms <b>uranium</b> into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the <b>uranium</b> {{is extracted}} by reaction with hydroxides as (NH4)2U2O7 or with hydrogen peroxide as UO4·2H2O.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uranium</b> is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, or silver, and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. <b>Uranium</b> is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common <b>uranium</b> ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of <b>uranium</b> occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% <b>uranium).</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Uranium</b> metal {{reacts with}} almost all {{non-metal}} elements (with {{the exception of}} the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve <b>uranium,</b> but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, <b>uranium</b> metal becomes coated with a dark layer of <b>uranium</b> oxide. <b>Uranium</b> in ores is extracted chemically and converted into <b>uranium</b> dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.|$|E
5|$|<b>Uranium</b> ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see <b>uranium</b> mining). Low-grade <b>uranium</b> ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% <b>uranium</b> oxides. Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% <b>uranium</b> oxides on average. <b>Uranium</b> ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% <b>uranium</b> oxides U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia has a {{significant}} share of the Australia's <b>uranium</b> reserves, but between 2002 and 2008, a statewide ban on <b>uranium</b> mining was in force. The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and, as of 2010, many companies are exploring for <b>uranium</b> in Western Australia. One of the industry's major players, the mining company BHP Billiton, planned to develop the Yeelirrie <b>uranium</b> project in a 17billion dollar project. Two other projects in Western Australia are further advanced then BHP's Yeelirrie, these being the Lake Way <b>uranium</b> project, which is pursued by Toro Energy, and the Lake Maitland <b>uranium</b> project, pursued by Mega <b>Uranium.</b> But {{it is unlikely that}} any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 <b>uranium</b> prices are very low.|$|E
5|$|A {{calutron}} is a {{mass spectrometer}} originally designed {{and used for}} separating the isotopes of <b>uranium.</b> It was developed by Ernest Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention, the cyclotron. Its name was derived from California University Cyclotron, in tribute to Lawrence's institution, the University of California, where it was invented. Calutrons {{were used in the}} industrial-scale Y-12 <b>uranium</b> enrichment plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The enriched <b>uranium</b> produced was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into <b>uranium.</b> Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural <b>uranium,</b> so the separation factor of any <b>uranium</b> enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural <b>uranium.</b> The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} 4.6 billion tonnes of <b>uranium</b> {{are estimated}} to be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of <b>uranium</b> from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). There have been experiments to extract <b>uranium</b> from sea water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} a {{proposal}} {{was on the}} table to protect the <b>uranium</b> in a reactor from corrosion by jacketing it with copper. The Ames Project therefore studied uranium-copper alloys, which would occur where the <b>uranium</b> met the copper jacket. In practice, the <b>uranium</b> was canned in aluminum; this too was studied, as were alloys with tin, which was used to solder the cans. Tests were also carried out with alloys of <b>uranium</b> with beryllium, calcium, cobalt, magnesium, manganese and thorium, which were being produced or in use elsewhere in the Ames Project. Attempts were made to separate plutonium from <b>uranium</b> through metallurgy, exploiting plutonium's greater affinity with gold and silver, but the Manhattan Project chose to use the bismuth phosphate process, a chemical separation method, instead.|$|E
5|$|Before (and, occasionally, after) the {{discovery}} of radioactivity, <b>uranium</b> was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes, such as <b>uranium</b> glass and in Fiestaware.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{played a}} {{critical}} role in persuading the United States government to undertake a crash program to create an atomic bomb. When the NDRC was formed, the Committee on <b>Uranium</b> was placed under it, reporting directly to Bush as the <b>Uranium</b> Committee. Bush reorganized the committee, strengthening its scientific component by adding Tuve, George B. Pegram, Jesse W. Beams, Ross Gunn and Harold Urey. When the OSRD was formed in June 1941, the <b>Uranium</b> Committee was again placed directly under Bush. For security reasons, its name was changed to the S-1 Section.|$|E
5|$|By April 2009, {{construction}} {{had begun}} on South Australia's third <b>uranium</b> mine— the Honeymoon <b>Uranium</b> Mine. In October 2009, the Australian government was continuing {{to plan for}} a nuclear waste dump in the Northern Territory. However, there was opposition from indigenous people, the NT government, and wider NT community. In November 2009, about 100 anti-nuclear protesters assembled outside the Alice Springs parliamentary sittings, urging the Northern Territory Government not to approve a nearby <b>uranium</b> mine site.|$|E
5|$|Curie's {{systematic}} studies {{included two}} <b>uranium</b> minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was {{four times as}} active as <b>uranium</b> itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of <b>uranium</b> to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than <b>uranium.</b> She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. Pierre was increasingly intrigued by her work. By mid-1898 he was so invested in it {{that he decided to}} drop his work on crystals and to join her.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, huge {{stockpiles}} of <b>uranium</b> were amassed {{and tens of}} thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched <b>uranium</b> and plutonium made from <b>uranium.</b> Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600short tons (540metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade <b>uranium</b> (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade <b>uranium</b> or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard <b>uranium</b> and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) <b>uranium</b> in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.|$|E
5|$|Following Oppenheimer's {{reorganization}} of the Los Alamos Laboratory in July 1944, {{the work on the}} <b>uranium</b> gun-type weapon was concentrated in Francis Birch's O-1 (Gun) Group. The concept was pursued so that in case of a failure to develop an implosion bomb, at least the enriched <b>uranium</b> could be used. Henceforth the gun-type had to work with enriched <b>uranium</b> only, and this allowed the Thin Man design to be greatly simplified. A high-velocity gun was no longer required, and a simpler weapon could be substituted, one short enough to fit into a B-29 bomb bay. The new design was called Little Boy.|$|E
5|$|Francium-223, {{the only}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope of francium, {{is the product}} of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in <b>uranium</b> minerals. In a given sample of <b>uranium,</b> there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1018 <b>uranium</b> atoms. It has been calculated that there is at most 30g of francium in the earth's crust at any time, due to its extremely short half-life of 22 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing <b>uranium</b> metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with highly enriched <b>uranium</b> due to the danger of forming a critical mass. Highly enriched <b>uranium</b> was also far more valuable than natural <b>uranium,</b> {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with highly enriched <b>uranium</b> tetrafluoride.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, Eugène-Melchior Péligot, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers (Central School of Arts and Manufactures) in Paris, {{isolated}} the first sample of <b>uranium</b> metal by heating <b>uranium</b> tetrachloride with potassium.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Wilhelm Roentgen {{discovered}} {{the existence of}} X-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. In 1896, Henri Becquerel discovered that <b>uranium</b> salts emitted rays that resembled X-rays in their penetrating power. He demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from <b>uranium</b> itself. Influenced by these two important discoveries, Marie decided to look into <b>uranium</b> rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.|$|E
5|$|In 1974 and 1975 concern came {{to focus}} on <b>uranium</b> mining in Australia and several Friends of the Earth groups were formed. The Australian Conservation Foundation also began voicing concern about <b>uranium</b> mining and {{supporting}} {{the activities of the}} grass-roots organisations. Concern about the environmental effects of <b>uranium</b> mining was a significant factor and poor management of waste at an early <b>uranium</b> mine, Rum Jungle, led it to become a significant pollution problem in the 1970s. The Australian anti-nuclear movement also acquired initial impetus from notable individuals who publicly voiced nuclear concerns, such as nuclear scientists Richard Temple and Rob Robotham, and poets Dorothy Green and Judith Wright.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{seventeen}} countries produced concentrated <b>uranium</b> oxides, with Canada (27.9% {{of world}} production) and Australia (22.8%) being the largest producers and Kazakhstan (10.5%), Russia (8.0%), Namibia (7.5%), Niger (7.4%), Uzbekistan (5.5%), the United States (2.5%), Argentina (2.1%), Ukraine (1.9%) and China (1.7%) also producing significant amounts. Kazakhstan {{continues to increase}} production and may have become the world's largest producer of <b>uranium</b> by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826tonnes, compared to Canada with 11,100t and Australia with 9,430t. In the late 1960s, UN geologists also discovered major <b>uranium</b> deposits and other rare mineral reserves in Somalia. The find was the largest of its kind, with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25% of the world's then known <b>uranium</b> reserves of 800,000 tons.|$|E
5|$|In nature, <b>uranium</b> {{is found}} as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), {{uranium-235}} (0.7198–0.7202%), {{and a very}} small amount of uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%). <b>Uranium</b> decays slowly by emitting an alpha particle. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 billion years and that of uranium-235 is 704 million years, making them useful in dating {{the age of the}} Earth.|$|E
5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at alkaline pH. This {{leads to}} an increase in mobility and availability of <b>uranium</b> to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate <b>uranium</b> as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of <b>uranium</b> as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E
