40|$|China, like {{a number}} of other {{antitrust}} jurisdictions, has a law concerning <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing.</b> This article develops an economic framework for applying the <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> law in China. The framework draws on the experience of courts and competition authorities in other jurisdictions and the writings of various commentators, particularly economists, on <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> in those jurisdictions. It shows that virtually all jurisdictions have decided to consider <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> claims only in exceptional circumstances, and rarely, if ever, in innovation-intensive industries. For those cases that pass this screen and receive consideration, the courts and competition authorities then, under the leading test, insist on substantial evidence that the price is significantly higher than cost and is unfair given the value provided to the buyer. This article shows that the exceptional circumstances screen and the rigorous <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> test are motivated by a recognition, supported by substantial empirical evidence, that successful firms must have the assurance of receiving significant rewards to induce them to invest time and capital in highly risky innovation that is the source of economic growth and welfare. It concludes by showing that this approach is consistent with modern Chinese economic policy...|$|R

The study showed, researched in 1999, that urban areas lived with better means when retail prices were lower resulting from lower rice tariffs.

5000|$|Throughout {{much of the}} 1890s Roosevelt rarely {{spoke on}} anti-trust policy in his private letters and public speaking. It was not until his {{election}} as Governor of New York in November 1898, that Roosevelt began to politically sympathize with the public concern over the corporate monopolies created by the super wealthy. When Roosevelt became president in 1901 he shifted the Republican Party to a more populist direction by increasing anti-trust prosecutions. One of Roosevelt's acts as president was to deliver a 20,000-word address to Congress asking it to curb the power of large corporations (called [...] "trusts"). He also spoke in support of organized labor to further chagrin big business, but to their delight, he endorsed the gold standard, protective tariffs and lower taxes.

40|$|When and why can parties {{escape from}} a {{contract}} {{on the ground}} that the price is unfair? This question is considered in a comparative and historical perspective in English and French law. The general rule in both systems is that the parties are free to determine the price and they are then bound by their contract. One well known exception in French law, which derives from Roman law, is Article 1674 of the Code civil which allows a vendor to rescind a contract for the sale of land if the price agreed in the contract is less than five-twelfths of the fair price. It is generally thought that there are no analogous rules in English law. However, the law on this subject is in fact considerably more complex and more colourful than this simple contrast would suggest. Numerous rules on <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> in contracts were created in French law by the legislature and the courts since the promulgation of the Code civil in 1804. In English law, courts intervened in contracts on the ground of an unfair price in a few instances in the nineteenth century. However, only the rule on <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> in salvage contracts has survived until today. In both systems, the policies of preserving family wealth, protecting weak parties and giving special treatment to certain parties for economic, political, social or cultural reasons underpin these rules. There are two principal conclusions. First, freedom of contract is much less extensive in French law than in English law. This is evident in the numerous rules on <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> in contracts in French law and in the primacy of the remedy of altering the price rather than rescission. Secondly, while in theory, French courts play a much less significant role than English courts in the development of law, the creation and abolition of certain rules on <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> in contracts by French courts shows that judicial creativity in French law can be much less constrained in practice than in English law.

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the decision to}} purchase insurance against possible losses of a property or wealth. The decision involves a standard economic trade-off between the benefit of protection against loss {{and the cost of}} insurance premium. The premium is paid out of the income and decreases the consumption of other goods and services, rather than out of wealth and decreases the property or wealth. The demand for insurance depends mainly on the income and preferences. As a result, unlike in the standard model, a fair premium is neither necessary nor sufficient for the optimality of full coverage insurance. Rather, the individuals with higher incomes purchase full coverage insurance even at <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> of insurance while the individuals with lower income purchase partial coverage insurance at a fair price.

40|$|ABSTRACTLower pricing for new customers: {{consequences}} of perceived pricing unfairness among current customersThis study examines the relations {{that result from}} perceptions of pricing unfairness triggered by comparisons with the lower price paid by new clients in promotional situations. An experiment was conducted with a sample that consisted of 200 undergraduate students. The data was analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings indicate that the perception of <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing</b> is positively succeeded by negative emotions, and by the intent to switch immediately or in the future. Moreover, trust {{is affected by the}} perception of <b>unfair</b> <b>pricing,</b> since this perception may violate a client’s trust in the company. Supporting the distinction of immediate and future switching intentions, the study found that negative emotions and trust have different impacts on these two types of switching intentions. Negative word-of-mouth intention was also found to be an important consequence of the emotions that stem from the perceived injustice and from trust feelings, indicating that strong negative emotions and lower levels of trust are related to higher levels of negative word-of-mouth. This study also discusses the managerial and academic contributions of these results and the implications for future studies...|$|R

40|$|Co-location, where {{multiple}} jobs share compute nodes in large-scale HPC systems, {{has been}} shown to increase aggregate throughput and energy efficiency by 10 – 20 %. However, system operators disallow co-location due to fair-pricing concerns, i. e., a pricing mechanism that considers performance interference from co-running jobs. In the current pricing model, application execution time determines the price, which results in <b>unfair</b> <b>prices</b> paid by the minority of users whose jobs suffer from co-location. This paper presents POPPA, a runtime system that enables fair pricing by delivering precise online interference detection and facilitates the adoption of supercomputers with co-locations. POPPA leverages a novel shutter mechanism – a cyclic, fine-grained interference sampling mechanism to accurately deduce the interference between co-runners – to provide unbiased pricing of jobs that share nodes. POPPA is able to quantify inter-application interference within 4 % mean absolute error on a variety of co-located benchmark and real scientific workloads...|$|E

40|$|There is {{an undeniable}} and {{immediate}} appeal {{about the idea}} of a single world currency, analogous to that of a universal system of measurement.

One argument is about what we might like to do: In a global and inter-connected world, we should like to be able easily to assess values and prices and compare them {{from one end of the}} world to the other.

40|$|In this article, {{we study}} the antecedents of {{supplier}} innovativeness and supplier pricing. Based on an extensive literature review, we identify {{different types of}} antecedents: (1) ‘technical ’ antecedents, which include the capabilities of suppliers to innovate (such as their level of R&D investment) and (2) ‘behavioural ’ antecedents, which focus on {{the position of the}} buyer as a supplier’s preferred customer. We hypothesise that the two antecedents influence supplier innovativeness in a positive way. Furthermore, we analyse supplier pricing behaviour. We assume that suppliers ’ awareness of their capabilities to innovate might provoke them to charge <b>unfair</b> <b>prices,</b> while preferred customer status may reverse this tendency and lead to more benevolent supplier pricing behaviour. We test the conceptual framework using a sample of 166 buyer-supplier relations. We find out that technical and behavioural antecedents can explain supplier innovativeness to a large extent, with the role of preferred customer status striking out. Remarkably, whereas we expected that suppliers who are involved in innovation would be found to charge higher prices for their contributions to newly developed products, our results show that this effect is not statistically significant.
