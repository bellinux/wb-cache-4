Most of the teams in the tournament had not teamed up {{on a regular basis}} prior to the show, except for Los Nuevo Infernales. In the end, the team of El Felino, Safari and Volador Jr., who was paired up for the tournament, defeated Alan Stone, Super Crazy, and Zumbido to win the titles.|$|E

5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote. The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E

5|$|At a party {{thrown by}} himself and his wife Marge, Homer humiliates himself by getting drunk, telling off strangers, and leering at Maude Flanders' cleavage. The {{following}} day at church, Marge signs <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> weekend retreat of marriage counseling hosted by Reverend Lovejoy and his wife Helen.

5|$|Heavy {{resistance}} was encountered that {{day as the}} 2/2nd Infantry Battalion advanced towards the high ground around Oivi. They were held <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of days until outflanking moves by the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, temporarily detached to the 25th Brigade, pushed the Japanese back and enabled the brigade to continue its advance. Gorari was taken and by mid-November the brigade, having suffered 471 battle casualties since the being committed to the fighting around Kokoda, finally reached Wairopi, where the swollen Kumusi River was forded.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, Rose resurfaced with Guns N' Roses at Rock in Rio 3 to {{commence}} the decade-long Chinese Democracy Tour, though {{the majority of}} its scheduled concerts {{over the next two years}} did not take place. A critically panned surprise appearance at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards was followed by an incident in November when a riot erupted at Vancouver's General Motors Place after Rose failed to show <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> scheduled concert. When venue staff announced the cancellation, a riot broke out, resulting in an estimated $100,000 in damages. As the band's line-up continued to evolve, his constant bandmates were guitarist Richard Fortus, bassist Tommy Stinson, and keyboardists Dizzy Reed and Chris Pitman.|$|E

5|$|In June 2005, he {{suffered}} a heart attack and was treated in the United Arab Emirates. A PPP spokesman stated he underwent angioplasty in the United States. In September 2005, he did not show <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Rawalpindi hearing on corruption charges; the court issued an arrest warrant. His lawyers stated he could not come because he was recovering from his treatment. Following a request by the Rawalpindi court, Interpol issued a red notice in January 2006 against the couple which called on member nations to decide on the couple's extradition.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, he was {{released}} on bail by court order. A month later, he was unexpectedly arrested for failing to show <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> hearing on a murder case in Islamabad. He was placed under house arrest in Karachi. A day later, he {{was released}} on $5,000 bail. His release, rearrest, and then release again {{was regarded as a}} sign of growing reconciliation between Musharraf's government and the PPP. After his second release in late 2004, he left for exile in Dubai.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows <b>up.</b> <b>For</b> <b>a</b> smooth curve without crossings, the only possible singularity happens when the curve collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E

5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had also never flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's old injury {{continued}} to trouble {{him and he}} found flying high performance aircraft like the Spitfire extremely painful. RAF medics gave him two options; he could have an operation that would correct the problem, but this meant he would miss the Battle of Britain, or becoming a training instructor flying the light Tiger Moth. Johnson opted for the operation. He had hoped for discreet treatment, but word soon reached the CO, and Johnson was taken off flying duties {{and sent to the}} RAF Hospital at Rauceby. He did not return to the squadron until 28 December 1940. CO Burton took Johnson <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> test flight on 31 December 1940 in Miles Magister L8151. After the 45-minute flight, Johnson's fitness to fly was approved.|$|E
5|$|Lynch {{conceived}} South of Nowhere {{from the}} idea of a teenager's coming out after hearing that his friend's son had come out to his parents. Lynch pitched the premise to The N and was commissioned to write the pilot. After the casting process was complete, the episode was filmed in October 2004, but when the show was picked <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full season, Lynch decided to recast many of the characters and the pilot was shot again in July 2005 with the new cast. The premiere of the episode was promoted with branded MetroCards that were handed out to teenagers in Manhattan. Generally, critics reviewed the pilot positively, particularly commending its treatment of current social issues; however, some critics found the show's introduction of these issues to be forced and inauthentic.|$|E

5|$|Mackin was {{involved}} in two matches with the Wales under-17 team, against Scotland and Norway in 2001 and 2002 respectively, {{although he did not}} play in either and remained on the substitutes' bench. He was called <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> training camp and match against Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 2003 UEFA European Under-17 Championship first qualifying round, and made an appearance in this match as Wales won 2–1 to progress to the second qualifying round. He was called into the under-19 team for the Milk Cup in July 2004 and another call up came for the 2005 UEFA European Under-19 Championship qualifier against the Faroe Islands in October.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield was put <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> vote {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed {{to gain more}} support. In polls, {{a large majority of}} the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E
5|$|Officials of the Port of Port Hedland, an {{important}} iron ore exporting terminal, closed and evacuated the port by {{the morning of}} 16 March, operating under standard emergency preparedness procedure. Overall, nearly 40 ships in the port were relocated from the port {{out of the path}} of the storm. The Port of Dampier was also closed. The Port of Port Hedland reopened to shipping on 18 March, about 52 hours after its closure, with little or no damage reported, though the downtime drove iron ore prices <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time, and reduced exports of the raw material by 4.7% compared to the previous month. In total, Lua cost natural resources companies over $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in stunted industry, accounting for nearly all of the monetary losses resulting from the storm.|$|E
