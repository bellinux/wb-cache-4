White House counterterrorism advisor John O.

[...] CIA Director Leon Panetta said on PBS NewsHour: [...] "The authority here was to kill bin Laden.... Obviously under the rules of engagement, if he in fact had thrown <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> surrendered and didn't appear to be representing any kind of threat, then they were to capture him.

500|$|On May8, 1923, Hornsby {{suffered}} {{an injury to}} his left knee {{in a game against}} the Phillies when he turned to make a throw. He returned 10 days later, but the injury lingered, and he was removed from a game against the Pirates on May26 to be examined by Robert Hyland, the Cardinals' physician. Hyland had Hornsby's knee placed in a cast for two weeks, after which he returned to the Cardinals. During a game in August, Hornsby was on third base late in the game and threw <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in disgust in response to a sign flashed by Rickey; he had given the current batter the take sign, and Hornsby felt the batter should have hit the ball. After the game, he and Rickey fought in the clubhouse, but teammates quickly broke it up. Hornsby missed several games late in the year with injuries that the Cardinals (and Hyland) did not believe to be serious; as a result he was fined $500 ($ today) and suspended for the last five games of the year. However, Hornsby still won his fourth consecutive NL batting title with a batting average of [...]384. He also repeated as the leader in on-base percentage (.459) and slugging percentage (.627).|$|E
500|$|Monk {{carries out}} futile and endless {{attempts}} {{to make the world}} [...] "balanced". Monk is fixated with symmetry, {{going so far as to}} always cut his pancakes into squares. He strongly prefers familiarity and rigorous structure in his activities. Monk only drinks Sierra Springs water throughout seasons 1–5 and a fictional brand (Summit Creek) throughout seasons 6–8, to the point that in the season 2 episode [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to Mexico", Monk goes without drinking for several days because he cannot find any Sierra Springs. Monk also has great difficulty in standard social situations, so much so that he must write down common small talk phrases on note cards in an attempt to successfully socialize. While his obsessive attention to minute detail cripples him socially, it makes him a gifted detective and profiler. He has a photographic memory, and can reconstruct entire crime scenes based on little more than scraps of detail that seem unimportant to his colleagues. His trademark method of examining a crime scene, which Sharona used to call his [...] "Zen Sherlock Holmes thing", is to wander seemingly aimlessly around a crime scene, occasionally holding <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> as though framing a shot for a photograph. Shalhoub explained in an interview that Monk does this because it [...] "isolates and cuts the crime scene into slices" [...] and causes Monk to look at parts of the crime scene instead of the whole.|$|E

[...] was so amusing that Elton John reused it {{as the title of}} a 1973 album. An added Marx homage was that a poster for the Marx Brothers' movie Go West was included on the cover art.|$|E
2500|$|Although his mother, sisters, and few {{close friends}} {{themselves}} never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed. One of Gacy's friends at school recalled several {{instances in which}} Gacy Sr. ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, he witnessed an incident in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him. Gacy's mother attempted to intervene between her son and her husband. The friend recalled Gacy simply [...] "put <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to defend himself", adding that he never struck his father back during these altercations.|$|E

Mehserle voiced his fear that Grant was [...] "going for his waistband." [...] The day after the shooting, BART spokesman Jim Allison said that Grant was not restrained when he was shot, and multiple witnesses testified that Grant refused to give <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> for handcuffing prior to the shooting. [...] The family's claim against BART stated that Grant was handcuffed only after he was shot.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Hawkes {{burned to}} death in 1555 during the Marian Persecutions rather than allow his son to be baptised into the Roman Catholic Church. Responding to Edmund Bonner, the Bishop of London, who urged {{him to return to}} Catholicism, he is {{reported}} to have said: [...] "No my lord, that I will not, for if I had a hundred bodies I would suffer them all to be torn in pieces rather than I will abjure and recant." [...] As he burned, Hawkes threw <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and clapped them three times, a sign to his friends that the pain could be endured.

2500|$|In Stuart Lake's best-selling biography, [...] (1931), Earp {{added to}} the story. He {{is quoted as saying}} that Holliday's girlfriend, [...] "Big Nose Kate" [...] Horony, devised a diversion. She {{procured}} a second pistol from a friend in town, removed a horse from its shed behind the hotel, and then set fire to the shed. Everyone but Holliday and the lawmen guarding him ran to put out the fire, while she calmly walked in and tossed Holliday the second pistol. However, no contemporary records have been found of either Bailey's death or of the shed fire. In addition, Horony denied that Holliday killed [...] "a man named Bailey over a poker game, nor was he arrested and locked up in another hotel room." [...] She laughed at the idea of [...] "a 116-pound woman, standing off a deputy, ordering him to throw <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> disarming him, rescuing her lover, and hustling him to the waiting ponies." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bickerdyke {{also worked}} closely with Eliza Emily Chappell Porter of Chicago's Northwestern branch of the United States Sanitary Commission. She later worked on the first {{hospital}} boat. During the war, she became chief of nursing {{under the command of}} General Ulysses S. Grant, and served at the Battle of Vicksburg. [...] As chief of nursing, Bickerdyke sometimes deliberately ignored military procedure, and when Grant's staff complained about her behavior, Union Gen. William T. Sherman reportedly threw <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and exclaimed, [...] "She outranks me. I can't do a thing in the world." [...] Sherman acknowledged that she was [...] "one of his best generals" [...] and other officers referred to her as the [...] "Brigadier Commanding Hospitals." [...] Sherman was especially fond of this volunteer nurse, who followed the western armies. Bickerdyke held the favor of both General Sherman and General Grant, who often provided her whatever she requested of them.|$|E

2500|$|No one can {{complain}} of Clarence's lack of variety or versatility. When he really gets going he's a three-ring circus. During one number, he plays, sings, whistles a chorus, and snaps his fingers with {{the technique of}} a Spanish dancer to give further percussive accompaniment to his blues. At times he turns sideways, almost {{with his back to}} the piano as he keeps pounding away at the keyboard and stomping his feet, meanwhile continuing to sing and shout at his audience or his drummer. Suddenly in the middle of a number he jumps <b>up,</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> clasped in front of him, and walks around the piano stool, and then, unexpectedly, out booms a vocal break in a bass voice from somewhere. One second later, he has turned and is back at the keyboard, both hands flying at lightning-like pace. His actions and facial expressions are as intensely dramatic and exciting as his music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{developed}} {{friendships with}} rock star Alice Cooper—the two were photographed together for Rolling Stone magazine—and television host Dick Cavett, becoming {{a frequent guest}} on Cavett's late-night talk show, even appearing in a one-man, 90-minute interview. He befriended Elton John when the British singer was staying in California in 1972, insisting on calling him [...] "John Elton." [...] According to writer Philip Norman, when Groucho jokingly pointed his index fingers as if holding a pair of six-shooters, Elton John put <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and said, [...] "Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player," [...] thereby naming the album he had just completed. A film poster for the Marx Bros. movie Go West is visible on the album cover photograph as an homage to Groucho. Elton John accompanied Groucho to a performance of Jesus Christ Superstar.

2500|$|One famous {{crossing}} at Putney {{was that}} of Cardinal Wolsey in 1529 upon his 'disgrace' in falling out of favour with Henry VIII and on ceasing to be the holder of the Great Seal of England.

When the Cardinal had heard these words of the king, he quickly lighted from his mule and knelt down in the dirt upon both knees, holding <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> for joy, and said [...] "When I consider the joyful news that you have brought to me, I could do no less than greatly rejoice. Every word pierces so my heart, that the sudden joy surmounted my memory, having no regard or respect to the place; but I thought it my duty, that in the same place where I received this comfort, to laud and praise God upon my knees, and most humbly to render unto my sovereign lord my most hearty thanks for the same." ...|$|E

2500|$|A smaller {{composition}} in a horizontal format originated with the Venetian painter Giovanni Bellini in about 1500 and was extremely popular, {{with at least}} 34 copies or versions being produced over the following decades; the nearest to a prime version is in the National Gallery, London, though attributed to his workshop. These {{appear to have been}} commissioned for homes, possibly as votive offerings for the safe birth of an eldest son, although the reason for their popularity remains unclear. [...] They followed some other depictions in showing Simeon, the prophet of the Presentation, regarded by then as a High Priest of the Temple, performing the operation on Jesus held by Mary. In other depictions he is a figure in the background, sometimes holding <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and looking to heaven, as in the Signorelli. [...] An altarpiece of 1500 by another Venetian painter, Marco Marziale (National Gallery, London), is a thoroughgoing conflation of the Circumcision and Presentation, with the text of Simeon's prophecy, the Nunc dimittis, shown as if in mosaic on the vaults of the temple setting. There were a number of comparable works, some commissioned in circumstances where {{it is clear that the}} iconography would have had to pass learned scrutiny, so the conflation was evidently capable of theological approval, although some complaints are also recorded.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{the next}} day, Kennedy and Scanlon {{went down to}} the creek to explore, leaving McIntyre to {{attended}} to camp duty. He fired two shots out of his fowling piece at a pair of parrots. These shots were heard by Kelly, who was on the lookout for the police. At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, [...] "Bail up; throw up your arms." [...] McIntyre testified that Kelly took his fowling piece, and that all the gang members were armed. (Kelly stated that only two had guns.) Having left his revolver at the tent door, McInytre held <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> as directed. Lonigan went for cover behind a tree and, at the same time, put his hand on his revolver. Kelly shot him in the temple. He fell to the ground and said, [...] "Oh Christ, I am shot." [...] He died a few seconds later. Kelly remarked, [...] "What a pity; what made the fool run?" [...] Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his wonder that the police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied. McIntyre revealed their whereabouts and pleaded for their lives: ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was intense}} {{anticipation}} for the match against the Prime Minister's XI as the 54-year-old Sir Donald Bradman agreed to captain the team after 14 years without playing cricket. The thorough {{man that he}} was Bradman started practicing for the big day and 10,000 men, women and children came to see him bat for the last time. His old foe the MCC assistant-manager Alec Bedser agreed to play and the Bradman Pavilion was unveiled at the Manuka Oval. The Australian Prime Minister Robert Menzies was a keen cricket fan who initiated these matches in 1951 and the money raised was donated to Legacy, a charity for the dependents of deceased Australian servicemen. Ted Dexter won the toss and elected to bat with Bradman fielding at first slip they rattled the fence with 36 fours and birthday-boy Fred Trueman hit a six. David Sheppard top-scored with 72 and Colin Cowdrey made 42. Richie Benaud took 2/62 off 8 overs, but the bowling honours went to the Canberra leg-spinner G. Brown, who took 3/61. Dexter nicked a ball off Brown to Wally Grout, but was called back by Bradman when he walked as the umpire gave him not out. [...] "Lord Ted" [...] lofted the next ball to Cowper at extra-cover and walked off for 22. Dexter declared the innings at 253/7, leaving the Prime Minister's XI 254 to win and Bob Cowper (47) and Ray Flockton (45) got the home team {{off to a good}} start with 7 boundaries apiece. They had both departed and the score was 108/3 when the name of Bradman came up on the board and the great man in a baggy green cap walked out to the crease to a standing ovation, surrounded by photographers and greeted by the England team. Tom Graveney's leg-spin got him off the mark with a straight-drive and in the next over from Brian Statham the Australian politician Don Chipp hit a single to put Bradman on strike. Although it was the intention of the MCC to let Bradman get some runs, and to bat against Bedser, Statham bowled a leg-cutter which came off the inside edge, brushed the pads and bounced onto the stumps with just enough force to dislodge a bail and the Don was out. Statham threw <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in anguish and the crowd was stunned, but [...] "the little man, after on brief look back at his broken wicket, walked quickly away, the step firm, the head erect, but the shoulders, one thought, now slightly stooped. He had made one scoring stroke, for four. The crowd watched him go and signed. How much they wanted just a half-hour, at least, of him - as the Englishmen had." [...] Ironically, in his last Test 14 years before he had been bowled by Eric Hollies for a duck, four runs short of a Test average of 100.00. He reached the pavilion to the commiserations of the Prime Minister and the Duke of Norfolk and told them [...] "It wouldn't happen in a thousand years. Anyway that's my final appearance at the wicket". After this the rest of the match was an anticlimax. Neil Harvey was out for 3 and the PM's XI were 123/6 before Richie Benaud (63) and Ken Mackay (49) restored the situation, but David Allen (5/68) took three quick wickets, G. Brown was unable to bat so the PM's XI were out for 250 and the MCC won by 3 runs. Robert Menzies invited both teams to dinner and at the end of his speech presented a delighted Fred Trueman with a silver tankard as a birthday present from the Australian people. The Duke joked to the Prime Minister [...] "I suppose you know you've just destroyed the disciplinary labours of several months?" ...|$|E
