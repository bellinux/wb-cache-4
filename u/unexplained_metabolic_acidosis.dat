Hypersensitivity to cefazolin is not uncommon, and the symptoms mostly include urticaria, skin reaction, diarrhea, vomiting, and transient neutropenia, which are rarely life threatening. We present a rare case of fatal cefazolin hypersensitivity in a female who {{was diagnosed with}} multiple meningiomas and scheduled for craniotomy and tumor removal. Immediately after cefazolin IV administration, the patient developed acute hypertensive crisis, which resolved within 10 minutes after the treatment. This was followed by <b>unexplained</b> <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis.</b> The patient then developed severe brain edema 100 minutes later. The patient had facial edema when her face was exposed for the next 30 minutes. A computed tomography scan revealed global brain edema with herniation.

Single-dose administration of cefazolin for surgical prophylaxis may lead to rare, fatal adverse reaction.

40|$|<b>Metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> in {{maintenance}} dialysis patients: Clinical considerations. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> is {{a common}} consequence of advanced chronic renal failure (CRF) and maintenance dialysis (MD) therapies are not infrequently unable to completely correct the base deficit. In MD patients, severe <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> is {{associated with an increased}} relative risk for death. The chronic <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> of the severity commonly encountered in patients with advanced CRF has two well-recognized major systemic consequences. First, <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> induces net negative nitrogen and total body protein balance, which improves upon bicarbonate supplementation. The data suggest that <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> is both catabolic and antianabolic. Emerging data also indicate that <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> {{may be one of the}} triggers for chronic inflammation, which may in turn promote protein catabolism among MD patients. In contrast to these findings, <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> may be associated with a decrease in hyperleptinemia associated with CRF. Several studies have shown that correction of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> among MD patients is associated with modest improvements in the nutritional status. Second, <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> has several effects on bone, causing physicochemical dissolution of bone and cell-mediated bone resorption (inhibition of osteoblast and stimulation of osteoclast function). <b>Metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> is probably also associated with worsening of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Data on the effect of correction of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> on renal osteodystrophy, however, are limited. Preliminary evidence suggest that <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> may play a role in β 2 -microglobulin accumulation, as well as the hypertriglyceridemia seen in renal failure. Given the body of evidence pointing to the several systemic consequences of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis,</b> a more aggressive approach to the correction of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> is proposed...|$|R

We report on a severely ill infant who had ingested aspirin contained in a traditional medicine and review 21 other patients with pre-admission non-therapeutic salicylate exposure. Objectives and methods. We reviewed laboratory, clinical and poisons unit records to determine how many children were admitted to our hospital over an 18 -month period with evidence of salicylate ingestion not prescribed for therapeutic reasons. We determined the source of the salicylate, elapsed time between ingestion and laboratory assay, morbidity and mortality and final diagnosis. Results. Twenty-one children meeting our criteria, including 9 under 6 months of age, were admitted during this period. The most prevalent source of salicylate was over-the-counter (OTC) aspirin, but some had reportedly only been given traditional medicines. Nineteen were seriously ill, 4 died and 3 had severe brain injury. Two, initially diagnosed with Reye’s syndrome, probably had inherited metabolic disorders. Only 2 patients had salicylate levels {{that at the time of}} measurement are normally considered toxic; however, the literature suggests that lower levels may exacerbate illness severity in young children. Conclusions. We found inappropriate use of OTC aspirin in children that requires explanation.

40|$|The kidney {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in acid-base regulation by reabsorbing the filtered bicarbonate and excreting a net acid load by titrating the phosphate and ammonia buffers present in the urine. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> is defined by the accumulation of non-volatile acids, resulting from a deficit in urinary acidification, an increased acid generation or acid load, or a digestive or renal bicarbonate loss.

METHODS: The effects of acute respiratory and <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> (pH 7. 10) and their interactions with α and β-adrenoceptor stimulations were studied in isolated rat left ventricular papillary muscle (n= 8 per group). Intracellular pH was measured using confocal microscopy and a pH-sensitive fluorophore in isolated rat cardiomyocytes. Data are mean percentages of baseline±SD. RESULTS: Respiratory acidosis induced more pronounced negative inotropic effects than <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> did both in isotonic (45 ± 3 versus 63 ± 6 %, P< 0. 001) and isometric (44 ± 5 versus 64 ± 3 %, P< 0. 001) conditions concomitant with a greater decrease in intracellular pH (6. 85 ± 0. 07 versus 7. 12 ± 0. 07, P< 0. 001).

To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the present study is the largest study focusing on the prevalence and the prognostic impact of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> in successfully resuscitated OHCA patients. Moreover, several studies reported <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> using either pH and/or blood lactate level [19, 20]. This probably includes some patients with exclusive respiratory acidosis, especially in countries where there is no use of advanced airway in the field, and simultaneously misses some patients with compensated <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis.</b> This is the reason why we used the base deficit calculation without using pH. Furthermore, the association we observed between severity of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> and both resuscitation duration and initial rhythm may reflect the goodness-of-fit of such a measure with the degree and the duration of inadequate perfusion [21]. Thus, we showed that lactate level was an important contributor of <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> but not sufficient to exhaustively describe it [22, 23]. In the present study, acidosis strongly correlated with both lactate level and phosphorus level, highlighting the fact that <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> after OHCA is not only related to increase of lactate level but also to accumulation of unmeasured anions partially because of frequent acute kidney injury.

40|$|Objectives: We {{investigated}} {{relation of}} preoperative renal scar to incidence of postoperative <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> following ileocystoplasty {{in patients with}} neurogenic bladder. Patients: Thirty patients with neurogenic bladder, who underwent ileocystoplasty, {{were enrolled in the}} present study. Median age at ileocystoplasty was 13. 9 years and median follow-up period after ileocystoplasty was 8. 2 years. <b>Metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> was defined based on the outlined criteria: base excess (BE) is less than 0 mmol l (- 1). Preoperative examination revealed that no apparent renal insufficiency was identified in blood analysis, although preoperative Tc- 99 m-DMSA scintigraphy indicated abnormalities such as renal scar in 14 patients (47 %). Incidence of postoperative <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> was compared between patients with and without preoperative renal scar, which may reflect some extent of renal tubular damage. Results: Postoperative <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> was identified in 13 patients (43 %). Incidence of postoperative <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> was significantly higher in patients with renal scar (11 / 14, 79 %) compared with patients without renal scar (2 / 16, 13 %; P< 0. 01). Particularly, all eight patients who had bilateral renal scars showed <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> postoperatively. Compared with patients without preoperative renal scar, pH (P< 0. 05) and BE (P< 0. 01) were significantly lower postoperatively in patients with preoperative renal scar. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in PCO 2. Hyperchloremia was observed in each patient with or without preoperative renal scar. Conclusion: Incidence of postoperative <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> was significantly implicated in preoperative renal scar. If renal abnormalities are preoperatively identified in imaging tests, we need to care patients carefully regarding <b>metabolic</b> <b>acidosis</b> and subsequent comorbidities following ileocystoplasty...|$|R
