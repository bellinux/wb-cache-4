40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{application}} of computational learning techniques in practical scenarios, like for example adaptive inferential control, {{it is often difficult}} to apply the state-of-the-art techniques in a straight forward manner and <b>usually</b> <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> has to be dedicated to tuning either the data, in a form of data pre-processing, or the modelling techniques, in form of optimal parameter search or modification of the training algorithm. In this work we present a robust approach to on-line predictive modelling which is focusing on dealing with challenges like noisy data, data outliers and in particular drifting data which are often present in industrial data sets. The approach is based on the local learning approach, where models of limited complexity focus on partitions of the input space and on an ensemble building technique which combines the predictions of the particular local models into the final predicted value. Furthermore, the technique provides the means for on-line adaptation and can thus be deployed in a dynamic environment which is demonstrated in this work in terms of an application of the presented approach to a raw industrial data set exhibiting drifting data, outliers, missing values and measurement noise...|$|E
40|$|Glitches {{represent}} a great danger for hardware implementations of cryptographic schemes. Their intrinsic random nature makes them difficult to tackle and their occurrence threatens side-channel protections. Although countermeasures aiming at structurally {{solving the problem}} already exist, they <b>usually</b> require <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> to be applied or introduce non-negligible overhead in the design. Our work addresses the gap between such countermeasures and the na ive implementation of schemes being vulnerable {{in the presence of}} glitches. Our contribution is twofold: (1) we expand the mathematical framework proposed by Brzozowski and Esik (FMSD 2003) by meaningfully adding the notion of information leakage, (2) thanks to which we define a formal methodology for the analysis of vulnerabilities in combinatorial circuits when glitches are taken into account...|$|R
40|$|LIDAR is {{a useful}} tool for quickly digitalizing real world objects, but it <b>usually</b> takes <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> to produce a {{recognizable}} object from the raw input. When the object is a tree, the challenge is to create a three-dimensional model that represents its general shape, while avoiding the influence of undersampling and noise. In the method developed for this research, the user creates a sketch overlaying a display of the raw input data. Each node in the sketch creates an estimated slice of the tree skeleton at that point, and the slices are connected according to the connectivity of the sketch. Both user-guided and automated sketches are tested. Analysis is performed by simulating the LIDAR scan process on pre-existing three-dimensional tree models, and then comparing the surface of the reconstruction to that of the original. The results of the method are presented on scans of both synthetic and real trees. It is shown that the output meshes follow the general shapes of the trees, although the influence of undersampling and noise can still be found. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Usually,</b> <b>some</b> severe <b>efforts</b> are {{required}} to obtain tribological parameters like Archardâ€™s wear depth parameter kd. Complex tribological experiments {{have to be performed}} and analyzed. The paper features an approach where such parameters are extracted from effective interaction potentials in combination with more physical-oriented measurements, such as Nanoindentation and physical scratch. Thereby, the effective potentials are built up and fed from such tests. By using effective material potentials one can derive critical loading situations leading to failure (decomposition strength) for any contact situation. A subsequent connection of these decomposition or failure states with the corresponding stress or strain distributions allows the development of rather comprehensive tribological parameter models, applicable in wear and fatigue simulations, as demonstrated in this work. From this, a new relatively general wear model has been developed {{on the basis of the}} effective indenter concept by using the extended Hertzian approach for a great variety of loading situations. The models do not only allow to analyze certain tribological experiments, such as the well known pin-on disk test or the more recently developed nano-fretting test, but also to forward simulate such tests and even give hints for structured optimization or result in better component life-time prediction. The work will show how the procedure has to be applied in general and a small selection of practical examples will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It is {{desirable}} to automatically learn {{the effects of}} actions in an unknown environment. C 4. 5 {{has been used to}} discover associations, and it {{can also be used to}} find causal rules. Its output consists of rules that predict the value of a decision attribute using some condition attributes. Integrating C 4. 5 's results in other applications <b>usually</b> requires spending <b>some</b> <b>effort</b> in translating them into a suitable format. We have modified standard C 4. 5 so it will optionally generate its rules in Prolog. We have tried to retain as much information as possible in the conversion process. For example, it is possible for the prolog statements to optionally include the certainty values that C 4. 5 computes for its rules. This is achieved by simulating the certainty values as the probability that the statement will fail no matter what the values of its arguments. Prolog can move from statement to statement and find a series of rules that have to be fired to get from a set of premises to a desired result. We briefly mention how, when dealing with temporal data, the Prolog statements can be used for recursive searches...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{key factors}} that affects {{automated}} tutoring systems in making instructional decisions {{is the quality of}} the student model built in the system. A student model is a model that can solve problems in various ways as human students. A good student model that matches with student behavior patterns often provides useful information on learning task difficulty and transfer of learning between related problems, and thus often yields better instruction on intelligent tutoring systems. However, traditional ways of constructing such models are often time consuming, and may still miss distinctions in content and learning that have important instructional implications. Automated methods can be used to find better student models, but <b>usually</b> require <b>some</b> engineering <b>effort,</b> and can be hard to interpret. In this paper, we propose an automated approach that finds student models using a clustering algorithm based on automaticallygenerated problem content features. We demonstrate the proposed approach using an algebra dataset. Experimental results show that the discovered model is as good {{as one of the best}} existing models, which is a model found by a previous automated approach, but without the knowledge engineering effort...|$|R
