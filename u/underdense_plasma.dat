2500|$|The {{space between}} the uranium fusion tamper (also termed pusher; both terms can be used interchangeably) which is the metal {{cladding}} encasing the secondary and the case formed a radiation channel to conduct X-rays from the primary to the secondary assembly; the interstage. It {{is one of the}} most closely guarded secrets of a multi-stage thermonuclear weapon. Implosion of the secondary assembly is indirectly driven, and the techniques used in the interstage to smooth the spatial profile (i.e. reduce coherence and nonuniformities) of the primary’s irradiance are of utmost importance. This was done with the introduction of the channel filler – an optical element used as a refractive medium, also called random-phase plate. This [...] "plate" [...] was a polystyrene plastic foam filling, extruded or impregnated with a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon (possibly methane gas), which turned to a low-Z plasma from the X-rays and tamped (not to be confused with the fusion tamper) the sputtering effect that choked the radiation from compressing the secondary. Sputtering is the manifestation of the <b>underdense</b> <b>plasma</b> corona of the ablating hohlraum and the tamper surfaces. It is a problem, also shared by magnetically confined fusion reactors (see Tokamak), that has to do with the ablated particles, the blown-off uranium (or Pb–Bi alloy, depending on the [...] "cocktail", or high-Z element mixture, of the hohlraum design to tailor its opacity), which fly inside the radiation channel and absorb radiation or reflect it, contributing negatively to the radiation mirroring (also termed [...] "ducting" [...] in the TN jargon). The re-emitted X-rays from the radiation case must be deposited uniformly on the outer walls of the secondary’s tamper and ablate it externally, driving the thermonuclear fuel capsule (increasing the density and temperature of the fusion fuel) to the point needed to sustain a thermonuclear reaction. (see Nuclear weapon design). This point is above the threshold where the fusion fuel would turn opaque to its emitting radiation, as determined from its Rosseland opacity. After all, for any hydrogen weapon system to work, this radiative equilibrium must be reached together with the compression equilibrium between the fusion tamper and the sparkplug (see below), hence their name equilibrium supers.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{interaction}} of two co-propagating laser beams with crossed polarization in the <b>underdense</b> <b>plasmas</b> has been investigated analytically with the variational approach and numerically. The coupled envelope equations of the two beams include both the relativistic mass correction and the ponderomotive force effect. It is found that the relativistic effect always {{plays the role of}} beam attraction, while the ponderomotive force can play both the beam attraction and beam repulsion, depending upon the beam diameters and their transverse separation. In certain conditions, the two beam centers oscillate transversely around a propagation axis. In this case, the ponderomotive effect can lead to a higher oscillation frequency than that accounting for the relativistic effect only. The interaction of two beams decreases the threshold power for self-focusing of the single beam. A strong self-trapping beam can channel a weak one. Recently, we have investigated {{the interaction}} between two co-propagating laser beams with the same polarization directions in <b>underdense</b> <b>plasmas,</b> and found that two beams can merge into one beam or split into three beams [1]. Ren et al. have observed spiraling of the two beams with crossed polarization directions in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations [2]. They also have studied this phenomenon analytically, where their coupled beam equations only include the effect of the relativistic mass correction. However, the ponderomotive force effect, which has a significant influence on the self-trapping of a laser beam [3], has been ignored.
