25|$|Sometimes two {{different}} authors {{have been published}} under the same name. This can happen {{if there is a}} title which is identical to another title or to a collective <b>uniform</b> <b>title.</b> This, too, can cause confusion. Different authors can be distinguished correctly from each other by, for example, adding a middle initial to one of the names; in addition, other information can be added to one entry to clarify the subject, such as birth year, death year, range of active years such as 1918–1965 when the person flourished, or a brief descriptive epithet. When cataloguers come across different subjects with similar or identical headings, they can disambiguate them using authority control.|$|E
60|$|Witton Gilbert, {{a village}} four {{miles west of}} Durham, is, {{throughout}} the bishopric, pronounced Witton Jilbert. We have also the common name of Giles, always in Scotland pronounced Jill. For Gille, or Julianna, as a female name, we have Fair Gillian of Croyden, and a thousand authorities. Such being the case, the editor must enter his protest against the conversion of Gil Morrice, into child Maurice, an epithet of chivalry. All the circumstances in that ballad argue, that the unfortunate hero was an obscure and very young man, who had never received the honour of knighthood. At any rate, {{there can be no}} reason, even were internal evidence totally wanting, for altering a well known proper name, which, till of late years, has been the <b>uniform</b> <b>title</b> of the ballad.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} {{instances}} in which a <b>uniform</b> <b>title</b> can be used. Anonymous works such as sacred texts and folk tales may lack an obvious title: for instance, the Bible, Epic of Gilgamesh, Beowulf or the Chanson de Roland. Works of art and music may contain no text {{that can be used}} for reference. A <b>uniform</b> <b>title</b> allows all of the works to fall under one title and will reference all of the items to which the <b>uniform</b> <b>title</b> applies.|$|E

40|$|The Italian {{cataloguing}} code (Regole italiane di catalogazione, REICAT) requires {{the identification of}} all the works represented in the catalogue {{by the use of}} <b>uniform</b> <b>titles.</b> In the SBN-MARC protocol of the Italian National Library Service network (SBN), the authority records for the <b>uniform</b> <b>titles</b> have a different structure from the one proposed by the UNIMARC Authorities format: this prevents the respect of the cataloguing rules, the correct indexing of works and expressions and consequently their effective retrieval and display in the OPACs. This paper illustrates the problems and the possible solutions, both in the SBN-MARC protocol and in the UNIMARC systems that are hubs linked to SBN Index system, the core of the collective catalogue...|$|R

50|$|For some works, {{even the}} title can be standardized. The {{technical}} term {{for this is}} <b>uniform</b> <b>title.</b> For example, translations and re-editions are sometimes sorted under their original title. In many catalogs, parts of the Bible are sorted under the standard name of the book(s) they contain. The plays of William Shakespeare are another frequently cited example of {{the role played by}} a <b>uniform</b> <b>title</b> in the library catalog.|$|E

50|$|For example, if {{a library}} has 10 copies of Crime and Punishment, each in a {{different}} language, an online library catalogue can display all of the copies of the book together under the chosen <b>uniform</b> <b>title.</b> The library could also list any copies of Crime and Punishment in other mediums, such as film adaptations or abridged editions, under the same <b>uniform</b> <b>title.</b> This can help a library patron when searching the online catalog find all of the versions of Crime and Punishment at once instead of searching for each foreign title or film individually.|$|E

5000|$|Controversial {{literature}} is a subdivision of the Library of Congress Subject Headings, {{used in the}} description of religious books.

40|$|This filing manual was {{developed}} to address certain problems unique to music catalog filing. Prior to development of the manual, a thorough study of the existing arrangement in the Northern Illinois University Music Library's catalog was undertaken and staff members were interviewed {{to determine the extent}} of "unwritten" rules, if any existed. The rules in this document were designed to conform as closely as possible to existing filing practice in the Music Library; the new elements are principally more detailed explanations of the basic rules, and many new rules governing problematic situations such as <b>uniform</b> <b>titles</b> are introduced. The general emphasis of these rules is literal; the major exception is the treatment of subject headings, in which a traditional hierarchical approach is applied. There are also special rules to allow interfiling of some AACR 1 (Anglo American Cataloging rules, 1 st edition) and AACR 2 (Anglo American Cataloging Rules, 2 nd edition) <b>uniform</b> <b>titles.</b> There are no rules governing the filing of printed versus recorded manifestations of music or works by authors versus works about authors.

As part of this assessment of the need for a uniform system of legislation, this paper considers whether stakeholder groups, including government and practitioners, support the establishment of <b>uniform</b> Torrens <b>Title</b> Legislation. In examining the constitutional issues which must be addressed in order to harmonise Torrens Title legislation, this paper presents a discussion on the not insurmountable constitutional issues that are present. Finally, this paper discusses the numerous issues that need to be considered for the creation of <b>uniform</b> Torrens <b>Title</b> legislation in Australia, particularly indefeasibility of title, exceptions to indefeasibility, and restrictive covenants...|$|R

50|$|A <b>uniform</b> <b>title</b> in library {{cataloging}} is a title {{assigned to}} a work which either has no title or has appeared under more than one title. It is part of authority control. The phrases conventional title and standard title are sometimes used; Resource Description and Access uses preferred title; and the 2009 Statement of International Cataloguing Principles deprecates it in favour of authorized access point.|$|E
50|$|Some works {{supplement}} the title with a subtitle. Texts without separate titles may {{be referred to}} by their incipit, especially those produced before the practice of titling became popular. During development, a work may be referred to by a temporary working title. A piece of legislation may have both a short title and a long title. In library cataloging, a <b>uniform</b> <b>title</b> is assigned to a work whose title is ambiguous.|$|E

To reduce library costs, which might increase dramatically as users attempted to resolve those conflicts, OCLC converted name headings and <b>uniform</b> <b>titles</b> in its database to AACR 2 form.

5000|$|While {{in theory}} {{any piece of}} {{information}} is amenable to authority control such as personal and corporate names, <b>uniform</b> <b>titles,</b> series names, and subjects, library cataloguers typically focus on author names and book titles. Subject headings from the Library of Congress fulfill a function similar to authority records, although they are usually considered separately. As time passes, information changes, prompting needs for reorganization. According to one view, authority control is not about creating a perfect seamless system but rather it is an ongoing effort {{to keep up with}} these changes and try to bring [...] "structure and order" [...] to the task of helping users find information.|$|R
