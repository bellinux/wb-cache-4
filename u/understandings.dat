Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues.

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} the {{principles}} of learning, as highlighted by Bransford and colleagues, require biological grounding. This process essentially amounts to the facilitation of, and development of, an enriched capacity for ongoing biofunctional activity (OBA) —physical biology in action. The learning sciences’ principles of active learning, i. e., accessing prior <b>understanding,</b> organizing knowledge through schemas, and self-monitoring are psychological-understanding vehicles that work only in the ground of biofunctional (deep) <b>understanding.</b> Biofunctional <b>understanding</b> {{is a form of}} <b>understanding</b> that rises out of OBA. In this sense, biofunctional <b>understanding</b> juxtaposes and inherently complements psychological <b>understanding.</b> Without biofunctional <b>understanding,</b> psychological <b>understanding</b> becomes synonymous with superficial <b>understanding.</b> By contrast, in the illuminating context of biofunctional <b>understanding,</b> psychological <b>understanding</b> enables accomplishments of the kind enjoyed by experts in the rich and deep, metaphorically speaking, experiences of their respective fields of specialization.

Following Wittgenstein, we suggest that <b>understanding</b> is best conceived of as something akin to an ability, and shared <b>understanding</b> is, we suggest, best conceived of as the sharing of individual forms of <b>understanding</b> by multiple agents. We further suggest that mental models may provide a mechanistic realization for some of the performances that manifest <b>understanding,</b> and that situation awareness should best be seen as a particular kind of <b>understanding,</b> namely a dynamic form of situational <b>understanding.</b> In addition to discussing the nature of <b>understanding</b> and shared <b>understanding,</b> we also discuss their potential relevance to military coalition operations. We propose that shared <b>understanding</b> is important to coalition operations because it contributes to improvements in coalition performance, the optimal use of limited communication assets, and an improved sense of group cohesion, group solidarity and mutual trust...|$|R

Anecdotal reports suggest that shared <b>understanding</b> enables coalition forces to coordinate their efforts in respect of mission goals, and shortfalls in shared <b>understanding</b> are frequently cited as the reason for poor coalition performance. In spite of this consensus regarding the importance of shared <b>understanding,</b> however, there are very few empirical studies that attempt to explore shared <b>understanding</b> in a military coalition context. This paper attempts to support future research efforts into shared <b>understanding</b> by proposing a specific definition for shared <b>understanding</b> and identifying a number of research challenges. Shared <b>understanding</b> is defined as the ability of multiple agents to exploit common bodies of causal knowledge for the purposes of accomplishing common (or shared) goals. This definition implies that agents possessing shared <b>understanding</b> will be capable of coordinating their respective behaviours in order to ensure the efficient realization of cognitive and behavioural objectives. We also identify a number of areas for future research into shared <b>understanding.</b> These include the factors that affect shared <b>understanding,</b> the effect of shared <b>understanding</b> on coalition performance, and the development of techniques to reliably measure and assess <b>understanding</b> in coalition environments...|$|R
