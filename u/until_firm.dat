Retrospective study of all patients undergoing transhiatal resection for a mid-/distal esophageal carcinoma between 1993 and 1997. 110 patients underwent transhiatal resection for esophageal carcinoma. Sixteen patients had tumor-positive, resectable peritruncal lymph nodes not identified preoperatively, changing preoperative stage III into postoperative stage IV (M 1 a). After follow-up of 2. 9 years (0. 07 - 7. 6), 49 patients (45 %) were alive. On multivariate analysis radicality and lymph node status were independent prognostic factors.

40|$|A {{review of}} the WTO {{agricultural}} negotiations and their implications for developing countries {{is the subject of}} a report published in March 2003 by Tim Ruffer (Oxford Policy management) and Alan Swinbank (University of Reading). The report, which was based on a DfID financed study, summarises the most important issues arising for developing countries in the WTO agricultural negotiations in the context of the Harbinson drafts. It looks at issues under five headings: market access; domestic support; export subsidies; the peace clause; and support for developing countries. Its main conclusions are that: market access liberalisation will 'reduce the preferences margins that some developing countries currently enjoy'. Accordingly the authors make a number of recommendations, the most significant of which is for the extension of special safeguard mechanisms for key food commodities for developing countries; concerning domestic support, the blue box should be eliminated, and there should be no extension of the green box as this could harm the interests of developing countries; developing countries should push for the elimination of export subsidies; developing countries should hold back on approval of the extension of the peace clause <b>until</b> <b>firm</b> assurances have been received on their areas of concern. Comment: In calling for the elimination of the 'blue box' and the maintenance of 'green box' provisions within current limits the analysis ignores the reality of the EU position which will require an extension of the green box provisions if it is to accept the elimination of the 'blue box'. It needs to be recognised that the EU is only likely to accept a timetable for the elimination of export subsidies which is consistent with the internal process of CAP reform designed to eliminate the need for export refunds.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} {{the sequence of events}} of T-cell mediated target cell lysis in microcinematography and electron microscopy. Highly efficient cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated in vivo and in vitro using preimmunized spleen cells and purification procedures. Such CTL were highly specific. This specificity correlated well with the number of adhesions formed between CTL and targets and this criterion was used to study killer-target cell interaction. Microcinematography showed that target cell lysis at the single cell level, despite time variations, could be clearly separated into three phases: (a) a recognition phase, visible by random crawling of CTL over the target cell surface <b>until</b> <b>firm</b> contact was established; (b) a post-recognition phase, during which firm contact between CTL and target was maintained without gross modification of either cell; (c) a phase of target cell disintegration, mainly characterized by vigorous blebbing of the cell membrane resulting in a motionless carcass of the target cell but not in its total dissolution. Only later this carcass decayed and formed a necrotic ghost. Electron microscopic observations were put into sequence according to microcinematography. Post-recognition phase was characterized by a tight apposition of the membranes of CTL and target cell. No gap junctions could be observed. During target cell disintegration, profound cytoplasmic and nuclear changes occurred simultaneous with surface blebbing. Most noticeable were extensive internal vacuolization, mitochondrial swelling, nuclear pycnosis and dissolution of the nucleolus. These observations suggested that target cell lysis does not start with a surface phenomenon similar to complement lysis, but a process involving practically the whole cell simultaneously. It is conceivable, therefore, that the signal from the CTL is transmitted across the target cell, and that the switch to sudden cell death is manipulated deep inside the cell...|$|E

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) {{currently}} owns {{several hundred}} {{metric tons of}} aluminum clad, spent nuclear fuel and target assemblies. The vast majority of these irradiated assemblies are currently stored in water basins that were designed and operated for short term fuel cooling prior to fuel reprocessing. Recent DOE decisions to severely limit the reprocessing option have significantly lengthened the time of storage, thus increasing the tendency for corrosion induced degradation of the fuel cladding and the underlying core material. The portent of continued corrosion, coupled with the age of existing wet storage facilities {{and the cost of}} continuing basin operations, including necessary upgrades to meet current facility standards, may force the DOE to transition these wet stored, aluminum clad spent fuels to interim dry storage.

40|$|Authors: Michelle Lee, Florian Muller, Elisa Aquilanti, Baoli Hu & Ronald DePinho ### Abstract Xenografting {{of human}} cancer cell lines {{injected}} subcutanously in nude mice {{has become the}} standard testing platform for dissecting mechanistic aspects of tumorigenesis and for pre-clinical drug development. However, subcutanous xenografts do not model tumors in their tissue of origin and thus may have some clinically relevant limitations. Xenografted human tumor cells directly injected into their relevant organ may present a more accurate model of human tumors. Here, we describe a rapid protocol for the injection of tumor cell lines into the mouse brain {{for the establishment of}} orthotopic tumors. ### Introduction Subcutaneuous growth of human tumor cells in immunodeficient mice is a mainstay of cancer research and anti-cancer drug development. However, it is known that the microenvironment influences tumor growth as well drug response. To better model human tumors in immunocompromised mice, cancer cells can be injected into the organ of origin (orthotopically), allowing organotypical interactions between cancer cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Orthotopic tumors may more properly recapitulate human tumor biology, as the interactions of tumor cells with normal tissue cells as well as stromal, vascular, and immunologic cells could have effects on cell survival and migration, and even developmental potential. Similarly, orthotopic tumors may recreate some physiologic barriers and could reveal important issues in drug penetration and metabolism. Located within the microenvironment of the highly specialized and protected central nervous system, orthotopic brain tumor models may have higher clinical relevance than conventional subcutaneous xenografts for understanding tumor behavior and for predicting drug efficacy. ### Reagents 1. Anesthetic (Ketamine) - Analgesic (Buprenorphine) - 1 cc syringes and 30 g needles - Sterile phosphate-buffered saline - Ethanol 70 % - Sterile water - Hamilton syringe and cleaning solution - Betadine - Alcohol wipes - Sterile cotton swabs - Disposable scalpels - Sterile ocular lubricant (Puralube vet ointment) - Forceps - Autoclip applier and 9 mm clips - Clip remover - Cells on ice: enough for 100, 000 cells per 3 ul injection - Immunocompromised mice: We use typically either use female SCID (B and T cell deficient; Taconic # ICRSC-F) or Nude (T-cell deficient, Taconic # NCRNU-F) mice between the ages of 6 to 20 weeks. ### Equipment 1. Micromotor drill and bits (Foredom 1070) - Stereotaxic device (Stoelting Elliptic Lab Standard ™ Stereotaxic Instrument) - Heating pad - Microscope light - Timer ### Procedure The procedure described below details how to perform intracranial tumor cell injection in mice. This is a major surgery and all procedures must be approved by IACUC or other animal use committee. Prepare cells for injection: - In the tissue culture room, typsinize cultured cells. - Wash cells with sterile PBS, and then resuspend in sterile PBS to an adjusted final volume of at least 100, 000 cells per 3 ul injection. - Cells should be transported to the injection area on ice. Set up: - Assemble the stereotaxic device according to manufacturer’s instructions. - Lay out the drill and drill bit. - Turn on the heating pad and monitor its temperature with a thermometer. Load Hamilton syringe with cells: - Prepare the Hamilton syringe by rising in 70 % Ethanol and then sterile PBS. - Gently resuspend trypsinized cells in PBS. - Draw cells to 3 uL in the Hamilton syringe, carefully avoiding bubbles. - Position the syringe in the stereotactic device, and tighten the screw to lock the syringe in the correct position. Surgical procedure: - Preoperative preparation: - Anesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine 100 mg/kg. Confirm anesthetic effectiveness by toe pinch. Wipe the mouse’s head 3 times with sterile cotton swab dipped in betadine, then swab with an alchohol wipe. Protect the mouse’s eyes by coating with sterile ocular lubricant. Make a 1. 5 cm sagittal incision in the mouse’s scalp from the front to the back. - Stereotactic immobilization: - Position the mouse in the stereotactic apparatus: first displace the tongue to the side with the wooden end of a sterile cotton swab, then position the front teeth in the tooth holder, next tighten the nose holder <b>until</b> <b>firm,</b> and finally place both ears in the ear holders. Once the mouse is in the correct position, tighten the ear holders <b>until</b> <b>firm.</b> Wipe the skull with a sterile cotton swab to remove the shiny membranes and to aid idenification of the bregma suture. - Cell injection: - Drill a hole 2 mm right and 1 mm anterior to the bregma suture. Lower the Hamilton syringe needle {{to the edge of the}} hole. Lower the needle 3. 5 mm, into the brain. Raise the needle 1 mm and wait 1 minute. Inject 1 uL of cells, raise the needle 1 more mm, and wait 1 minute. Inject 1 uL, raise 1 mm, and wait 1 minute. Then inject the final 1 uL. Completely remove the needle from the mouse’s brain. Remove the mouse from the stereotaxic device. - Recovery: - Close the skin incision by holding the edges with forceps and applying one clip. Place the mouse on the heating pad until the effects of anesthetic wear off, at which time the mouse can be returned to its cage. Follow up: - Clean the Hamilton syringe with Hamilton cleaning solution, then 70 % Ethanol, then sterile water. - Administer analgesic twice a day for the first 3 days after surgery. - Remove sutures after 10 days. - Monitor mice daily for signs of neurologic compromise. ### Timing After proper setup of an efficient system, 3 - 4 mice injected per hour can be passed through the procedure, which includes, anesthesia, injection, and recovery. ### Troubleshooting Some typical problems include injection of cells in the sub-cutaneous areas of the skull or into the membranes (dura, pia) covering the brain, rather than the brain itself. The ideal location is in the frontal cortex, with tumors cells located within the brain parenchyma near the lateral ventricles. As with all mouse surgical procedures requiring deep anesthesia, death from hypothermia can be an issue, which must be minimized by appropriate supportive care including monitoring and the use of a heating pad. It is of course advisable to include a positive control when first performing this procedure. Many established glioma and non-glioma cell lines rapidly and consistently form intracranial tumors when injected in this manner, including U 87 cells. A negative control would consist of normal, immortalized but non-transformed human astrocytes. ### Anticipated Results The tumor latency is dependent on both the cell line and the number of cells injected. The typical time to onset of neurological symptoms is about 3 months but can be as long as 6 months, or even longer. Volumetric measurement of intracranial tumors by MRI is possible but not practical, and is cost-prohibitive when using a large number of animals. Therefore, neurological symptoms, specifically abnormalities of gross motor function, are used as an endpoint for tumor latency. Neurological symptoms are indicative of a tumor that is sufficiently large to have displaced or infiltrated the mouse brain or to have caused obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid flow with resultant increased intracranial pressure. Dormant, non-tumor forming cells can remain alive in the cerebrospinal fluid for a prolonged time after injection: using anti-human NUMA (Epitomics 3402 - 1) that specifically detects human but not mouse cells, we have observed residual, non-tumor forming cells as long as 6 months after orthotopic injections. ### References Zheng H, Ying H, Yan H, Kimmelman AC, Hiller DJ, Chen AJ, Perry SR, Tonon G, Chu GC, Ding Z, Stommel JM, Dunn KL, Wiedemeyer R, You MJ, Brennan C, Wang YA, Ligon KL, Wong WH, Chin L, DePinho RA, 'p 53 and Pten control neural and glioma stem/progenitor cell renewal and differentiation.
