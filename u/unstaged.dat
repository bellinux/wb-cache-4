5|$|The Bayreuth {{authorities}} allowed <b>unstaged</b> performances to {{take place}} in various countries after Wagner's death (London in 1884, New York City in 1886, and Amsterdam in 1894) but they maintained an embargo on stage performances outside Bayreuth. On 24 December 1903, after receiving a court ruling that performances in the United States could not be prevented by Bayreuth, the New York Metropolitan Opera staged the complete opera, using many Bayreuth-trained singers. Cosima barred anyone involved in the New York production from working at Bayreuth in future performances. Unauthorized stage performances were also undertaken in Amsterdam in 1905, 1906 and 1908. There was a performance in Buenos Aires, in Teatro Coliseo, on June 20, 1913 under Gino Marinuzzi.|$|E
25|$|There also arose a {{trend for}} <b>unstaged</b> opera. This led to {{works for the}} radio by Grażyna Bacewicz (Przygody Króla Artura -The Adventures of King Arthur, 1959), Jerzy Sikorski (Muzyczna opowieść niemalże o końcu świata - A Musical Tale About the End of the World 1958), Tadeusz Szeligowski (Odys płaczący -Odysseus Weeping 1961) and Zbigniew Penherski (Sąd nad Samsonem - Judgement on Samson 1969). Television operas were also written by Krzystof Meyer (the famous Cyberiad after the science-fiction stories by Stanisław Lem, 1970) and Maciej Małecki (Balladyna, 1999).|$|E
25|$|The Dresden-based oboist Petra Andrejewski {{discovered}} the score in a Moscow library and reconstructed the opera for a revival at the Dresden Music Festival on 27 May 2012—the first performance of La casa disabitata in 177 years. The performance was in concert version (Russian authorities would only grant {{permission to use}} the manuscript for a single <b>unstaged</b> performance). It took place in the salon of the 17th-century summer palace in Dresden's Großer Garten with Helmut Branny conducting the Dresdner Kapellsolisten. The performance was also recorded for later broadcast on several European radio stations including Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk, Österreich 1, and Catalunya Música.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a case}} {{of cruelty}} to animals in the South Korean film The Isle (2000), {{according}} to its director Kim Ki-Duk. In the film, a real frog is skinned alive while fish are mutilated. Seven animals were killed for the camera in the controversial Italian film Cannibal Holocaust (1980). The images in the film include the slow and graphic beheading and ripping apart of a turtle, a monkey being beheaded and its brains being consumed by natives and a spider being chopped apart. Cannibal Holocaust was only one film in a collective of similarly themed movies (cannibal films) that featured <b>unstaged</b> animal cruelty. Their influences were rooted in the films of Mondo filmmakers, which sometimes contained similar content. In several countries, such as the UK, Cannibal Holocaust was only allowed for release with most of the animal cruelty edited out.|$|E

500|$|By {{the early}} 17th century the {{traditional}} intermedio—a musical sequence between {{the acts of}} a straight play—was evolving into {{the form of a}} complete musical drama or [...] "opera". Monteverdi's L'Orfeo moved this process out of its experimental era and provided the first fully developed example of the new genre. After its initial performance the work was staged again in Mantua, and possibly in other Italian centres in the next few years. Its score was published by Monteverdi in 1609 and again in 1615. After the composer's death in 1643 the opera went unperformed for many years, and was largely forgotten until a revival of interest in the late 19th century led to a spate of modern editions and performances. At first these performances tended to be concert (<b>unstaged)</b> versions within institutes and music societies, but following the first modern dramatised performance in Paris, in 1911, the work began to be seen in theatres. After the Second World War many recordings were issued, and the opera was increasingly staged in opera houses, although some leading venues resisted it. In 2007 the quatercentenary of the premiere was celebrated by performances throughout the world.|$|E

Based on Yejiri Station, Province of Suruga (ca. 1832) a woodprint by Katsushika Hokusai, A Sudden Gust of Wind recreates the depicted 19th-century Japanese scene in contemporary British Columbia, utilizing actors and took over a year to produce 100 photographs in order [...] "to achieve a seamless montage that gives the illusion of capturing a real moment in time." ...|$|E

The A-3 was an <b>unstaged</b> (non-parasite) {{aircraft that}} cruised at Mach 3.2 at [...] The Land Panel favored Convair's design, {{which had a}} smaller radar cross section than the A-3. On 22 December, Convair was instructed to continue FISH's development and to plan for production. While Convair struggled with aerodynamic issues, Lockheed pursued its own efforts on high-speed, high-altitude reconnaissance designs, evolving from A-4 through A-11. The first three configurations, A-4 through A-6, were smaller, self-launched aircraft with vertical surfaces hidden above the wing. The aircraft {{used a variety of}} propulsion schemes that included turbojets, ramjets, and rockets. None met the required mission radius of , leading Lockheed to conclude that maximum performance and low radar cross section were mutually exclusive. The A-10 and A-11 configurations were larger aircraft that also focused on performance at the expense of radar cross section. Lockheed submitted the more refined A-11 at the next Land Panel review.|$|E
2500|$|February CTP (built on February 17, 2006 with a {{build number}} of 5308), was {{released}} on February 22, 2006 {{and was the first}} feature-complete CTP. This build was meant for enterprises. It was also the first build to have the upgrade compatibility. This build, according to Microsoft, had all but one feature (which should appear in the next CTP) that customers will see in the final release. However, later builds brought more improvements than previously expected. An <b>unstaged</b> revision was made to this build and {{was released on}} February 28, 2006 as build 5308.60 (built on February 23), which was released as a result of Windows Server [...] "Longhorn" [...] having many issues.

2500|$|In 2000 Wells wrote Icons of Evolution, {{in which}} he claims, [...] "What the {{textbooks}} don't explain, however, is that biologists have known since the 1980s that the classical story has some serious flaws. The most serious is that peppered moths in the wild don't even rest on tree trunks. The textbook photographs, it turns out, have been staged." [...] The arguments were dismissed by Majerus, Cook and Bruce Grant who describes Wells as distorting the picture by selectively omitting or scrambling references {{in a way that}} is dishonest. Professional photography to illustrate textbooks uses dead insects because of the considerable difficulty in getting good images of both forms of moth in the same shot. The scientific studies actually consisted of observational data rather than using such photographs. The photographs in Majerus's Melanism: Evolution in Action are <b>unstaged</b> pictures of live moths in the wild, and the photographs of moths on tree-trunks, apart from some slight blurring, look little different from the [...] "staged" [...] photographs. While an experiment did involve the gluing of dead moths to trees, this practice was just one of many different ways used to study different individual elements of the overall hypothesis. This particular experiment was not meant to exactly reproduce natural conditions but instead was used to assess how the numbers of moths available (their density) affected the foraging practices of birds.|$|E
