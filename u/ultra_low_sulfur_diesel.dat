5000|$|The engine has a 3.87 in bore and 4.13 in stroke, {{resulting}} in a total calculated displacement of 387 cuin L (6,333 cc). Despite having to meet emission regulations, the engine was able to increase horsepower ratings to [...] and torque to 650 lbft Nm at the flywheel. Horsepower and torque are achieved at 3,000 rpm and 2,000 rpm respectively. It also features a compound VGT turbo system. Air enters the low-pressure turbo (the smaller of the two) and is fed into the high-pressure turbo (the larger of the two), then is directed into the engine or intercooler. This system is designed to result in reduced turbo lag when accelerating from a stop. The series-turbo system is set up to provide a better throttle response while in motion to give a power flow more like a naturally aspirated engine.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{focuses on}} {{determining}} the variation of indoor pollutants in public transport buses in the City of Toledo running on biodiesel (BD) and <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>diesel</b> (ULSD). The indoor pollutants monitored are carbon dioxide (CO 2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitric oxide (NO), and particulate matter (PM). Temperature (Temp.) and relative humidity (RH) are also measured inside the vehicle {{in addition to}} the monitored in-vehicle pollutants. The various factors generally affecting indoor air quality in any microenvironment are indoor sources of pollutants (people, furniture, etc.), ventilation, outdoor air quality, meteorology, pollutant decay, and vehicular traffic. The objective of this research paper is to study the daily, monthly, and seasonal variation of in-vehicle pollutants in relation to different vari-ables and also determine the statistical significance of in-vehicle pollutant levels in biodiesel and <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>diesel</b> buses. The daily, monthly, and seasonal variations of the pollutants monitored are studied and it was observed that the pollutant level buildup within a bus compartment is due to a combination of different factors and not a result of variation due to a single variable. CO 2 levels are influenced by a combination of varying passenger ridership, vehicular traffic, ventilation settings, and bus status. CO and SO 2 levels depend on vehicular traffic, ventilation settings, and to an extent on vehicle speed. NO levels varied with vehicular traffic and ventilation settings.

This thesis examines the potential of two jet fuel types, <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> jet fuel and synthetic paraffinic kerosene, to reduce aviation's contribution to ambient particulate matter concentrations. Scaling factors were developed for airport criteria pollutant emissions to model alternative jet fuels in aircraft and ground support equipment. These linear scaling factors were based on currently published studies comparing standard diesel and jet fuels with alternative jet fuels. It was found that alternative jet fuels lower or maintain all air pollutant emissions considered (primary particulate matter, sulfur oxides, nitrous oxides, unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide) for both aircraft and ground support equipment. To quantify the potential benefits of changing fuel composition on ambient particulate matter concentrations, a study of the Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport was completed using both emissions inventory analysis and atmospheric modeling. The atmospheric modeling captures both primary particulate matter and other emissions that react in the atmosphere to form secondary particulate matter. It was found that the use of an <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> jet fuel in aircraft gas turbines could reduce the primary particulate matter inventory by 37 % and synthetic paraffinic kerosene could reduce the primary particulate matter inventory by 64 %. The atmospheric modeling predicts that an <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> jet fuel in aircraft could reduce ambient particulate matter concentrations due to aircraft by up to 57 % and synthetic paraffinic kerosene could reduce particulate matter concentrations due to aircraft by up to 67 %. Thus, this study indicates that the majority of air quality benefits at Atlanta Hartsfield Jackson International Airport that could be derived from the two fuels considered can be captured by removing the sulfur from jet fuel through the use of an <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> jet fuel. by Pearl Donohoo.

The study also determines whether there are refinery economic benefits for producing an emissions reduction RFD (with flexibility for individual property values) compared to a vehicle performance RFD (with inflexible recipe values for individual properties). Results show that refining costs are lower with early notice of requirements for RFD. While advanced desulfurization technologies (with low hydrogen consumption and little effect on cetane quality and aromatics content) reduce the cost of <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel, these technologies contribute to the increased costs of a delayed notice investment pathway compared to an early notice investment pathway for diesel fuel reformulation. With challenging RFD specifications, there is little refining benefit from producing emissions reduction RFD compared to vehicle performance RFD. As specifications become tighter, processing becomes more difficult, blendstock choices become more limited, and refinery benefits vanish for emissions reduction relative to vehicle performance specifications. Conversely, the emissions reduction specifications show increasing refinery benefits over vehicle performance specifications as specifications are relaxed, and alternative processing routes and blendstocks become available. In sensitivity cases, the refinery model is also used to examine the impact of RFD specifications on the economics of using Canadian synthetic crude oil. There is a sizeable increase in synthetic crude demand as <b>ultra</b> <b>low</b> <b>sulfur</b> <b>diesel</b> fuel displaces low sulfur diesel fuel, but this demand increase would be reversed by requirements for diesel fuel reformulation...|$|E

Adsorption desulfurization at ambient temperature, 24 h{sup - 1 } of LHSV over A- 2 is efficient to remove dibenzothiophene (DBT) in the model diesel fuel, but difficult to remove 4 -methyldibenzothiophene (4 -MDBT) and 4, 6 -dimethyl-dibenzothiophene (4, 6 -DMDBT). Adsorption desulfurization at 150 C over A- 2 can efficiently remove DBT, 4 -MDBT and 4, 6 -DMDBT in the model <b>diesel</b> fuel. The <b>sulfur</b> content in the model diesel fuel can be reduced to less than 1 ppmw at 150 C without using hydrogen gas. The adsorption capacity corresponding to the break-through point is 6. 9 milligram of sulfur per gram of A- 2 (mg-S/g-A- 2), and the saturate capacity is 13. 7 mg-S/g-A- 2. Adsorption desulfurization of a commercial diesel fuel with a total sulfur level of 47 ppmw was also performed at ambient temperature and 24 h{sup - 1 } of LHSV over the adsorbent A- 2.
