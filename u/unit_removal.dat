40|$|BACKGROUND: Nail unit {{melanoma}} (NUM) is {{a variant}} of acral lentiginous melanoma. The differential diagnosis is wide but an acquired brown streak in the nail of a fair-skinned adult person must be considered a potential melanoma. Dermoscopy helps clinicians to more accurately decide if a nail apparatus biopsy is necessary. OBJECTIVE: Detailed evaluation of clinical and dermoscopy features and description of conservative surgery of in situ NUM. METHODS: Retrospective study of in situ NUM diagnosed and treated with conservative surgical management in the authors' center from 2008 to 2013. RESULTS: Six cases of NUM were identified: 2 male and 4 female patients, age range at diagnosis of 44 to 76 years. All patients underwent complete nail <b>unit</b> <b>removal</b> with at least 6 -mm security margins around the anatomic boundaries of the nail. The follow-up varies from 4 to 62 months. CONCLUSION: Nail unit melanomas pose a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. Wide excision is sufficient, whereas phalanx amputation is unnecessary and associated with significant morbidity for patients with in situ or early invasive melanoma. Full-thickness skin grafting or second-intention healing after total nail unit excision is a simple procedure providing a good functional and cosmetic outcome...|$|E
40|$|The Project Disassembly Analysis of Slates: Design for Repair and Recycling Evaluation was {{initiated}} by Fraunhofer IZM, Berlin. The {{objective of the}} project was to investigate current design trends in slate devices and to carry out an evaluation with regard to repair and recycling. Within the scope of the study, 21 slates were examined. A focus was put on the opening and the disassembly of the slates as well as on battery, mainboard and display <b>unit</b> <b>removal.</b> Additionally, in order to analyze the thermal behavior, a thermography analysis was undertaken during a performance benchmark test. The findings indicate an even heat distribution as well as a moderate temperature increase of the battery during the test. With regard to the recycling and repair analysis significant differences were observed in the complexity of the opening and dismantling of the main parts. An overall tendency is, on the one hand, the execution of numerous steps for the slates opening. On the other hand, the access to the main parts is accomplished after a complex disassembly process, employing the removal of numerous screws, clips and adhesives. In general, the findings indicate that the robustness and the highly integrated designs might complicate the ease of dismantling of the slates as well as their recyclability...|$|E
40|$|Background Nail {{apparatus}} melanoma (NAM) {{is a rare}} melanocytic neoplasm with pejorative prognosis often {{related to}} late diagnosis. Early diagnosis at in situ stage (NAMis) is difficult, but essential to improve prognosis. NAMis management is not well established yet. Removal of the whole nail unit has been advocated in several small series as a potential treatment for NAMis. Objective To report and assess 'functional' or 'conservative' surgery for NAMis and evaluate its long-term oncologic safety. Methods Retrospective study of cases diagnosed in the University Hospital Saint-Pierre collected over a 13 year period and compared with the published data. Results Eleven cases of NAMis were identified: 73 % concerned females. Thumb and first toe were the most affected digits (63 % of total). Monodactylic longitudinal melanonychia (LM) was the most frequent presentation (92 %). Mean diagnosis delay was 5 years. Diagnosis was suspected {{on the basis of}} clinical and dermatoscopic signs and was confirmed by pathological examination. All patients underwent complete nail <b>unit</b> <b>removal</b> with 6 mm security margins around the anatomic boundaries of the nail. Two late local recurrences were observed at 7 and 11 years follow-up. Conclusions Our series, the largest up to now, demonstrates that 'functional surgery' is a rational approach for NAMis with an excellent oncologic safety at 5 years. However, this study suggests that a very long-term follow-up is mandatory, as recurrences may appear late. © 2013 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.

40|$|Three outer {{membrane}} proteins with molecular {{masses of}} 40, 38, and 27 kDa of the hypertoxinogenic strain 569 B of Vibrio cholerae have been purified to homogeneity. The synthesis {{of all the}} three proteins is regulated by the osmolarity of the growth medium. The pore-forming ability of the 40 -kDa protein, OmpT, and the 38 -kDa protein, OmpU, has been demonstrated by using liposomes, in which these proteins were embedded. The 27 -kDa protein, OmpX, though osmoregulated, is not a porin. OmpU constitutes 30 % of the total outer membrane protein when grown {{in the presence of}} 1. 0 % NaCl in the growth medium and 60 % in the absence of NaCl. OmpU is an acidic protein and is a homotrimer of 38 -kDa monomeric units. Its secondary structure contains predominantly a beta-sheet, and three to four Ca 2 + ions are associated with each monomeric <b>unit.</b> <b>Removal</b> of Ca 2 + irreversibly disrupts the structure and pore-forming ability of the protein. The pore size of OmpU is 1. 6 nm, and the specific activity of the OmpU channel is two- to threefold higher than that of Escherichia coli porin OmpF, synthesis of which resembles that of OmpU with respect to the osmolarity of the growth medium. The pore size of OmpT, which is analogous to OmpC of E. coli, is smaller than that of OmpU. Southern blot hybridization of V. cholerae genomic DNA digested with several restriction endonucleases with nick-translated E. coli ompF as the probe revealed no nucleotide sequence homology between the ompU and ompF genes. OmpU is also not antigenically related to OmpF. Anti-OmpF antiserum, however, cross-reacted with the 45 -kDa V. cholerae outer membrane protein, OmpS, the synthesis of which is regulated by the presence of maltose in the growth medium. OmpU hemagglutinated with rabbit and human blood. This toxR-regulated protein is one of the possible virulence determinants in V. cholerae (V. L. Miller and J. J. Mekalanos, J.

40|$|LectureAcid {{gas removal}} (AGR) using a high {{pressure}} amine solvent in a contactor tower {{is widely used}} to sweeten sour gas and render it suitable for commercial distribution. Acid gas removal is also common in other applications such as ammonia production. Single-stage hydraulic turbochargers can reduce energy use in AGR processes. In the revised process, the hydraulic turbocharger essentially replaces the pressure letdown, or level control valve at the contactor exit and the high pressure pump used to bring the solvent to contactor pressure. This significantly reduces operating costs for the acid gas <b>removal</b> <b>unit.</b> This paper will present a turbocharger based system that optimizes energy use while simultaneously fulfilling the required controls functionality of the LCV.

50|$|Modern Air's {{historic}} {{arrival in}} Moscow was memorable {{for a different}} reason as well. In common with other contemporary jet aircraft types, such as the Boeing 707/720, deHavilland Comet, Douglas DC-8, Sud Aviation Caravelle and Vickers VC-10, Convair's 880/990 lacked an auxiliary power unit (APU). This made the Convair jets dependent on an external ground power unit (GPU) to provide electrical power for the aircraft while stationary on the ground, including starting the engines. When Polar Byrd I needed power externally supplied by a GPU to start its engines {{at the end of the}} stopover in Moscow to resume its journey, it was found that the Soviet GPUs could not be connected to the CV-990s air intake valve due to an incompatibility between the ground equipment's fittings and the aircraft's valve. This necessitated flying in a Modern Air GPU from West Berlin and resulted in the delay of the onward flight. It also resulted in a subsequent collaboration between Modern Air's maintenance department and Garrett AiResearch to design and test a CV-990 APU, which was located in a hollow area behind the fuel tank inside the aircraft's inboard anti-shock body on the starboard wing. This however proved unsuccessful, resulting in the <b>unit's</b> <b>removal</b> after the first installation.|$|R
