5|$|A {{determination}} about {{a diagnosis}} of plantar fasciitis can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> made based on a person's medical history and physical examination.|$|E
5|$|Devices called HDCP {{strippers}} {{can remove}} the HDCP {{information from the}} video signal so the video can play on non-HDCP-compliant displays, though a fair use and non-disclosure form must <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> signed with a registering agency before use.|$|E
5|$|Graduations, weddings, and {{any other}} family gatherings will <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> celebrated with {{the killing of a}} goat or cow, which will be barbecued or roasted by the family.|$|E
30|$|The {{clinical}} {{manifestations of}} the various causes of acute abdominal pain <b>usually</b> <b>are</b> not straightforward; besides the variable symptoms of the underlying mechanism, a rigid abdomen <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> present [9, 10].|$|R
50|$|In this variant, a gold 金 is {{positioned}} on 38 where the silver 銀 <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> {{and the silver}} {{is positioned}} where the gold <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> in a High Mino castle.|$|R
50|$|Toppers <b>usually</b> <b>were</b> {{drawn by}} the same artist as the larger strip. These strips <b>usually</b> <b>were</b> {{positioned}} {{at the top of}} the page (hence their name), but they sometimes ran beneath the main strip.|$|R
5|$|The third type, {{pancreatic}} mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) mainly {{occur in}} women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> successfully removed by surgery.|$|E
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines have robust {{efficacy}} in {{the short-term}} management of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), but were not shown effective in producing long-term improvement overall. According to National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), benzodiazepines {{can be used in}} the immediate management of GAD, if necessary. However, they should not <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> given for longer than 2–4 weeks. The only medications NICE recommends for the longer term management of GAD are antidepressants.|$|E
40|$|Ibuprofen {{has become}} one of the most popular and widely used non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) since its introduction in the United States in 1974. This propionic acid derivative inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and pos-sesses both analgesic and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs <b>usually</b> <b>are</b> absorbed rapidly after oral adminis-tration. Renal excretion <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> the primary route of elimination. Common side effects from NSAID use <b>usually</b> <b>are</b> due to potent inhibi-tion of prostaglandin synthesis...|$|R
3000|$|Admission {{of these}} [...] "non-traditional" [...] {{students}} in fact <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> based on vocational qualifications as well. Often a {{vocational training certificate}} plus work experience or specialists training is required and admission <b>usually</b> <b>is</b> restricted to related fields.|$|R
50|$|For most of {{the twentieth}} century, Gerrardina and Dipentodon had <b>usually</b> <b>been</b> placed in Flacourtiaceae, a family that is now {{recognized}} by only a few taxonomists, and then only as a segregate of Salicaceae. Perrottetia, meanwhile, had <b>usually</b> <b>been</b> placed, with considerable doubt, in Celastraceae.|$|R
5|$|In the American League {{and others}} with the DH rule, there will <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> nine {{offensive}} regulars (including the DH), five starting pitchers, seven or eight relievers, a backup catcher {{and two or three}} other reserves; the need for late-inning pinch-hitters is reduced by the DH.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{generating}} {{a set of}} woven source code, some AspectJ weavers instead weave the aspects and classes together directly into bytecode, acting both as the aspect weaver and compiler. While {{it is expected that}} the performance of aspect weavers which also perform the compilation process will require more computation time due to the weaving process involved. However, the bytecode weaving process produces more efficient runtime code than would <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> achieved through compiled woven source.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{you open}} your mouth and you don't {{know what you are}} going to say, and {{whatever}} comes out is the starting point. If that happens and you are lucky, it can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> turned into a song. This song is a prayer and personal statement between me, the Lord, and whoever likes it.|$|E
50|$|Special purpose coffee {{grinders}} <b>usually</b> <b>are</b> either blade grinders or burr grinders: blade grinders {{being less}} expensive and having additional uses, burr grinders giving {{a better quality of}} grind (see Coffee preparation#Grinding). Special purpose spice grinders <b>usually</b> <b>are</b> either blade grinders or mortar and pestle (or related tools).|$|R
50|$|Markings for {{the model}} <b>usually</b> <b>are</b> {{provided}} as decals.|$|R

5|$|The Mediterranean species Boletus poikilochromus {{somewhat}} resembles I.torosus, but can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> {{distinguished by}} a smaller fruit body, a cylindrical stipe, and the lighter colours of younger mushrooms. Also, B.poikilochromus does not feature the colour {{change of the}} stipe base in mature fruit bodies that is seen in I.torosus. Imperator luteocupreus and Caloboletus radicans are also similar but the pores of the former are red and the flesh of latter has a bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shooting}} medals {{were struck}} {{in honor of}} the Officers' Shoot held in Langenthal, Bern, in 1822. They can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> distinguished from shooting thalers by their lack of denomination and difference in weight and often composition, though there is evidence that many of thaler-size did circulate amongst the legal tender coins of Switzerland. Shooting medals were minted in a variety of metals, including silver, bronze, goldene and white metal.|$|E
5|$|The {{parathyroid}} glands are {{variable in}} number: {{three or more}} small glands, and can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. Occasionally, some individuals may have six, eight, or even more parathyroid glands. Rarely, the parathyroid glands may be within the thyroid gland itself, the chest, or even the thymus.|$|E

5|$|The patient's own {{description}} {{is the best}} measure of pain; they will <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> asked to estimate intensity {{on a scale of}} 0–10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain they have ever felt). Some patients, however, may be unable to give verbal feedback about their pain. In these cases you must rely on physiological indicators such as facial expressions, body movements, and vocalizations such as moaning.|$|E
5|$|Their {{longevity}} may {{be explained}} by the fact that the builders used a relatively dry mix of mortar and aggregate and compacted it by pounding it down to eliminate air pockets. Although derived from earth products, concrete structures would not <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> considered earth structures.|$|E
5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always know what time it was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> seen from {{a large part of the}} Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E
5|$|A {{technique}} called radioembolization {{is used to}} treat hepatocellular carcinoma and liver metastasis. Radioembolization is a low toxicity, targeted liver cancer therapy that uses millions of tiny beads made of glass or resin containing radioactive yttrium-90. The radioactive microspheres are delivered directly to the blood vessels feeding specific liver tumors/segments or lobes. It is minimally invasive and patients can <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> discharged after a few hours. This procedure may not eliminate all tumors throughout the entire liver, but works on one segment or one lobe {{at a time and}} may require multiple procedures.|$|E
5|$|Each stop usually {{controls}} one rank of pipes, although mixtures and undulating stops (such as the Voix céleste) control multiple ranks. The name of {{the stop}} reflects not only the stop's timbre and construction, but also {{the style of the}} organ in which it resides. For example, the names on an organ built in the north German Baroque style generally will be derived from the German language, while the names of similar stops on an organ in the French Romantic style will <b>usually</b> <b>be</b> French. Most countries tend to use only their own languages for stop nomenclature. English-speaking nations as well as Japan are more receptive to foreign nomenclature. Stop names are not standardized: two otherwise identical stops from different organs may have different names.|$|E
50|$|The temples <b>are</b> <b>usually</b> {{painted in}} white or other light colours, and <b>usually</b> <b>are</b> covered with clay tiles. A Golden Kalasha is also seen.|$|R
