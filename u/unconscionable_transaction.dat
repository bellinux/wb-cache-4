40|$|This article alerts {{farmers and}} those who advise them {{of the need for}} caution when making {{arrangements}} or agreements with family members regarding the future ownership and succession of the family farm. Such arrangements are frequently oral and informal. Promises are made and revised, and often unspoken ‘understandings’ are arrived at. This lack of legal formality gives rise to a propensity for matters to go badly and bitterly ‘wrong’. Furthermore, the article draws attention to the fact that, even where formal arrangements are made, they are vulnerable to challenge {{and the nature of the}} legal and equitable doctrines applicable in such cases means the outcome of such challenges cannot be confidently predicted. It may come as a surprise to many farmers to learn that their autonomy in dealing with their land and businesses can be overridden by legally imposed obligations of morality and good conscience. The article illustrates its thesis by examining three High Court cases in which family farming agreements have been challenged. In each case, the court determined the fate of the family farm, not by reference to the farmer’s intention, but by the application of succession legislation and equitable doctrines, such as equitable estoppel and <b>unconscionable</b> <b>transaction.</b> Moreover, in two of these cases, the farmer’s actual intention was overridden in favour of an arrangement that better coincided with what the court considered that he ought to have done - resulting in an outcome that neither the parties nor their legal advisers could have expected...|$|E
40|$|While {{financial}} services {{are essential for}} the everyday life of EU citizens and for the EU economy at large, some of them entail very high risks which may particularly affect the vulnerable in financial transactions. Thus, for example, the provision of investment services by the bank may lead to huge financial losses beyond the client’s ability to pay. Similarly, the provision of a business loan to one family member {{on the condition that}} another family member stands as a surety for the whole debt may result in financial ruin for the latter. The information asymmetry and huge risks involved in some financial transactions give rise {{to the question of how}} and to what extent the vulnerable must be protected (against themselves). At present one can trace several contract-related methods of protecting the vulnerable against <b>unconscionable</b> financial <b>transactions,</b> some of which even going beyond private law. On the one hand, the influence of public law can be seen in the recourse to fundamental rights with a view to rebalancing contract law (e. g. the Bürgschaft case in Germany) and in the adoption of the financial supervision legislation in some areas containing extensive duties of care on the part of financial service providers. On the other hand, contract law itself has developed concepts which protect the vulnerable against <b>unconscionable</b> financial <b>transactions.</b> This contribution critically analyses these methods and a possible interplay between them. It is argued that recourse to fundamental rights cannot effectively resolve the problem of contractual unfairness. What is needed is a further development of contract law concepts of unconscionability taking into account the contract-related rules in the financial supervision laws and, possibly, even the integration of the two. Special attention in this respect must be paid to the role of the vulnerable at the (pre-) contractual stage...|$|R

There was nothing to alert Mr Akindele to the transaction being tainted. Dishonesty was not needed to establish liability for knowing receipt as a constructive trustee, Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2) 1980 1 All ER 393 considered. The degrees of knowledge in Baden were unhelpful and a single test of unconscionability was better. Even if constructive knowledge was still the test, Mr Akindele did not have constructive knowledge of the breach of trust by BCCI management.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} what seem to be basic principles in contract law: 2 ̆ 2 consideration need not be adequate 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 the rule against penalties applies only to sums payable on breach. 2 ̆ 2 The 2 ̆ 7 reluctant inspiration 2 ̆ 7 lies in the recent Australian case of Andrews v. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, which establishes {{that the absence of}} breach or an obligation to avoid the occurrence of an event upon which a sum becomes payable, does not render such sum incapable of being characterized as a penalty. This decision constitutes an unexpected divergence from the position in most other common law jurisdictions. What are its practical implications? Should we even engage in historical arguments given that the penalty jurisdiction evolved at the time where the law did not recognize enforceable promises to perform? The paper commences with broad observations regarding the enforceability of liquidated damages clauses, the increasingly commercial approach to evaluating whether a pre-estimate of loss is 2 ̆ 2 genuine 2 ̆ 2 and the necessity to treat sums payable on breach as part of the commercial bargain. The more liberal the attitude with regards to the amount (i. e. the higher the sum that can be stipulated), the more limited the effect of the rule against penalties. A liberal approach does not affect the contract breaker’s ability to invoke the rule but his ability to succeed. In combination with the description of the performance, the price and the limitation of liability (if any), sums payable on breach often point towards a transaction-specific risk allocation. In many instances such sums come dangerously close to primary obligations. And courts do not, as a matter of principle, review primary obligations. Once this is acknowledged, it becomes even more difficult to justify any attempts to expand the scope of the penalty jurisdiction beyond payments triggered by breach. After confronting some of the historical arguments made by the court in Andrews, the paper analyzes the recurring attempts to extend judicial review of contractual payments by creating 2 ̆ 2 hybrid stipulations 2 ̆ 2 – sums that are neither payable on breach nor in return for contractual performance. A difficult theoretical exercise awaits: should we create artificial divisions between contractual payments to establish whether they can be reviewed? Or should we finally acknowledge that all sums payable under a contract are part of the commercial bargain? On one hand, doctrinal integrity may point towards the need to vigorously defend the present form of the rule against penalties, including its (seemingly) strict limitation to sums payable on breach. On the other, some arguments made in Andrews and in other recent cases highlight the theoretical inconsistencies of its current formulation. After all, the 2 ̆ 2 breach/no breach 2 ̆ 2 dichotomy can also be regarded as a device for avoiding judicial scrutiny. At present, on the basis of Andrews alone it appears incorrect to use an institution that prohibits deterrence from breach to review the commercial substance of contracts. The rule against penalties reflects the general equitable principle not to enforce oppressive or <b>unconscionable</b> <b>transactions.</b> It does not reform commercially imprudent transactions. Given its exceptional nature, the penalty jurisdiction should be exercised sparingly – even with regards to sums payable on breach. Once sums payable on breach are regarded as part of commercial bargain, it is more difficult to subject them to review. If, however, payment is unrelated to the breach of a contractual promise, it comes dangerously close to being a contractual promise. Any review seems unacceptable...|$|R
