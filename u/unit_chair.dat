It also examines how environmental sustainability fits into the scaffolding of the main Bachelor of Commerce degree and how each school plays its part into the overall development of graduates’ understanding of environmental sustainability. In July and December 2011 all <b>unit</b> <b>chairs</b> in the Faculty of Business and Law at Deakin University were asked if and how environmental sustainability was included in their units. Of the 336 <b>unit</b> <b>chairs</b> that completed the survey,  37 % of those <b>unit</b> <b>chairs</b> replied positively and of the remainder, the vast majority of these believed environmental sustainability was not applicable to their unit. However, measuring the effectiveness of the introduction of environmental sustainability into the curriculum is extremely difficult and this is often done by student assessment methods. Only 7 % of the units actually carried out any assessment of the students’ knowledge of environmental sustainability. The findings across the faculty were mixed, with Post Graduate units and Management and Marketing courses being very strong in embedding environmental sustainability into their curriculum. The Bachelor of Commerce Degree students, especially those with Management or Marketing majors received a good grounding in environmental sustainability.   These findings have implications for course and curriculum designers who are trying to effectively embed environmental sustainability into the scaffolding of their existing educational courses. </div...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability to}} perform collegial {{governance}} is a cornerstone of modern universities in the United States and Canada. This idea of governance is well practiced among faculty members but is not often practiced {{to the same extent}} with librarians in those same institutions. In this chapter, I will look at a popular form of collegial governance called the Library Council. Further, I will examine how the Library Council at Brock University has enabled librarians there to perform meaningful collegial self-governance. Collegial Governance & the Library Council Most, if not all, universities and colleges in North America practice some form of collegial self-governance. This is often instantiated though the development of various committee structures that serve to govern the academic function of the institution. In the case of the lives of traditional faculty members, this can include a departmental committee governed by a departmental chair, a faculty committee governed by a dean, or a committee matched to an appropriate organizational <b>unit</b> <b>chaired</b> by an administrator. In cases of unionized work environments these structures are almost always codified in collective agreements and are the result of collective bargaining between the institution’s faculty association and its Administration. The basic concept behind collegial governance is that the fundamental functions of the academic institution are split into a bicameral division where the management function of the institution rests {{in the hands of the}} Administration, while matters involving the academic function fall in the hands of the faculty. For considerations that overlap between the two domains, joint committees are struck. The tradition of bicameralism traces its origins to British universities in the late 19 th century and expanded to North America. As pointed out by Andrew M. Boggs, “the principles of bicameralism and lay governance became the norm in university governanc...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to study the leadership style of academic chairs and faculty job satisfaction at the University of Guam. Using Fiedler 2 ̆ 7 s Contingency Model (1972), a prediction was made for interaction between a chair 2 ̆ 7 s leadership style and faculty job satisfaction, contingent upon three situational variables: leader-member relationships, task structure and position power of the leader. The criterion variable was job satisfaction of faculty. The situation at the University of Guam was hypothesized to be characterized by an unstructured task and weak position power of the chair. ^ Faculty and <b>unit</b> <b>chairs</b> from 25 academic divisions within the five colleges at the University of Guam completed paper-and-pencil questionnaires. Data analysis included testing the model by correlating faculty job satisfaction with leadership style, contingent upon situational variables of task structure, position power of the chair, and leader-member relations. ^ The supporting qualitative design used semi-structured interviews with one faculty member and chair from each of three units purposefully selected from different colleges. Interviews sought to identify perceptions of what constituted effective and noneffective academic leadership. Perception of situation variables in a multicultural higher education environment at the University of Guam differed from norms obtained from studies in other educational institutions. Faculty respondents perceived the position power of the chair to be low, the task to be structured, and the leader-member relations to be poor. These results contrasted with studies in higher educational institutions indicating high position power, unstructured tasks, and good leader-member relations. The low LPC score of the chairs indicated a tendency for task-oriented leadership, possibly indicative of high stress levels. ^ The hypotheses of Fiedler 2 ̆ 7 s Contingency Theory of Leadership Effectiveness (1972) relating the leadership style of the chair, measured as an LPC score, to faculty job satisfaction as an effectiveness measure, were not supported. Intrinsic job satisfaction was high and extrinsic job satisfaction was low. Qualitative summary results identified descriptors of effective academic leaders at the University of Guam as those demonstrating integrity, adaptability, and fairness in dealing with faculty members. ...|$|R

To develop a centralised, automated water quality and biofilm management system serving the distribution network providing water to Dublin Dental Hospital's 103 DCUs, capable of maintaining DUWL supply and output water at better than potable quality standards in the long-term and requiring a minimum of human intervention. The potable water standard for the European Union does not specify an upper limit of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, whereas a maximum of 100 cfu/mL is permitted in bottled water. Mains water of varying quality was treated by specifically selected automated filtration units to provide DCUs with water of consistent chemical composition. This water was then automatically disinfected using an electrochemically activated solution Ecasol (Trustwater Group, Clonmel, Ireland) (2. 5 ppm) prior to distribution to DCUs. Microbiological quality of both DUWL supply and output water was monitored weekly by culture on R 2 A agar for 10 sentinel DCUs for a 100 -week period. DUWLs were tested for the presence of biofilm by electron microscopy. Chemical composition of processed mains water consistently bettered potable water standards. DUWL supply water and output water aerobic heterotrophic bacterial counts averaged < 1 and 18. 1 cfu/mL, respectively, from the 10 DCUs, compared to 88 cfu/mL for unprocessed mains water. This correlated with the absence of biofilm in DUWLs. No adverse effects due to Ecasol treatment of supply water were observed for DUWLs or DCU instruments. This centralised and automated water treatment and biofilm management system consistently maintains DUWL output water at better than potable quality simultaneously in a large number of DCUs over the long-term...|$|R

Studies have demonstrated that DUWLs provide a favourable environment for microbial proliferation and biofilm formation, and that water is consequently often contaminated with high densities of various microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses). The presence of high levels of microbial contamination may be a health problem for dentists and patients, especially those who are immunocompromised.
