50|$|As the {{quantity}} of film and filmmakers grew, the demand for standardization increased. Between 1900 and 1910, film formats gradually became standardized and film stocks improved. A number of film gauges were made. Eastman increased the length of rolls to 200 feet without major adjustments to the emulsion, retaining a large market share. Lumiere reformulated its stock to match the speed of Eastman film, naming it 'Etiquette Violette' (Violet Label). Blair sold his English company to Pathé in 1907 and retired to the US. Pathe began to supplement its operation in 1910 by purchasing film prints, stripping the emulsion from the film base and re-coating it. 35mm film began to become the dominant gauge because of the popularity of Edison's and Lumière's cameras. Consumers usually purchased <b>unperforated</b> <b>film</b> and had to punch it by perforators that were often imprecise, causing difficulty in making prints for the opposite perforation format. In 1908, the perforators began {{to be made by}} Bell and Howell. Eastman Kodak used the Bell and Howell's machine to perforate its films. In 1909, Edison's organization of the Motion Picture Patents Trust agreed to what would become the standard: 35 mm gauge, with Edison perforations and a 1.33 aspect ratio.Agfa began to produce motion picture film in 1913, but remained a largely local supplier until World War I boycotts of popular French, American and Italian film stocks allowed the UFA film studio to flourish, boosting Agfa's orders. All film stocks were manufactured on a nitrate film base, which is highly flammable. Nitrate film fires were difficult to extinguish. A significant number of fatal accidents occurred in theatrical projection booths, where the heat of the projector lamp made ignition most likely. Amateur filmmaking (home movies) slowly developed during this period. Kodak developed a heat-resistant 'safety base' for home projection. In 1909, tests showed cellulose diacetate to be a viable replacement base, and Kodak began selling acetate-base films the following year in 22 mm widths for Edison's work on the Home Kinetoscope, which was commercially released in 1912. Eastman Kodak introduced a non-inflammable 35 mm film stock in 1909. The plasticizers used to make the film flexible evaporated quickly, making the film dry and brittle, causing splices to part and perforations to tear. In 1911 the major American film studios returned to using nitrate stock. More amateur formats began to use acetate based film, and several, including Kodak's own 16 mm format, were designed specifically to be manufactured with safety base. Kodak released Cine Negative Film Type E in 1916 and Type F (later known as Negative Film Par Speed Type 1201) in 1917. As both of these orthochromatic films were no faster than previous offerings; the improvements were in granularity and sharpness.|$|E

The purpose of an adapter structures {{is to provide}} some means bywhich the satellite can {{be attached to the}} rocket. Some of the adapters are made fromcarbon fiber reinforced plastic and the object of this thesis is to investigate alternativeproduction methods and to construct and test a prototype adapter made with chosenmethod. The selected method (vacuum bag only) was used to manufacture a prototype between thediameters 298 mm and 437 mm with a height of 104 mm using VTM 264 epoxy reinforcedwith 5 HS (3 K) 283 g/m 2 carbon fiber weave supplied by CYTEC Ind. Materials. The adapterprototype was designed and simulated using Nastran Software and the lay-up chosen so thatit could support a 200 kg satellite mounted 450 mm above the upper edge of the adapter. Several test plates were manufactured using an identical matrix but a different weave toestablish cure characteristics and optimal design of the edge dams so that the void contentcould be kept at a minimum. The best edge-dam design was found to consist of generalsealant, <b>unperforated</b> <b>film</b> and woven glass fiber. The finished adapter prototype wasdetermined to have a fiber volume fraction of 49. 7 % and a void content of roughly 1. 5 - 2 %in the radii and 0. 5 % in the flat areas which is not far from the current material whichtolerates voids up to 0. 5 %. The adapter also showed a slight thickening effect in the concaveradius and a thinning effect in the convex; these were expected and are also present tosome extent in current structures. The adapter was installed in the testing rig where it was exposed to some of the loadsrepresenting the design criteria used. The test loads were increased all the way to failureand the fatal load in a combined (compressive and lateral) load was determined to beroughly 87 kN which is several times above the required load limit. The material was also tested in respect to ILSS and 4 -point bending at Exova in Linköpingwhere the initial results show a 9. 7 % increase in interlaminar shear strength and a 28. 5 %decrease in flexural strength compared to current materialOverall the results are very promising, indicating a high potential in the selected method. However, further studies should be performed to optimize the manufacturing method andmore extensive tests should be carried out on more material systems.

40|$|We {{present the}} {{formulation}} of a scattering matrix method {{for the study of}} light-scattering properties of metal films. The method is employed {{for the study of the}} optical excitation of surface plasmons in a gold film of 15 - 230 nm thickness, patterned periodically with subwavelength nanoholes. The gold film is placed on a thick SiO 2 wafer, and the nanoholes as well as the top side of the gold film are filled with H 2 O. Light is incident on the gold film from either the SiO 2 or the H 2 O side. The extinction and reflectance spectra of the system, as well as the electromagnetic field distributions at certain characteristic wavelengths, are calculated. The extinction spectra show, depending on system parameters, one or several peaks in the visible wavelength range. The extinction peaks are found to be caused by surface plasmons. A simple model based on the dispersion relation for surface plasmons in an <b>unperforated</b> gold <b>film</b> is shown to predict the peak positions of the extinction for thick perforated films very well. Even for thin films, this simple model, which includes coupling of surface plasmons on both surfaces of the film, predicts peak positions of the extinction well if the hole diameter is small enough. As the hole diameter increases, the extinction peaks of thin films show redshifts. Extinction peaks caused by surface plasmons at the SiO 2 /Au interface in thick films exhibit strong redshifts when the film thickness is decreased. However, the extinction peaks caused by surface plasmons at the H 2 O/Au interface in thick films show a completely different behavior. In this case, the extinction peaks do not move noticeably when the film thickness is decreased. Instead, they are weakened and finally disappear. It is also found that each extinction peak is accompanied by an extinction dip and that a reflectance dip is located in the wavelength between the extinction peak and the dip. This arrangement of an extinction peak, a reflectance dip, and an extinction dip is a general property of the surface-plasmon excitation. The calculated electromagnetic field distributions in both thick and thin films show clearly the signature of the excitation of surface plasmons at the extinction peaks, the extinction dips, and the reflectance dips. In thick films with small holes, the electric-field strength in the vicinity of the holes is weak at wavelengths for which surface plasmons are excited. In contrast to this, for thin films at the surface-plasmon excitations, a much stronger electric field is seen in the vicinity of the holes...|$|R
