5|$|David {{decides to}} take the lead in {{opposing}} the Conqueror in hopes of earning independence for Athlum, which is currently a vassal state to the city of Celapaleis. The party succeeds in stopping the Conqueror's army from attacking Celapaleis, but the Conqueror himself attacks Athlum in their absence. He kills Emma, who had remained behind to defend the city and takes the massive Remnant of Athlum, shrinking it to a normal-sized sword. The party then returns to Elysion to rescue Irina from Wagram. Irina is revealed to have a special power, that of <b>unbinding</b> bound Remnants, and it was for this reason that she was kidnapped. They discover that Hermeien is trying to use the Conqueror and Wagram to spark distrust in the people for Remnants and the city-states' ability to control them, so that he can then use Irina and her power to prop himself up as supreme ruler. While the party are successful in retaking Irina and killing Hermeien, Wagram escapes while revealing that he and the Conqueror never planned to support Hermeien. Confronted by the Conqueror, Irina uses Nagapur's Remnant to protect her brother, destroying half of the city in the process.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after this}} agonizing pedicure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The {{bindings}} were pulled even tighter {{each time the}} girl's feet were rebound. This <b>unbinding</b> and rebinding ritual was repeated {{as often as possible}} (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants {{two or three times a}} week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that a woman with bound feet was limited in her ability to take part in politics, social life and the world, due to her {{restricted}} mobility. Bound feet rendered women dependent on their families, particularly their men, as they became largely restricted to their homes. The early Chinese feminist Qiu Jin, who underwent the painful process of <b>unbinding</b> her own bound feet, attacked footbinding and other traditional practices. She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient as it would mean women imprisoning themselves indoors. She believed that women should emancipate themselves from oppression, that girls can ensure their independence through education, and that they should develop new mental and physical qualities fitting for the new era. The ending of the practice is seen as a significant event in the process of female emancipation in China.|$|E
500|$|Strand {{displacement}} complexes {{can be used}} to make molecular {{logic gates}} capable of complex computation. [...] Unlike traditional electronic computers, which use electric current as inputs and outputs, molecular computers use the concentrations of specific chemical species as signals. [...] In the case of nucleic acid strand displacement circuits, the signal is the presence of nucleic acid strands that are released or consumed by binding and <b>unbinding</b> events to other strands in displacement complexes. [...] This approach has been used to make logic gates such as AND, OR, and NOT gates. [...] More recently, a four-bit circuit was demonstrated that can compute the square root of the integers 0–15, using a system of gates containing 130 DNA strands.|$|E
500|$|Escobar turned {{professional}} on September 1, 1930, {{in a fight}} card organized at the Victory Garden gym in San Juan. In this event, he defeated Luis [...] "Kid Dominican" [...] Pérez, {{who entered}} the fight as the Dominican Republic's champion, by knockout in the third round. In Puerto Rico, Escobar fought in 15 contests, before moving to Venezuela after the popularity of professional boxing declined in his home country. This move was motivated by Roberto Andrade, who provided transportation to the country. In Venezuela, he fought in Caracas, competing against José Lugo, Sindulfo Díaz, Rafael [...] "Moralito" [...] Morales, Pica Pica and Simón Chávez among others. On November 11, 1931, Escobar competed against Enrique Chaffardet for the Venezuelan Bantamweight Title, but lost by decision. After 17 fights, he returned to Puerto Rico and competed in five cards. But professional boxing suffered another decline in interest, which forced Escobar to work as an accommodator in baseball games three days of the week, generally on weekends. In the meanwhile, Tony Rojas, {{a friend of his}} managers Gustavo Jiménez and Arturo Gigante, convinced them to release Escobar of the contract which bound them. Since Escobar turned professional while he was still legally a minor, his father had to sign the <b>unbinding</b> agreement. After succeeding in this task, Rojas presented Escobar with a steam boat ticket to New York, which covered his food, clothes and hotel expenses. Escobar reached New York in early 1934, intending to [...] "obtain fame and honor" [...] for [...] " [...] motherland", there he was received by Rojas and professional trainer Whitey Bimstein. His first fight in the United States took place in Holyoke, Massachusetts on May 7, 1934. In this contest he was paired against Canadian bantamweight titleholder Bobby Leitham, defeating him by technical knockout in the seventh round.|$|E
2500|$|The Michaelis-Menten {{equation}} {{has been}} used to predict the rate of product formation in enzymatic reactions for more than a century.

While the first prediction is well established, the second is more elusive. [...] Mathematically analysis of the effect of enzyme-substrate <b>unbinding</b> on enzymatic reactions at the single-molecule level has shown that <b>unbinding</b> of an enzyme from a substrate can reduce the rate of product formation under some conditions, but may also have the opposite effect.

The former consisted in carrying a red-hot iron for five paces: the wound was immediately bound up and if, on <b>unbinding,</b> it was found to be festering the case was lost. In the ordeal by water the victim, usually an accused person, was cast bound into water: if he sunk he was innocent, if he floated, guilty.

2500|$|Theravada Buddhism is {{generally}} considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of Vibhajjavada (Pali), literally [...] "Teaching of Analysis", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the Four Noble Truths. This is attained in the achievement of Nirvana, or <b>Unbinding</b> which also ends the repeated cycle of birth, old age, sickness and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the Noble Eightfold Path.|$|E
