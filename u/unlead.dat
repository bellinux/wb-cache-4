40|$|Aim of {{the thesis}} is {{to explain the}} issue of forces acting in circuit breaker caused by {{magnetic}} fields induced by short-circuit current. This thesis is focused on force affecting in concrete system of a circuit breaker. The given circuit breaker is made by OEZ Letohrad, the type Modeion BD 250. In the thesis the way of creating 3 -D model is shown {{for the purpose of}} creating numeric simulation by ANSYS 11. The next approach of the thesis is the description of applicating the results for DC and AC current calculations. The noted calculation is made in the programme MATLAB 6. 5. The solutions are mentioned at calculations both in the graphic form and numeric specifications. Visualisation was made by using GIF graphic system animation. The individual pictures processing was done in the programme <b>UNLEAD</b> GIF ANIMATOR 5...|$|E
40|$|Using the OECDâ€™s data, {{we study}} {{well-being}} indices comparison main areas for Russia and economically developed countries. The tendency of <b>unleading</b> countries to find mechanisms {{of economic growth}} by the welfare various aspects impact is noted. We used the method of complex efficiency estimation {{to solve the problem}} of economic well-being analysis. We assessed the effectiveness and optimality of economic well-being of the population. The effectiveness assessment of economic well-being in Russia revealed a significant gap from foreign countries by most indices. The optimality assessment of economic well-being did not reveal any major differences in values between men and women both in Russia and in foreign countries, but allowed to establish a greater gap between the values of indicators of leading and lagging groups in Russia than in other countries. Indicators ratio of lagging groups in Russia with foreign countries was worse than the ratio of indicators at the entire population level. The results of the economic well-being analysis are advisable to consider in the process of state regulation in Russia. State support of social services should be a priority of social and economic policy on the federal and regional authorities. Our analysis justifies the recommendation to reduce the gap between rich and poor groups of Russia's population by using various regulatory tools, including a progressive scale for a number of taxes...|$|R
