40|$|When {{the art of}} posing was {{exploited}} by Oscar Wilde and bodybuilding performer Eugen Sandow, both achieved worldwide notoriety.

Yet after the Labouchère Amendment, when Wilde was persecuted as a poseur and prosecuted, Sandow was not censored, even though his homosexuality and homosexual following were a well-known public secret. Amidst the homophobic panic unleashed by the Wilde trials, Sandow’s posing was reframed as Sandow’s Physical Culture, repackaged as a patriotic strategy for achieving imperial manliness and National Efficiency, while providing licit new rituals for intense homosocial interaction with bared male bodies lauded by Uranists and <b>Unisexuals.</b> In the battle of virility over effeminacy, this article reveals how the queering of Sandow’s body cultures facilitated their circulation as multifarious signs, simultaneously aspirational and erogenous, edifying and homoerotic, permissive and perverse...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe optimal {{deployment}} of reproductive resources by hermaphrodites to male versus female function (i. e., their sex allocation) depends directly on opportunities for mating. If hermaphrodites occur among females, selection should favor {{those with a}} male-biased allocation because increased male allocation enhances siring success when eggs are abundant [1 – 3]. Similarly, when hermaphrodites co-occur with males, selection should favor those that bias their allocation toward their female function. We tested these predictions by allowing hermaphrodites of the plant Mercurialis annua to evolve in either {{the presence or absence}} of males. In the presence of males, hermaphrodites did not evolve, probably because they were already strongly female biased in the base population. However, hermaphrodites mating in the absence of males evolved greater male allocation, as predicted. Our results provide the first demonstration of an evolutionary response to the frequency of <b>unisexuals</b> in hermaphroditic sex allocation, and they verify the quantitative phase predicted by models for the transition between hermaphroditism and dioecy [4, 5]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Stressful {{ecological}} conditions have {{been implicated in}} the evolution of separate sexes in plants. Gender dimorphic species are often found in drier habitats than their sexually monomorphic relatives, and gynodioecious populations appear closer to a dioecious state as resources, particularly water, become limiting. This pattern could result if dry conditions decrease the relative seed fitness of cosexual plants, allowing female plants to become established in monomorphic populations. We studied geographical variation in gender expression and biomass allocation among 12 monomorphic and dimorphic populations of Wurmbea dioica along a latitudinal precipitation gradient in south-western Australia to provide insight into mechanisms by which aridity might favor transitions between sexual systems. Plants in monomorphic and dimorphic populations exhibited contrasting gender expression and patterns of biomass allocation in areas with different levels of precipitation. Among dimorphic populations, lower precipitation was associated with a higher frequency of female plants, and reduced allocation to female function by hermaphrodites during flowering. In contrast, stress conditions had no effect on female allocation at flowering in monomorphic populations. Across latitudes, <b>unisexuals</b> and cosexuals exhibited consistent differences in above ground traits, with cosexuals having larger leaves, taller stems and larger flowers. Although all plants were smalle...|$|R

25|$|Termites. By {{studying}} living termites Müller {{was able}} to correct many errors {{to be found in}} textbooks. For example, their caste system is organised quite differently from ants, since the castes contain members of both sexes, whereas in Hymenoptera the castes are <b>unisexual</b> and the males are haploid. Termites are placed in a completely distinct order from ants, traditionally the Isoptera.|$|E
25|$|Parthenogenesis is seen {{to occur}} {{naturally}} in aphids, Daphnia, rotifers, nematodes and some other invertebrates, {{as well as in}} many plants. Among vertebrates, strict parthenogenesis is only known to occur in lizards, snakes, birds and sharks, with fish, amphibians and reptiles exhibiting various forms of gynogenesis and hybridogenesis (an incomplete form of parthenogenesis). The first all-female (<b>unisexual)</b> reproduction in vertebrates was described in the fish Poecilia formosa in 1932. Since then at least 50 species of <b>unisexual</b> vertebrate have been described, including at least 20 fish, 25 lizards, a single snake species, frogs, and salamanders. Other, usually sexual, species may occasionally reproduce parthenogenetically and Komodo dragons; the hammerhead and blacktip sharks are recent additions to the known list of spontaneous parthenogenetic vertebrates. As with all types of asexual reproduction, there are both costs (low genetic diversity and therefore susceptibility to adverse mutations that might occur) and benefits (reproduction without the need for a male) associated with parthenogenesis.|$|E
40|$|Parthenogenetic {{lines of}} the Heteronotia binoei complex are genetically diverse, of hybrid origin, and {{geographically}} widespread, ranging from central Australia to the west coast. Analysis of the western populations revealed a class of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) approximately 12 % different from the mtDNAs found among parthenogens further east. Detailed analysis of mtDNAs from 59 western individuals revealed far greater diversity than previously reported for any parthenogenetic vertebrate. Phylogenetic comparisons with mtDNAs from the bisexual parental species identified the maternal parent(s) as coming from the SM 6 species, most probably from west coast populations. This ancestry contrasts {{with that of the}} more eastern parthenogenetic lines, which had as parents females of the other bisexual parental species, CA 6. The nucleotide diversity of mtDNA among the western parthenogens, although higher than usual (x 0. 38 %), is low compared with the variation found within (2. 1 %) and among (3. 9 - 7. 8 %) SM 6 populations. This diversity illustrates the importance of rigorous sampling of related bisexual populations for interpreting variation among <b>unisexuals.</b> Despite the high mtDNA diversity, these parthenogens probably arose from a relatively small geographic area. The distinct geographic ranges of parthenogens that have the two major classes of mtDNA suggest that the western populations arose separately and further to the west than did the other lines. If so, then the two groups of parthenogenetic lines should be regarded as separate species...|$|R
40|$|After {{the third}} trial of Oscar Wilde when {{paranoia}} of insidious ‘inversion’ peaked, Eugen Sandow’s physical culture became widely advocated for {{the attainment of}} muscularized manhood and the eradication of onanism and ‘inversion’. Extolled by the Marquis of Queensbury as a defence against effeminacy and by National Efficiency reformers as a panacea for degeneration, Sandow’s physical culture was also lauded by ‘uranists’ and ‘unisexuals’ for virilizing and depathologizing ‘inversion’. The very year that The Intermediate Sex was published, Edward Carpenter openly advocated the practice of physical culture in Sandow’s Magazine, while insisting that the male body in Sandow’s Institutes would benefit from being bared in “a large open swimming bath”, with “a running track” and “horizontal bars in convenient locations”. “Uranians of the “normal type”, explained Carpenter in Love’s Coming-of-Age, “possess thoroughly masculine powers of mind and body” and are “often muscular and well built. ” Extolling {{the virtues of the}} Ancient Greek gymnasium as Sandow’s model, Marc-André Raffalovich maintained that the ‘unisexual’ was also virilized by art and culture in which healthy heroic manliness was glorified. “He loves pictures, statues, images representing attractive figures,” Raffalovich wrote. “He has heroic dreams. He is a hero loving other heroes. ” By no means were <b>unisexuals</b> denied these phantasies, as this paper will reveal. Exploiting physical culture performances and photography, Sandow was powdered, painted and photographed nude in the same postures as Ancient Greek sculptures of Apollo and Hermes, while readily modelling himself as Hercules covered by nothing other than a skimpy tiger skin for the British and New Zealand Academicians, Aubrey Hunt and William Reuben Watts. Corporeally aspirational while lip-lickingly exhibitionist, this art and body culture was able to appease the Marquis of Queensbury, lure King Edward VII while simultaneously attracting a huge homosexual following. By focusing upon {{the ways in which the}} queering of art and body culture was able to function as a double sign, a licit expression of illicit desire that was simultaneously permissive and perverse, this paper will demonstrate how paradoxically the very policing of homoeroticism after the Wilde Trials led not to its suppression but to its gratification...|$|R
25|$|Asexual {{reproduction}} {{has been}} identified in squamates in six families of lizards and one snake. In some species of squamates, a population of females is able to produce a <b>unisexual</b> diploid clone of the mother. This form of asexual reproduction, called parthenogenesis, occurs in several species of gecko, and is particularly widespread in the teiids (especially Aspidocelis) and lacertids (Lacerta). In captivity, Komodo dragons (Varanidae) have reproduced by parthenogenesis.|$|E
25|$|The new foundresses {{and males}} gather in {{separate}} and <b>unisexual</b> clusters, and occasionally mate with non-relatives that they meet while feeding on flowers. Those clusters are common until November, often {{not too far}} from the nest, that no longer produces new wasps. All the workers die out, then the males, and only the fertilized foundresses overwinter in various shelters until the next year, when they start new colonies and the cycle goes on.|$|E
25|$|The {{terminal}} or lateral inflorescences are spike-like, {{made up of}} joint-like segments {{with tiny}} paired cymes emerging from the joints. Each cyme consists of three (rarely five) flowers completely embedded between the bract and immersed in the fleshy tissue of the axis. The flowers of a cyme are arranged in a transverse row, the central flower separating the lateral flowers, with tissue of the axis between them. The hermaphrodite or <b>unisexual</b> flowers {{are more or less}} radially symmetric, with a perianth of three or four fleshy tepals connate nearly to the apex, one or two stamens, and an ovary with two or three stigmas.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} solitary or {{aggregated}} in cymes, spikes, or panicles and typically perfect (bisexual) and actinomorphic. Some species have <b>unisexual</b> flowers. Bracts and bracteoles are either herbaceous or scarious. Flowers are regular with an herbaceous or scarious perianth of (one to) mostly five (rarely to eight) tepals, often joined. One to five stamens are opposite to tepals or alternating, inserting from a hypogynous disc, {{which may have}} appendages (pseudostaminodes) in some species. The anthers have two or four pollen sacs (locules). In tribe Caroxyloneae, anthers have vesicular appendages. The pollen grains are spherical with many pores (pantoporate), with pore numbers from a few to 250 (in Froelichia). One to three (rarely six) carpels are fused to a superior ovary with one (rarely two) basal ovule.|$|E
25|$|The {{flowers are}} <b>unisexual,</b> {{carried on the}} same {{inflorescence}} (i.e. the plant is monoecious). One (or occasionally two) inflorescences emerge from a leaf axil, with at least five inflorescence-bearing axils per fertile branch. The inflorescences have a unique structure among flowering plants. In the centre {{there is a single}} carpellate ("female") flower. This lacks obvious petals or sepals (although there are small bracts below the flower which some researchers have suggested may be the remnants of the perianth), and consists solely of a single-celled (unilocular) ovary, 5mm long by 2mm wide, surmounted by three curved 4mm long stigmas. On either side of the solitary carpellate flower there are two branches each with five or six staminate ("male") flowers arranged at 1–3mm intervals.|$|E
25|$|Sphagnum, {{like all}} other land plants, has an {{alternation}} of generations; like other bryophytes, the haploid gametophyte generation is dominant and persistent. Unlike other mosses, the long-lived gametophytes do not rely upon rhizoids to assist in water uptake. Sphagnum species can be <b>unisexual</b> (male or female, dioecious) or bisexual (male and female gametes produced from the same plant; monoecious); In North America, 80% of Sphagnum species are <b>unisexual.</b> Gametophytes have substantial asexual reproduction by fragmentation, producing much of the living material in sphagnum peatlands. Swimming sperm fertilize eggs contained in archegonia that remain attached to the female gametophyte. The sporophyte is relatively short-lived, and consists almost entirely of a shiny green, spherical spore capsule that becomes black with spores. Sporophytes are raised on stalks to facilitate spore dispersal, but unlike other mosses, Sphagnum stalks are produced by the maternal gametophyte. Tetrahedral haploid spores are produced in the sporophyte by meiosis, which are then dispersed when the capsule explosively discharges its cap, called an operculum, and shoots the spores some distance. The spores germinate to produce minute protonemae, which start as filaments, can become thalloid, and can produce a few rhizoids. Soon afterwards the protonema develops buds and these differentiate into its characteristic, erect, leafy, branched gametophyte with chlorophyllose cells and hyaline cells. This stage dominates the environment where Sphagnum grows, obliterating and burying the protonema and eventually building up into layers of dead moss called peat. Carpets of living Sphagnum may be attacked by various fungi, and one fungus that is also a mushroom, Sphagnurus paluster, produces conspicuous dead patches. When this fungus and other agarics attack the protonema, Sphagnum is induced to produce non-photosynthetic gemmae that can survive the fungal attack and months later germinate to produce new protonema and leafy gametophytes. It is unknown whether the leafy stage can produce such gemmae.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{original}} description and early {{work on this}} species in the 1990s, other field work has revealed some instances of L. schismatica flowers that were <b>unisexual.</b> The closely related species Triuris brevistylis was discovered to be mostly dioecious but a few individuals were located that had bisexual flowers with the flower arrangement inverted, just {{like that of the}} normal L. schismatica flowers. This discovery led the authors of the study to conclude that the inverted floral morphology evolved before L. schismatica and T. brevistylis diverged. Isolated populations during the Quaternary Period (around five million years ago) when temperatures in the Lacandon lowland rainforest were six to eight °C (10.8 to 14.4 °F) cooler than today. This hypothesis is supported by the geographic distribution where L. schismatica is restricted to the warmer lowlands and T. brevistylis has a distribution in the cooler highlands.|$|E
25|$|Separating {{the effect}} of {{resource}} use from that of interference is not easy. A good example of exploitative competition is found in aphid species competing over the sap in plant phloem. Each aphid species that feeds on host plant sap uses some of the resource, leaving less for competing species. In one study, Fordinae geoica was observed to out-compete F. formicaria {{to the extent that}} the latter species exhibited a reduction in survival by 84%. Another example is the one of competition for calling space in amphibians, where the calling activity of a species prevents the other one from calling in an area as wide as it would in allopatry. A last example is driving of bisexual rock lizards of genus Darevskia from their natural habitats by a daughter <b>unisexual</b> form; interference competition can be ruled out in this case, because parthenogenetic forms of the lizards never demonstrate aggressive behavior.|$|E
