5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the eruption, despite earning rapid fame and opportunities to research internationally in Japan, New Zealand, and Guadeloupe, Glicken still failed to obtain a job at USGS. Senior employees at the Survey found his behavioral oddities unsettling. Activity at Mount St. Helens diminished, prompting USGS to reduce CVO's budget and contemplate closing the station. He continued helping the Survey until 1989, also serving as an assistant researcher at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Santa Barbara.|$|E
5|$|The Spinks {{variety of}} avocado, Persea {{americana}} 'Spinks', {{was developed by}} William A. Spinks at his Duarte ranch between 1910 and 1920. In 1920, Spinks provided a supply of his avocados for a <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Berkeley and California Avocado Association comparison of avocado strains. The Spinks avocado fruit was shown to be more resistant to freezing than other avocados. They also {{proved to be the}} second-longest-lasting in storage out of the ten varieties tested.|$|E

5|$|Excavations at {{the site}} in the 1970s were {{sponsored}} by the University of California, Berkeley. They began in 1976 and were undertaken by John A. Graham, Robert F. Heizer and Edwin M. Shook. This first season uncovered 40 new monuments, including Stela5, {{to add to the}} dozen or so already known. Excavations by the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Berkeley continued until 1981 and uncovered even more monuments in that time. From 1987 excavations have been continued by the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH) under the direction of Miguel Orrego and Christa Schieber, and new monuments continue to be uncovered. The site has been declared a national park.|$|E
5|$|Gary Klein, born , {{attended}} the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Davis before transferring to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During the Independent Activities Period in 1973, {{a group of}} students including Klein worked together under Professor Buckley to produce an aluminum framed bicycle. After analyzing a number of contemporary steel frames, and examining ones that had broken in use, they were able to determine the stresses placed on a bicycle frame. Faced with limited available types of aluminum alloy tubing, the students chose to construct frames from 6061 aluminium alloy seamless drawn tube; alternatives such as the stronger 7075 aluminum alloy were discarded because of the tubing dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The Ghadar Party, {{initially}} the 'Pacific Coast Hindustan Association', {{was formed in}} 1913 in the United States {{under the leadership of}} Har Dayal, with Sohan Singh Bhakna as its president.

Many of its members were also from the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Berkeley including Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Kartar Singh Sarabha and V.G. Pingle. The party quickly gained support from Indian expatriates, especially in the United States, Canada and Asia.

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} World War II, a {{group of}} {{physicians}} proposed that the University of California should establish a medical school in Southern California. One {{of them was the}} urologist Elmer Belt, whose patients included the Governor of California, Earl Warren. The University of California Board of Regents voted to establish a medical school as part of the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Los Angeles (UCLA) on October 19, 1945. In 1946 the California State Legislature unanimously voted $7 million to establish the new school, and Earl Warren signed it into law.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Dean applied to the US Military Academy, but was rejected. He then tried to enlist in the United States Army during World War I, {{but he was too}} young to do so without his parents' permission, and his mother refused. Dean instead {{attended}} <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Berkeley studying pre-law. During this time, he also took a variety of side jobs, including a stevedore at the San Francisco docks, a motorman, and briefly as a patrolman for the Berkeley Police Department, where he worked under police chief August Vollmer. Dean originally sought to attain a Doctor of Law degree but only completed a Bachelor of Arts degree from Berkeley in 1922 before joining the Army.|$|E
5|$|Aside from control interfaces, {{the bridge}} set was {{populated}} with monitors looping animations. Each oval monitor was a rear-projection screen on which super 8mm and 16mm film sequences looped for each special effect. The production acquired 42 films {{for this purpose}} from an Arlington, Virginia-based company, Stowmar Enterprises. Stowmar's footage was exhausted {{only a few weeks}} into filming, and it became clear that new monitor films would be needed faster than an outside supplier could deliver them. Cole, Minor, and another production designer, Rick Sternbach, worked together with Povill to devise faster ways of shooting new footage. Cole and Povill rented an oscilloscope for a day and filmed its distortions. Other loops came from Long Beach Hospital, the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> San Diego, and experimental computer labs in New Mexico. In all, over two hundred pieces of monitor footage were created and catalogued into a seven-page listing.|$|E

5|$|Fletcher Joseph Perry {{was born}} in Stephens, Arkansas, {{and grew up in}} Los Angeles, California, after his family moved there during the Great Depression. He was a four-sport star at David Starr Jordan High School in Los Angeles. Perry grew up admiring several African-American athletes at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Los Angeles (UCLA), {{including}} Jackie Robinson, who played football and baseball and ran track for the university. After being rejected by UCLA, Perry played football at Compton Junior College in 1944, and scored 22 touchdowns that season. He was then recruited by UCLA, but declined, and enlisted in the Navy during World War II. He played football in the military for Naval Air Station Alameda. In an East vs. West college all-star game in January 1948, Perry scored on a four-yard run in the first quarter for the West, which also featured Bobby Layne of Texas and Jake Leicht of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|Further {{experiments}} in 1969 at Dubna and in 1970 at Berkeley demonstrated an actinide chemistry {{for the new}} element, so that by 1970 it was known that element 103 is the last actinide. In 1970, the Dubna group reported the synthesis of 255103 with half-life 20s and alpha decay energy 8.38MeV. However, {{it was not until}} 1971, when the nuclear physics team at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Berkeley successfully performed a whole series of experiments aimed at measuring the nuclear decay properties of the lawrencium isotopes with mass numbers from 255 through 260, that all previous results from Berkeley and Dubna were confirmed, apart from the Berkeley's group initial erroneous assignment of their first produced isotope to 257103 instead of the probably correct 258103. All final doubts were finally dispelled in 1976 and 1977 when the energies of X-rays emitted from 258103 were measured.|$|E
5|$|In later life, Hamming became {{interested}} in teaching. Between 1960 and 1976, {{when he left the}} Bell labs, he held visiting or adjunct professorships at Stanford University, the City College of New York, the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>California</b> <b>at</b> Irvine and Princeton University. As a Young Turk, Hamming had resented older scientists who had used up space and resources that would have been put to much better use by the young Turks. Looking at a commemorative poster of the Bell Labs' valued achievements, he noted that he had worked on or been associated with nearly all of those listed {{in the first half of}} his career at Bell Labs, but none in the second. He therefore resolved to retire in 1976, after thirty years.|$|E
