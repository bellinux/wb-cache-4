25|$|A novel biodegradable, tough {{elastomer}} {{has been}} developed from poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) for use in creation of a nerve guidance conduit. PGS was originally developed for soft tissue engineering purposes to specifically mimic ECM mechanical properties. It is considered an elastomer because {{it is able to}} recover from deformation in mechanically dynamic environments and to effectively distribute stress evenly throughout regenerating tissues in the form of microstresses. PGS is synthesized by a polycondensation reaction of glycerol and sebacic acid, which can be melt processed or solvent processed into the desired shape. PGS has a Young's modulus of 0.28 MPa and an <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> strength greater than 0.5 MPa. Peripheral nerve has a Young's modulus of approximately 0.45 MPa, which is very close to that of PGS. Additionally, PGS experiences surface degradation, accompanied by losses in linear mass and strength during resorption. Following implantation, the degradation half-life was determined to be 21 days; complete degradation occurred at day 60. PGS experiences minimal water absorption during degradation and does not have detectable swelling; swelling can cause distortion, which narrows the tubular lumen and can impede regeneration. It is advantageous that the degradation time of PGS can be varied by changing the degree of crosslinking and the ratio of sebacic acid to glycerol. In a study by Sundback et al. (2005), implanted PGS and PLGA conduits had similar early tissue responses; however, PLGA inflammatory responses spiked later, while PGS inflammatory responses continued to decreases.|$|E

500|$|In the Lexingtons {{longitudinal}} {{strength was}} challenged further {{by the large}} amount of freeboard required at the forward section of the hull to keep the ships dry and maintain a high speed in various types of weather. Also, while the [...] of belt armor being considered was not an impressive amount in itself, the belt's running potentially along 80 percent of the waterline and covering the entire side amidships made the amount of armor protection impressive by European standards. Because of the difference in <b>ultimate</b> <b>tensile</b> strength between armor steel and hull steel, severe stresses on the hull were expected. These factors plus the ships' unusual length prompted Naval Constructor R. H. Robinson, who led the design group for the Lexingtons, to make careful analyses of strength, buoyancy and stresses expected in service. For instance, designers assumed customarily that a ship needed to withstand stresses caused by a wave of the ship's length with a ratio of height to length of 1:20. Robinson found a more reasonable ratio at 1:26 for the Lexingtons, which also promised considerable savings in weight.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{externally}} bonded FRP-systems is {{an effective}} retrofitting technique widely recognized to increase strength and deformability of reinforced concrete columns. With the expanding use of FRP jacketing, accurate prediction in performance for design purposes becomes increasingly important, achieved through well characterised materials. A critical parameter in predicting the ultimate behaviour of FRP confined concrete is measured with the <b>ultimate</b> FRP <b>tensile</b> strain, determined from material direct <b>tensile</b> tests. However, <b>ultimate</b> FRP <b>tensile</b> strain determined experimentally according to flat coupon tests has not been reached at the circumferential (hoop) rupture of FRP jackets confining concrete cylinders. This paper presents {{the development of a}} novel 'Investigation of Circumferential-strain Experimental' (ICE) methodology for FRP characterisation, aimed at providing a reliable experimental technique to assess the ultimate hoop strain of FRP laminates. The ICE methodology uses the unique property of water that expands when it changes state of matter from liquid to solid, as a medium to apply an internal hydrostatic pressure replicating the effect of concrete columns subjected to axial loads. The method was first assessed on circular metal containers to assess its feasibility, and then validated on cylindrical Glass FRP specimens made of different diameters and laminate thicknesses. The results indicate that the proposed ICE methodology is a reliable test method generating statistically reproducible hoop strain measurements, while providing an effective test technique. Furthermore, average ultimate hoop strain results indicate a lower level of strain than those found in similar flat coupon specimens under direct tensile tension...|$|R

The characteristics of <b>ultimate</b> diametral <b>tensile</b> strength (DTS), moduli, pH values, and fracture surfaces of the samples with different amounts of surface-modified TTCP (30 %– 60 %) were determined before and after thermal cycling between 5 °C and 55 °C in deionized water for 600 cycles. The trends of all groups were ductile prior to thermal cycling and the moduli of all groups increased after thermal cycling. The ductile property of the control group without filler was not significantly affected. Larger amounts of fillers caused the particles to aggregate, subsequently decreasing the resin’s ability to disperse external forces and leading to brittleness after thermal cycling.
