5|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} of the Malagasy economy. Land {{is used for the}} cultivation of rice and other crops, raising of zebu and other livestock, the fabrication of bricks and other traditional livelihoods. In Antananarivo, access to land is guaranteed and protected by law for every resident of the city. The CUA manages requests to lease or purchase land, but demand dramatically outstrips supply and much of the unallocated land fails to meet the requisite criteria for parceling, such as land where floodwater runoff is diverted. Much of this marginal land has been illegally occupied and developed by land-seeking residents, creating shantytown slums in pockets throughout the lower portions of the city. This <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>development</b> poses sanitation and safety risks to residents in these areas.|$|E

Gosseau took over planning of the fort when construction was already under way. Starting in August 1712, Austrian engineers, supervised by the fort's commander, General Johann Stephan von Beckers, built barracks, staff headquarters, churches and monasteries, surrounded by system of moats, bastions and gun positions, respecting Gosseau's design. The design followed the model of lowland Dutch military fortifications of the period.|$|E

25|$|Davidson {{moved to}} East York in 1947 {{after the death}} of her mother. Shortly after moving she was {{diagnosed}} with cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital. Feeling that she had not much time left Davidson immersed herself in community issues. It turned out that the cancer diagnosis was incorrect but she continued her involvement. She established a neighbourhood kindergarten which led to her being elected as a school trustee in 1948. In 1952 she became the first woman to chair the East York Board of Education. In 1958, she was elected to East York's town council. In 1960 she ran for the position of Reeve of the Township of East York against incumbent Jack Allen. The main issue at the time was <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>development</b> on land bordering the Don Valley beside Bayview Avenue. The development, later dubbed the Bayview Ghost, was a rallying cry for her campaign. She beat Allen by 5,065 votes to 3,458. Davidson was a dedicated politician, often attending community meetings, up to 40 per month. She was also a formidable debater, with an abrupt and abrasive style that annoyed her fellow council members. Yet the voters loved her and she was re-elected six times.|$|E

40|$|Noise {{is defined}} as {{unwanted}} or objectionable sound. Human susceptibility to noise varies in terms of intensity, altitude, timbre of sound, personal sensibility, age, and history of ear disorder.

Although noise pollution in Kerman (located in southeast of Iran) is not as serious as that of large cities in Iran, it can be considered as one of the elements which have changed Kerman's life pattern. In this study, conducted in 1999, in order to assess noise pollution level in Kerman, 13 stations were selected and the levels of Lmax, LAV, L 99, L 90, L 50, L 10 were measured daily for 156 days. Results, in all stations, indicated that sound level in Kerman exceeds national standard level and WHO guidelines. Therefore, it is essential to take some actions in order to control Kerman noise pollution with some undesirable impacts...|$|R

50|$|Due to its {{favourable}} location, {{proximity to}} Bergen, {{and the construction}} of the tunnel, the island has in recent years been seeing strong population growth. To prevent <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>development,</b> a building ban was instituted in 2007 but was later removed. The ban was instituted after a non-legally binding cap that only allowed ten new houses to be built on the island per year. The purpose was to ensure that the population growth did not surpass the growth of drinking water availability and kindergarten capacity (among other things), but the cap proved to be ineffective.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Urbanization in the Philippines {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} in the region, as the Philippine economy {{continues}} towards service and industrial orientation and away from rural agriculture. Already more than 60 % of the population resides in cities, and it expected to continue to grow relentlessly. Likewise, rapid urbanization led to <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>developments,</b> which contribute to the deterioration of urban environment. Among this is the increasing traffic congestion due to improper planning and inefficient traffic management. Pressure is therefore mounting for Philippine local cities to address urban service requirements including transportation, thus the capacity of local government units to deal with these issues is a critical element in the promotion of sustainable urban development. To examine the needs of cities in developing its capacity to deal with transport and traffic problems, a nationwide survey on 120 cities was. This paper will present the results of the survey, with the aim of illustrating a comprehensive and clear picture of the needs of cities in the area of enhancing capacity building in transport planning and traffic management...|$|R

The work aims to contribute to the understanding of territorial features linked to extreme events (focus on floods, forest fires, droughts and heat-waves) and to propose solutions and policy-options for sustainable regional development in Europe. The analysis of impacts from weather driven extreme events is centred on the concept of ‘risk’, which is defined as the resulting combination of hazard, exposure and vulnerability.

40|$|Cameron Highlands was {{discovered}} in 1885 and was developed as a hill station. It first served as a quaint retreat destination for the British residence where the urban morphology of its little town centres were strongly characterised by colonial architecture such as bungalows, institutional buildings and government offices, shophouses and market stalls. Eventually due to economic pressure and location potentials, more land was opened for tea plantations and vegetable and flower industries. Conversely, recent rapid <b>uncontrolled</b> <b>developments</b> in the built environment and agricultural sectors have tarnished its natural environment, old-world charm and historical values.
