Research on integrated strategies has demonstrated that road <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> is a key element of an effective strategy, and is best complemented by actions to promote public transport, to reallocate road space and to manage land use [35, 41]. These measures are also likely to reduce the adverse impacts of urban road <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> on those travellers who are most disadvantaged by it, and increase its acceptability [42]. However, the best combination of these policy instruments will depend critically on the city context in which they are being applied.|$|R

The project did this by working with a user group of 20 cities interested in pursuing road <b>user</b> <b>charging,</b> to identify the barriers to their doing so, and to provide evidence on ways of overcoming those barriers.

This involved the trial of a congestion metering scheme, a form of road <b>user</b> <b>charging.</b> Cambridge presented an ideal opportunity for the implementation of a road <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> scheme not least in terms of its congestion problem, the free-standing nature {{of the city and the}} fact that at the time, the local authority in the form of the council was sympathetic to the objectives of road <b>user</b> <b>charging.</b> The scheme did not, however, proceed and many reasons have been put forward as to why this was the case—issues such as not all the alternatives having been exhausted, the level of sophistication of the proposed scheme and the lack of a similar scheme to consider elsewhere. Fifteen years later, Cambridgeshire is once again considering the whole issue of road <b>user</b> <b>charging.</b> As such, the aim of this paper is to assess how the authority is proceeding this time round: what type of technology is being considered; how the politicians are presenting the concept to the local population and what are they doing differently from the first time round, in terms of consultation; and most importantly, what provision for alternative means of transport will be made and how this relates to the potential success of any road <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> scheme?

50|$|Fuel {{taxes in}} New Zealand are {{considered}} an excise applied by the New Zealand Customs Service on shipments {{brought into the}} country. A breakdown of the fuel taxes is published by the Ministry of Economic Development. Excise as at 1 August 2012 totals 50.524 cents per litre ($1.89/imperial gal; $1.58/US gal) on petrol. In addition the national compulsory Accident Compensation Corporation motor vehicle account receives a contribution of 9.9 cents/litre (37.1¢/imperial gal; 30.9¢/US gal). The ethanol component of bio blended petrol currently attracts no excise duty. This was to be reviewed in 2012. Diesel is not taxed at the pump, but road users with vehicles over 3.5 tonne in Gross Laden Weight and any vehicles not powered wholly by any combination of petrol, LPG or CNG must pay the Road <b>User</b> <b>Charge</b> instead.

30|$|The use made of road <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> {{revenues}} {{is critical}} to determining the acceptability and effectiveness of the scheme (Section  3.11). Most charged drivers will initially be made worse off by road <b>user</b> <b>charging,</b> {{and it is only}} when the revenues have been channelled into transport (or other) improvements that they begin to appreciate the personal benefits. It is thus particularly important that the costs of operating road <b>user</b> <b>charging</b> schemes are kept as low as possible. It is also essential that the surplus revenues are available to the city authorities to use in support of their overall strategy (Sections  3.1 and 3.11).|$|R
40|$|<b>User</b> <b>charges</b> {{have come}} to play a {{significant}} role in the financing and delivery of publicly provided health services in many developing countries. As a response to health care financing crises, <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> are often promoted as a way of rationalizing the use of care, raising revenue, and improving the coverage and quality of services. The primary purpose of this paper is to provide a critical review of the main arguments for the efficiency- and equity-enhancing potential of <b>user</b> <b>charges.</b> The extent and scope of welfare gains from <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> are found to be very limited in practice. Using a less restrictive theoretical choice model and estimation technique, the most recent demand studies' findings indicate that household's utilization of health services are more responsive to changes in price and income than was initially reported by the early demand studies. Response to price changes are also found to be greater among the poor than the rich. These findings, combined with modest retained fee revenues and the failure of exemption mechanisms to protect the poor tend to cast doubt on the net benefits of <b>user</b> <b>charges</b> policy, particularly in the area of equity.
