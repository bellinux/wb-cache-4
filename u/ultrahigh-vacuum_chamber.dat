40|$|The {{experimental}} apparatus used in {{the investigation}} consisted of an <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> <b>chamber,</b> a triple-grid, a microwave-excited resonance lamp, and an electron energy analyzer.

40|$|If dark energy, which {{drives the}} {{accelerated}} {{expansion of the}} universe, consists of a light scalar field, itmight be detectable as a “fifth force ” between normal-matter objects, in potential conflict with precision tests of gravity. Chameleon fields and other theories with screening mechanisms, however, can evade these tests by suppressing the forces in regions of high density, such as the laboratory. Using a cesium matter-wave interferometer near a spherical mass in an <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> <b>chamber,</b> we reduced the screening mechanism by probing the fieldwith individual atoms rather thanwith bulkmatter. We therebyconstrained awide class of dark energy theories, including a range of chameleon and other theories that reproduce the observed cosmic acceleration. C osmological observations have firmly estab-lished {{that the universe is}} expanding at an accelerating pace, which can be explained by dark energy permeating all of space and accounting for ∼ 70 % of the energy densit...|$|E
40|$|Single-crystal copper {{thin films}} were {{oxidized}} at an isothermal temperature of 425 C and at an oxygen partial pressure of 0. 005 torr. Specimens were prepared by epitaxial vapor deposition onto polished faces of rocksalt and were mounted {{in a hot}} stage inside the <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> of a high-resolution electron microscope. An induction period of roughly 30 min was established which was independent of the film thickness but depended strongly on the oxygen partial pressure and to exposure to oxygen prior to oxidation. Neither stacking faults nor dislocations {{were found to be}} associated with the Cu 2 O nucleation sites. The experimental data, including results from oxygen dissolution experiments and from repetitive oxidation-reduction-oxidation sequences, fit well into the framework of an oxidation process involving the formation of a surface charge layer, oxygen saturation of the metal with formation of a supersaturated zone near the surface, and nucleation followed by surface diffusion of oxygen and bulk diffusion of copper for lateral and vertical oxide growth, respectively...|$|E
40|$|An IR {{pyrometric}} {{technique for}} measuring the surface temperatures of metal specimens in an <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> analytic <b>chamber</b> is described and demonstrated. The experimental setup comprises a commercial IR microscope with a long-working-distance right-angle objective (focal spot diameter 1 mm at 53 cm), a metal-coated glass vacuum chamber with a Ta-mesh-covered quartz viewport, an Mo specimen stub with an internal heating element, and a Ta disk test specimen with a flat side coated with a high-emissivity graphite film. The results of an initial calibration test are presented graphically and briefly characterized. The measurement error at 450 C {{is found to be}} less than 10 C...|$|R
40|$|The new {{instrument}} for near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectro-scopy {{which has been}} installed at the MAX II ring of the Swedish synchrotron radiation facility MAX IV Laboratory in Lund is presented. The {{new instrument}}, {{which is based on}} a SPECS PHOIBOS 150 NAP analyser, is the first to feature the use of retractable and exchangeable high-pressure cells. This implies that clean vacuum conditions are retained in the instrument’s analysis chamber and {{that it is possible to}} swiftly change between near-ambient and ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. In this way the instrument implements a direct link between ultrahigh-vacuum and in situ studies, and the entire pressure range from ultrahigh-vacuum to near-ambient conditions is available to the user. Measurements at pressures up to 105 mbar are carried out in the <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> analysis <b>chamber,</b> while measurements at higher pressures are performed in the high-pressure cell. The installation of a mass spectrometer on the exhaust line of the reaction cell offers the users the additional dimension of simultaneous reaction data monitoring. Moreover, the chosen design approach allows the use of dedicated cells for different sample environments, rendering the Swedish ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy instrument a highly versatile and flexible tool...|$|R
40|$|A Kelvinox 400 {{dilution}} refrigerator {{with the ability}} to load samples onto the mixing chamber {{from the bottom of the}} cryostat has been combined with an <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> (UHV) deposition <b>chamber</b> equipped with molecular beam sources. The liquid helium cooled sample transfer mechanism is used in a manner that allows films to be grown on substrates which are kept at temperatures of order 8 K with chamber pressures in the 10 ^- 9 to 10 ^- 10 Torr range. This system facilitates the growth of quench-condensed ultrathin films which must always be kept below ~ 12 K in a UHV environment during and after growth. Measurements can be made on the films down to millikelvin temperatures and in magnetic fields up to 15 T. Comment: 10 pages text, 1 figur...|$|R
30|$|HXPES {{measurements}} {{were conducted in}} an <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> <b>chamber</b> at room temperature at BL 46 XU and BL 47 XU of SPring- 8. The photon energy used for the photoemission measurements was 7.94 keV. Insulating FePc/PhRs catalysts Fe 500 and Fe 550 were mounted on indium sheets to avoid charging problems. In this study, the probing depth of HXPES for the C 1 s, N 1 s, O 1 s, and Fe 2 p edges is approximately 40 nm, which is about three {{times larger than the}} inelastic mean free paths of photoelectrons [24]. HXPES spectra were recorded by an electron analyzer (VG Scienta, R- 4000) with a pass energy Epass of 200 eV. The overall energy resolution estimated using the Fermi edge of an Au plate was approximately 0.25 eV, and the stability of the absolute energy was within 20 meV. All of the spectra shown in this paper are normalized to the peak height. For detailed chemical analysis, backgrounds of the core level spectra were subtracted by the Shirley method [25]. For the N 1 s HXPES, each spectrum was fitted with a Voigt function [26], which is a convolution of Gaussian and Lorentzian functions, to decompose it into different chemical species of nitrogen.|$|E
30|$|After discharge, {{the cell}} was opened inside an argon-filled glove box by {{removing}} the loosely bound positive electrode Al-current collector. The electrode {{and a piece of}} scratched lithium metal for reference were transferred into an <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> X-ray photoelectron-spectrometer <b>chamber</b> without exposing them to air by employing a sample transfer interface. An XPS study was performed with a Kratos Axis Ultra, a multitechnique electron spectrometer (Manchester, UK). The monochromatic Al X-ray source (148.6 [*]eV) was calibrated with the 3 d 5 / 2 line of silver (Hoffmann et al. 2015). Casa XPS analysis software was used for peak deconvolution, and line syntheses were conducted with a Gaussian–Lorentzian 70 : 30 curve fit and linear background subtraction of elemental spectra. The XPS profile depth was 10 [*]nm (Hoffmann et al. 2015; Singh et al. 2015).|$|R
40|$|We report {{studies of}} the {{interactions}} of quantified deuterium (hydrogen) atom beams with hard amorphous hydrogenated carbon films at a substrate temperature of ~ 330 K in an <b>ultrahigh-vacuum</b> (UHV) <b>chamber.</b> The modification/erosion of a-C:H (a-C:D) films was monitored in-situ by ellipsometry in real-time. By interpreting the ellipsometric information and combining it with measurements of the absolute D areal density changes of the a-C:H (a-C:D) films by ion beam analysis {{as a function of}} D (H) atom fluence, we are able to distinguish three sequential stages of D interaction with hard a-C:H films. The first stage is replacement of bonded hydrogen by deuterium up to an areal density of ~ 51015 D cm- 2 to a depth of ~ 1. 4 nm from the surface. This phase is complete after a deuterium fluence of 21018 cm- 2. The effective cross section for isotopic exchange of H with D atoms for the a-C:H layer is found to be σ= 2. 010 - 18 cm 2, and is close to the cross section for H abstraction from a carbon surface. This may indicate that H abstraction by D from the a-C:H surface is the rate limiting step for isotope exchange in this situation. Hydrogen replacement is followed by creation of additional C-D bonds in the near-surface region and increases the D areal density by about 2. 51015 D cm- 2. By ellipsometry thi...|$|R
