25|$|Under normal circumstances, a tiny {{amount of}} urobilinogen, if any, is {{excreted}} in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, {{some of the}} conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing {{an increase in the}} amount of <b>unconjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> in the blood. Because the <b>unconjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess <b>unconjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E
25|$|Like {{these other}} pigments, {{some of the}} double-bonds in {{bilirubin}} isomerize when exposed to light.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Because {{meconium}} accumulates continuously in {{the fetal}} intestine, {{analysis of the}} postnatally excreted material could yield important information of intrauterine metabolism and maturation. Therefore, {{a study of the}} bilirubin pigments in meconium and in the first neonatal stools was carried out. METHODS: Meconium and stools from 37 neonates of various gestational ages were collected carefully, and stored at - 20 degrees C, protected by aluminium foil. Samples were defrosted, vortex mixed with an equal amount of dimethyl sulfoxide, centrifuged, and submitted to analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography using newly developed methods to identify and to quantitate the bilirubin-IXalpha, -IXbeta, -IXgamma, and -IXdelta isomers. In addition, samples were also submitted to diazo coupling with ethyl anthranilate. Total coproporphyrins and zinc coproporphyrin were assayed for comparison. RESULTS: Unconjugated bilirubin-IXalpha and -IXbeta were detected in meconium but not the -IXgamma or the -IXbeta isomer. Bilirubin-IXbeta was the predominant pigment and comprised 63 % to 96 % of the <b>unconjugated</b> <b>bilirubins</b> in the first sample of meconium excreted. Its amount decreased rapidly during the first 5 days in full-term newborns, but this occurred more slowly in preterm neonates, especially in those with a gestational age less than 30 weeks. The decrease of bilirubin-IXbeta over time correlated with that of coproporphyrin. CONCLUSIONS: Bilirubin-IXbeta is the prevailing bile pigment in the first excreted sample of meconium. It gradually decreases after birth and can be considered a biochemical marker of meconium, like zinc coproporphyrin. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Choluria is the {{presence}} of bile in urine. Choluria is a common symptom of liver diseases, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. It can be described as dark or brown urine, {{often referred to as the}} color of Coca-Cola. Choluria is usually manifested when serum bilirubin is higher than 1.5 mg/dL.The presence of choluria is a useful symptom to distinguish if somebody presenting with jaundice has liver disease (direct hyperbilirubinemia) or hemolysis (indirect hyperbilirubinemia). In the first case, patients have choluria due to excess conjugated ("direct") bilirubin in blood, which is eliminated by kidneys. Hemolysis, on the contrary, is characterized by <b>unconjugated</b> ("indirect") <b>bilirubin</b> which is bound to albumin and thus not eliminated in urine.|$|R
25|$|Mixed ("Brown Pigment") stones {{typically}} contain 20–80% cholesterol (or 30–70%, {{according to}} the Japanese- classification system). Other common constituents are calcium carbonate, palmitate phosphate, bilirubin and other bile pigments (calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate and calcium stearate). Because of their calcium content, they are often radiographically visible. They typically arise secondary to infection of the biliary tract which results in the release of β-glucuronidase (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) which hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of <b>unconjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> in bile. Between 4% and 20% of stones are mixed.|$|E
2500|$|Note: Conjugated {{bilirubin}} {{is often}} incorrectly called [...] "direct bilirubin" [...] and <b>unconjugated</b> <b>bilirubin</b> is incorrectly called [...] "indirect bilirubin".

2500|$|Urine [...] {{bilirubin}} {{may also}} be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people.

Testing urine for both bilirubin and urobilinogen can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{applications}} of thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) procedures has revealed an unexpected {{wide variety of}} naturally occurring <b>unconjugated</b> and conjugated <b>bilirubins.</b> Biliverdins seems to occur only in unconjugated forms, mainly as the IX alpha isomer. Several synthetic biliverdins and bilirubins present interesting models for biochemical and metabolic studies. Owing to recent recognition of the astounding heterogeneity of natural bilirubins and to the various artifactual changes that bile pigments can undergo, considerable confusion has existed, and still exists, {{with regard to the}} nomenclature of the bile pigments and their derivatives. To set a background for further discussion, the present review starts with a brief discussion of nomenclature and of the various characteristic forms of lability of the bile pigments. TLC and HPLC procedures for preparation and analysis of <b>unconjugated</b> biliverdins and <b>bilirubins</b> and their methyl ester and sugar ester conjugates, as well as procedures for analysis of bilirubin-protein conjugates, are then discussed. Since, in view of the lability and pronounced heterogeneity of bile pigments, it is important to assess the composition and nature of chromatographically isolated pigments, the review is concluded by a brief evaluation of various structural tests. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Low {{birth weight}} and {{premature}} infants are at major risk for exaggerated hyperbilirubinaemia and jaundice {{that can lead}} to bilirubin encephalopathy. Phototherapy is the most common treatment for neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia and could be most effective in preventing the sequelae of hyperbilirubinaemia if initiated prophylactically. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of prophylactic phototherapy for preterm (10 mg/dl (typical RR 0. 27; 95 % CI 0. 22 to 0. 33; three studies, 1090 participants) or peak <b>unconjugated</b> serum <b>bilirubin</b> levels > 15 mg/dl (typical RR 0. 13; 95 % CI 0. 07 to 0. 23; four studies, 1116 participants).

40|$|The {{effects of}} thyroidectomy and of thyroid hormone {{administration}} on the hepatic transport of endogenous bilirubin were investigated in the Wistar R/APfd rat. Hypothyroidism {{resulted in an}} enhanced hepatic bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and in a decreased p-nitrophenol transferase activity. It caused a cholestatic condition with a 50 % decrease in bile flow and bile salt excretion, and an increased proportion of conjugated bilirubin in serum. The biliary output of <b>unconjugated</b> and monoconjugated <b>bilirubins</b> decreased in parallel by about 65 %, whereas the excretion rate of the diconjugate dropped by only 47 %, resulting in an increased di- to monoconjugate ratio in bile. Hyperthyroidism was characterized by a decreased bilirubin and an increased p-nitrophenol transferase activity, and by an augmented bilirubin output in bile. The output of <b>unconjugated</b> and monoconjugated <b>bilirubins</b> increased in parallel by about 50 or 100 %, whereas the excretion of the diconjugate increased by only 20 to 50 %, depending on the dose of thyroxine administered; {{this resulted in a}} decreased di- to monoconjugate ratio in bile. A linear positive relationship was found between bilirubin UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity and the ratio of bilirubin di- to monoconjugates present in bile or formed by in vitro incubation of liver homogenates at low concentration of bilirubin (10 to 15 microM), indicating that bile pigment composition is mainly determined by the conjugation activity in the liver.
