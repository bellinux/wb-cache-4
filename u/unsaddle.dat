500|$|The World Grand Championship, {{also known}} as the [...] "Big Stake" [...] or [...] "Rider's Cup, Canter" [...] is the final class of the Celebration. It is held late on the Saturday night before Labor Day, or more often, very early Sunday morning. To compete in the stake, horses must qualify by showing in a class on the first Saturday night of the show. Previous World Grand Champions are {{automatically}} eligible to compete again. The competing horses enter the arena to the song [...] "Flat Walk Boogie" [...] which was composed and is played by official TWHNC organist Larry Bright. Horses are required to perform the flat walk, running walk and canter twice each in two separate workouts. Between workouts, riders dismount and <b>unsaddle</b> their horses so the judges can evaluate their conformation. The winner is announced by a spotlight sweeping back and forth along the line-up of horses and then settling on the World Grand Champion.|$|E
60|$|With that he {{addressed}} {{a word to}} his comrades, and they repaired to a cedar-tree near-by, where they began to <b>unsaddle</b> and unpack.|$|E
60|$|She was {{trembling}} with apprehension and nestled close to me; while we both listened intently and heard Don Hilario <b>unsaddle</b> his horse, then going softly, whistling to himself, to his room.|$|E
60|$|A {{few moments}} later Bridge {{returned}} to the office, having <b>unsaddled</b> his pony {{and turned it into}} the pasture.|$|R
60|$|Without a word John leaped bareback {{on one of}} {{the horses}} he had just <b>unsaddled</b> and spurred him across the courtyard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can we have dinner!" [...] inquired Ned, {{entering}} this house of entertainment, while his companions were <b>unsaddling</b> and picketing their horses and mules.|$|R
6000|$|... "Easy now, Dale, ole man.... Don't you reckon I'm ridin' in on {{you pretty}} early? Look at thet hoss!" [...] John slid off and waved a hand at the {{drooping}} beast, then began to <b>unsaddle</b> him. [...] "Wal, he done great. We bogged some comin' over. An' I climbed the pass at night on the frozen snow." ...|$|E
60|$|Without {{speaking}} {{a word to}} him, the men led their horses through to the inner cave, and then threw themselves down by the fire. Jim at once proceeded to <b>unsaddle</b> the horses, and rub them down; keeping an ear open, all the time, to {{what was being said}} by the bush rangers. Their remarks however were, for a time, confined to terrible curses as to their luck.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll camp {{here for}} an hour or two," [...] he said sharply, leaping from his horse, which he {{proceeded}} to <b>unsaddle.</b> [...] "Hallo! somebody's bin here before us. Their fire ain't cold yet. Well, it don't matter. Get the grub ready, boys, an' boil the kettle. My head is all but split. If ever I have the luck to come across that Irish blackguard Brixton I'll--" ...|$|E
60|$|Barney <b>unsaddled</b> the captain's {{horse and}} turned him loose, then he remounted and, with the princess at his side, rode down toward Blentz.|$|R
60|$|When we had <b>unsaddled,</b> unpacked, {{and got a}} fire roaring on {{the wide}} stone hearth of the cabin, it was once again night.|$|R
6000|$|Grumblingly Grayson <b>unsaddled.</b> [...] "Ef you'd {{seen what}} I've seen around here," [...] he said, [...] "I guess you wouldn't be so keen {{to save this}} feller's hide." ...|$|R
60|$|Alone with Val after dinner, {{he sipped}} port deferentially and {{answered}} the advances of this new-found brother-in-law. As to riding (always the first consideration with Val) {{he could have}} the young chestnut, saddle and <b>unsaddle</b> it himself, and generally look after it when he brought it in. Jon said he was accustomed to all that at home, and {{saw that he had}} gone up one in his host's estimation.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] Dave agreed, [...] "I don't see {{any signs}} of the landmarks, {{but they may be}} somewhere about. We will <b>unsaddle</b> the ponies. Boys, you may as well walk up the stream a bit. Keep your eyes open, but don't go very far away. Keep your rifles ready for use; there is no saying but what some prowling Indian may not have caught sight of us as we came along." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{began to}} <b>unsaddle,</b> and the Marquis, {{restored}} to equanimity, followed his example. Rolling up his sleeves, Miss Sally sprang for the grub wagon, shouting: [...] "I'm the new cook b'thunder! Some of you chaps rustle a little wood for a fire, and I'll guarantee you a hot square meal inside of thirty minutes." [...] Miss Sally's energy and good-humor, as he ransacked the grub wagon for coffee, flour, and bacon, won the good {{opinion of the}} camp instantly.|$|E
25|$|Borglum's pieces can {{be found}} at the Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody, Wyoming, {{including}} Evening, a depiction of a cowboy leaning against his <b>unsaddled</b> horse at the end of the day.|$|R
50|$|The La Prevoyante Handicap {{is named}} for the Hall of Fame filly La Prevoyante who {{collapsed}} and died in the <b>unsaddling</b> area at Calder Race Course after a December 28, 1974 race.|$|R
6000|$|She <b>unsaddled</b> one pack-animal {{and spread}} some {{blankets}} on the grass. [...] "Lie down and rest while I boil some coffee," [...] she commanded; and he obeyed, {{too tired to}} make pretension toward assisting.|$|R
60|$|Leaving Pierre to <b>unsaddle</b> and {{rub down}} his horse, Philip {{walked to the}} farther edge of the wood, to view the country beyond. They were, he knew, not far from La Chatre; {{and he was not}} {{surprised}} to see the town, lying in a valley, to which the ground sloped down from the wood. It was about {{a mile and a half}} distant. Nearer the wood, but half a mile to the west, the towers of a fortified chateau rose from a clump of trees. The country was rich and well cultivated, and everything had an aspect of peace and comfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was easy}} enough. After {{what we had}} heard of these brigands I {{made up my mind}} that I would not <b>unsaddle</b> the mules, nor take the packs off the two loaded ones. The burdens were not heavy, for we have little but our bedding and the tents left, and I thought they might as well stay where they were, and in the morning we could shift them on to the others. I told Jos√© to watch about half the night; but I was {{standing}} talking to him, and smoking my last cigarette, when he said suddenly, 'I can hear a noise {{at the other end of}} the village.' ...|$|E

60|$|As we {{neared the}} ranch, however, Sally slowed down until I {{caught up with}} her; and side by side we rode the {{remainder}} of the way. At the corrals, while I <b>unsaddled,</b> she lingered.|$|R
60|$|Hare {{saw that}} they {{had come up with}} the other wagons. George Naab was leading a team down a rocky declivity to a pool of yellow water. The other boys were unharnessing and <b>unsaddling.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Walthew, smiling. [...] "Now I {{want the}} mule fed but not <b>unsaddled.</b> I may perhaps need {{it in an}} hour, {{and it would be}} an {{advantage}} if you could find me another." ...|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the horses}} were detrained and the baggage packed, the little party mounted and left the station, and {{choosing}} a piece of unoccupied ground {{a few hundred yards}} away, proceeded to <b>unsaddle</b> and picket the horses, while Chris rode away to the camp accompanied by one of the natives to hold his horse there. He had no difficulty in finding it, and dismounting, walked to the group of head-quarter tents. His appearance excited a good deal of amusement and some chaff from the soldiers he passed. He looked, indeed, like a young Dutch farmer in his rough clothes, and his rifle, and a bandolier of cartridges. Seeing a young officer close to a tent, he asked him which was that of the adjutant- general.|$|E
6000|$|... "This it {{said and}} vanished. I lifted my whip, but needed not to strike my horse, for not {{a bird that}} has wings could fly faster than he now flew with me on his back. No path was before me, nor did I know where we were going. Through rushes and through thickets, over burrows of wild animals, stones, rivers, marshes, we flew {{as if all the}} devils that are on the earth and under it were at our heels; and when the horse stopped it was at my own door. I stayed not to <b>unsaddle</b> him, but, cutting the {{surcingle}} with my knife, left him to shake the saddle off; then with the bridle I hammered on the door, shouting to my wife to open. I heard her fumbling for the tinder-box. 'For the love of Heaven, woman, strike no light,' I cried. 'Santa Barbara bendita! have you seen a ghost?' she exclaimed, opening to me. 'Yes,' I replied, rushing in and bolting the door, 'and had you struck a light you would now have been a widow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There must be no delay," [...] the {{commander-in-chief}} said. [...] "If possible--and it is possible--these scoundrels must be attacked at daylight to-morrow morning. They {{will see the}} rope the lad escaped by, {{but they will not}} dream of an attack so early, and may be caught napping. Besides, it is all important to rescue those officers, whom they will have been making a target of all day, especially as one is badly wounded, and will be in the full blaze of the sun. See that a wagon and an ambulance accompany the column. Send a regiment of Punjaub horse, three field guns, and three hundred infantry in light marching order. Let gharries be got together at once to take the infantry forty miles, then they will start fresh for a thirty-mile march. The cavalry and guns can go on at once; let them march halfway, then, <b>unsaddle</b> and rest. If they are off by half-past ten, they can get to their halting-place by five. Then if they have five hours' rest they will catch the infantry up before daybreak, and attack just as it gets light. Those light Punjaub horse can do it. Now, which regiments shall we send?" ...|$|E
60|$|Roy {{appeared}} to slide off the mustang without effort, and his swift hands slapped the straps as he <b>unsaddled.</b> Buckskin was wet with sweat and foam mixed with rain. He heaved. And steam rose from him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] {{returned}} the guide, who, however, seemed {{more interested in}} <b>unsaddling</b> his mules than in listening to {{the account of the}} unfortunate man, [...] "was it near this that he fell in with the bandits?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Outside, John, true to his habits, was thinking, even in {{that moment}} of suspense, about the faithful, {{exhausted}} horses. As he <b>unsaddled</b> them he talked: [...] "Fer soft an' fat hosses, winterin' high up, wal, you've done somethin'!" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{mouth of}} this canon was a wild, green-flowered, {{beautiful}} place. There were willows and alders and aspens along the brook. The green bench {{was like a}} grassy meadow. Joan {{caught a glimpse of}} a brown object, a deer or bear, stealing away through spruce-trees on the slope. She dismounted, aware now that her legs ached and it was comfortable to stretch them. Looking backward across the valley toward the last foot-hill, she saw the other men, with horses and packs, coming. She had a habit of close observation, and she thought that either the men with the packs had now one more horse than she remembered, or else she had not seen the extra one. Her attention shifted then. She watched Kells <b>unsaddle</b> the horses. He was wiry, muscular, quick with his hands. The big, blue-cylindered gun swung in front of him. That gun had a queer kind of attraction for her. The curved black butt made her think of a sharp grip of hand upon it. Kells did not hobble the horses. He slapped his bay on the haunch and drove him down toward the brook. Joan's pony followed. They drank, cracked the stones, climbed the other bank, and began to roll in the grass. Then the other men with the packs trotted up. Joan was glad. She had not thought of it before, but now she felt she would rather not be alone with Kells. She remarked then that there was no extra horse in the bunch. It seemed strange, her thinking that, and she imagined she was not clear-headed.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there is}} a great {{clapping}} of hands, and looking up you find the president has come; he is supported by two friends, and all three, with comic solemnity, wear tall hats and frock coats. They bow to the public. Bull-fighting is the only punctual thing in Spain, and the president arrives precisely as the clock strikes half-past four. He waves a handkerchief, the band strikes up, a door is opened, and the fighters enter. First come the three matadors, the eldest in the middle, the next on his right, and the youngest on the left; they are followed by their respective cuadrillas, the banderilleros, the capeadors, the picadors on horseback, and finally the chulos, whose duty it is to <b>unsaddle</b> dead horses, attach the slaughtered bull to the team of mules, and perform other minor offices. They advance, gorgeous in their coloured satin and gold embroidery, bearing a cloak peculiarly folded over the arm; they walk with a kind of swinging motion, as ordained by the convention of a century. They bow to the president, very solemnly. The applause is renewed. They retire to the side, three picadors take up their places at some distance from one another on the right of the door from which issues the bull. The alguaciles, in black velvet, with peaked and feathered hats, on horseback, come forward, and the key of the bull's den is thrown to them. They disappear. The fighters meanwhile exchange their satin cloaks for others of less value. There is another flourish of trumpets, the gates are opened for the bull.|$|E
6000|$|At {{five o'clock}} {{we came to}} the end of the road. It led to a forest glade, {{overlooking}} the stream we had followed, and that was as far as our wagon could go. The glade shone red with sumach, and surrounded by tall pines, with a rocky and shady glen below, it appeared a delightful place to camp. As I was about to <b>unsaddle</b> my horses I heard the cluck-cluck of turkeys. Pulling out my borrowed rifle, and calling Romer, I ran to the edge of the glade. The shady, swift stream ran fifty feet or so below me. Across it I saw into the woods where shade and gray rocks and colored brush mingled. Again I heard the turkeys cluck. [...] "Look hard, son," [...] I whispered. [...] "They're close." [...] R.C. came slipping along below us, with his rifle ready. Suddenly Romer stiffened, then pointed. [...] "There! Dad!--There!" [...] I saw two gobblers wade into the brook not more than a hundred and fifty feet away. Drawing down with fine aim I fired. The bullet splashed water all over the turkeys. One with loud whirr of wings flew away. The other leaped across the brook and ran--swift as a deer--right up the slope. As I tried to get the sight on him I heard other turkeys fly, and the crack-crack of R.C.'s gun. I shot twice at my running turkey, and all I did was to scatter the dirt over him, and make him run faster. R.C. had not done any better shooting. Romer, wonderful to relate, was so excited that he forgot to make fun of our marksmanship. We scouted around some, but the turkeys had gone. By promising to take Romer hunting after supper I contrived to get him back to the glade, where we made camp.|$|E
60|$|The knight {{shrugged his}} shoulders, {{and leaving the}} hut, brought in his horse, (which in the interim he had {{fastened}} to a tree,) <b>unsaddled</b> him with much attention, and spread upon the steed's weary back his own mantle.|$|R
60|$|It {{was still}} {{early in the}} {{afternoon}} when they passed {{under the shadow of}} the buttes, and, two miles farther, came upon a small lake, the water from which ran north. Here they <b>unsaddled</b> the horses and prepared to camp.|$|R
60|$|Over {{and over}} again he recounted her words, {{lingering}} especially upon the sweetness of her voice and the searching quality of that last look she had given him. He <b>unsaddled</b> his horse mechanically, and went about his cabin duties with listless deftness.|$|R
