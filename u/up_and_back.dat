25|$|Secretarybirds {{associate}} in monogamous pairs. During courtship, they exhibit a nuptial display by soaring high with undulating flight patterns and calling with guttural croaking. Males and females can also perform a grounded display by chasing {{each other with}} their wings <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>back,</b> much {{like the way they}} chase prey. They usually mate on the ground, although some do so in Acacia trees.|$|E
500|$|Saurolophus ( [...] ; meaning [...] "lizard crest") is a genus {{of large}} saurolophine hadrosaurid dinosaurs that lived about 70.0–68.5million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous of North America and Asia; {{it is one}} of the few genera of dinosaurs known from {{multiple}} continents. It is distinguished by a spike-like crest which projects <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> from the skull. Saurolophus was a herbivorous dinosaur which could move about either bipedally or quadrupedally.|$|E

500|$|In 1942, Seaborg married Helen Griggs, the {{secretary}} of physicist Ernest Lawrence. Under wartime pressure, Seaborg had moved to Chicago while engaged to Griggs. When Seaborg returned to accompany Griggs for the journey back to Chicago, friends expected them to marry in Chicago. But, eager to be married, Seaborg and Griggs impulsively got off the train {{in the town of}} Caliente, Nevada, for what they thought would be a quick wedding. When they asked for City Hall, they found Caliente had none—they would have to travel [...] north to Pioche, the county seat. With no car, this was no easy feat, but one of Caliente's newest deputy sheriffs {{turned out to be a}} recent graduate of the Cal Berkeley chemistry department and was more than happy to do a favor for Seaborg. The deputy sheriff arranged for the wedding couple to ride <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> to Pioche in a mail truck. The witnesses at the Seaborg wedding were a clerk and a janitor. Glenn Seaborg and Helen Griggs Seaborg had seven children, of whom the first, Peter Glenn Seaborg, died in 1997 (his twin Paulette having died in infancy). The others were Lynne Seaborg Cobb, David Seaborg, Steve Seaborg, Eric Seaborg, and Dianne Seaborg.|$|E

2500|$|An Dro, meaning [...] "the turn", is a Breton circle dance. The dancers {{link the}} little fingers {{in a long}} line, {{swinging}} their arms, whilst moving to their left. The arm movements consist first of two circular motions going <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> followed by one in the opposite direction. The leader (person at the left-hand end of the line) will lead the line into a spiral or double it back on itself to form patterns on the dance floor, and allow the dancers to see each other.|$|E

2500|$|NFL {{executive}} Bill Granholm {{recalled that}} it was Hirsch's ability to make the overhead or over-the-shoulder catch that set him apart: [...] "He would run down the field with his chin {{high in the air}} -- with his head all the way back.

2500|$|Occasionally a {{pinball machine}} {{will have a}} pin or post placed {{directly}} between the two bottom flippers. When this feature is present, the advanced player may then attempt to perform a [...] "chill maneuver" [...] when the ball is heading directly toward the pin by opting not to hit a flipper. If successful, this will cause the ball to bounce <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> into play. A related move, the [...] "dead flipper pass," [...] is performed by not flipping when a ball is heading toward a flipper. If done properly, the ball will bounce off the [...] "dead" [...] flipper, across to the other flipper, where it may be trapped and controlled.|$|E
2500|$|Most insects use {{a method}} that creates a {{spiralling}} leading edge vortex. These flapping wings move through two basic half-strokes. The downstroke starts <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> and is plunged downward and forward. [...] Then the wing is quickly flipped over (supination) so that the leading edge is pointed backward. The upstroke then pushes the wing upward and backward. Then the wing is flipped again (pronation) and another downstroke can occur. The frequency range in insects with synchronous flight muscles typically is 5 to 200 hertz (Hz). In those with asynchronous flight muscles, wing beat frequency may exceed 1000Hz. When the insect is hovering, the two strokes take {{the same amount of}} time. A slower downstroke, however, provides thrust.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. {{government}} mandated major safety improvements for vehicles {{starting with}} the 1980 model year. These included [...] front-end crash testing, [...] side crash testing, and [...] rollover testing, {{as well as the}} installation of bumpers that would resist a [...] impact at the front and [...] at the rear. [...] "Full-circle body protection was designed into the Pacer, {{starting with the}} energy-absorbing bumper mounts" [...] through upper and lower box-section rails on each side extending back to the front pillars, {{as well as from the}} bases of the pillars behind the doors, the box-section members in the body floor curve <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> in past the rear wheel houses.

2500|$|Until the Marian {{reforms of}} 107 BC, the lower ranks of Rome's {{military}} forces were [...] "farmer-soldiers", a militia of citizen smallholders conscripted {{for the duration}} of hostilities. They were expected to provide their own arms and armour. Citizens of higher status were expected to serve in more senior positions as a foundation for their progress to high civil office (see cursus honorum). The Romans believed that in Rome's earliest days, its military had gone to war in togas, hitching them <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> for action by using {{what became known as the}} [...] "Gabine cinch". From at least the mid-Republic on, the military reserved their togas for formal leisure and religious festivals; the tunic and sagum (heavy cloak) were used or preferred for active duty. As part of a peace settlement of 205 BC, two formerly rebellious Spanish tribes provided Roman troops with togas and heavy cloaks; [...] in 206 BC, Scipio Africanus was sent 1,200 togas and 12,000 tunics for his operations in North Africa. In the Macedonian campaign of 169 BC, the army was sent 6,000 togas and 30,000 tunics.|$|E
2500|$|Koolies {{are much}} sought-after in rural Australia, and {{interest}} {{is now being}} shown in America, Canada, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland and Holland. According to Geoff Broughton, {{past president of the}} Koolie Club of Australia for 7 years, the Koolie will head (move to the front or head of the stock to push them back towards you), heel or drive, (push the stock from behind), cast (move out and around the stock), block (hold the stock or block them from in front, in three sheep trials this action is called the pick <b>up)</b> <b>and</b> <b>back</b> (literally jump onto the backs of their charges to herd them if necessary). Koolies have a reputation for being upright workers with a good eye, who can easily shift their focus from holding the group to casting around a flock or gathering breakaways. They are not known for having [...] "sticky eyes" [...] (focusing on the sheep in front only). Unlike other working breeds, which are noted for their crouched form or style and preference for either yard or field work, Koolies are at ease working in closed surroundings such as yards or trucks and being out in paddocks and droving. As well as working anything from ducks to bulls, like all dogs of their kind they will herd family members and children in the absence of other charges.|$|E

In other uses, such as to reach upper floors of a building, a grenade may be lobbed for greater distance or accuracy.|$|R
