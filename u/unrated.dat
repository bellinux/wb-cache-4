5|$|On October 24, 2006, an <b>Unrated</b> Special Edition was {{released}}, {{while an}} <b>Unrated</b> Blu-ray edition was also released with various special features on January 23, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Blu-ray and DVD were {{released}} on October 29, 2007, in the United Kingdom, on October 31 in Hungary, November 20 in the United States, and December 12 in Australia. The DVD topped rental and sales charts in its opening week of release in the U.S. and Canada. There is an <b>unrated</b> version, which retains {{much of the}} original 'R-rated' dialogue, and a theatrical version of the film. However, the <b>unrated</b> version has a branching error resulted {{in one of the}} <b>unrated</b> changes to be omitted. The film briefly switches to the PG-13 version in the airbag scene; McClane's strong language is missing from this sequence (although international DVD releases of the <b>unrated</b> version are unaffected). The Blu-ray release features the PG-13 theatrical cut which runs at 128 minutes, while the Collector's Edition DVD includes both the <b>unrated</b> and theatrical versions. Time magazine's Richard Corliss named it one of the Top 10 DVDs of 2007, ranking it at #10.|$|E
5|$|The Strangers was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray in the United States on October 21, 2008. Both the Blu-ray and DVD feature rated and <b>unrated</b> versions of the film, with the <b>unrated</b> edition running approximately two minutes longer. Bonus materials include two deleted scenes and a making-of featurette. The DVD {{was released}} in the UK on December 26, 2008. The film was available on Universal VOD (Video on Demand) from November 19, 2008 through March 31, 2009.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray on December 29, 2009 in the United States and Canada. In Australia, the DVD and Blu-ray {{was released on}} May 18, 2010. The film opened at #11 at the DVD sales chart, making $1.6 {{million in the first}} week off 104,000 DVD units. There is a rated and an <b>unrated</b> version, with the <b>unrated</b> version running about five minutes longer than the theatrical version. The UK Blu-ray lacks most of the extras found on the locked US release.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, Die Hard 4.0 was {{released}} with the PG-13 cut with an M rating, {{the same as}} the others in the series (The Australian Classification Board is less strict with regards to language and to a lesser extent, violence). The <b>unrated</b> version was later released on DVD and Blu-ray also with an M rating. The film notably was never released in home media with its theatrical cut, and has only been released in Australia as the extended edition.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} animation by American {{graphic designer}} and cartoonist Bill Plympton. To illustrate key concepts, Fuck uses sound bites, music, video clips and archival film footage; Anderson combined excerpts from five television series and twenty-two {{films in the}} documentary. The interviews were cut so that different subjects appear {{to be talking to}} each other; the interviewees in question generally had opposite views on the subject. The film was <b>unrated</b> by the Motion Picture Association of America.|$|E
5|$|American Gangster was {{released}} in DVD and HD DVD format on February 19, 2008. The home release included an <b>unrated</b> extended version of the film, featuring 18 additional minutes and an alternate ending. The film topped both the DVD sales charts with 4 million units during its first week in stores, {{more than three times}} as many copies as second place Michael Clayton, and the rental charts. American Gangster ended up as the 14th best-selling DVD of 2008. It also topped the high-definition charts despite being released in the same week Toshiba announced it would discontinue the HD DVD format. On October 14, the film saw its release on Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|Aronofsky's followup, the {{psychological}} drama Requiem for a Dream, {{was based on}} the novel of the same name by Hubert Selby, Jr. The film garnered strong reviews and received an Academy Award nomination for Ellen Burstyn's performance. The film also generated considerable controversy due to the graphic nature of several scenes, and was eventually released <b>unrated.</b> After writing the World War II horror film Below, Aronofsky began production on his third film, the romantic fantasy sci-fi drama The Fountain. The film received mixed reviews and performed poorly at the box-office, but has since garnered a cult following.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for release in March 2012, Hansel & Gretel was delayed for ten months to accommodate Renner's appearances in The Avengers and The Bourne Legacy and to give Wirkola time to shoot a post-credits scene. It premiered in North America on January 25, 2013, in 2D, 3D, and IMAX 3D, as well in D-Box motion theaters and select international 4DX theaters, and was rated R in the United States. The film had its home media release on June 11, including a longer, <b>unrated</b> version on Blu-ray.|$|E
5|$|Several {{aspects of}} Aronofsky's films have been controversial, most notably Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler, and Black Swan. Requiem for a Dream was {{originally}} set for release in 2000, but it met with {{controversy in the}} United States, being rated NC-17 by the MPAA due to a graphic sex scene. Aronofsky appealed the rating, claiming that cutting any portion of the film would dilute its message. The appeal was denied and the film's distributor Artisan Entertainment decided to release the film <b>unrated.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tropic Thunder was {{released}} in the United States on DVD and Blu-ray on November 18, 2008, three months after its release and {{a week after the}} end of its theatrical run in the U.S. and Canada. The film {{was released}} on home video on January 26, 2009 in the United Kingdom. Special features include an <b>unrated</b> director's cut of the film, audio commentaries (including one featuring Stiller, Downey, and Black, with Downey providing his commentary as Lincoln Osiris, a nod to a joke in the film that Lazarus never breaks character until he completes the DVD commentary), several featurettes, deleted scenes, an alternate ending, and the Rain of Madness mockumentary.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the prior}} three {{films in the}} series, the U.S. rating was PG-13 rather than R. An <b>unrated</b> version {{contained}} more strong profanity and violence not shown in the theatrical version, and {{was included in the}} DVD release. For the DVD release, 20th Century Fox pioneered a new kind of DRM, Digital Copy protection that tries to weaken the incentives for consumers to learn how to rip discs by offering them a downloadable version with studio-imposed restrictions. The score for the film was released on July 2, 2007. The fifth film in the series, titled A Good Day to Die Hard, was released on February 14, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Warner Bros. {{originally}} planned {{to release the}} film on December 25, 1991. It first premiered at the Miami International Film Festival on February 7, 1992 before being released theatrically on February 28, 1992. The Mambo Kings was released on VHS and laserdisc on September 2, 1992, and on DVD on August 17, 2005. The DVD includes an <b>unrated</b> version of the film that restores one deleted scene. Other features include a behind-the-scenes featurette and an audio commentary by Arne Glimcher.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{received}} one Academy Award nomination, for Best Sound Mixing (Jeffrey J. Haboush, Greg P. Russell, Scott Millan and William Sarokin), which it lost to Inception. The film won Best Action/Adventure Film at the Saturn Awards, with Angelina Jolie being nominated for Best Actress, and the Deluxe <b>Unrated</b> Edition being nominated for Best DVD Special Edition. At the Taurus World Stunt Awards, stuntwoman Janene Carleton's jump on a moving truck won Best Overall Stunt by a Stunt Woman, {{and the film}} was nominated for Best Stunt Coordinator and/or 2nd Unit Director. It was also nominated for Satellite Awards for Cinematography and Original Score, a Golden Reel Award for Sound Effects and Foley, a People's Choice Award for Favorite Action Movie, and two Teen Choice Awards.|$|E
5|$|To {{counteract}} these increasing {{complaints and}} attempts at legislation, {{the video game}} industry in the United States created the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) in 1994. This was prompted by a 1993 congressional hearing over {{the violence in the}} video game Mortal Kombat and lack of consistent content ratings between publishers, with Congress threatening to pass legislation that would mandate a ratings system if the industry did not take its own steps. The industry reacted by forming the Interactive Digital Software Association, which would become the ESA, and establishing the ESRB. The ESRB, like the Motion Picture Association of America's rating system, is a voluntary and self-regulated body that examines the content of video games as provided by the publisher before distribution, and given a rating describing the content within, generally classified from being all ages-appropriate to adult audiences only. Video game distributors are similarly bound by voluntary compliance to check the age of the purchaser against the rating of the game to prevent the sale of mature titles to younger players. Most stores prevent the sale of <b>unrated</b> games, so virtually every video game sold at retail in the United States is rated by the ESRB. Attempts have been made to mandate the ratings system; the Family Entertainment Protection Act, a 2005 bill introduced into the U.S. Congress by Senators Hillary Clinton, Joseph Lieberman, and Evan Bayh, would have made ESRB participation mandatory with oversight by the Federal Trade Commission, and introduced fines for selling Mature or Adult-Only content to minors. The bill, however, did not clear the Senate. Though the ESRB met criticism in 2000â€“2005 for the ease of access of mature-rated games to minors, the Board has improved its efforts to enforce the ratings system at retailers. A 2011 report issued by the Federal Trade Commission found that the voluntary controls by the ESRB had the highest success rate of any media industry, preventing sales of mature titles to minors 87% of the time. Similar content rating systems exist in other countries, including the British Board of Film Classification, the Australian Classification Board, and Japan's Computer Entertainment Rating Organization.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, {{both the}} {{theatrical}} and <b>unrated</b> versions were rated 18 anyway. As such, only the <b>unrated</b> version was {{widely available in}} Germany.|$|E
25|$|Jesse's {{death in}} the <b>unrated</b> cut is much more gruesome. In the {{theatrical}} version, she is hit by a Predator smart weapon while trying to run away and impaled onto the wall, but in the <b>unrated</b> version, upon hitting the wall, her body is split in half with {{the bottom half of}} her body falling to the floor. (Early copies of the Blu-ray release were missing some scenes from the <b>Unrated</b> Cut and played the Theatrical version scenes in their place, 20th Century Fox quietly fixed the issue and later copies contain the full <b>Unrated</b> Cut).|$|E
25|$|<b>Unrated</b> participants.|$|E
25|$|The Hangover was {{released}} on DVD, Blu-ray, and UMD on December 15, 2009. There is a single disc theatrical version featuring both full and wide screen option (DVD only), {{as well as a}} wide screen two-disc <b>unrated</b> version of the film, also containing the theatrical version (DVD, Blu-ray, and UMD). The <b>unrated</b> version is approximately seven minutes longer than the theatrical version. The <b>unrated</b> version is on disc one and the theatrical version, digital copy, and the different features are on disc two.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Unrated</b> Cut shows a chestburster erupting from a child's chest at {{the start}} of the film.|$|E
25|$|The song's <b>unrated</b> {{music video}} was {{originally}} banned from YouTube before being reposted some weeks later.|$|E
25|$|Kaley Cuoco (uncredited, <b>unrated</b> version only) as a {{woman that}} Albert tries to pick up in a store.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} set of Establishment dimensions was defined for each size of ship, other than the smallest (i.e. the <b>unrated)</b> vessels.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray on June 27, 2006 in North America. There are {{two versions of the}} film, an <b>unrated</b> version (94 minutes long) and a PG-13 version (88 minutes long). The North American, European, South American, Hong Kong, Korean Blu-ray is the PG-13 version of the film. However the Japanese Blu-ray contains the <b>Unrated</b> version of the film. The film performed quite well in the DVD market, grossing over $35.1 million in rental sales. In the end the film turned in a healthy profit of over $36 million.|$|E
25|$|In April 2013, the school's Chess Club {{participated in}} the largest chess tournament in history, located in Nashville, Tennessee, taking home the seventh-place trophy in the K-9 <b>Unrated</b> Section.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the attempt}} to tone down the content, the Motion Picture Association of America deemed the film too violent to rate PG-13, so Gibson {{released}} it as <b>unrated.</b> The re-release showed for three weeks.|$|E
25|$|A Million Ways to Die in the West was {{released}} via DVD and Blu-ray on October 7, 2014. The Blu-ray release contains an <b>unrated</b> version (135 minutes), {{along with the}} original theatrical cut (116 minutes).|$|E
25|$|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem was {{released}} on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on April 15, 2008 in North America and May 12, 2008 in the United Kingdom by Fox Home Entertainment. It {{was released}} in three versions: a single-disc, R-rated version of the 94-minute theatrical presentation, a single-disc <b>unrated</b> version extended to 101 minutes and a two-disc <b>unrated</b> version with the 101 minute film and a second disc of special features. Extra features on the single-disc editions include two audio commentary tracks: one by the directors and producer John Davis and a second by creature effects designers and creators Tom Woodruff Jr. and Alec Gillis.|$|E
25|$|On October 23, 2007, Warner Home Video {{released}} Eyes Wide Shut in {{a special}} edition DVD, plus the HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats. This is the first home video release that presents the film in anamorphic 1.78:1 (16:9) format (note that the film was shown theatrically as soft matted 1.66:1 in Europe and 1.85:1 in the USA and Japan). The previous DVD release used a 1.33:1 (4:3) aspect ratio. It is also the first American home video release to feature the uncut version. Although the earliest American DVD of the uncut version states on the cover that it includes both the R-rated and <b>unrated</b> editions, in actuality only the <b>unrated</b> edition is on the DVD.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on Blu-ray Disc and DVD on September 17, 2013. The Blu-ray disc contains an <b>unrated</b> cut. It adds seven minutes of additional footage featuring moderate amounts of blood, gore and violence. Some scenes that are shown in cinemas are also extended.|$|E
25|$|An <b>unrated</b> director's cut of {{the film}} has been released; it has extra footage of battle scenes {{as well as more}} scenes between Lancelot and Guinevere, whose {{traditional}} love triangle with Arthur is only hinted at here. The battle scenes are also bloodier and more graphic.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the BBFC gave {{both the}} {{theatrical}} version and the <b>unrated</b> version a 15 certificate for strong language, violence, horror and gore. Every UK release bar the UMD version were rated 18 overall {{due to a}} bonus feature (a highlights reel of the goriest moments called Scenes of Carnage).|$|E
25|$|However, the British Board of Film Classification {{refused to}} allow {{the release of the}} film uncut in Britain, citing its extreme levels of sexual {{violence}} towards women. In Hong Kong, 15 minutes of footage were cut. In the United States it has been shown uncut (<b>unrated).</b> An uncut DVD was also released in the Benelux.|$|E
25|$|Land of the Dead is {{the first}} film in the series to receive an MPAA rating for its {{theatrical}} release. Romero had said for years that he would film two versions; an R rated cut for theatrical release and first DVD, and an <b>unrated</b> cut for the second DVD release. Both DVDs were released in the U.S. on October 18, 2005. Rumors suggested that Romero shot alternate, less explicit, gore scenes for the theatrical release, {{but this is not}} entirely accurate. The more extreme instances of gore (e.g. a woman having her navel piercing graphically torn out by a zombie) were obscured by foreground elements filmed on bluescreen, so that these overlaid elements could be easily removed for the <b>unrated</b> DVD. Other ways to obscure blood in order to get an R-rating were achieved by simply trimming the grislier shots by a few seconds, by digitally repainting blood so that it is more black than red, or by digitally painting the blood out altogether.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{original}} DVD release sold well, it contained no extra materials other than soundtrack language selections. The no-frills edition provoked speculation about when {{a special edition}} would be released. On January 30, 2007, a two-disc Definitive Edition was released in the North American markets, and March 26 elsewhere. It contains several documentaries, soundtrack commentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes, the 2005 <b>unrated</b> version, and {{the original}} 2004 theatrical version.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} set of Establishment dimensions was defined for each size of ship, other than the smallest (i.e. the <b>unrated)</b> vessels. In the main (the exceptions being the 64-gun and 58-gun ships, as shown below) the armament remained that set out under the 1743 Establishment of Guns (created by Order of the King in Council, 25 April 1743); this was applied retrospectively to all ships order to be built subsequent to 1 January 1740.|$|E
