40|$|A Bessel beam {{without an}} axial {{gradient}} can exert a pulling force on an object [A. Novitsky, C. W. Qiu, and H. Wang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 203601 (2011) ]. However, it cannot {{be called a}} ‘‘tractor beam’’ per se, {{as long as the}} light pulling effect is ultrasensitive to the object’s material and size, a perturbation of which will make the optical traction go away. In this Letter, we investigate and report on the universality for a Bessel beam to be either a material-independent or size-independent optical tractor beam within the dipolar regime. Moreover, a general condition for a nonparaxial laser to be simultaneously a material- and size-independent tractor beam is proposed. These <b>universal</b> <b>pulling</b> effects and conditions are discussed in association with insight on modified far-field scattering, scattering resonances, and induced polarizabilities. Interestingly, we find that the acoustic pulling force exhibits only size independence, owing to the acoustic scattering theory in contrast to the light scattering counterpart. The findings pave the way for the realistic engineering and application of <b>universal</b> tractor beams <b>pulling</b> a wide variety of objects...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{analyzes}} the performance of the Itinerant Civil Special Court project, {{developed in}} Florianópolis in the period of April to November of 2003, by the Local State Judiciary Power. It is pointed out that the Itinerant Civil Special Court is based on the attempt of making conditions of citizenship exercise and the participation of {{the community in}} the resolution of its conflicts. Besides that, it also intends the decentralization and the intent of making the access to justice <b>universal,</b> <b>pulling</b> together the Judiciary Power and the community. For the thematic contextualization, was intended to establish the present concept of citizenship, the access to justice and roll of the Judiciary Power, to finally describe the structure of Itinerant Court and demonstrate its statistics data and activity developed. To conclude this paper a bibliography research was made, with direct documental research and statistic data supplied by the special Court and interviews with users and collaborators of the project. Este artigo analisa o desempenho do projeto Juizado Especial Cível Itinerante, desenvolvido em Florianópolis, durante os meses de abril a novembro do ano de 2003, pelo Poder Judiciário Estadual local. Ressalta-se que o Juizado Especial Cível Itinerante se constitui na tentativa de proporcionalizar condições de exercício de cidadania e participação das comunidades na resolução de seus conflitos. Além disso, visa também à descentralização e universalização do acesso à justiça, bem como da aproximação do Poder Judiciário com a comunidade. No sentido de contextualização da temática, buscou-se estabelecer a concepção atual da cidadania, como também do acesso à justiça e do papel do Poder Judiciário, para, por fim, descrever a estrutura do Juizado Itinerante e demonstrar seus dados estatísticos e atividades desenvolvidas. Para realização desse trabalho foi utilizada pesquisa bibliográfica, bem como pesquisa documental direta a dados estatísticos fornecidos pelo Juizado Especial e entrevistas com usuários e colaboradores do projeto...|$|R

Kaplan's son Rueben, invented the [...] "Grip-O-Matic" [...] <b>universal</b> gear <b>puller</b> and received his first patent. [...] The tool remains virtually unchanged to this day. By 1934, OTC was selling a variety of mechanic's tools to farmers and service stations.

When World War II broke out in 1939, the U.S. Army and Navy bought large quantities of OTC tools and by 1945, the company had doubled its staff. In 1950, Kaplan began work in ultra-high-pressure fluid power technology, a new technology for hydraulics manufacturers of the day. One development was a twin-cylinder ram that operated at 10,000 psi—much higher than any other devices of the day.|$|R
5000|$|The sixth {{aspect of}} the Six Paths, the Deva Path (Tendō), {{provides}} five known abilities based on gravitation. The first is Almighty Push (lit. [...] "Heavenly Subjugation of the Omnipresent God"), which uses the user's body as the epicenter of gravity and pushes away any technique of any force through gravity manipulation, though it has a five-second limit after each use. It {{can be used for}} a large-scale effect by placing a titanic gravity over a large area and obliterating it; in this case {{it can be used to}} destroy an entire village - at the cost of shortening the user's lifespan and being unable to use it for several minutes. The second is <b>Universal</b> <b>Pull</b> (lit. [...] "Heavenly Attraction of All Creation"), a companion of Almighty Push which also manipulates gravity, but pulls all things towards a center point. It also has the same five-second limit, though it is unknown whether it can be used for a large-scale effect. The third ability is Planetary Devastation (lit. [...] "Heavenly Body Bursts from the Earth"), which musters a large amount of user's chakra to release a small black orb of energy with intense gravitational pull, enough to uproot trees and destroy mountains, that compacts any thing caught in its pull into an extraterrestrial body that serves to encase whoever is trapped within it. Hagoromo used this technique to seal the Gedo Statue with the moon created as a result. The fourth ability is Shattered Heaven (lit. [...] "Heavenly Obstacle Quaking Star"), which pulls down double meteors to the Earth. The fifth ability is Limbo: Hengoku (lit. [...] "Wheel Grave: Limbo"), which sends as many as five shadowed duplicates of the user to an invisible world known as the Limbo (lit. [...] "Wheel Grave"). The shadow can attack in accordance with the user, capable of striking all nine Tailed Beasts at once. It is normally undetectable by people without Rinnegan; however, Naruto is able to sense its presence after receiving some of Hagoromo's power. Despite being invisible, the shadows can be bound, and if they expire, all damage they sustained are transferred to their user.|$|R

40|$|Fronts {{that start}} {{from a local}} {{perturbation}} and propagate into a linearly unstable state come in two classes: pulled and pushed. "Pulled" fronts are "pulled along" by the spreading of linear perturbations about the unstable state, so their asymptotic speed v^* equals the spreading speed of linear perturbations of the unstable state. The central result {{of this paper is}} that the velocity of pulled fronts converges universally for time t→∞ like v(t) =v^*- 3 /(2 λ^*t) + (3 √(π) / 2) Dλ^*/(Dλ^*^ 2 t) ^ 3 / 2 +O(1 /t^ 2). The parameters v^*, λ^*, and D are determined through a saddle point analysis from the equation of motion linearized about the unstable invaded state. The interior of the front is essentially slaved to the leading edge, and we derive a simple, explicit and universal expression for its relaxation towards ϕ(x,t) =Φ^*(x-v^*t). Our result, which {{can be viewed as a}} general center manifold result for pulled front propagation, is derived in detail for the well known nonlinear F-KPP diffusion equation, and extended to much more general (sets of) equations (p. d. e. 's, difference equations, integro-differential equations etc.). Our <b>universal</b> result for <b>pulled</b> fronts thus implies independence (i) of the level curve which is used to track the front position, (ii) of the precise nonlinearities, (iii) of the precise form of the linear operators, and (iv) of the precise initial conditions. Our simulations confirm all our analytical predictions in every detail. A consequence of the slow algebraic relaxation is the breakdown of various perturbative schemes due to the absence of adiabatic decoupling.

40|$|AbstractWe study a {{new model}} Tess of a {{universal}} Teichmüller space, which is defined to be the collection Tess′ of all ideal tesselations of the Poincaré disk (together with a distinguished oriented edge) modulo the natural action of the Mödbius group Möb. Applying arguments from the decorated Teichmuller theory of punctured surfaces (which was developed elsewhere), we find that Tess is an infinite-dimensional Fréhet manifold with canonical global coordinates, {{and there are a}} "universal sympletic form" ω on Tess (which generalizes the classical Weil-Petersson Kähler two-forms) and a group G (which generalizes the classical mapping class groups) acting on Tess and preserving ω. In fact, Tess, is isomorphic to the right coset space of Möb in the group Homeo+ of all orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the circle, and one sees easily that Tess naturally generalizes the other well-known models of a universal Teichmüller space, namely, Bers′ universal Teichmüller space and the right coset space of Möb in the subgroup of C∞ smooth elements of Homeo+ (which is of interest in physics). The latter model supports the Kirillov-Kostant two-form, and we show that the <b>universal</b> symplectic form <b>pulls</b> back to this two-form. Implicit in our discussion so far is the fact that Homeo+ is isomorphic to Tess′, and one is led to ask for the characterization of various families of homeomorphisms in terms of the corresponding tesselation. Reporting on joint work with Dennis Sullivan, we partially solve one such problem here using the Ahlfors-Bers theory. Furthermore (as in the classical decorated Teichmuller theory) there is an associated "universal decorated Teichmüller space" Tess̃, which is actually of central concern in this work. Tess̃ is a Fréchet manifold on which G acts, and there is a G-invariant two-form, just above for Tess. There is moreover a G-invariant cell-decomposition of Tess̃ which generalizes the cell decompositions of the classical decorated Teichmüllerspaces. Thus, truly all {{of the structure of the}} decorated Teichmüller spaces of punctured surfaces which is known from previous work arises as the restriction of a corresponding universal structure on Tess̃...|$|R
