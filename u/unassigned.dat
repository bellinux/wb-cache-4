5|$|The Committee on Territories again {{rejected}} Weaver's bill, but {{approved a}} compromise measure {{that opened the}} <b>Unassigned</b> Lands, Cherokee Outlet, and Neutral Strip to settlement. Congress debated the bill over several months, while the tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory; according to an 1884 Supreme Court decision, Elkv. Wilkins, Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting rights in the new territory. When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in limbo. Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.|$|E
5|$|When U.S. Highways {{were first}} posted in New York in 1927, US9 was {{restored}} to its originally planned alignment between Albany and Glens Falls (via Waterford and Mechanicville) while the US109 designation went <b>unassigned.</b> The portion of US109's alignment south of Waterford became US9E instead. US4 was assigned as planned in 1926, overlapping NY30 between Glens Falls and Whitehall. The NY6 designation was completely removed at this time. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, US9 was realigned to follow its modern routing between Albany and Round Lake. The portion of US9's former routing between Waterford and Mechanicville {{as well as all}} of US9E north of US20 became a southward extension of US4, which left its original alignment in Hudson Falls and followed a previously unnumbered riverside highway south to Northumberland. In between Northumberland and Mechanicville, it utilized the former routing of NY30, which was reassigned to another highway as part of the renumbering.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, {{the third}} species, P. cyrtocristatus was named by John Ostrom. Its three known specimens, {{have been found}} in the Fruitland and Kaiparowits {{formations}} from Utah and New Mexico. The second specimen, the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation, was originally <b>unassigned</b> to a specific taxon. Of the Parasaurolophus species, P. cyrtocristatus it is the smallest, and has the most curved crest. Because of its possession of the two above features, it has often been speculated that it was a female of P. walkeri or P. tubicen, which were males, although P. tubicen lived approximately a million years later. As noted by Thomas Williamson, the type material of P. cyrtocristatus is about 72% the size of P. tubicen, close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests (~70% of adult size). Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of P. cyrtocristatus being a female, many other studies have found that it is not, because of the differences in age, distribution, and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure.|$|E
5|$|In the {{lame-duck session}} of 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act, which allowed the {{president}} to terminate tribal governments, and broke up Indian reservations into homesteads for individual natives. Although the Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Act, {{the spirit of the}} law encouraged Weaver and the Boomers to continue their own efforts to open western Indian Territory to white settlement. Weaver reintroduced his Oklahoma bill in the new Congress the following year, but again it stalled in committee. He returned to Iowa for another re-election campaign in September 1888, but the Greenback party had fallen apart, replaced by a new left-wing third party, the Union Labor Party. In Iowa's 6th district, the new party agreed to fuse with Democrats to nominate Weaver, but this time the Republicans were stronger. Their candidate, JohnF. Lacey, was elected with an 828-vote margin. The Union Laborites and their presidential candidate, Alson Streeter, fared poorly nationally as well, and the new party soon dissolved. Weaver returned to Congress for the lame-duck session and once more pushed to organize the Oklahoma Territory. This time he prevailed, as the House voted 147–102 to open the <b>Unassigned</b> Lands to homesteaders. The Senate followed suit and President Cleveland, who was about to leave office, signed the bill into law.|$|E
5|$|Weaver {{also took}} {{up the issue of}} white {{settlement}} in Indian Territory. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the <b>Unassigned</b> Lands in what is now Oklahoma. After the Civil War, the Five Civilized Tribes had been forced to cede their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as Boomers, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the Homestead Acts. The federal government disagreed, as did the Cherokee Nation, which leased its neighboring Cherokee Outlet to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring Neutral Strip into a new Oklahoma Territory. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land to be open to white settlement.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing Patterson's and Thewissen's {{contributions}} in 1994, Ross MacPhee found little {{support for the}} classification of Plesiorycteropus as a tubulidentate in their data. MacPhee used a cladistic analysis of eutherians to ascertain the relationships of the genus, but found that while different analytic variants supported different affinities—with aardvarks, hyraxes, ungulates (hooved mammals), and even lipotyphlans (shrews, moles, hedgehogs, and allies)—there was no compelling evidence linking it to any other eutherian group. Therefore, he erected a separate order for Plesiorycteropus, named Bibymalagasia, arguing {{that it would be}} unacceptable to leave a Recent eutherian <b>unassigned</b> to any order and that discovery of more material, or further analysis, was unlikely to demonstrate close affinities of Plesiorycteropus with any other order. He considered it possible but unlikely that a few fossil taxa, such as Palaeorycteropus and Leptomanis from the Paleogene of France, would eventually be found to be bibymalagasians. Various analyses published by Robert Asher and colleagues in 2003, 2005, and 2007, based on morphology combined with DNA sequence data in some analyses, produced different estimates of the relationships of Plesiorycteropus, some placing it within Afrotheria close to aardvarks or Afrosoricida, but others supporting a relationship with the hedgehog Erinaceus. A 2004 morphological study by Inés Horovitz, focusing on extinct South American ungulates (such as Notoungulata and Litopterna), placed Plesiorycteropus among tubulidentates and closer to the extinct aardvark relative Myorycteropus than to Orycteropus. A 2013 study by Michael Buckley examined preserved collagen sequences in Plesiorycteropus bones. Buckley found that the animal was closely related to the tenrecs, a group of insectivorous mammals native to Madagascar, and suggested that it should be placed in the order Tenrecoidea with the tenrecs and golden moles.|$|E

25|$|It was too late. Almost {{immediately}} speculators and landless citizens began {{organizing and}} agitating {{for the opening}} of the land to settlement. The newspapers generally referred to these pro-settlement forces as Boomers and followed Boudinot's lead in referring to the area as the <b>Unassigned</b> Lands or Oklahoma.|$|E

25|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} accept the decision and the raids continued. Finally General Pleasant Porter, the Creek Council's delegate to Washington, offered to relinquish all Creek claims to that part of the ceded territory which remained <b>unassigned.</b> On January 31, 1889, the United States and the Creeks agreed to quit any claims to title of the land. The Creeks received approximately $2,250,000.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Unassigned</b> Lands in Oklahoma were in {{the center}} of the lands ceded to the United States by the Creek (Muskogee) and Seminole Indians {{following}} the Civil War and on which no other tribes had been settled. By 1883 it was bounded by the Cherokee Outlet on the north, several relocated Indian reservations on the east, the Chickasaw lands on the south, and the Cheyenne-Arapaho reserve on the west. The area amounted to 1,887,796.47 acres (2,949 miles² or 7,640km²).|$|E
25|$|The {{area was}} defended by two battalions of the 78th Infantry Regiment, {{supported}} by the 26th Artillery Regiment and the 27th Independent Engineer Regiment. The II/78th and two companies of the III/78th were deployed forward around Kankiryo and Shaggy Ridge, with the I/78th spread out around Saipa and Yokopi and the remaining two companies of the III/78th at Yaula. In addition, the 239th Infantry Regiment held the rear around Madang, Erima and Bogadjim, along with 2,000 <b>unassigned</b> reinforcements. Overall, this was a force of about 12,000 men.|$|E

25|$|In {{some sources}} Austro-Hungarian U-boats are {{referenced}} with Roman numerals {{as a way}} to distinguish them from German U-boats with similar numbers, but the Austro-Hungarian Navy itself used Arabic numerals. There are gaps in the numbering for several reasons. One series of Austro-Hungarian U-boats under construction in Germany was sold and commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. In other cases, U-boats commissioned into the Imperial German Navy were temporarily assigned Austro-Hungarian numbers when they operated in the Mediterranean. One final reason, {{in the case of the}} <b>unassigned</b> U-13, was superstition.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} {{allocation}} of powers to the United States Congress under the United States Constitution, the Constitution of Australia grants a number of specified powers to the Parliament of Australia, while leaving <b>unassigned</b> powers to the state parliaments. Most of the powers granted to the federal parliament can also be exercised by the state parliaments, though because of section 109 of the Australian Constitution federal laws will prevail in case of inconsistency. This arrangement resulted in a constitutional dispute {{as to whether the}} federal government could be subject to state laws, and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|He {{remained}} in the Regular Army after {{the close of the}} Civil War and was promoted to captain on March 14, 1866. From May 1866 to May 1867 he was commanding a company as chief quartermaster for the Quartermaster Department of the District of Minnesota at Fort Snelling, Minnesota. He was then on leave of absence from May to October, 1867; commanding a company at Fort Snelling, Minnesota to April, 1869; <b>unassigned</b> May, 1869; and then on duty at Galveston, Indianola, Corpus Christi, and Jefferson, Texas, until December 1869.|$|E
25|$|The {{rhinoceros}} iguana is {{well established}} in captivity, both {{in public and private}} collections. As of 2007, rhinoceros iguanas in captivity throughout the United States total 39 males, 32 females, and 36 undetermined individuals at 20 zoological institutions, with an additional 533 animals of <b>unassigned</b> subspecies, reported by seven American Zoological and Aquarium Association institutions. The actual number may be much higher considering animals kept at European and Asian zoos and the many kept as pets in private collections. As a result, the demand for wild-caught animals to supply zoos and the pet trade has been reduced.|$|E
25|$|The Boomers planned excursions, {{which they}} called raids, {{into the area}} and {{surveyed}} townsites, built homes, and planted crops. The United States sent troops to round them up and expel them. The raids continued for several years. The Boomers {{tried to get a}} legal opinion as to the status of the public lands, but the government, instead of charging them for illegal settlement of Indian land, charged them only under the Intercourse Act. Finally, in United States vs. Payne in 1884, the United States District Court at Topeka, Kansas ruled that settling on the <b>Unassigned</b> Lands was not a criminal offense.|$|E
25|$|Luke meets many {{historical}} Western {{figures such}} as Calamity Jane, Billy the Kid, Judge Roy Bean and Jesse James's gang, and takes part in {{events such as the}} guarding of Wells Fargo stagecoaches, the Pony Express, the building of the First Transcontinental Telegraph, the Rush into the <b>Unassigned</b> Lands of Oklahoma, and a tour by French actress Sarah Bernhardt. Some of the books feature a one-page article on the background to the events featured.

25|$|Magistrates in the Qing, however, {{also became}} more {{professional}} in several respects. They studied administration as a craft rather than something which a cultivated Confucian scholar-bureaucrat {{was expected to}} perform {{on the basis of}} moral training and knowledge of the Confucian classics. Since the emperor, in order to reward loyalty, increased the quota of those who were allowed to pass the exams without increasing the number of positions, there came to be more degree holders than there were entry level appointments. Many of these <b>unassigned</b> men took positions as secretaries or clerks to county magistrates, forming a virtual sub-profession of experts on various aspects of the law, water-works, taxation, or administration. Others, especially those who held only lower degrees, became tutors or local school teachers with little prestige or adequate income.|$|E
