Margolies {{sent a letter to the}} Fall Creek Baptist Church in Indianapolis, ordering the church to cancel its party and remove the trademarked Super Bowl name from its website. She said that the church could not use the words [...] "Super Bowl" [...] as it violates trademark law, could not charge admission as that violates copyright law, could not use its projection screen (only one television could be used and it could not be over 55inches), and could not [...] "promote a message" [...] in connection with the game. Regarding the last point, the Fall Creek Baptist church planned to also show an extra video to highlight the Christian testimonies of Colts coach Tony Dungy and Chicago Bears coach Lovie Smith. [...] "While this may be a noble message", Rachel L. Margolies wrote, [...] "we are consistent in refusing the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> game broadcasts in connection with events that promote a message, no matter the content." [...] Sports bars nationwide were allowed to show the game, as were businesses that televised sports as part of their everyday operations because they didn't charge admission and they left the message the NFL intended intact.|$|E

[...] Although Brown did {{not rule out the}} assured destruction approach, which stressed attacks on urban and industrial targets, he believed that [...] "such destruction must not be automatic, our only choice, or independent of any enemy's attack.

[...] Furthermore, China currently has an effective monopoly on the world's REE Value Chain. (all the refineries and processing plants that transform the raw ore into valuable elements).

Depth, after symmetrization, indeed provides the center-outward ordering that is necessary and sufficient to define nearest neigh-bors. The resulting classifiers are affine-invariant and inherit the nonparamet-ric validity from nearest-neighbor classifiers. In particular, we prove that the proposed depth-based classifiers are consistent under very mild conditions. We investigate their finite-sample performances through simulations and show that they outperform affine-invariant nearest-neighbor classifiers obtained through an obvious standardization construction. We illustrate the practical value <b>of</b> <b>our</b> classifiers on two real data examples. Finally, we shortly discuss the possible <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> depth-based neighbors in other inference problems...|$|R
