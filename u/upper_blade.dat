2500|$|The main {{contributor}} to onychocryptosis is footwear, particularly ill-fitting shoes with inadequate toe-box room and tight stockings that apply {{pressure to the}} top or side of the foot. Other factors may include the damp atmosphere of enclosed shoes, which soften the nail-plate and cause swelling on the epidermal keratin (eventually increasing the convex arch permanently), genetics, trauma and disease. Improper cutting of the nail may cause the nail to cut into the side-fold skin from growth and impact, {{whether or not the}} nail is truly [...] "ingrown". The nail bends inwards or upwards depending on the angle of its cut. If the cutting tool, such as scissors, is at an attitude in which the lower blade is closer to the toe than the <b>upper</b> <b>blade,</b> the toenail will tend to grow upwards from its base, and vice versa. The process is visible along the nail as it grows, appearing as a warp advancing {{to the end of the}} nail. The upper corners turn more easily than the center of the nail tip. Holding the tool at the same angle for all nails may induce these conditions; as the nail turns closer to the skin, it becomes harder to fit the lower blade in the right attitude under the nail. When cutting a nail, it is not just the correct angle that is important, but also how short it is cut. A shorter cut will bend the nail more, unless the cut is even on both top and bottom of the nail.|$|E

40|$|Title: Electromyographic Analysis of the Different Handlebars Grips Effect on the Shoulder Blade Fixators Aims: The main {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to carry out a}} methodological study on the impact of different handlebars grips on the shoulder blades fixators. Result of the grip change is not only reduction of the upper fixators activity and the increase in the lower fixators activity but also co-contraction index increase and muscle fatigue reduction. Based on the hypothesis we assumed that the highest activity rate of the lower blades fixators and the lowest activity rate of the <b>upper</b> <b>blades</b> fixators will be during the handlebars brakes grip. The highest co- contraction index will occur during the handlebar brakes grip and the maximum muscular fatigue will occur during the grip {{at the top of the}} handlebars. The first part of the thesis is focused on the literature search and facts retrieval pertaining to the studied issue. In the second special part of the thesis we conducted a research during which the muscle activity of the <b>upper</b> and lower <b>blade</b> fixators was recorded.

5000|$|Some {{scissors}} are {{marketed as}} ambidextrous.

However, most [...] "ambidextrous" [...] scissors are in fact still right-handed in that the <b>upper</b> <b>blade</b> is on the right, and hence is on the outside when held in the right hand. Even if they cut successfully, the blade orientation will block the view of the cutting line for a left-handed person. True ambidextrous scissors are possible if the blades are double-edged and one handle is swung all the way around (to almost 360 degrees) so that the back of the blades become the new cutting edges.

Numerous studies have established that fluid injections to the hippocampus can induce lesions in the dentate gyrus (DG) that lead to cell death within the <b>upper</b> <b>blade.</b> Using a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy, we previously observed that embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors (ESNPs) survive and differentiate within the granule cell layer after stereotaxic delivery to the DG, replacing the endogenous cells of the <b>upper</b> <b>blade.</b> To investigate the mechanisms for ESNP migration and repair in the DG, we examined {{the role of the}} chemokine CXCL 12 in mice subjected to kainic acidinduced seizures.

40|$|Wind-tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to investigate orthogonalvortex interaction with a stationary blademimicking the main-rotor/tail-rotor interaction. High-quality experimental results with high-temporal resolution for the interaction have been obtained at different wind speeds and blade incidence angles. A vortex generator was specially designed for the experiment and produced stable trailing vortices. These were identified by hot-wire anemometry, with different vortical parameters for different speeds. When the measurement location is aligned with the vortex axis, pressure data reveal a suction peak on the <b>upper</b> <b>blade</b> surface and a pressure peak on the lower surface during the interaction. Significant dependence of the pressure on spanwise distance from the vortex indicates a strong three-dimensional interaction effect. For example, for spanwise positions above the core axis, a pressure pulse on the upper surface and a suction peak on the lower surface have been observed. It is shown that these differences {{can be attributed to}} the in fluence of the axial and tangential velocity components of the vortex. Pressure data for the blade at high incidence also show that the interaction can exacerbate and alleviate flow separation, depending on the spanwise position. Tongguang Wang, C,J. Doolan, F. N.

40|$|Layer 5 {{pyramidal}} neurons comprise {{an important}} but heterogeneous group of cortical projection neurons. In motor-frontal cortex, these neurons are centrally {{involved in the}} cortical control of movement. Recent studies indicate that local excitatory networks in mouse motor-frontal cortex are dominated by descending pathways from layer 2 / 3 to 5. However, those pathways were identified in experiments involving unlabeled neurons in wild type mice. Here, to explore the possibility of class-specific connectivity in this descending pathway, we mapped the local sources of excitatory synaptic input to a genetically labeled population of cortical neurons: YFP-positive layer 5 neurons of YFP-H mice. We found, first, that in motor cortex, YFP-positive neurons were distributed in a double blade, {{consistent with the idea}} of layer 5 B having greater thickness in frontal neocortex. Second, whereas unlabeled neurons in upper layer 5 received their strongest inputs from layer 2, YFP-positive neurons in the <b>upper</b> <b>blade</b> received prominent layer 3 inputs. Third, YFP-positive neurons exhibited distinct electrophysiological properties, including low spike frequency adaptation, as reported previously.

40|$|Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESCs) are an {{exciting}} candidate for treating many degenerative diseases, because they retain {{the ability to}} become any desired cell type. We do not know enough to safely use embryonic stem cell therapies in human neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy, however. In our research, we transplant mouse or human embryonic stem cell-derived neural progenitors (mESNPs or hESNPs) into the hippocampus of control mice and those subjected to prior seizure experience. By characterizing these transplants, we can better understand {{the interaction between the}} ESNPs and the host brain. We are currently using immunohistochemistry to characterize the differentiation of transplanted m and hESNPs. Our results show that after 28 days, transplanted mESNPs predominantly become the neural cell types found in the <b>upper</b> <b>blade</b> of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. We also show that interneuron progenitors can be generated from hESNPs and transplanted into the mouse hippocampus where they become mature interneuron subtypes after 3 weeks. Since interneurons are responsible for inhibiting over-excitation and are susceptible to cell death in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), this finding is particularly significant for developing cell replacement therapies for seizure reduction. Results from both projects will help us better understand the interactions between transplanted ESNPs and the host brain and bring us closer to being able to use ESCs in neurodegenerative disease therapies. ...|$|E
40|$|In limbic seizures, {{neuronal}} excitation is conveyed {{from the}} entorhinal cortex directly to CA 1 and subicular regions. This phenomenon {{is associated with}} a reduced ability of CA 3 to respond to entorhinal cortex inputs. Here, we describe a lesion that destroys the perforant path in CA 3 after status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine injection in 8 -week-old rats. Using magnetic resonance imaging, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural analyses, we determined that this lesion develops after 30 minutes of SE and is characterized by microhemorrhages and ischemia. After a longer period of SE, the lesion invariably involves the <b>upper</b> <b>blade</b> of the dentate gyrus. Adult rats treated with subcutaneous diazepam (20 mg kg(- 1) for 3 days) did not develop the dentate gyrus lesion and had less frequent spontaneous recurrent seizures (p < 0. 01). Young (3 -week-old) rats rarely (20 %) developed the CA 3 lesion, and their spontaneous seizures were delayed (p < 0. 01). To investigate the role of the damaged CA 3 in seizure activity, we reinduced SE in adult and young epileptic rats. Using FosB/Delta FosB markers, we found induction of FosB/Delta FosB immunopositivity in CA 3 neurons of young but not in adult rats. These experiments indicate that SE can produce a focal lesion in the perforant path that may affect the roles of the hippocampus in epileptic rats...|$|E
