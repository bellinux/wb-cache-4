40|$|AbstractIntroductionQuestions remain {{regarding}} {{differences in}} nodal evaluation and <b>upstaging</b> between thoracotomy (open) and video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) approaches to lobectomy for early-stage lung cancer. Potential differences in nodal staging based on operative approach remain the final significant barrier to widespread adoption of VATS lobectomy. The current study examines differences in nodal staging between open and VATS lobectomy. MethodsThe National Cancer Data Base was queried {{for patients with}} clinical stage T 2 N 0 M 0 or lower lung cancer who underwent lobectomy in 2010 – 2011. Propensity score matching was performed to compare the rate of nodal <b>upstaging</b> in VATS with that in open approaches. Additional subgroup analysis was performed to assess whether rates of <b>upstaging</b> differed by specific clinical setting. ResultsA total of 16, 983 lobectomies were analyzed; 4935 (29. 1 %) were performed using VATS. Nodal <b>upstaging</b> was more frequent in the open group (12. 8 % versus 10. 3 %; p <  0. 001). In 4437 matched pairs, nodal <b>upstaging</b> remained more common for open approaches. For a subgroup of patients who had seven lymph or more nodes examined, propensity matching revealed that nodal <b>upstaging</b> remained more common after an open approach than after VATS (14. 0 % versus 12. 1 %; p = 0. 03). For patients who were treated in an academic/research facility, however, the difference in nodal <b>upstaging</b> between an open and VATS approach was no longer significant (12. 2 % versus 10. 5 %, p = 0. 08). ConclusionsFor early-stage lung cancer, nodal <b>upstaging</b> was observed more frequently with thoracotomy than with VATS. However, nodal <b>upstaging</b> appears {{to be affected by}} facility type, which may be a surrogate for expertise in minimally invasive surgical procedures...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the prognosis of}} pT 3 a <b>upstaging</b> from cT 1 renal cell carcinoma, and to compare the outcomes of partial or radical nephrectomy in cases of pT 3 a <b>upstaging.</b> We reviewed the records of patients who underwent partial or radical nephrectomy for cT 1 at our center between January 2001 and October 2013. We compared the 2 -year recurrence-free survivals for cases with pT 1 or pT 3 a <b>upstaging,</b> and for partial or radical nephrectomy in cases with pT 3 a <b>upstaging.</b> Clinicopathological parameters were analyzed in univariate and multivariate analyses to {{evaluate the}}ir associations with <b>upstaging.</b> Among the 1, 009 eligible patients, 987 patients {{were included in the}} analysis. The mean follow-up was 48. 5 ± 27. 8 months in whole patients. The 2 -year recurrence-free survival was worse in the pT 3 a <b>upstaging</b> group, compared to the pT 1 group (87. 3 % vs. 98. 7 %; p < 0. 001). Partial nephrectomy and radical nephrectomy had no significant difference in 2 -year recurrence-free survivals (91. 9 % vs. 83. 7 %; p = 0. 251). The multivariate analysis revealed that <b>upstaging</b> was associated with old age, cT 1 b stage, clinical symptoms, and a high Fuhrman grade. Pathological T 3 a <b>upstaging</b> of cT 1 renal cell carcinoma was associated with a poorer prognosis, compared to pT 1 disease. However, the surgical technique (radical or partial nephrectomy) did not affect the recurrence rate. Therefore, clinicians should select the treatment method based on the clinical stage, and consider the pathological stage during the follow-up...|$|R

Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked {{in the middle of}} the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to <b>upstage</b> Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.|$|E
5|$|During Prohibition, Pflueger {{designed}} {{bars for}} private clubs {{such as the}} Stock Exchange Luncheon Club where members kept their personal bottles in small lockers behind the bar, and two bars for The Family, one at the Family Farm in Woodside and one at the clubhouse in San Francisco. Pflueger created a cocktail bar and nightclub for Frank Martinelli and Tom Gerun in 1931, the Bal Tabarin, featuring a stage for live music and colorful indirect lighting from above metal fins in the ceiling and behind curved metal strips <b>upstage.</b> When Prohibition ended in December 1933, Bal Tabarin received an immediate renovation by Pflueger along with a liquor license from the state. Pflueger was then asked to design cocktail lounges for several hotels, completing the Cirque for the Fairmont Hotel in 1935, adorned with finely painted murals by Esther Bruton, and in 1939, both the Patent Leather Bar for the St. Francis Hotel and the Top of the Mark for the Mark Hopkins Hotel. The Patent Leather Bar used a metal-finned ceiling much like that which Pflueger had installed above the audience at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. A padded, serpentine bar snaked through the room's mirror, chrome and black leather decor. Ansel Adams was retained by C. Templeton Crocker {{to show off the}} new cocktail lounge in photographs.|$|E
30|$|The rate of <b>upstaging</b> (having {{a higher}} stage after {{secondary}} staging procedure then presumed {{after the initial}} operation) {{found in this study}} is 32 %, percentages found in other studies range between 0 % (only nine patients described) [20] and 41.7 % [12]. The high percentage of 41.7 % found by Jung et al. is not entirely comparable to percentages found in other studies because they included a relatively high percentage of primary staging procedures. Our <b>upstaging</b> percentage is similar to <b>upstaging</b> rates in laparotomic staging ranging from 21.2 % [17] to 47 % [21].|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Surgical {{specimens}} {{obtained at}} the time of the last transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for patients with nonmuscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) who underwent radical cystectomy were retrospectively evaluated in order to investigate the relationship between pathological variation and <b>upstaging</b> of NMIBC. Methods and Materials: Twenty patients (19 men, 1 woman; aged 69. 4 ± 12. 1 (mean ± SD) years) diagnosed with NMIBC underwent radical cystectomy during follow-up. Results: Five of the 20 patients (25 %) had pathological <b>upstaging</b> in the radical cystectomy specimens. There was a statistical association between pathological <b>upstaging</b> and cancer death (p = 0. 002). There were three patterns of pathological variation in the <b>upstaged</b> specimens: 1) in patients with BCG-resistant NMIBC, urothelial carcinoma invaded through the lamina propria; 2) urothelial carcinoma showed diffuse invasion beyond the deep lamina propria, and the cancer cells had infiltrated as single cells and formed nodules; 3) TURBT specimens showed a micropapillary variant. Conclusions: Since these pathological variations correlated with pathological <b>upstaging,</b> they may provide an indication for cystectomy in NMIBC patients...|$|R

40|$|Often, {{pathological}} Gleason Score (GS) {{and stage}} {{of prostate cancer}} (PCa) were inconsistent with biopsy GS and clinical stage. However, there were no widely accepted methods predicting upgrading and <b>upstaging</b> PCa. In our study, we investigated the association between serum testosterone and upgrading or <b>upstaging</b> of PCa after radical prostatectomy (RP). We enrolled 167 patients with PCa with biopsy GS ≤ 6, clinical stage ≤T 2 c, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 10 ng ml− 1 from April 2009 to April 2015. Data including age, body mass index, preoperative PSA level, comorbidity, clinical presentation, and preoperative serum total testosterone level were collected. Upgrading occurred in 62 (37. 1 %) patients, and <b>upstaging</b> occurred in 73 (43. 7 %) patients. Preoperative testosterone was lower in the upgrading than nonupgrading group (3. 72 vs 4. 56, P< 0. 01). Patients in the <b>upstaging</b> group had lower preoperative testosterone {{than those in the}} nonupstaging group (3. 84 vs 4. 57, P= 0. 01). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, as both continuous and categorical variables, low serum testosterone was confirmed to be an independent predictor of pathological upgrading (P = 0. 01 and P= 0. 01) and <b>upstaging</b> (P = 0. 01 and P = 0. 02) after RP. We suggest that low serum testosterone (< 3 ng ml− 1) is associated with a high rate of upgrading and <b>upstaging</b> after RP. It is better for surgeons to ensure close monitoring of PSA levels and imaging examination when selecting non-RP treatment, to be cautious in proceeding with nerve-sparing surgery, and to be enthusiastic in performing extended lymph node dissection when selecting RP treatment for patients with low serum testosterone...|$|R
40|$|Background and purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} delays for radiotherapy on survival, recurrence and <b>upstaging</b> for head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with no nodal involvement treated with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Material and methods: This retrospective study included 63 consecutive patients with HNSCC located in the pharynx and larynx and treated with exclusive IMRT with or without chemotherapy. Survival, loco-regional or distant failure and <b>upstaging</b> were analyzed according to the waiting time. Results: Mean waiting time for treatment was 62. 5  days for the hypopharynx subgroup (range =  37 – 102), 63  days for the larynx subgroup (range =  19 – 128) and 58. 5  days for the oropharynx subgroup (range =  29 – 99) (p =  0. 725). Nine patients (14 %) experienced <b>upstaging.</b> Loco-regional or distant failure occurred in 18 patients. Beyond a delay of 50  days, 19 % of patients had local failure, 17 % nodal recurrence and 11 % distant failure. Within a delay of 50  days, no nodal or distant failure was observed and only 1 patient experienced local recurrence. <b>Upstaging</b> and overall survival were not significantly affected by an increased waiting time.
