30|$|Introduction: The {{etiology}} of <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> is unknown. Petros in {{the so called}} Integral Theory postulated that incompetent pelvic ligaments {{may play a role}} for he development of urge and <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> In 2012 Jäger reportet a 77 % cure rate for <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> after replacement of the uterosacral ligaments by an alloplastic tape. We want to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in 2 similar cases of pure <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Overactive bladder is {{characterized}} by a group of four symptoms: urgency, urinary frequency, nocturia, and <b>urge</b> <b>incontinence.</b> <b>Urge</b> <b>incontinence</b> is not present in the [...] "dry" [...] classification.|$|E
50|$|<b>Urge</b> <b>{{incontinence}}</b> {{is a form}} of {{urinary incontinence}} characterized by the involuntary loss of urine occurring for no apparent reason while feeling urinary urgency as discussed above. Like frequency, the person can track incontinence in a diary to assist with diagnosis and management of symptoms. <b>Urge</b> <b>incontinence</b> can also be measured with pad tests, and these are often used for research purposes. Some people with <b>urge</b> <b>incontinence</b> also have stress incontinence and this can complicate clinical studies.|$|E
50|$|Regulatory {{clearances}} {{were based}} on these data. A PTNS device received FDA-clearance for urinary urgency, urinary frequency and <b>urge</b> <b>incontinence</b> in 2000; in 2010, the clearance was updated to include Overactive Bladder (OAB).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} quality of life (QoL) and voiding variables in patients with lower urinary tract dysfunction treated with percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), as {{it is assumed that}} improvements in voiding will lead to a better QoL in such patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 30 patients with <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> who were treated with PTNS; 24 -h bladder diaries and QoL questionnaires (Short Form, SF- 36, and incontinence-specific QoL) were completed at baseline and after PTNS. RESULTS: There was a significant correlation (P or = two pads/day before their QoL improves, and this might be the best definition of successful therapy for patients with <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Urinary {{incontinence}} is {{a common}} problem among women and {{it is estimated that}} between 15 and 55 % of them complain of lower urinary symptoms. The most prevalent form of urinary incontinence is associated with stress, followed by mixed urinary <b>incontinence</b> and <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> It is a symptom with several effects on quality of life of women mainly in their social, familiar and sexual domains. Female reproductive and urinary systems share anatomical structures, which promotes that urinary problems interfere with sexual function in females. This article is a review of both the concepts of female urinary incontinence and its impact on global and sexual quality of life. Nowadays, it is assumed that urinary <b>incontinence,</b> especially <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence,</b> promotes anxiety and several self-esteem damages in women. The odour and the fear of incontinence during sexual intercourse affect female sexual function and this is related with the unpredictability and the chronicity of <b>incontinence,</b> namely <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> Female urinary incontinence management involves conservative (pelvic floor muscle training), surgical and pharmacological treatment. Both conservative and surgical treatments have been studied about its benefit in urinary incontinence and also the impact among female sexual function. Unfortunately, there are sparse articles that evaluate the benefits of female sexual function with drug management of incontinence...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of pelvic floor muscle training in pre- and postmenopausal women using a quality-of-life questionnaire. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 96 patients with urinary incontinence who participated in a pelvic floor muscle-training (PFMT) program at the Physiotherapy Department in a London University Hospital between January 2010 and August 2011. RESULTS: A period of supervised PFMT resulted in significant improvement in symptoms of stress urinary <b>incontinence,</b> <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence,</b> urgency, frequency, and nocturia, irrespective of menopausal status. CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and postmenopausal women experience similar outcomes in relation to urinary symptoms following a short-term supervised PFMT...|$|R
30|$|Discussion: Pelvic {{ligament}} defects have theoretically {{been viewed}} as a possible cause of urge and <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> Although the anatomic defect was not pronounced in both cases uterosacral ligament reconstruction by an alloplastic tape was successful. We think that this method could be an effective treatment for otherwise incurable urge.|$|R
30|$|Material and Methods 2 Patients: age 65 (66) years, para 0 (1), {{hysterectomy}} 1990 (1987), {{history of}} urge and <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> since 14 (12) years. Anatomy: minimal enterocele (entero-rectocele) Urodynamic studies (both): overactive bladder, urethra closing pressure normal. Treatment: {{reconstruction of the}} uterosacral ligaments using an alloplastic tape by laparotomy.|$|R

40|$|Using {{prospective}} {{data from}} 983 British women born in 1946, the study aims {{to describe the}} profiles of symptoms of stress, <b>urge,</b> and severe <b>incontinence,</b> and to relate these to change in quality of life. Based on the longitudinal patterns of symptoms experienced, four groups of women were defined: ‘low symptom’, ‘onset’, ‘recovering’, and ‘chronic’. Childhood enuresis was associated with being in the ‘chronic’ group for <b>urge</b> and severe <b>incontinence.</b> Women in the ‘recovering’ group for stress incontinence experienced an improvement in the physical health domain (regression coefficient (95 % CI) : 0. 1 (0. 02, 0. 18)) compared with women without symptoms. This relationship existed beyond the effects of ageing, menopausal status, current life stress, and reproductive, lifestyle, and social factors.

5000|$|The {{most common}} types of urinary {{incontinence}} in women are stress urinary <b>incontinence</b> and <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence.</b> Women with both problems have mixed urinary incontinence. After menopause, estrogen production decreases {{and in some}} women urethral tissue will demonstrate atrophy with the tissue of the urethra becoming weaker and thinner. Stress urinary incontinence is caused by loss of support of the urethra which is usually a consequence of damage to pelvic support structures {{as a result of}} childbirth. It is characterized by leaking of small amounts of urine with activities which increase abdominal pressure such as coughing, sneezing and lifting. Additionally, frequent exercise in high-impact activities can cause athletic <b>incontinence</b> to develop. <b>Urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> is caused by uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle [...] It is characterized by leaking of large amounts of urine in association with insufficient warning to get to the bathroom in time.|$|R
50|$|FI can {{be divided}} into those people who {{experience}} a defecation urge before leakage (<b>urge</b> <b>incontinence),</b> and those who experience no sensation before leakage (passive incontinence or soiling). <b>Urge</b> <b>incontinence</b> is characterized by a sudden need to defecate, with little time to reach a toilet.

50|$|Urinary urgency is a sudden, {{compelling}} urge to urinate. It is often, {{though not}} necessarily, associated with urinary incontinence, polyuria, nocturia, and interstitial cystitis. It tends to increase with age. When uncontrollable, it causes <b>urge</b> <b>incontinence.</b>|$|E

40|$|Urinary {{incontinence}} affects {{approximately a}} quarter of a billion people worldwide. It is associated with high economic costs, psychological morbidity and adverse effects on the quality of life. Despite this, few women seek help for this condition either due to embarrassment and unwillingness to discuss the symptom with their family member or friend or, acceptance of the disorder as a natural part of aging or being unaware that treatment exists. More resources are utilised in maintaining patients with chronic incontinence rather than for diagnosis and treatment of the condition. Urinary incontinence is a complex problem resulting from many different causes and for which many different approaches to treatment exist. The commonest types of incontinence include stress urinary <b>incontinence,</b> <b>urge</b> urinary <b>incontinence</b> and mixed incontinence.
