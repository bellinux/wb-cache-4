Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J.

Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E
5|$|At the 22nd {{hurricane}} {{committee in}} 2000 {{it was decided}} that tropical cyclones that moved from the Atlantic to the Eastern Pacific basin and vice versa would no longer be renamed. Ahead of the 2000–01 season it was decided to start using male names, as well as female names for tropical cyclones developing in the South-West Indian Ocean. RSMC La Reunion subsequently proposed to the fifteenth session of the RA I Tropical Cyclone Committee for the South-West Indian Ocean during September 2001, that the basin adopt a single circular list of names. Along with the RA V Tropical Cyclone Committee, RSMC La Reunion also proposed to the session that a tropical cyclone have only one name during its lifetime. However, both of these proposals were rejected in favour of continuing an annual list of names and to rename systems when they moved across 90°E into the South-West Indian Ocean. During the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season the naming of subtropical cyclones restarted, with names assigned to systems from the main list of names drawn <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E

He struck ten fours, all off which were driven. In the second innings, {{he came to the}} crease with four wickets down with Australia still in arrears. He scored an unbeaten 35 to ensure that Australia would not {{collapse}} further and lose the match. The public reception towards the Victory Tests resulted in an additional fifth match being added to the schedule. To warm <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> match, Miller took 3/95 against the North of England.|$|E

25|$|The {{consuming}} east region, {{particularly the}} states in the northern part, heavily rely on stored gas to meet the peak demand during the cold winter months.

In addition to underground storage, LNG is increasingly playing a crucial role in providing supplemental backup and/or peaking supply to LDCs on a short term basis.

25|$|Before the 2017 season, Somerset {{announced}} {{that at the}} age of 22, Tom Abell would be appointed as club and Championship captain. Somerset made a disastrous start to the Championship, losing four of their first six games of the season. Despite a victory in the seventh game against Yorkshire at Scarborough, Somerset's prospects of survival looked very poor indeed at the halfway mark of the season. A strong draw against Surrey was followed by victories against Warwickshire and Lancashire, and although Somerset lost their penultimate game against Surrey, their fate was still in their own hands. Somerset needed to beat Middlesex in the final match of the year at Taunton with one more bonus point than their opponents to assure safety. Thanks to a 9 wicket match haul from Jack Leach on a turning pitch, and a century from James Hildreth in the second innings, Somerset comfortably beat Middlesex by 231 runs to condemn last year's champions to relegation, and ensure their 10 year run in Division One would continue for another season. Leach finished with 51 wickets, while Craig Overton's 46 wickets were enough to see him called <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> winter's Ashes tour. As a mark of how the batting unit struggled, overseas player Dean Elgar was the only batsman to average over 36 with the bat, and Elgar was absent from {{the second half of the}} season. New signing Steven Davies was the leading run scorer with 775. Somerset again enjoyed good success in the One-Day Cup, winning five of seven completed matches and qualifying second in the South Group for a home quarter-final against Nottinghamshire. Somerset lost an incredible game in which 834 runs were scored, falling short of Nottinghamshire's 429/9 by 24 runs. Elgar also enjoyed great success in this competition, scoring 519 runs in the 6 games he played. Somerset were again involved in a thriller in the final round of games of the t20 Blast, where a 98-run victory against Hampshire saw them through to the quarter-finals by 0.07 on Net run rate for the first time since 2013. Somerset faced a difficult trip to Trent Bridge, and lost to Nottinghamshire by 5 wickets. At the end of the year it was {{announced that}} both one-day captain Jim Allenby and Director of Cricket Matthew Maynard would not be returning for 2018.|$|E

Mike Stagno of Sputnikmusic reviewed the album positively.

Sonali Kokra of The National praised the film: [...] "Neerja is a great story told well.

500|$|The book {{received}} mixed reviews. Caroline Foulkes {{wrote in}} The Birmingham Post: [...] "The {{thing about this}} biography is the depths to which Taraborrelli has dug to get information on a famously controlling woman. He relates revealing anecdotes {{as if they were}} mere bagatelle, making News of the World style revelations look like kid's stuff. If Taraborrelli were to include in his list of acknowledgments 'thanks to the maid who let me into Madonna's bedroom to raid her underwear drawer', it wouldn't be any great surprise." [...] She also felt that [...] "despite the sensationalism, Taraborrelli's writing style lets him down. Too often it descends into the kind of mush you expect from an airport novel, with the singer coming across more like a character from Shirley Conran's Lace than a real woman." [...] Peter Sobczynski reviewed the book for the Post-Tribune and felt that [...] "the problem with writing an unauthorized tell-all biography is that, in this information-rich world that we live in, by the time a book gets written on somebody, most of the juicy stories are already common knowledge. To make <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> the tell-all author needs to fill his or her pages with either a thoughtful analysis of the subject at hand, or, frankly, newer and better dirt. Unfortunately, celebrity biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli does neither with his latest concoction, Madonna: An Intimate Biography." ...|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8.5 out of 10, {{indicating}} a [...] "great" [...] episode, highlighting the reunion {{of the six}} original team members and their evolved dynamic, despite {{what he called a}} [...] "contrived" [...] set <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> situation. He felt that using the characters of List and Hill to tie the series into Age of Ultron was [...] "the right way" [...] to tie the two together, and was also positive of the character beats for Simmons and Palamas. Goldman also made special mention of Tancharoen's direction of the one-shot fight, though he felt that Tancharoen's May vs. Agent 33 fight from [...] "Face My Enemy" [...] was the superior sequence, and of the visual effects for the shooting down of the Bus. The A.V.

500|$|Several reviews {{praised the}} game's setting. GameSpy's David Chapman called it [...] "a truly {{remarkable}} experience.

[...] According to Game Informer, [...] "in terms of gameplay quality, this may be another middle-of-the-road shooter, but the unique premise sets it aside from everything else out there." [...] Greg Bemis of G4TV wrote that the biggest draw in Darkwatch is the [...] "different enough" [...] setting that [...] "does fall back on tired video game clichés {{from time to time}} like big-breasted, leather-clad babes who speak in aggressive sexually suggestive double entendres, but it’s nice to see something--anything--that’s a little off the beaten path." [...] GameShark's Will Jayson Hill wrote that [...] "about the sharpest criticism that can be leveled at Darkwatch is that it really adds nothing original in the gameplay department. Aside from its extremely well executed western/horror environment, Darkwatch is a pretty generic FPS game with a weaker multiplayer mode." [...] On the other hand, some reviews thought that the gameplay was actually the strongest part of the game. Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine stated Darkwatch [...] "has a few neat ideas but wins us over by doing solid shooting well. Fast-paced with cool guns, what's not to like?" [...] GameZone's Mike David wrote that only a [...] "weak plot pacing and that feeling that something is missing" [...] kept it from being given a score of 9/10.|$|E
500|$|Chris Stamp {{designed}} {{the cover of}} the UK version of Are You Experienced, which featured a picture of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding by Bruce Fleming. The image shows Hendrix wearing a long dark cape while standing over Mitchell and Redding, striking what Egan described as a [...] "Dracula-esque pose". Chandler contacted Fleming based on the photographer's previous work with the Hollies, the Dave Clark Five, and the Animals. The photo shoot took place in February after Fleming had attended several recording sessions and Experience gigs. Chandler made a point of requesting that the band member's faces be clearly visible in the photograph; Fleming explained: [...] " [...] got much more esoteric as time went on, but to establish the artist we had to get their faces across so the kids would recognize them." [...] He took monochrome and color shots of the band; Track selected an image from the latter group. Fleming had indicated which picture he preferred they use, marking the shot with a cross, but after the album's release he realized that they had selected another, less desirable image. According to Fleming, the shot that he chose was [...] "more sinister; more interesting". Stamp hired graphic artist Alan Aldridge to design the sleeve's psychedelic lettering. Track inexplicably put only the album's title on the cover, omitting the band's name; Polydor issued the release throughout Europe with Hendrix's name printed at the top in matching font. The cover art's combination of dull green and brown tones, juxtaposed with the jocular nature of the subject's pose, created a weak overall visual impression; Stamp commented: [...] "It's not a great cover at all. Hopefully, we made <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> in all the other covers." ...|$|E

He criticized the [...] "featherweight" [...] plot, but said that there is enough humor to support it, and that Reynolds was [...] "born to play" [...] Deadpool. Chris Nashawaty graded the film a 'B' for Entertainment Weekly, saying it [...] "doesn’t have the most adrenalized action sequences or the deepest origin story" [...] but makes <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> with R-rated fun. Nashawaty felt Reynolds was the perfect star for the film, and is [...] "a blast of laughing gas in a genre that tends to take itself way too seriously." [...] Tasha Robinson at The Verge felt {{there was too much}} juvenile humor, but was positive that the film did not make homophobic, racist, or sexist jokes, and that its overall tone remained joyous despite the material. She also praised the smaller scope of the film. David Edelstein of Vulture said the film's jokes save it from a lack of subtext and strong villains, and noted the gratifyingly twisty" [...] structure. Manohla Dargi at The New York Times did not give the film a pass for listing its genre cliches in the opening credits before using them, but instead highlighted the [...] "human" [...] elements in the film and the moments where Reynolds and Tim Miller did [...] "more than hit the same bombastic notes over and over again." [...] For IndieWire, Kate Erbland gave the film a 'B-', praising its style, and Reynolds' Deadpool for breaking the superhero mold, but criticizing the overall film for following genre conventions and focusing on [...] "numbing" [...] violence and un-original swearing and nudity.|$|E
