5|$|In intensively farmed {{areas where}} {{agricultural}} practices {{appear to have}} made cropped land unsuitable, gardens are an important breeding habitat. In one English study, only 3.5% of territories were found in farmland, whereas gardens held 71.5% of the territories, despite that habitat making <b>up</b> <b>only</b> 2% of the total area. The remaining nests were in woodlands (1% of total area).|$|E
5|$|Notable in {{this era}} was {{a game against the}} Detroit Lions on November 7, 1943 which ended in a {{scoreless}} tie, the last NFL game ever played to end this way. The defensive unit of the 1944 Giants team is ranked #1 of all time in NFL history, giving <b>up</b> <b>only</b> 7.5 points per game – a record that stands to this day.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the causes}} of insurer losses is the lower income, older and sicker enrollee population.

5|$|That season, Brodeur won 43 {{games for}} the second time in his career, and the Devils {{finished}} with the fourth spot in the Eastern Conference after losing the division to the Flyers by two points. Brodeur helped the Devils sweep the Florida Panthers in the first round, giving <b>up</b> <b>only</b> six goals in four games. In the next round against the Toronto Maple Leafs he recorded two shutouts, including one in the final game of the series as the Devils went on to win four games to two, setting up a showdown with rival Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Flyers took a 3–1 series lead and had home ice to close out the series, but Brodeur gave <b>up</b> <b>only</b> one goal in each of the remaining three games of the series, propelling the Devils to a comeback series victory in 7 games. They went on to play the Dallas Stars in the Stanley Cup Final, who had a higher seed but fewer regular season points, giving the Devils home ice advantage in the series. After taking game one with a 7-goal rally against Dallas, the Devils were led by Brodeur the rest of the way as he gave <b>up</b> <b>only</b> six goals in the next five games, giving the team their second Stanley Cup Championship in six years.|$|E

5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes <b>up</b> <b>only</b> about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: electromagnetic separation. This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E

Yorkshire and the Humber and the North West both had significant populations of Muslims – 6.2% and 5.1% respectively – while Muslims in the North East made <b>up</b> <b>only</b> 1.8% of the population.

5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes <b>up</b> <b>only</b> 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the electromagnetic separation plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Christians at {{the time}} of Constantine's {{conversion}} made <b>up</b> <b>only</b> 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% {{by the end of the}} fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} {{extensive}} clearing of the Wheatbelt in the 1930s, B.cuneata {{must have had}} a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes <b>up</b> <b>only</b> 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must have further fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.|$|E

In three games at Scranton, he struck out 36 batters while giving <b>up</b> <b>only</b> one walk and one run. His minor league statistics included a record of 14–4 with a 1.43 ERA and 273 strikeouts in 35 games pitched. For his performance, the Phillies promoted him to the major league club.|$|E
5|$|In January 1953, Plante {{was called}} up {{to play for the}} Canadiens. Bill Durnan, the goaltender who played for Montreal when Plante first began, had retired, and Gerry McNeil—their top goaltender—had {{fractured}} his jaw. Plante played for three games, but in that short time, he generated controversy. Coach Dick Irvin, Sr. did not wish his players to stand out by any addition to their regular uniforms. Plante always wore one of his tuques while playing hockey, and after an argument with Irvin, all of Plante's tuques had vanished from the Montreal locker room. Even without his good luck charm, Plante gave <b>up</b> <b>only</b> four goals in the three games he played, all of them wins.|$|E

Alexander finished with his second complete game of the series and gave <b>up</b> <b>only</b> two runs on eight hits, while striking out six batters. The three Yankee pitchers combined to give up thirteen hits, seven earned runs, three unearned runs, and one home run.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} game of the 1992 season, the Packers played the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Buccaneers were leading 17–0 at halftime when head coach Mike Holmgren benched {{starting}} quarterback Don Majkowski and Favre played the second half. On his first regular season play as a Packer, Favre threw a pass that was deflected by Buccaneers player Ray Seals and caught by Favre. Favre was tackled and the completion went for −7yards. The Packers lost the game 31–3, chalking <b>up</b> <b>only</b> 106yards passing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the ninth, Bottomley singled off Pennock {{but could}} not advance, giving the Yankees a 2–1 win in Game 1. Gehrig was their {{offensive}} star with both of his team's RBI.
