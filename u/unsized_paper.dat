25|$|Vegetable (paper) {{parchment}} is made {{by passing}} a waterleaf (an <b>unsized</b> <b>paper</b> like blotters) made of pulp fibers into sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid hydrolyses and solubilises the main natural organic polymer, cellulose, present in the pulp wood fibers. The paper web is then washed in water, which stops the hydrolysis of the cellulose and causes a kind of cellulose coating to form on the waterleaf. The final paper is dried. This coating is a natural non-porous cement, that gives to the vegetable parchment paper its resistance to grease and its semi-translucency.|$|E

Some grains of uncrushed gunpowder should be left adhering to the paper, and a few more should be allowed to lie loosely upon it. <b>Unsized</b> <b>paper,</b> like that out of a blotting-book, is the best suited for making into touch-paper; paper is rendered unsized by being well soaked and washed in water.

40|$|International audienceMany western manuscripts {{were written}} using iron gall inks. These inks {{can damage the}} paper via two major mechanisms: (a) acid hydrolysis, {{enhanced}} by humidity, and (b) oxidative depolymerization provoked {{by the presence of}} oxygen and free iron(II) ions. The degradation of <b>unsized</b> Whatman <b>paper</b> impregnated with different combinations of iron sulfate, gallic acid, and gum arabic was studied at room temperature in order to assess the relative importance of each mechanism. The samples were stored in various environments including a dry and/or an oxygen-free atmosphere. The cellulose depolymerization was monitored by viscometry and related to changes in the oxidation state of iron, determined by X-ray absorption near-edge spectrometry. The results indicate that residual amounts of oxygen (less than 0. 1 %) promote cellulose depolymerization, whereas the level of relative humidity has no impact. The cellulose depolymerization also appears closely correlated to oxidative mechanisms. Regarding the oxidation of iron, it only occurs in the simultaneous presence of oxygen and moisture, suggesting the occurrence of rustlike oxidative mechanisms. Finally, the presence of gallic acid has a strong influence, which is only partially explained by its capacity to reduce iron(III) to iron(II) ...|$|R
40|$|According to Food and Agriculture Organization {{newsprint}} {{is defined}} as: Uncoated <b>paper,</b> <b>unsized</b> (or only slightly sized), containing at least 60 percent of mechanical wood pulp. The consumption of newsprint in Sweden {{was just over}} 798 000 tonnes in 2009, which represents approximately 90 kg per person. Although there are studies that predict a drastic reduction in newsprint consumption in the Western world, {{there seems to be}} a clear difference between forecasts for the future given by statistical analysis of newsprint consumption and forecasts given by experts in the industry. The former predict a continuing increase while the experts see a coming decrease in consumption. In this report, both demand and business strategies of newsprint in Sweden are studied. The study also presents a forecast of the future which is based on historical data and qualitative interviews. According to the regression analysis done in this research the consumption will increase with an increase in GDP. However, the qualitative interviews are pointing to another direction. Experts in the newsprint industry believe the increase in consumption of newsprint in Sweden will slow down over time and it might even decrease in total. This will probably largely depend on the development of information and communications technology such as Internet, e-readers and mobile phones. Business strategies for meeting the structural difference, that may appear in the future, varies from different parts of the industry. Newspapers are trying to create as attractive a product as possible regardless of whether it is in printed or digital form. Printing firms are trying to find additional customers for continued profitability. Paper mills strive to do as good a product as possible to compete and they try to sell more in the more profitable segments. The one similarity between the various parts in the industry is that everyone is trying to streamline their production...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} phase of {{papermaking}} the characteristics such as its composition, color and weight is determined. Paper has as its chief component, a mat of cellulose fibers. Cellulose is the skeleton structure of plant cells and can be separated from the plant for use in paper. Cellulose has several characteristics that make it desirable for paper, the foremost being its strength when formed into a mat or web. When cellulose fibers come in contact with each other in water, a bond is formed. When water is removed from the adjoining fibers, the bond between the fibers strengthens. Pulp, the collection of individual fibers, may be bleached, especially if the paper is to be dyed a different color or the paper is expected to be white. Since most paper is either printed or written upon, fillers are added to the pulp to fill the pores of the paper and sizing is added to make the fibers water resistant, yet both act as fillers. <b>Unsized</b> <b>paper</b> is blotting paper, making it unsuitable for printing. Fillers and sizing are added to the pulp to absorb the ink quickly, unlike pure cellulose. Fillers can be glues made from animal products, starches from rice or wheat, resins or gums, or minerals such as calcium carbonate, titanium dioxide or kaolin. Mineral fillers are the most common as they are very effective as a filler. When all of these ingredients are assembled, they are suspended in water, which may include a color dye, as the furnish to the second phase of papermaking.|$|E
