For example, on the Nintendo 64 and the GameCube, it instructs the currently running software (game or console BIOS) to restart forcibly, usually fading out the volume and/or screen brightness for a cleaner effect. On the PlayStation 2, the button is by default programmed to restart the whole system, but, especially on games using the Network Adapter/HDD, it might clean up the connection, <b>unmount</b> hard drive partitions, and remove power from the hard drive before restarting the machine. In the latter case, {{many times it}} switches off the system instead of restarting it (the reset button is actually also the on/off button, but under normal circumstances, the button needs to be held for 2-4 seconds to turn the system off).|$|E

40|$|FreeBSD is a UNIX {{oriented}} {{operating system}} {{which is also}} the default desktop Operating System (OS) for many at the Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures (CAIA). While documentation for FreeBSD, its usage and configuration is plentiful and generally complete, it is often scattered and difficult to apply to generic desktop situations. This lack of straight forward HOW-TO documentation, either within the official documentation or associated web-sites located through the use of Google is often frustrating. The topic of this article, allowing general users (non-root) to mount and <b>unmount</b> removable filesystems (such as the Floppy Drive, CDROM or a USB Memory Stick) is one such issue. While all the information contained within this article is available online, it is often spread around numerous web-pages, and written {{in a way that makes}} it difficult to implement. In the same vein as our recent article on installing Microsoft Office 2000 on a FreeBSD system, I present this short report with a step-by-step procedure in allowing regular users to be able to mount removable filesystems. Note that the procedures within this report may lessen the security of your system by allowing greater capability for malice by a regular user, in an environment of a desktop PC typically used by a single (or trusted) persons, this risk is minimal. However, you should consider your security requirements carefully before opening up mounting of filesystems to non-root users. I would not recommend allowing this functionality on server or general public access computers. The task that we wish to allow is this: General non-root users to be allowed to mount and <b>unmount</b> removable filesystems, Integration with the KDE Desktop Environment to allow this to occur through graphical tools...|$|E

40|$|Every day, {{the amount}} of data that is {{acquired}} from plasma experiments grows dramatically. It has become difficult for systems administrators {{to keep up with}} the growing demand for hard drive storage space. In the past, project storage has been supplied using UNIX filesystem (ufs) partitions. In order to increase the size of the disks using this system, users were required to discontinue use of the disk, so the existing data could be transferred to a disk of larger capacity or begin use of a completely new and separate disk, thus creating a segmentation of data storage. With the application of ZFS pools, the data capacity woes are over. ZFS provides simple administration that eliminates the need to <b>unmount</b> to resize, or transfer data to a larger disk. With a storage limit of 16 Exabytes (1018), ZFS provides immense scalability. Utilizing ZFS as the new project disk file system, users and administrators can eliminate time wasted waiting for data to transfer from one hard drive to another, and also enables more efficient use of disk space, as system administrators need only allocate what is presently required. This paper will discuss the application and benefits of using ZFS as an alternative to traditional data access and storage in the fusion environment...|$|E
