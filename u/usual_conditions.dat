2500|$|The {{suppression}} of the Jesuits in France began in the French island colony of Martinique, where the Society of Jesus had a major commercial stake in sugar plantations worked by black slave and free labor. Their large mission plantations included large local populations that worked under the <b>usual</b> <b>conditions</b> of tropical colonial agriculture of the 18th century. The Catholic Encyclopedia in 1908 said that missionaries occupying themselves personally in selling off the goods produced (an anomaly for a religious order) [...] "was allowed partly {{to provide for the}} current expenses of the mission, partly {{in order to protect the}} simple, childlike natives from the common plague of dishonest intermediaries." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{spite of}} {{numerous}} past {{attempts to find}} the mutant that overacumulates protochlorophyllide under <b>usual</b> <b>conditions,</b> only one such gene (flu) is currently (2009) known. Flu (first described in [...] ) is a nuclear-encoded, chloroplast-located protein that appears containing only protein-protein interaction sites. It is currently not known which other proteins interact through this linker. The regulatory protein is a transmembrane protein that {{is located in the}} thylakoid membrane. Later, it was discovered that Tigrina mutants in barley, known a long time ago, are also mutated in the same gene. It is not obvious why no mutants of any other gene were observed; maybe mutations in other proteins, involved into the regulatory chain, are fatal. Flu is a single gene, {{not a member of the}} gene family.|$|E

2500|$|The final {{approach}} involves {{the construction of}} MOFs that incorporate chiral reaction sites {{from a number of}} different components, potentially including chiral and achiral organic ligands, structural metal ions, catalytically active metal ions, and/or preassembled catalytically active organometallic cores. [...] This field is relatively new, and few examples exist of chiral asymmetric hydrogenation using these frameworks. [...] One of these was reported in 2003, when a heterogeneous catalyst was reported that included structural zirconium, catalytically active ruthenium, and a BINAP-derived phosphonate as both chiral ligand and structural linker. [...] As little as 0.005mol% of this catalyst proved sufficient to achieve the asymmetric hydrogenation of aryl ketones, though the <b>usual</b> <b>conditions</b> featured 0.1mol % of catalyst and resulted in an enantiomeric excess of 90.6–99.2%.|$|E
2500|$|Pope Paul VI {{completely}} reformed {{the grants}} of indulgences, after the Second Vatican Council. His Apostolic Constitution [...] "Indulgentiarum Doctrina" [...] (1967), yet again confirmed the Portiuncula Indulgence. According to the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, Catholic faithful may gain a plenary indulgence on 2 August (the Portiuncula) or on such other day as {{designated by the}} local ordinary for {{the advantage of the}} faithful, under the <b>usual</b> <b>conditions</b> (sacramental Confession, Holy Communion, and prayer for the intentions of the Supreme Pontiff), by devoutly visiting the parish church, and there reciting at least the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. The Indulgence applies to the cathedral church of the diocese, and to the co-cathedral church (if there is one), even if they are not parochial, and also to quasi-parochial churches. To gain this, as any plenary indulgence, the faithful must be free from any attachment to sin, even venial sin. Where this entire detachment is wanting, the indulgence is partial.|$|E

It is evident from what we have found, {{that there is no}} colour which pre-eminently appears to be the colour of the table, or even of any one {{particular}} part of the table--it appears to be of different colours from different points of view, {{and there is no reason}} for regarding some of these as more really its colour than others. And we know that even from a given point of view the colour will seem different by artificial light, or to a colour-blind man, or to a man wearing blue spectacles, while in the dark there will be no colour at all, though to touch and hearing the table will be unchanged. This colour is not something which is inherent in the table, but something depending upon the table and the spectator and the way the light falls on the table. When, in ordinary life, we speak of the colour of the table, we only mean the sort of colour which it will seem to have to a normal spectator from an ordinary point of view under <b>usual</b> <b>conditions</b> of light. But the other colours which appear under other conditions have just as good a right to be considered real; and therefore, to avoid favouritism, we are compelled to deny that, in itself, the table has any one particular colour.|$|E

The true detection is defined as CH that accurately detects the member as unusual when that member is jammed. The false detection is defined as CH that wrongly detects the member as unusual though that member is usual. The undetection is defined as CH that wrongly detects the member as usual although the member is actually jammed.|$|R
