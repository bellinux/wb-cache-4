5|$|Hoosiers {{were divided}} about {{entering}} World War I. Before Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare {{and tried to}} enlist Mexico as a military ally in 1917, most Hoosiers wanted the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> neutral in the war. Support for Britain came from professions and businessmen. Opposition came from churchmen, women, farmers and Irish Catholics and German-American elements. They called for neutrality and strongly opposed going to war to rescue the British Empire. Influential Hoosiers who opposed involvement in the war included Democratic Senator John W. Kern, and Vice President Thomas R. Marshall. Supporters of military preparedness included James Whitcomb Riley and George Ade. Most of the opposition dissipated when the United States officially declared war against Germany in April 1917, but some teachers lost their jobs on suspicion of disloyalty, and public schools could no longer teach in German. Socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, from Terre Haute, went to federal prison for encouraging young men to evade the draft.|$|E

This was done in response to spiking interest rates, but also put the Salt Lake Department of Airports in a better financial position for future expansion plans.|$|E

25|$|The Jayuya Uprising, {{also known}} as the Jayuya Revolt or El Grito de Jayuya, was a Nationalist revolt that took place on October 30, 1950, in the town of Jayuya, Puerto Rico.

The Nationalists considered the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a colonial power.|$|E
25|$|Fiat {{money or}} fiat {{currency}} is money whose value is not derived from any intrinsic value or guarantee {{that it can}} be converted into a valuable commodity (such as gold). Instead, it has value only by government order (fiat). Usually, the government declares the fiat currency (typically notes and coins from a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve System in the <b>U.S.)</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> legal tender, making it unlawful not to accept the fiat currency as a means of repayment for all debts, public and private.|$|E

25|$|Others {{practice}} casual public nudity. Topfree sunbathing {{is considered}} acceptable by {{many on the}} beaches of Finland, France, Spain, Italy {{and most of the}} rest of Europe (and even in some outdoor swimming pools); however, exposure of the genitals is restricted to nudist areas in most regions. In the United States, topfree sunbathing and wearing thongs are not common in many areas, but are limited to nude beaches in various locations. It is normally acceptable for men in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> barechested or shirtless when engaged in outdoor recreational activities.|$|E

At the same time we adopt the principle: not to employ any of the other expressions of the discipline under consideration, unless its meaning has first been determined with the help of primitive terms and of such expressions of the discipline whose meanings have been explained previously. The sentence which determines the meaning of a term in this way is called a DEFINITION,...|$|E

25|$|Ford and Toyota {{announced}} that all their North American vehicles would {{be equipped with}} ESC standard {{by the end of}} 2009 (it was standard on Toyota SUVs as of 2004, and after the 2011 model-year, all Lexus, Toyota, and Scion vehicles have ESC; the last one to get it was the 2011 model-year Scion tC). However, , Ford still sells models in North America without ESC. General Motors had made a similar announcement for the end of 2010. The NHTSA requires all new passenger vehicles sold in the <b>US</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> equipped with ESC as of the 2012 model year, and estimates it will prevent 5,300–9,600 annual fatalities. A similar requirement has been proposed for new truck tractors and certain buses, but it hasn't yet been finalized.|$|E
25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. I myself believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E
25|$|FutureGen was {{to capture}} carbon dioxide {{produced}} during the gasification process and pump it into deep rock formations {{thousands of feet}} under ground. FutureGen specifically targeted rock formations containing saline water, as these {{are one of the}} most abundant types of geologic formations that can be used to store carbon dioxide worldwide. A study by the Global Energy Technology Strategy Program estimates the storage capacity of these saline rock formations in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 2,970 gigatons of carbon dioxide, compared to a capacity of 77 gigatons of carbon dioxide for all other types of reservoirs, such as depleted gas fields. Focusing on rock formations with saline water was intended to help ensure that the lessons learned from the project are broadly transferable throughout the U.S. and around the world.|$|E
