5|$|Philosopher John Searle {{argues that}} Watson—despite {{impressive}} capabilities—cannot actually think. Drawing on his Chinese room thought experiment, Searle claims that Watson, like other computational machines, is capable only of manipulating symbols, {{but has no}} ability to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of those symbols; however, Searle's experiment has its detractors.|$|E
5|$|According to analyst firm Ovum, the {{software}} is made possible through advances in predictive analytics, machine learning and the NoSQL data caching methodology. The software uses semantic algorithms to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of a data table's columns and pattern recognition algorithms to find potential duplicates in a data-set. It also uses indexing, text pattern recognition and other technologies traditionally found in social media and search software.|$|E
5|$|Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was {{therefore}} selected {{to perform the}} item number instead. She was friends with Jagannadh, and he approached her for this song during the film's shoot at Mumbai, saying that the song suited her and her personality as a dancer. She also tried to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the lyrics while dancing. Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E

25|$|Prushevsky — Supervisor who, like Voshchev, {{feels that}} he does not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of life. He contemplates suicide due to this feeling and spends one night {{sleeping}} in the barracks with regular workers.|$|E
25|$|Children {{may take}} part in Communion after their parents have {{instructed}} them to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of Communion. If a person is in mortal danger and wishes to receive Holy Communion, any Christian is allowed to administer him a valid sacrament. Normally, nonetheless, the administering of the sacrament is reserved to priests. The ordination of women is allowed.|$|E
25|$|Learning to read is the {{acquisition}} {{and practice of}} {{the skills necessary to}} <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> behind printed words. For a fairly good reader, the skill of reading often feels simple, effortless, and automatic; however, the process of learning to read is complex and builds on cognitive, linguistic, and social skills developed from a very early age.|$|E

60|$|Though Lingard alone <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> {{of these}} words, all on board felt oppressed by the uneasy silence which {{followed}} her cry.|$|R
25|$|XBRL {{facilitates}} {{the development of}} continuous auditing modules by providing a way for systems to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of tagged data. Proper use of XBRL assures that relevant data gathered from multiple sources is easily comparable and analyzable. XBRL is a derivative of the XML file format, which tags data with contextual and hierarchical information. It is expected that many enterprise resource planning systems will provide data in the XBRL-GL format to facilitate machine readability.|$|E
25|$|The Foundation Pit (Russian: Котлован, kotlovan) is {{a gloomy}} {{symbolic}} and semi-satirical novel by Andrei Platonov. The {{plot of the}} novel concerns a group of workers living in the early Soviet Union. They attempt to dig out a huge foundation pit {{on the base of}} which a gigantic house will be built for the country's proletarians. The workers dig each day but slowly cease to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of their work. The enormous foundation pit sucks out all of their physical and mental energy.|$|E
25|$|When Mister refuses {{and tries}} to beat her, Celie stands firm and curses him ("I Curse You, Mister"). Harpo then invites Sofia {{to come back and}} live at the Juke Joint, {{reconciling}} with her in the process. Eventually, Mister begins to feel the effect of Celie's curse. Harpo challenges his father to make things right after a bunch of terrible things happen to Mister, which force Mister to try to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of Celie's curse and the meaning of life other than his tough childhood. ("Mister's Song/Celie's Curse").|$|E
60|$|I glanced towards Lord Chelsford. His {{back was}} turned to us. If he <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of my pause {{he made no}} sign.|$|R

25|$|When Phan was five, {{his father}} {{returned}} {{home and he}} began attending his father's classes, where he studied the Chinese classics, such as the Three Character Classic, which took him just three days to memorize. As {{a result of his}} ability to learn quickly, his father decided to move him to further Confucian texts, such as the Analects, which he practiced on banana leaves. In his autobiography, Phan admitted he did not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the text in great detail at the time, but by age six, he was skillful enough to write a variant of the Analects that parodied his classmates, which earned him a caning from his father.|$|E
25|$|Arakawa {{wanted to}} {{integrate}} social problems into the story. Her research involved watching television news programs {{and talking to}} refugees, war veterans and former yakuza. Several plot elements, such as Pinako Rockbell caring for the Elric brothers after their mother dies, and the brothers helping people to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of family, expand on these themes. When creating the fictional world of Fullmetal Alchemist, Arakawa was inspired after reading about the Industrial Revolution in Europe; she was amazed by differences in the culture, architecture, and clothes of the era and those of her own culture. She was especially interested in England during this period and incorporated these ideas into the manga.|$|E
25|$|Biblical {{inspiration}} is {{the doctrine}} in Christian theology {{concerned with the}} divine origin of the Bible and what the Bible teaches about itself. Different groups <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> and details of inspiration in different ways. Most such as Evangelicals and Catholics, see the Bible as a truly human product whose creation was superintended by the Holy Spirit, preserving the authors' works from error without eliminating their specific concerns, situation, or style. This divine involvement, they say, allowed the biblical writer to reveal God's own message to the immediate recipients of the writings and {{to those who would}} come later, communicating God's message without corrupting it.|$|E
60|$|Brandt {{looked at}} Helen, <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of her words, and laughed. But his face paled, and involuntarily his shifty glance sought {{the rocks and}} trees upon the ridge.|$|R
60|$|If Mr Balls had {{followed}} Bobby Frog in spirit, watched his subsequent movements, {{and listened to}} his remarks, perhaps he might have <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of his conduct a little better.|$|R
60|$|Carley {{had never}} <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of <b>the</b> word. The immensity of the West seemed flung at her. What her vision beheld, so {{far-reaching}} and boundless, {{was only a}} dot on the map.|$|R
25|$|Translations of sung texts—whether of {{the above}} type meant to be sung or of {{a more or less}} literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a {{language}} not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the words they are singing.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} make {{patients}} feel more comfortable, the patient care providers make themselves more approachable, therefore more readily open to multiple levels of personal connections. Such personal connections {{have the ability to}} uplift patients’ spirits and secure confidentiality. Utilization of the quality of time spent with the patient proves to be beneficial. By being available for a proper amount of time, patients open up and disclose personal stories, which enable psychiatric/mental health nurses to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> behind each story. The outcome results in nurses making every effort to attaining a non-biased point of view. A combination of being there and being available allows empirical connections to quell any negative feelings within patients.|$|E
25|$|The country's {{laws are}} {{published}} in Hebrew, and eventually English and Arabic translations are published. Publishing {{the law in}} Hebrew in the official gazette (Reshumot) {{is enough to make}} it valid. Unavailability of an Arabic translation can be regarded as a legal defense only if the defendant proves he could not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the law in any conceivable way. Following appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the use of Arabic on street signs and labels increased dramatically. In response to one of the appeals presented by Arab Israeli organizations, the Supreme Court ruled that although second to Hebrew, Arabic is an official language of the State of Israel, and should be used extensively. Today most highway signage is trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic, and English).|$|E
5000|$|In some {{discussion}} models, participants {{are expected to}} come to discussions prepared with their own lists of questions about texts, to encourage independent thinking. Interpretive discussions can arise or flow from participants' questions; discussants can be genuinely motivated to participate {{as well as to}} engage with texts so as to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of texts. That is, no questions need be thrust upon groups for discussions, but rather interested discussants can participate actively to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of texts. [...] In other discussion models (often those with more limited time), leaders guide participants through questions to ensure that important topics are covered over the course of discussions.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{when all}} that company <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of these outspoken words, they swayed {{to and fro}} and whispered like reeds in an evening wind. Presently above this {{whispering}} a soft yet penetrating voice was heard to say: ...|$|R
6000|$|The Indian {{was ready}} for anything. So were the dogs--especially for [...] "grub." [...] Indeed {{it was obvious that}} they <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of that word, for when Macnab uttered it they wagged their tails and cocked their ears.|$|R
25|$|Ethologists and sociobiologists have {{characteristically}} analysed animal {{communication in}} terms of more or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising {{the question of whether}} the animals concerned <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of the signals they emit and receive. That is a key question in animal cognition. There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding. A much discussed example is the use of alarm calls by vervet monkeys. Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators (leopards, eagles, and snakes), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately—but that this ability develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call. Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.|$|E
25|$|Experimental method: This {{method is}} an {{experimental}} paradigm {{used to study}} human experiences involved in the studies of sensation and perception, learning and memory, motivation, and biological psychology. The experimental psychologist usually deals with intact organisms although studies are often conducted with organisms modified by surgery, radiation, drug treatment, or long-standing deprivations of various kinds or with organisms that naturally present organic abnormalities or emotional disorders. Economists and psychologists have developed a variety of experimental methodologies to elicit and assess individual attitudes where each emotion differs for each individual. The results are then gathered and quantified to conclude if specific experiences have any common factors. This method is used to seek clarity of the experience and remove any biases to help <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> behind the experience {{to see if it}} can be generalized.|$|E
25|$|His next {{work was}} {{published}} in 1933 titled The Physical Dimensions of Consciousness; he attempts an accommodation with behaviorism by viewing sensations through their physical mechanisms. In this Boring expresses his monist physicalism perspective, similar to operationalism’s emphasis on measurement in order to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of concepts. Boring himself was surprised by his view being in direct opposition to his deeply respected mentor Titchener. However Titchener was dead by this time and Boring was now free to express his views. The mentalist and dualist perspective of Titchener seemed insecure to Boring, he focused on a physical brain rather than the abstract mind. One {{of the purposes of}} this book was try to clarify such complex terms as consciousness and sensation, questions that had been plaguing him since his automobile accident. Boring wanted to define what these phenomena actually meant physically.|$|E
60|$|Orpin {{feared that}} he <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of <b>the</b> last words too well, but, being aware that Hintza was {{regarded}} by the colonists {{as one of}} the friendliest of the Kafir chiefs, he hoped that he might be mistaken.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we sought to}} <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of <b>the</b> term “shift in the equilibrium”, term related to systems in {{chemical}} equilibrium, for chemistry teacher students. The data were collected by a questionnaire, which wes answered by students in a teacher education course in Chemistry. The data were interpreted by the Content Analysis, which was used to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> of <b>the</b> expression “shift in the equilibrium” for the chemistry teacher students. The answers highlighted the need for deeper conceptual discussions on the subject chemical equilibrium in teacher ́s education programs, given that there where erroneous interpretations and, if these concepts are not <b>understood,</b> <b>the</b> misconceptions {{are likely to be}} maintained and brought back in classes given by the future teachers...|$|R
5000|$|The Tibetan {{term for}} arhat was {{translated}} by meaning from Sanskrit. This translation, dgra bcom pa, means [...] "one who has destroyed the foes of afflictions." [...] Thus the Tibetan translators also <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> of arhat to be ari-hanta.|$|R
