40|$|The {{impulsive}} behavior <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> plays a {{key role}} in the Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) of internal combustion engines. There have been several studies on the identification and quantification <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> impacting action under various operation conditions. In the current study, the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> secondary motion are briefly explored, since this is fundamental to understanding the aggressive oscillations, energy loss and noise generation. Concepts <b>of</b> controlling <b>piston</b> secondary motion (and thus, impacts) are investigated and a new passive control approach is presented based on the nonlinear energy absorption of the highly transient oscillations. The effectiveness of this new method on the improvement <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> impact behavior is discussed, using a preliminary optimization exercise (with respect to engine excitation/speed, damping and stiffness of the nonlinear oscillator) that leads to the conceptual design of a nonlinear energy absorber...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims {{to obtain}} the piston ring tribological characteristics of a free-piston engine.

The lubrication performances <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> ring were simulated; the effects <b>of</b> the <b>piston</b> motion to piston ring lubrication process were analyzed compared with a corresponding conventional engine. Results show that seal working time of free-piston ring is longer than conventional engine's during a cycle time, but the leakage loss is lower. Besides, the oil film thickness <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> ring in free-piston engine is thinner than that of crankshaft engine just around TDC, but other position is thicker. Moreover friction forces and friction work <b>of</b> <b>piston</b> ring in two engines are almost equivalent, but the peak friction power of free-piston engine is larger than crankshaft engine...|$|R
