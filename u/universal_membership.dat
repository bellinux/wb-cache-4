25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, opponents of VSU {{argue that it}} silences students' voices by {{removing}} <b>universal</b> <b>membership</b> of a student organisation. The National Union of Students (NUS) is an umbrella organisation for most (though not all) representative and advocacy-providing student organisations; at present it organises national programs and days of action (for example) and undertakes activities such as parliamentary submissions and media relations. It is probable that the NUS's activities will be severely curtailed as VSU has left many student unions unable to pay full dues to the NUS. The fact that any given student union would also represent a significantly smaller part of their university's student body would make it much harder to gain media attention and funds {{to be an effective}} pressure group. VSU supporters counter that the NUS and member bodies used students' money for political ends, some of which were supported by only left wing students.|$|E

Though specific reasons for the dissolution are unknown, the political polarization and MEMCh's refusal to exclude anyone for their political views and factionalism dividing the focus to interest groups were contributing factors.|$|R

This paper examines the use of emergency power in the cases of SARS, H 1 N 1 and Ebola to see if Global Administrative Law principles are present.

This paper looks into the feasibility of implementing PPPs in the health sector. Review of literature, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were conducted for the study. The Philippine hospital system was reviewed using five performance criteria, namely, improved health care access, equity, and quality, operating with maximum efficiency, and ensuring sustainability followed {{by the development of}} an assessment framework; the application of the said framework; and policy and program implementation recommendations for health PPPs. In order to improve the feasibility of PPPs in the health sector, it is recommended that the government use public-private investment partnerships as the definition for health PPPs, encourage public policy discussions on PPP and its relation to socioeconomic development, and develop a comprehensive communications program for PPPs. It needs to rectify shortcomings in previous PPPs and ensure absolute transparency and accountability in the entire PPP process. There is a need to amend the legal framework to ensure coherence of health PPPs. It should conduct joint capacity-building initiatives and develop and enforce an evidence-based decisionmaking process for PPPs. It needs to strengthen implementation of monitoring and evaluation and utilize the health system indicators in evaluation of PPPs.

40|$|Research on party {{membership}} development commonly reports figures aggregated to {{the country}} level and/or using only a few time-points. While these choices may be appropriate for certain research questions, they nevertheless hide major differences between parties and conceal short-term fluctuations. Additionally, they are inappropriate for studying individ-ual party trajectories. This is necessary, however, to better describe and ultimately explain the phenomenon of member-ship decline. The article analyses in total 1653 observations across 47 parties in six western European countries between 1960 and 2010 to test hypotheses pertaining to individual party membership development. Using multilevel modelling and time-series analyses, the results show what aggregated data with few time-points cannot: membership decline is by far not a <b>universal</b> phenomenon. Additionally, <b>membership</b> decline appears {{to be part of}} a party’s life-cycle. The more consoli-dated parties are, the fewer members they have.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} the European Union and Asia with the purpose of developing new ideas for multilateral co-operation and building of trust in the area of comprehensive security. Specifically, this paper focuses on cooperation between Europe and Asia in three multilateral institutions: Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), ASEAN Regional Forum and the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) process. The paper notes that Asia is a contested concept and that none of the institutions is <b>universal</b> in its <b>membership.</b> Next, the paper reviews the recent history of Europe-Asia relations and notes that extensive areas of cooperation have already been mapped out. The paper therefore argues that Europe must prioritize immediate and long-term challenges to Asian regionalism and regional security. Six major issues are then highlighted: the ASEAN Charter and community building, Australia’s proposal for the creation of an Asia Pacific Community, the situation Myanmar, conflict resolution in regional hot spots, mitigation of the impact of climate change and developing safe nuclear energy. The paper way to address these issues and build trust is through the cluster where individual European and Asian states take the lead on issues of particular concern...|$|R

40|$|Relating {{nationalism}} {{to other}} ideologies or cultural values {{is one of}} the most enigmatic scholarly activities. The enigma lies in the kaleidoscopic nature of nationalism and the ease with which it adapts or relates to philosophically opposed ideologies (Hutchinson & Smith, 1994, 3). For example, nationalism often assumes ties to liberalism, even though it presupposes a strong commitment to the national community that transcends individualism. It accommodates conservatism fairly well despite nationalism’s modernizing mission, and it has often been paired with communism, despite the latter’s internationalist rhetoric. More surprisingly, nationalism and religion often go hand in hand, despite their deep philosophical inconsistencies. Nationalism is inherently local, philosophically poor, and limited and it lacks the belief in afterlife salvation and creative intelligence as source of meaning behind the universe (Anderson, 1983; Greenfeld, 1996 b). Yet it frequently relates to religions such as Christianity and Islam which are <b>universal</b> in their <b>membership</b> and message of salvation. The article examines the latter relationship, namely that of nationalism and religion, through evidence from Southeast Europe in the past three centuries. It identifies religious and linguistic cleavages as alternative sources of identity construction and points to the extent to which the interplay of the two can help us understand and evaluate contemporary theories of nationalism. Based on the Balkan experience, the article evaluates theories of nationalism put forward by Ernest Gellner (1983), Benedict Anderson (1983), Miroslav Hroch (1985), Anthony Smith (1971) and John Hutchinson (1987). It finally identifies the degree to which religion and nationalism have adapted to serve domestic constraints, new ideological waves and opportunities for ethnonational expansion or contraction facing modern nationalist movements as argued elsewhere by Hroch (1985 & 1998), Magocsi (1997) and Laitin, (1998) ...|$|R

Next, it addresses the Christian church's choice between exclusive membership and open access to all applicants on the day of its triumph and shows, by means of a cooperative model, that open access and <b>universal</b> <b>membership</b> were a superior policy if coupled with doctrinal radicalization. Finally, it analyzes the theological controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries by means of a Hotelling-type linear spatial model of doctrinal strictness ranging from paganism to Judaism, and traces the theological choices that were made back to the church's need to distance itself from its potential competitors. ...|$|E
