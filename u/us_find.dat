25|$|The Alexandrian {{contribution}} to Christian mysticism centers on Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Clement {{was an early}} Christian humanist who argued that reason {{is the most important}} aspect of human existence and that gnosis (not something we can attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) helps <b>us</b> <b>find</b> the spiritual realities that are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. Given the importance of reason, Clement stresses apatheia as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God's love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the Cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the Cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (theoria and praxis) in our spiritual exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of our souls with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{found the}} lack of an {{anthropomorphic}} point of view hurt the book's relevance. Robert Braile in The Boston Globe wrote that it has [...] "no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [...] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating". Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post also questioned the premise: [...] "Imagining the human footprint on a post-human planet might be fun for dormitory potheads who have already settled the questions of God's existence and Fergie's hotness, but it's not clear why the rest of us need this level of documentary evidence". On the other hand, Alanna Mitchell in the Globe and Mail review found relevance in the context of society's passiveness to resource depletion combined with an anthropomorphic vanity. She writes the [...] "book [...] designed to help <b>us</b> <b>find</b> the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death".|$|E
500|$|The St. Johns creeps {{into the}} {{southern}} tip of Lake George, the second largest lake in Florida at , [...] wide and [...] long. The watershed surrounding Lake George expands through , lying within Ocala National Forest and Lake George State Forest, that protect an ecosystem dominated by pine and scrub more than [...] and [...] in size, respectively. Flatwoods forests dominate the Lake George watershed, with slash pines (Pinus elliottii), saw palmetto (Serenoa repens), and over 100 species of groundcover or herbal plants that grow in poor, sandy soil. Flatwoods pine forests stay relatively dry, but can withstand short periods of flooding. Larger land animals such as wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), and the largest population of southern bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus leucocephalus) in the contiguous <b>U.S,</b> <b>find</b> it easier to live in the flatwoods. Typical mammals that live in these ecosystems, such as raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginiana), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and white tailed-deer (Odocoileus virginianus), are ones that prefer dry, flat areas with good ground cover and available nesting sites.|$|E

We wanted to try to avoid the classical witch with the long nose stirring the pot. I really wanted them to be...dangerous, fast – they’re stronger than Hansel and Gretel...It’s a good basis for a villain." [...] He recalled that [...] "the most fun was finding their look and sound. For the main witches, we found one animal to represent all of them, like Muriel is a wolf. It just helped <b>us</b> <b>find</b> the witches. In some ways, it feels like they're the spawn of the dark places of nature. It should feel animalistic." [...] Asked if he was worried about [...] "this perception that it might be interpreted as sexist", Wirkola said, [...] "For me, that’s a classical villain from hundreds and hundreds of years ago. Yeah, I never worried about that, to be honest." [...] He added, [...] "People forget how truly dark and twisted those stories are. [...] talks about a witch burning alive in an oven, screaming and scratching." [...] Ulrich Zeidler's concept art for some of the witches was released on the Internet.|$|E

The best pop music transports you to somewhere beyond words, and Rihanna's strongest singles all seem to be in on this secret." [...] Allmusic chose the song as a highlight on Talk That Talk, and wrote about the [...] "singer's ecstatic vocal than Calvin Harris' shrill, plinky production". Los Angeles Times commented that the song was an [...] "ode for bad love" [...] and added it [...] "wouldn't be out of place at Electric Daisy Carnival".

[...] As of January 2015, Billboard named [...] "We Found Love" [...] as the best song of the 2010s (so far).
