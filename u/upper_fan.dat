5000|$|The Fan is a {{district}} of Richmond, Virginia, {{so named because}} of the [...] "fan" [...] shape of the array of streets that extend west from Belvidere Street, on {{the eastern edge of}} Monroe Park, westward to the Boulevard. (Though the streets rapidly resemble a grid after moving through what is now Virginia Commonwealth University). The Fan is one of the easterly points of the city's West End section, and is bordered to the north by Broad Street and to the south by VA 195, although the Fan District Association considers the southern border to be the properties abutting the south side of Main Street. The western side is sometimes called the <b>Upper</b> <b>Fan</b> and the eastern side the Lower Fan, though confusingly the Uptown district is located near VCU in the Lower Fan. Many cafes and locally owned restaurants are located here, as well as historic Monument Avenue, a boulevard featuring enormous equine statuary of Civil War Confederate generals and a statue of tennis icon Arthur Ashe. Development of the Fan district was strongly influenced by the City Beautiful movement of the late 19th century.|$|E

Very {{little is known about}} the sedimentary structure of the 1800 km long and 400 km wide Mozambique Fan, which is fed by the Zambezi and spreads out into the Mozambique Channel. New multichannel seismic profiles in the Mozambique Basin reveal multiple feeder systems of the <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> that have been active concurrently or consecutively since Late Cretaceous. We identify two buried, ancient turbidite systems off Mozambique in addition to the previously known Zambezi-Channel system and another hypothesized active system. The oldest part of the <b>upper</b> <b>fan,</b> located north of the present-day mouth of the Zambezi, was active from Late Cretaceous to Eocene times. Regional uplift caused an increased sediment flux that continued until Eocene times, allowing the fan to migrate southwards under the influence of bottom currents. Following the mid-Oligocene marine regression, the Beira High Channel-levee complex fed the Mozambique Fan from the southwest until Miocene times, reworking sediments from the shelf and continental slope into the distal abyssal fan. Since the Miocene, sediments have bypassed the shelf and <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> region through the Zambezi Valley system directly into the Zambezi Channel.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The Wilkes Land {{continental}} slope contains an intricate network of submarine canyons {{that on the}} continental rise develop {{into a series of}} chan-nel and overbank deposits of turbidite systems. We can define upper-fan, mid-dle-fan, and lower-fan provinces. The Wilkes Land <b>upper</b> <b>fans</b> are character-ized by large channels with relief up to 900 m, distances between levee crests up to 18 km, and channel-floor widths up to 6 km. Middle-fan channels also have high relief (; 300 m), and locally, interchannel areas exhibit mounded contourite-style deposits with high relief (up to 490 m). Within middle-fan sed-iment mounds there are acoustic facies of channel–overbank deposits from tur-bidity currents, and of sediment waves from contour-current sedimentation. The lower rise is characterized by small, shallow channels (50 – 75 m relief) and by interchannel areas of low relief, both characteristic of a lower-fan environ-ment. The Wilkes Land turbidite systems show the following significant mor-phological differences compared to most river-sourced fans: (1) multiple large tributary channels across the <b>upper</b> and middle <b>fan,</b> (2) channel relief several times greater (900 m) than typical relief (100 – 200 m) for channels on fans less than 300 km in diameter, and (3) steep middle-fan and lower-fan gradients. We interpret the differences in channel network patterns, channel size, and middle-fan and lower-fan gradients between the Wilkes Land fans and other fans to result from the continental ice sheet feeding glacial ice streams that reached the outer continental shelf at times of glacial maxima. The Wilkes Land can-yon–channel network patterns are comparable with the high-latitude Lauren-tian Fan and Labrador Sea channels. The Laurentian Fan also has large upper-fan channels with larger relief (800 m) than typical relief (200 – 300 m) expected for fans that are 600 km in diameter. Both the Labrador Sea and Laurentian Fan are fed by continental ice sheets at the shelf edge...|$|R

40|$|The Imsdalen Submarine Fan Complex is {{a gravel}} and coarse sand {{dominated}} turbidite fan system. The fan complex was {{deposited in the}} Neoproterozoic Hedmark rift basin close to a basin margin bordered by the Imsdalen Fault. The Imsdalen Fault {{is supposed to be}} inherited from a syn-sedimentary strike-slip fault zone that was reactivated during the Caledonian nappe emplacement. Ten sedimentary logs cover a stratigraphic section more than 4 km thick. Thirteen facies have been organized into five facies associations, representing architectural elements including base-of-slope to <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> feeder channel complex, <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> distributary channel complex, middle to lower fan channel-lobe complex, fringed sheets, and fi ne-grained overbank and basin-plain deposits. The Imsdalen Submarine Fan Complex is divided into eleven fan systems, separated by erosional surfaces, interpreted as sequence boundaries, except for the boundary at the base of fan 6, interpreted to be a maximum fl ooding surface. Overall, the eleven fan systems form a turbidite succession that records a long history of aggradation to retrogradation, as shown by the fans 1 to 8, followed by a phase of marked progradation, displayed by the fans 9 to 11, from middle to lower, to <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> positions. It is suggested that the main factor in control of the development of the Imsdalen Submarine Fan Complex was related to fault activity at the basin margin and sediment supply. The Imsdalen Submarine Fan Complex shows that gravity fl ow processes have the capacity and competence to transport huge amounts of coarse sand and gravel at least 40 to 60 kilometres into a deep-marine basin. The long transport distance of the coarse-clastic material is interpreted {{as a result of the}} combined effects of very high rates of coarseclastic sediment supply, high potential energy along the submarine slope, high slope gradient, creation of accommodation due to high rate of basin subsidence, channelized transport, and effective mechanisms of clast support in the gravity fl ow system.

40|$|Its {{location}} on a tectonically relatively stable passive margin and its degree of {{interaction with the}} sea make the Horingbaai fan-delta, NW Namibia, an exceptional record of coastal activity, providing insights into the response of ephemeral fluvial systems to changes in climate, sea level and continent-scale uplift. The fan comprises upper, middle and lower segments. The <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> and middle fan are dominated by a braided river system; only in the <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> are fluvial sediments interleaved with hyperconcentrated flow deposits. Plio–Pleistocene sea level highstands have left marine terraces on the fan surface which enable correlation with the offshore marine record and provide timelines to constrain fan growth. The bulk of fan-delta progradation took place at ∼ 2. 7 – 2. 4 Ma, between {{the formation of a}} widespread erosional surface incising the middle Pliocene Karpfenkliff and Kamberg Formations, but prior to the emplacement of the warm-water fauna-bearing late Pliocene “Oyster Terrace” (∼ 2. 4 – 2. 2 Ma), an equivalent of the + 30 mP (marine terrace package) in coastal southwestern Africa. Major fan progradation is contemporaneous with widespread regional uplift (~ 12 ± 5 m/Ma) and climate change in southwestern Africa, the latter associated with intensification of northern hemisphere glaciations. Younger fan growth phases are weaker and constrained by < 10 m asl marine terrace bodies that yield mostly cold-water fauna, corresponding to the onset of strong glacial/interglacial climatic fluctuations superimposed on a general aridification trend and the introduction of colder sea-surface temperatures after 2. 2 Ma...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLarge-scale conical and saucer-shaped sand injectites {{have been}} {{identified}} in the Upper Miocene sediments of the Lower Congo Basin. These structures are evidenced on the 3 D high-resolution seismic data at about 600 ms TWT (two-way traveltime) beneath the seabed. The conical and saucer-shaped anomalies range from 20 to 80 m in height, 50 to 300 m in diameter, and 10 to 20 ms TWT in thickness. They are located within a sedimentary interval of about 100 m in thickness and are aligned over 20 km in dip direction (NE-SW), above the NW margin of an underlying <b>Upper</b> Miocene submarine <b>fan.</b> We have interpreted the conical and saucer-shaped anomalies as upward-emplaced sand injectites sourced from the <b>Upper</b> Miocene <b>fan</b> because of their discordant character, the postsedimentary uplifting of the sediments overlying the cones and saucer-shaped bodies, the alignment with the lateral fringe of the <b>Upper</b> Miocene submarine <b>fan,</b> and the geological context. Sand injection dates from the Miocene-Pliocene transition (approximately 5. 3 Ma). The prerequisite overpressure to the sand injection process {{may be due to the}} buoyancy effect of hydrocarbons accumulated in the margins of the fan. Additionally, overpressure could have been enhanced by the lateral transfer of fluids operating in the inclined margins of the lobe. The short duration of sand injection and the presence of many sandstone intrusions suggested that the process of injection was triggered by an event, likely due to a nearby fault displacement related to diapiric movements. This is the first time that sand injectites of seismic scale have been described from the Lower Congo Basin. The localized nature of these injectites has led to a change in the migration path of fluids through the sedimentary cover. Consequently, the sand intrusions are both evidence and vectors of fluid migration within the basin fill...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 A deep source-receiver seismic {{refraction}} {{experiment was}} conducted on {{the upper part of the}} Monterey Deep Sea Fan. The aim of this thesis is to construct the velocity structure of the upper Monterey Fan and to examine the lateral seismic velocity variations among the upper, middle and lower fan subunits. Using primary waves and whispering gallery phases (the multiply-reflected refraction waves), the sediment velocity structure was modeled by the tau-zeta travel time inversion process. The changes in velocity gradients with depth of the upper Monterey Fan are morphologically similar to that found on both the Central Bengal Fan and the Nicobar Fan, an abandoned lower fan of the Bengal Fan Complex. The velocity gradient of the upper Monterey Fan at depth, 0. 59 s⁻¹ is significantly lower than both the middle Bengal Fan (0. 68 s⁻¹) and the Nicobar Fan (0. 81 s⁻¹). The <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> subunit, which is closer to its sediment source, is characterized by higher porosities caused primarily by a higher sedimentation rate than the lower fan subunits. Since seismic velocity is inversely related to porosity, the <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> subunit should have lower velocity gradients and seismic velocities than the other fan subunits. If porosity and velocity variations exist, then these variations can be used to constrain various models of deep sea fan formation. No definite conclusion can be drawn at this time due to a fault within 1 km of the Nicobar Fan site; however, a systematic velocity variation pattern of deep sea fans is revealed. Some portions of the Monterey Fan data contain refracted waves which have bottomed within the underlying acoustic basement structure. The entire velocity structure was solved by both the general and the "stripping" solving schemes. The results of basement structure show a velocity ranging from 3. 4 to 5. 8 km/s indicating that the uppermost part may be pre-existing continental rise sediments...|$|E

40|$|The {{distribution}} of surficial sediments and sediment dispersion {{patterns on the}} steep continental slope off Nice (SE France) have been studied using side-scan sonar, 3. 5 kHz profiles, short piston cores and bottom photographs. The input of terrigenous material to the Baie des Anges, a submarine embayment bounded by two prominent ridges, is dominated by fluvial input from the Var River, the Paillon River being only a minor source. The Var River provides very coarse bedload material (gravel and cobble) directly {{to the head of}} the Var Canyon. Gravel and cobble deposits are found all along the Var Canyon and the <b>Upper</b> <b>Fan</b> Valley of the Var submarine fan and have been shaped into gravel waves. The fine particles (suspension load) are separated from the coarse bedload upon entering the sea and form up to 60 -m thick deposits on the uppermost continental slope of the Baie des Anges. These deposits are formed by settling out of sediment plumes. The presence of silt and fine sand laminae that decrease in thickness and frequency away from the Var River mouth indicate the influence of meso- and hyperpycnal flows on these plume deposits. Areas outside the Baie des Anges are not connected to major fluvial input and receive only hemipelagic sediments. These primary deposits are highly unstable and sediment failure due to seismic loading, sedimentary loading or undercutting is frequent. Sediment failure produces secondary sediment gravity flows that export most of the material to the basin, but also produce turbidity-current over-spill deposits on ridges bounding the slope canyons and on terraces within the Var Canyon. Slump and debris-flow deposits are also observed. At least some of these secondary flows erode the continental slope as cross-cutting chutes on the upper continental slope and erosional scours in the <b>Upper</b> <b>Fan</b> Valley demonstrate. Modern sediment dispersal patterns on the continental slope off Nice are proposed as a modern analogue to lowstand conditions on continental margins.

40|$|Seismic {{and gravity}} data {{have been used}} to {{determine}} the structure of the sediments, crust, and upper mantle that underlie the Amazon continental margin, offshore NE Brazil. Seismic reflection profile data reveal a major unconformity at ∼ 7 s two-way travel time (TWTT) which we interpret as marking the onset of the transcontinental Amazon River and the formation of the Amazon deep-sea fan system in the late Miocene. Seismic refraction data show mean sediment velocities that decrease by > 1. 5 km s- 1 in a seaward direction. We attribute this decrease to facies changes associated with sediment progradation and the development of topset, foreset, and bottomset beds. Seismic refraction data show that the sediments are underlain by oceanic crust that has a similar velocity structure compared to elsewhere in the Atlantic Ocean but is unusually thin (∼ 4. 2 km). We attribute the thin crust to either slow seafloor spreading or a limited magma supply during the initial rifting of South America and Africa in the Early Cretaceous. The seismic data {{have been used to}} construct a new sediment thickness grid that together with gravity anomaly data, suggests the Amazon fan loaded lithosphère with an unusually high flexural strength. While a high-strength lithosphere explains the overall depth of the seismic Moho, there are discrepancies (of up to 2 km) beneath the <b>upper</b> <b>fan,</b> where the modeled flexed Moho is shallower than the seismic Moho, and beneath the middle fan, where it is deeper. Gravity and seismic modeling suggest these discrepancies are caused by lateral changes in subcrustal density such that the mantle underlying the <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> is denser than it is beneath the middle fan. We attribute these lateral density differences to proximity to the Ceara Rise, which is believed to have formed during the Late Cretaceous in a mid-ocean ridge setting. Fan loading of a relatively strong, dense, and, hence, cold lithosphere predicts stress orientations that are consistent with borehole breakout data and the location and height of the Gurupé Arch onshore. Despite its proximity to "leaky" transform faults, the margin that underlies the Amazon fan appears to be of nonvolcanic origin. The main differences with other nonvolcanic margins, such as West Iberia and Newfoundland, are a greater sediment accumulation, a narrower zone of transitional crust, and a lack of any evidence for extreme extension and mantle serpentinization.

40|$|Thin layers {{composed}} of quartz of varied sizes and minor kaolin {{occur in a}} Mesozoic 	succession of coarse-grained and very coarse-grained sandstone within the Akatani area of 	the Nanjo Massif in the Mino Terrane of Central Japan. The depositional facies of the 	sandstone succession is interpreted as feeder-channel to <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> environment; the sandstones 	are classified as arkosic arenites derived from a granitic source terrane. Sandstones 	close to the layers are highly altered: feldspars are dissolved, and quartz partly corroded and 	partly overgrown. These altered sandstones are classified as quartz arenites. 	The quartz-kaolin layers, a few to lOcm thick and resembling bedded chert layers, are 	{{composed of}} authigenic quartz, kaolinite, dickite, and illite as documented by petrographic 	observations aided by electron scanning microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and 	X -ray analysis. Crystal forms and sizes of the quartz display a wide variation: mosaic to 	irregular, megacrystalline to microcrystalline, and euhedral to anhedral. Kaolinite and 	dickite are closely associated with quartz, and detailed textural and fabric observations show 	that kaolinite {{played an important role}} during crystallization and overgrowth of quartz crystals, 	and replacement of the finer quartz by the coarse quartz crystals. Polished and etched 	surfaces of some authigenic quartz crystals show fabrics similar to the twin fabrics of quartz. 	Field observations cannot recognize any evidence of hydrothermal alteration. Laboratory 	studies indicate that the quartz-kaolin layers were precipitated in layer-parallel open spac...|$|E
40|$|Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments. Seismic {{sequence}} {{analysis of the}} Palaeocene-Eocene strata on the southwestern a d southeastern margins of the basin reveals amounded and draped geometry. Four seismic sequences are d fined and are coeval {{with a series of}} deltaic deposits in the northern and central parts of the basin. In the southwestern area these are interpreted as stacked submarine fan deposits. In the southeastern area the lower two sequences are interpreted as shelf-slope deposits which are overlain by two submarine fan complexes. Funnelling of the sediment was controlled by erosive channelling through interfan topographic lows. The seismic response indicates hat the fans are dominated by lower fan sheet sand deposits with minor amounts of <b>upper</b> <b>fan</b> channellized sandstones. They probably developed in response to an interplay of eustatic sea level changes, tectonic uplift on the basin margins, and thermal subsidence towards thebasin centre. The Porcupine Basin, lying off the west coast of Ireland (Fig. 1), contains up to approximately 10 km of post-Palaeozoic sediments. The basin developed largely in response to the extensional stresses of the evolving North Atlantic Ocean. The sediments were deposited in a range of tectonic settings. Late Palaeozoic to Jurassic sedimentation took place in a syn-rift setting and the Cretaceous and Tertiary sediments formed during a phase of post-rift hermal sub-sidence. The general geology and the develop-ment of the region has been described and discussed in a number of publications includin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Upper Rotliegend {{sedimentation}} in {{the southern}} North Sea Basin (SNSB) {{was a response to}} complex synsedimentary tectonics and cyclical climatic hanges. During the early Upper Rotliegend, faulting (?dextral strike-slip) resulted in the formation f a number of isolated sub-basins e. g. the Sole Pit, Silverpit and the Broad Fourteens, which were gradually united {{as a consequence of the}} progressive collapse of the Inde-Cleaver Bank High. Basin-margin tectonics controlled the evolution of the basin and the nature and distribution of the various types of alluvial fan and fan delta systems that evolved uring pluvial climatic phases. Many of the earlier <b>Upper</b> Rotliegend <b>fans</b> display a systematic lateral displacement along synsedimentary faults. Along the Dowsing Fault Zone, 'dry-type' alluvial fans display a progressive northwestward migration with time. Also, fan deltas, sourced from the Texel-Ijsselmeer High, young progressively to the SE along the trend of the main faults. These systematic lateral displacements have been tentatively explained by invoking dextral oblique transfer of the source area relative to the depositional basin, within the context of a strike-slip tectono-sedimentary model. Alternatively, in an extensional model, the distribution pattern could be explained by sourcing the fans from both th...|$|R

40|$|Correlation of new {{multichannel}} seismic profiles {{across the}} <b>upper</b> Indus <b>Fan</b> and Murray Ridge with a dated industrial {{well on the}} Pakistan shelf demonstrates that ~ 40 % of the Indus Fan predates the middle Miocene, and ~ 35 % predates uplift of the Murray Ridge (early Miocene, ~ 22 Ma). The Arabian Sea, {{in addition to the}} Makran accretionary complex, was therefore an important repository of sediment from the Indus River system during the Paleogene. Channel and levee complexes are most pronounced after the early Miocene, coincident with an increase in sedimentation rates. Middle Eocene sandstones from Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 224 on the Owen Ridge yield K-feldspars whose Pb isotopic composition, measured by in situ ion microprobe methods, indicates an origin in, or north of, the Indus suture zone. This observation requires that India-Asia collision had occurred by this time and that an Indus River system, feeding material from the suture zone into the basin, was active soon after collision. Pleistocene provenance was similar to that during the Eocene, albeit with greater contribution from the Karakoram. A mass balance of the erosional record on land with deposition in the fan and associated basins suggests that only ~ 40 % of the Neogene sediment in the fan is derived from the Indian plate...|$|R
