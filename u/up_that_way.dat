500|$|The {{episode was}} the first in the series that did not feature Mulder, and {{featured}} Scully only in archival footage from [...] "Pilot". The episode was not intended to give the actors a week off, but ended <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> which Duchovny was very pleased with. Producer J.P. Finn coordinated the sequence where The Smoking Man assassinates John F. Kennedy. It was filmed in a downtown Vancouver location doubling for Dealey Plaza. The show's costume designer contacted the costume designer for the film JFK and borrowed a reproduction of Jackie Kennedy's pink suit used in the film. The presidential limousine ridden by Kennedy was created by picture vehicle coordinator Nigel Habgood.|$|E
500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way he sees it but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} Thelma, on {{the other}} hand, was first written as a character who [...] "had kids and stuff like that, but I realized that she couldn’t have kids. The idea that Darryl wanted her to wait, because the kids would be a sacrifice for him financially, fit perfectly. And, of course, she’s really a child herself. I had to set it <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I love to laugh, and I wanted {{this to be a}} movie you were enjoying and having a good time with because you were watching these women get their lives. Even though they would lose them, they were becoming more and more themselves. It was a beautiful experience, a liberating experience to watch that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Bemis, who {{has been}} sipping his tea in silent admiration: [...] "Are you often able to keep it <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way?</b> I was fancying myself at the theatre." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lor! How you do go and bother a gal of ten,' said Maggy, 'catching {{the poor}} thing <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Whoever said the Princess had a secret? I never said so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, don't make a tomfoolery of it; that's enough. I {{shall have}} all the fellows at me for your coming <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> you know. Why couldn't you shake hands like anyone else?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Complaints of {{that sort}} are {{sometimes}} made, about Ratcliffe and Wapping and <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> But {{who knows how many}} are true?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... --There's five fathoms out there, he said. It'll {{be swept}} <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> when the tide comes in about one. It's nine days today.|$|E
6000|$|They {{had come}} to a little barrier, <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and could go no further. Jeff said: [...] "I've just been {{interviewing}} another reformed pessimist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's that?" [...] said Mr. Amedroz, who, {{having no}} cows of his own, {{was not pleased}} to see one brought <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> before his hall door. [...] "There's somebody's cow come here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{should there}} be to be done? If you do remain here I wish you would sit down, Mr. Greenwood. You oppress me by {{standing}} <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> {{in the middle of}} the room." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} you tied <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> before. You don't do it out hunting. I've seen {{you when the}} snow has been driving in your face, and you didn't mind it,--not so much as I did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No use headin' north," [...] said Tim. [...] "Winter'll come on <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> {{and make}} the sleepin' crimpy. D'ye want to go East--that means Nevada and the deserts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She's {{a regular}} play actor. I don't like made-up people. Why does she go {{around with her}} sleeves rolled <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and--and her dress open at the throat?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget, Captain Cuffe, {{that his}} lordship {{has sent a}} light cruiser already <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and le Feu-Follet would hardly dare to show herself near one of our regular fellows--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{these guys}} are going to dig it <b>up.</b> <b>That's</b> the <b>way</b> it looks to me." [...] He lowered his voice. [...] "Say, I saw Clarice last night," [...] he said in a {{confidential}} undertone. [...] "It's all right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I know {{something}} much more bitter: {{and that is what}} she thinks of the bishop's wife. And you know, Mark, it was so unladylike, her getting <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> What must the people of Barchester think of her?" ...|$|R
50|$|The Texas Tornado's famous double loops do {{not occur}} in a row, but are lined <b>up</b> to appear <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now look here, youngster,' said Owlett. 'O, 'tis the Methodist parson!--what, and Mrs. Newberry! Well, you'd {{better not}} go <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> Lizzy. They've all run off, and folks have got their own again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{could he}} {{if he was}} at the ranch? But wait a minute! He said {{something}} about going fishing in that brook that flows through the woods. Maybe he did come <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] said Longlegs. [...] "I believe I have {{an errand}} <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> now I think of it. I believe I'll just {{go over and}} have a look at him. I have never seen him asleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did you {{not bring}} me <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> mamma?" [...] said Gwendolen. But {{immediately}} perceiving in the crushed look and rising sob that she had given a deep wound, she tossed down her hat and knelt at her mother's feet crying-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not mean}} {{anything}} of the kind," [...] said Aunt Dosett. [...] "You should not take me <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I am speaking only for your good, because I know that you should not dawdle away your existence. Leave the sheet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{call that}} sly and deceitful;--very sly and very deceitful. If I know it you won't stir {{out of this}} house to go to Cheltenham. I wonder Lady Ushant would go to put you <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> against those you're bound to obey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't mean {{to end it}} <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> but it was Mr. Stubbs's fault," [...] said Toby, as soon {{as quiet}} had been {{restored}} and the guests, {{with the exception of}} the monkey, were seated at the table once more.|$|E
6000|$|... "S'tira said that's the way {{she knew}} you was from Willoughby Pastures. Her folks is from <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> themselves. She says the minute she heard the name she knew it couldn't 'a' be'n you, whoever it was done it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But we were {{deprived}} of Sterrett's treat {{by a lot}} of gunshots several squares sway, which General Dingo seemed to think he ought to look after. He spurred his old white plug <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and the soldiers scuttled along after him.|$|E
6000|$|... "And on {{less than}} a quarter of it. The very respectable man who brushes my clothes no doubt does so. But then you see he has been brought <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I suppose <b>that</b> you as a {{bachelor}} put by every year at least half your income?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Cheer up, my friend,' {{said the}} hermit. 'You {{are too young}} to give <b>up</b> things in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> And now allow me, sir, to {{introduce}} you to my daughter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|MARY, with a doubting smile, goes out. [Rising] You {{might give}} me [...] {{the details of}} that trial, Mr Bly.

6000|$|Olly, {{whose sole}} {{idea of this}} {{instrument}} was of the itinerant barrel variety, yawned slightly, and with a very perceptible lack of interest said that she hoped she would see her some time when she came <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> and was [...] "going 'round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see {{you have}} to go <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> to get to New York,!" [...] said the boy, {{pointing}} with an air of wisdom, [...] "an' if you fellers want to get home real bad, I'll carry you there tomorrow myself in a boat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose," [...] he said, [...] "we {{might be}} able to fix things <b>up</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I should be glad enough to get the paper back again, but Vine is not an easy man to deal with, and he is pleased to call himself my enemy." ...|$|E
2500|$|I have a {{whole book}} filled <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way</b> and the answers are very amusing when {{compared}} with one another.

6000|$|Jenny Wren {{cocked her}} tail <b>up</b> in <b>that</b> saucy <b>way</b> of hers and winked at Johnny Chuck. [...] "The {{way he can}} fly," [...] said she softly.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} to a fictional brand {{is that all}} its specifications can be invented. In this sense, an author can invent a model or brand of car, for which he can make <b>up</b> details. <b>That</b> <b>way,</b> he doesn't have to go look up specifications on a car, which would take time and effort- he could just make them up.|$|R
