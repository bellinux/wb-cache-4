Foliot helped Theobald by forming a communication link to Matilda's side.|$|E
5|$|In 1754, the Stadt Huys was {{the site}} of the Albany Congress; Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania {{presented}} the Albany Plan of Union there. This was the first formal proposal to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> British American colonies. The Plan of Union's original intention was to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> colonies in defense against aggressions of the French to the north; it was not an attempt to become independent from the auspices of the British crown. Although it was never adopted by the British Parliament, it was an important precursor to the United States Constitution. A month prior to the meeting, Franklin published his Join, or Die political cartoon, an infamous graphical representation of the Plan of Union.|$|E

Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by cabin crew over a Â£1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew would strike until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident. In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.|$|E

50|$|Carpathia {{divides the}} world into ten regions: <b>the</b> <b>United</b> North American States, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> European States, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Carpathian States (Middle East; before events in The Indwelling it was called <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Holy Land States), <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Asian States, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> South American States, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Russian States, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Indian States, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Pacific States, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> African States, and <b>the</b> <b>United</b> Great Britain States. This {{partitioning}} eventually comes into play as ten sub-potentates are given control over each region, representing the ten kings prophesized in the Book of Revelation. Each region is assigned a code number, {{which is to be}} the marking used for the loyalty mark system established by Carpathia. (The code is based on a mathematical equation involving three sixes; example: United Carpathian States: 6 x 6 x 6 = 216).|$|R

5|$|After Tiku's death, {{the colonial}} powers hoped {{that he would}} be forgotten, a hope which was not realised; Tandibua' rebelled in 1917, and other local rebellions arose in {{different}} areas of Sulawesi until the Dutch withdrawal following the Japanese occupation. During the occupation, the Japanese forces used Tiku as a symbol of Torajan struggle against colonial aggression, working to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> people against Europeans. However, this was poorly received in conquered areas such as Baruppu' and Sesean, where Tiku was remembered as a man who killed others to steal their wives.|$|E
5|$|Anne's {{second cousin}} George of Hanover (her {{eventual}} successor) visited London {{for three months}} from December 1680, sparking rumours of a potential marriage between them. Historian Edward Gregg dismissed the rumours as ungrounded, as her father was essentially exiled from court, and the Hanoverians planned to marry George to his first cousin Sophia Dorothea of Celle {{as part of a}} scheme to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> Hanoverian inheritance. Other rumours claimed she was courted by Lord Mulgrave (later made Duke of Buckingham), although he denied it. Nevertheless, {{as a result of the}} gossip, he was temporarily dismissed from court.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond {{remained}} a close {{ally of the}} Byzantine Empire. He fought against Mleh, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, assisting in the restoration of Byzantine rule in the Cilician plain. He also made alliances with the Muslim rulers of Aleppo and Damascus against Saladin, who had begun to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> Muslim countries along {{the borders of the}} crusader states. Since Bohemond repudiated his second wife and married an Antiochene lady, Patriarch Aimery excommunicated him in 1180.|$|E
5|$|Bryan {{believed}} that he could, if nominated, <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> disaffected behind a strong silver campaign. However, part of his strategy was to remain inconspicuous until the last possible moment at the convention. He sent letters to national convention delegates, urging them to support silver, and enclosing copies of his photograph, writings, and speeches. Jones points out that though Bryan's speaking engagements were not deemed political {{by the standards of}} 1896, by modern measurements he was far more active in campaigning for the nomination than most of the better-known candidates.|$|E
5|$|By 1877 it {{was clear}} that the {{situation}} had become impractical. After letters were published in The Field deriding the state of affairs it was decided to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> kicking game under one set of laws. By this time the FA Cup had helped the FA gain a dominant position within the game. The FA accepted the Sheffield rule allowing throw-ins to be thrown in any direction, as opposed to right angles only as prevails in rugby lineouts. In return the FA's use of a three-man offside was adopted.|$|E

5|$|Calvin {{provided}} many of {{the foundational}} documents for reformed churches, including documents on the catechism, the liturgy, and church governance. He also produced several confessions of faith in order to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> churches. In 1559, he drafted the French confession of faith, the Gallic Confession, and the synod in Paris accepted it with few changes. The Belgic Confession of 1561, a Dutch confession of faith, was partly based on the Gallic Confession.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, Darwaza {{served as}} Postal Directorate-General of Beirut and {{retained}} this post until 1918. In 1916, while serving with the Ottoman {{army in the}} Sinai Peninsula, he joined the underground al-Fatat organization through Ahmad Qadri, a high-ranking member from Damascus. The aim of al-Fatat was to liberate and <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> Arab lands under Ottoman rule. In {{the wake of the}} Arab Revolt of 1916, Darwaza left the Ottoman civil service to serve in King Faisal's provisional government in Damascus. Ideologically, Darwaza became an Arab nationalist endorsing the concept of a Greater Syrian Arab state.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{asserted}} that the king of Scotland owed him feudal allegiance, and intended to <b>unite</b> <b>the</b> two nations by marrying his son Edward to Margaret, the sole heir of King Alexander III. When Margaret died in 1290, competition for the Scottish crown ensued. By invitation of Scottish magnates, Edward I resolved the dispute, ruling in favour of John Balliol, who duly swore loyalty to him and became king. Edward insisted that he was Scotland's sovereign and possessed the right to hear appeals against Balliol's judgements, undermining Balliol's authority. Balliol allied with France in 1295; Edward invaded Scotland the following year, deposing and exiling Balliol.|$|E

5|$|First {{elected to}} Congress in 1936, Voorhis had {{defeated}} lackluster Republican opposition {{four times in}} the then-rural Los Angeles County district to win re-election.
