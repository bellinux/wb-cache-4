[...] A number of factors, including Prosper's decision {{to set the}} interest rates on all loans (rather than let investors choose the rates they would accept), occurred after Prosper registered with the SEC and began issuing new loan notes in July, 2009. Additionally, after Prosper began setting the rates on all loans itself, Prosper significantly tightened the minimum credit quality necessary for a borrower to receive a Prosper loan. Many borrowers who received loans prior to 2009 (which were priced by investors) would no longer qualify for a loan, at any rate, under Prosper's new <b>underwriting</b> <b>policies.</b>|$|R
50|$|A gap in {{coverage}}, or lapse {{in coverage}} could result from not renewing the E&O coverage {{the same day}} it expires. Several carriers who <b>underwrite</b> <b>policies</b> will not allow professionals to backdate your coverage to your expiration date without a valid explanation (such as, but not limited to: natural disaster or personal medical issue that prevented you from renewing on time) and a signed warranty letter informing the carrier the specific professional is {{not aware of any}} pending claims. For example, with an effective date of 06/01/2010 and coverage expiring on 06/01/2011 and the insured does not renew the coverage on or before 06/01/2011 then the insured may have to enroll with a gap in coverage, resulting in a loss of prior acts coverage such that there is no coverage for any business placed prior to their new effective date. Although some carriers may allow a 30- to 45-day grace period, it is common for them to disallow this.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT:- This paper {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} rainfall and losses in revenue incurred by owners of buildings and property, in fire domestic and industrial insurance classes, during the years 1997 - 2000 and the ensuing claims that insurance companies in Nairobi had to pay. A rainfall derivative was then formulated. The methodologies included correlation, regression analysis, and questionnaire analysis. Results showed that extreme weather events, particularly excessive rainfall, had {{a direct impact on}} the extent of damage on buildings and property. It also became clear that insurance companies did not necessarily consult the meteorologists when <b>underwriting</b> <b>policies</b> and furthermore did not particularly consider that the meteorological information and products issued were relevant or accurate. This information will form the basis for a broader, more detailed study within the interdisciplinary field of Actuarial Science and Meteorology in Kenya, and will aim at creating useful and accurate weather derivatives that can be traded.

40|$|In most {{developed}} countries, {{the insurance}} sector accounts for around {{eight percent of}} the GDP. In Europe alone the insurers liabilities are estimated at around e 900 billion. Every insurance company regularly estimates its liabilities and reports them, in conjunction with statements about capital and assets, to the regulators. The liabilities determine the insurers solvency and also its pricing and investment strategy. The new EU directive, Solvency II, which came into effect {{in the beginning of}} 2016, states that those liabilities should be estimated with ‘realistic assumption’ using ‘relevant actuarial and statistical methods’. However, modern statistics has not found its way in the reserving departments of today’s insurance companies. This thesis attempts to contribute to the connection between the world of mathematical statistics and the reserving practice in general insurance. As part of this thesis, it is in particular shown that today’s reserving practice can be understood as a non-parametric estimation approach in a structured model setting. The forecast of future claims is done without the use of exposure information, i. e., without knowledge about the number of <b>underwritten</b> <b>policies.</b> New statistical estimation techniques and properties are derived which are build from this motivating application...|$|R
40|$|Custom DU ® is an {{automated}} underwriting system that enables mortgage lenders {{to build their}} own business rules that facilitate assessing borrower eligibility for different mortgage products. Developed by Fannie Mae, Custom DU ® has been used since 2004 by several lenders to automate the underwriting of numerous mortgage products. Custom DU ® uses rule specification language techniques and a web-based, user-friendly interface for implementing business rules that represent business policy. Via the user interface, lenders can also customize their underwriting findings reports, test the rules that they have defined and publish changes to business rules on a real-time basis, all without any software modifications. The user interface enforces structure and consistency, enabling business users to focus on their underwriting guidelines when converting their business policy to rules. Once a lender has created their rules, loans are routed to the appropriate rulesets and customized, but consistent results are always returned to the lender. Using Custom DU®, lenders can create different rulesets for their products and assign them to different channels of the business, allowing for centralized control of <b>underwriting</b> <b>policies</b> and procedures – even if lenders have decentralized operations...|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Small Business Administration (SBA) {{played a key role}} in assisting small businesses affected by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks by providing over $ 1 billion in disaster loans to businesses that sustained physical damage or economic injury. Small businesses in the immediate areas of the attacks and others nationwide that suffered related economic injury were eligible to apply for disaster loans. SBA declined or withdrew about half of these loan applications. SBA's disaster loans are direct federal government loans provided at a subsidized interest rate. In response to concerns that more small businesses impacted by September 11 could have benefited from SBA's disaster loans, GAO conducted a review of its Disaster Loan Program. Specifically, GAO addressed the following questions: (1) Are the disaster program policies consistent with the law and the overall mission of SBA's Disaster Loan Program? (2) What were SBA's <b>underwriting</b> <b>policies</b> and criteria for September 11 Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and how did they compare with those applied by nonprofit lenders that were active in New York City after September 11 ?

40|$|This {{study of}} the causes of death among Australian insured lives over the period 1995 - 1999 is based on data {{collected}} by the Institute of Actuaries of Australia as part of its Personal Business Insured Lives Mortality Investigation. A comparison against population experience reveals low insured lives mortality for external causes of death (motor vehicle accidents, suicide and other external causes), cerebrovascular disease, digestive diseases and AIDS. It is clear from the analysis that both male and female insured cancer mortality relative to the population is substantially heavier in 1995 - 1999 than it was in 1990 - 1994, though the actual reason for the change cannot be determined with certainty. There is also the suggestion of a relative worsening in insured male suicide. As expected, there is evidence of selection effects for the non-external causes of death, and of high mortality among policies in the minimum evidence underwriting category. An unexpected finding is that medically <b>underwritten</b> <b>policies</b> experience the same or even slightly heavier mortality than non-medically underwritten policies; however it is possible that these groups have different underlying mortality prior to the underwriting process. Overall female insured mortality is 69 % of that for males - identical to the result for 1990 - 1994 - with relatively light experience for the external causes of death and ischaemic heart disease, and relatively heavy experience for other neoplasms (which includes breast cancer). 72 page(s...|$|R
