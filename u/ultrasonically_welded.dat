40|$|Ultrasonic welding (UW) is {{not only}} a {{well-known}} industrial process but it has also been an active research area. Materials ranging from metals to non-metals e. g. polymers and from virgin materials to non-virgin materials e. g. composites are easily welded using this welding technique. Some research has already been carried out but more thorough analysis is needed on ultrasonic welding of thermoplastics. Two thermoplastics selected for this research are commercially known as Acrylo-nitrile-Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and Polypropylene (PP).

40|$|Ultrasonic welding {{can be used}} to join {{plastic and}} metal through {{high-frequency}} (more than 20 kHz) acoustic vibrations. Aluminium alloy is widely used in electronics, automotive and aerospace. The mechanical vibrations used during ultrasonic metal welding are introduced horizontally. During ultrasonic metal welding, a complex process is triggered involving static forces, oscillating shearing forces and a moderate temperature increase in the welding area. As the energy is introduced to the weld zone, there are three important, phenomena occurring which are surface effect, volume effect and thermal effect. As it is known, microstructure is directly linked to the mechanical properties including fatigue resistance, fatigue life and fracture strength. So the microstructure analysis is important to evaluate the <b>ultrasonically</b> <b>welded</b> aluminium alloy's properties. Also, mechanical properties of metal sheets, such as plastic anisotropy and formability, can be improved by a proper crystallographic texture control. That means the texture has great influence on the plastic anisotropy of the final recrystallized sheets. Optical microscopy (OM) can be used for showing the grain size and grain shape. However, {{to examine the relationship between}} mechanical behaviour and microstructure of the weldment, optical microscopy(OM) is not sufficient. OM cannot delineate a grain structure in the weld zone. The etched surface exhibited granularity at the micron level, but it was not clear if that reflected the grain structure. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in an SEM has become the most widely used technique for determination of microtexture. In this research, high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction is used to study the effects of the vibration on the evolution of microstructure in AA 6061. The orientation image maps (OIM), polar figures (PF), and orientation distribution functions (ODF) of the samples are obtained. The characteristics of the crystallographic orientation, the grain structure and the grain boundary are analysed to find the effect of ultrasonic vibration on the microstructure and texture of the bond. The ultrasonic vibration will lead to exceptional refinement of grains to a micron level along the bond area and affect the crystallographic orientation. The grain size of upper foil is much smaller than that of the lower foil. And ultrasonic vibration results in a very weak texture with some characteristic intensity of a rotated cube-orientation and the Brass-orientation and S-orientation. In the lower foil, there is no much influence of the ultrasonic vibration. So there is very strong cube orientation in the lower foil...|$|E
40|$|Ultrasonic welding {{is a very}} {{promising}} technique for joining thermoplastic composite (TpC) components in aircraft primary structures [1, 2]. The potential introduction of new lightweight structures in civil aviation has been driving the change towards condition-based maintenance (CBM) {{as an alternative to}} the regular inspection interval approach [3]. In turn, CBM has been pushing forward the development of structural health monitoring (SHM) technology capable of reliably assessing the structural integrity of a component during flight or at pre-flight checks. Among all of them, Lamb wave techniques are widely recognised as some of the most promising approaches for SHM of composite structures [4]. Accurate quantitative damage assessment can only be performed if ultrasonic response changes can be unambiguously correlated to specific damages. That correlation requires the distinction of benign features from damaging ones. Therefore, before designing an SHM system for any component it is first necessary to understand the influence of several intrinsic characteristics of the undamaged joints on Lamb wave propagation. In the case of TpC <b>ultrasonically</b> <b>welded</b> (UW) joints, the cross-section is characterised by a very thin (~ 0. 05 mm) polymeric weld-line between the laminated adherends, and a region within the two laminate layers adjacent to the weld-line which is affected by partial fusion of the matrix during the welding process [1, 2]. Although this heat-affected zone does not have a separation surface as the weld-line, it is expected to have different elastic properties to the rest of laminate. Despite several computational and experimental investigations about Lamb-wave-based SHM of different types of composite structures, the interaction of Lamb waves with the unique properties of TpCUW joints has not been addressed yet. This paper presents the first experimental study about the influence of weld quality and adherend edge tapering on the propagation of Lamb waves through TpCUW single-lap joints. The main aim of this research is to understand how the guided wave interactions with the internal structure of TpC ultrasonic welds influence the scattering at a single-lap geometry. The conclusions can later be used to develop a model which will assist the design of a Lamb-wave-based SHM system for a TpC structure. The results from this study are also expected to provide some reverse-engineering insight on different weld qualities, ultimately contributing to the improvement of the manufacturing process of TpCUW joints.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed at developing a very comprehensive system of manufacturing wire splices for automobile wire harnesses. Ultrasonic welding is increasingly being used in various industrial applications. Lack of a scientific data-base of its properties when applied to wire splicing is {{a major reason for}} lack of proper usage by the wiring harness industry and its subsequent acceptance by the end user. This thesis presents various experiments conducted to develop tensile strengths and electrical resistances of various types of <b>ultrasonically</b> <b>welded</b> wire splices. Crimping technology was evaluated for its mechanical strengths and electrical properties by conducting various experiments {{to make it possible for}} the industry to compare it with other alternative splicing technologies. The results are then compared with ultrasonic welding. The next stage of this thesis discusses the economic feasibility of ultrasonic wire splicing. In order to find the number of ultrasonic welding machines required to meet a particular level of demand, which is a prerequisite for establishing the economic feasibility, a virtual model of the process and the manufacturing cell has been prepared and this model was used to study the dynamics of demand and the number of required machines. Simulation in manufacturing-problem-solving is being used very widely by researchers. Proper understanding and visualisation of the future of the factory and understanding and answering various questions related to the adoption of new technology, is another major reason why companies shy away from adopting ultrasonic welding systems. An advanced simulation tool namely QUEST was used to model the wire splice manufacturing cell of Alcatel and simulation studies were conducted to foresee how the production dynamics would be if ultrasonic welding machines were incorporated in place of crimping machines and various what if scenarios were developed and some vital production related questions were answered. Material handling is a major bottleneck in any wiring harness manufacturing environment. Some conceptual designs are presented on automating the task of feeding wires to ultrasonic welding machines and transferring the wire assemblies from welding stations to different work stations, currently being done manually. A wire palletising system was designed to improve the productivity.

40|$|We {{conducted}} a design study {{to compare the}} manufacturing costs {{at a level of}} 100, 000 hybrid vehicle batteries per year for flexible package (Flex) cells and for rigid aluminum container (Rigid) cells. Initially, the Rigid cells were considered to have welded closures and to be deep-drawn containers of about the same shape as the Flex cells. As the study progressed, the method of fabricating and sealing the Rigid cells was expanded to include lower cost options including double seaming and other mechanically fastened closures with polymer sealants. Both types of batteries were designed with positive electrodes containing Li(Ni{sub 1 / 3 }Co{sub 1 / 3 }Mn{sub 1 / 3 }) O{sub 2 } and graphite negative electrodes. The use of a different combination of lithium-ion electrodes would have little effect on the difference in costs for the two types of cells. We found that 20 -Ah cells could be designed with excellent performance and heat rejection capabilities for either type of cell. Many parts {{in the design of the}} Flex cells are identical or nearly identical to those of the Rigid Cell, so for these features there would be no difference in the cost of manufacturing the two types of batteries. We judged the performance, size and weight of the batteries to be sufficiently similar that the batteries would have the same value for their application. Some of the design features of the Flex cells were markedly different than those of the deep-drawn and welded Rigid cells and would result in significant cost savings. Fabrication and processing steps for which the Flex cells appear to have a cost advantage over these Rigid cells are (1) container fabrication and sealing, (2) terminal fabrication and sealing, and (3) intercell connections. The costs of providing cooling channels adjacent to the cells and for module and battery hardware appear to favor Rigid cell batteries slightly. Overall, Flex cell batteries appear to have an advantage of about $ 1. 20 -$ 3. 70 per cell for a 25 -kW Battery of 20 cells or about $ 24 to $ 74 per battery. Container experts assisted with this study, including a paid consultant and personnel at container manufacturing companies. Some of the companies are considering entering the business of manufacturing containers for hybrid vehicle battery manufacturers. For this reason they provided valuable guidance on overall approaches to reducing the costs of the cell containers. They have retained the description of some specific designs and procedures for future possible work with battery manufacturers, with whom they are now in contact. Through the guidance of these experts, we determined that a new type of container could be manufactured that would have the best features of performance and low cost of both the Rigid and Flex containers. For instance, the aluminum layer in a tri-layer sheet can be sufficiently thick to form a rigid container that can be fabricated in two halves, much like a Flex container, and mechanically joined at the edges for strength. In addition to the mechanical joint, this container can be sealed at the edges, much like a Flex container, by means of an inner polymer liner that can be heat-sealed or <b>ultrasonically</b> <b>welded.</b> The terminals can be flat strips of metal sealed into the top of the container as part of the edge sealing of the container, as for the Flex cell. Ridges can be stamped into one side of the container to provide cooling channels and the exterior layer of the container stock can be coated with a thin, electrically insulating, polymer layer. We expect this type of container will provide excellent sealing and durability and be less expensive than either the Flex or the Rigid container, which the study initially considered. A major cost for the original Rigid container is the welding required for sealing the container. However, the welding of the current collector tabs to the terminal piece may be even more complex and costly than welding the container. It is important, therefore, to develop an inexpensive procedure for attachment of the foils to the terminal pieces. A lower-cost procedure, such as ultrasonic welding or mechanical clipping, might replace laser welding of the foils to the terminal pieces. A conclusion from our discussions with the container experts is that the manufacturing rate required for the containers for hybrid vehicle batteries is fairly low, and thus favors procedures requiring low tooling costs and little development effort. These conditions favor flexible packaging, heat sealing, shallow stamping, double seaming and ultrasonic welding. It works against deep drawing and untested procedures for welding and joining...|$|E
