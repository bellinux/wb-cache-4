Although this number seems relatively small, the amount of streams on the Internet is growing rapidly. Regular servers on the Internet cannot handle the stress induced by all the requests for high-quality streaming media and so a new form of delivery must be developed to deal with the growing demand.

40|$|Abstract. Many systems {{exist for}} {{community}} formation in extensions of traditional Web environments but little {{work has been}} done for forming and maintaining communities in the more dynamic environments emerging from ad hoc and peer-to-peer networks. This paper proposes an approach for forming and evolving peer communities based on the sharing of choreography specifications (Interaction Models (IMs)). Two mechanisms for discovering IMs and collaborative peers are presented based on a meta-search engine and a dynamic peer grouping algorithm respectively. OKBook, a system allowing peers to publish, discover and subscribe or <b>unsubscribe</b> <b>to</b> IMs, has been implemented in accordance with our approach. For the meta-search engine, a strategy for integrating and re-ranking search results obtained from Semantic Web search engines is also described. This allows peers to discover IMs from their group members, thus reducing the burden on the meta-search engine. Our approach complies with principles of Linked Data and is capable of both contributing to and benefiting from the Web of data. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCurrent publish/subscribe systems provide {{very limited}} support to modify {{subscriptions}} dynamically. Consequently, they cannot efficiently control {{the flow of}} events between publishers and subscribers, which may lead to unnecessary network traffic. In addition, {{it is not possible}} to automatically subscribe or <b>unsubscribe</b> <b>to</b> a service depending on certain context of use. This implies for developers to manually manage subscriptions (e. g., taking care of when to cancel or re-issue a subscription), which may result in inappropriate subscription states (e. g., subscriptions that are cancelled too late). In this paper, we propose the concept of dynamic subscription mechanisms that improves the expressiveness and flexibility of subscriptions. We introduce a new dimension to a subscription that allows a subscriber to express the flow of matched events, and when a new subscription can be (re) issued. We validate our claims for improved flexibility and expressiveness by providing language abstractions and a prototype implementation of a dynamic subscription mechanism framework called Flexub that supports a variation of subscription mechanisms. When compared to existing subscription models, our experiment results show that the support for dynamic subscription mechanisms greatly reduces network traffic of events sent from publishers to the subscribers. In addition, our approach reduces the workload on the subscriber side...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Using {{multicast}} {{for serving}} popular movies on de-mand reduces {{load on the}} server and the network by eliminat-ing redundant packet transmission. To permit clients to arrive at times of their choosing, periodic rebroadcast is necessary. In addi-tion, splitting the transmission over multiple multicast groups re-duces the cost of rebroadcasting by allowing clients <b>to</b> <b>unsubscribe</b> from groups {{in which they are}} no longer interested. The focus {{of this paper is to}} develop techniques for efficient Media-on-Demand delivery to asynchronous clients over multiple multicast groups. We start by describing an existing periodic mul-ticast technique that is near-optimal in terms of server bandwidth. Given a small number of groups, we then show how to distribute content over these groups in a way that minimizes network im-pact. We present a theoretical analysis of the performance gains and compare these predictions with simulations over real and gen-erated network topologies. We find that using even a small num-ber of multicast groups provides significant reduction in overall network bandwidth. I...|$|R
