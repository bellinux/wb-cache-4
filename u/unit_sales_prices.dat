40|$|Abstract. This paper models the {{emergence}} of retail clusters on a supply chain network comprised of suppliers, retailers, and consumers. Firstly, an agent-based model is proposed to investigate retail location distribution in a market of two complementary goods. The methodology controls for supplier locales and <b>unit</b> <b>sales</b> <b>prices</b> of retailers and suppli-ers, and a consumer’s willingness to patronize a retailer depends on the total travel distance of buying both goods. On a circle comprised of dis-crete locations, retailers play a non-cooperative game of location choice to maximize individual profits. Our {{findings suggest that the}} probabil-ity distribution of the number of clusters in equilibrium follows power law and that hierarchical distribution patterns {{are much more likely to}} occur than the spread-out ones. In addition, retailers of complementary goods tend to co-locate at supplier locales. Sensitivity tests on the num-ber of retailers are also performed. Secondly, based on the County Busi-ness Patterns (CBP) data of Minneapolis-St. Paul from US Census 2000 database, we find that the number of clothing stores and the distribution of food stores at the zip code level follows power-law distribution...|$|E
40|$|Introduction {{and study}} objectives: To {{describe}} {{the development of}} biosimilars in 24 European Union (EU) Member States, plus Norway and Switzerland, and to identify the key parameters associated with biosimilars market dynamics across EU Member States. Methods: A quantitative analysis of the EU biosimilar market from 2007 to 2010 was conducted. Data {{were obtained from the}} EMA and the IMS MIDAS database, which include for each EU Member States: date of market entry of all biosimilars authorized by EMA up to 31 December 2010 and their respective reference products, <b>unit</b> <b>sales,</b> <b>prices</b> and market value of existing biosimilars and their respective reference products. The variables used to characterize market dynamics were: 1) time period between EMA’s approval and market entry; 2) market share; 3) market exclusivity period. The analysis also explores whether country differences in the former variables is associated with characteristics such as pharmaceutical policies applied, demographics and economic factors. Results: The market share of biosimilars for the three reference molecules (somatropin, epoietin and filgrastim) rose from 0. 33 % (2007) to 15. 52 % (2010). Faster biosimilar launches were explained by generic price control policy, countries’ gross national income and expenditure on health, pharmacists’ generic substitution and medicines’ price level index. Conclusion: Biosimilars may help lower the cost of biological medicines. Existing EU evidence is still limited and results show no clear pattern of market dynamics, although it is likely that biosimilars will result in smaller price reductions and lower market share than conventional generics...|$|E

40|$|Ever since Clayton Christensen's 1997 book "The Innovator's Dilemma" on {{disruptive}} innovations, {{the theory}} has received considerable scholarly {{as well as}} business management attention, with some even calling it "groundbreaking". Its key premise - that entrant companies with products of inferior performance can displace established companies - {{continues to be a}} prominent subject of management and innovation research. Like any trailblazing theory, it has also stirred criticism and aroused alternative explanations, contributing to its ongoing evolution. There nevertheless exists a considerable amount of concrete examples in the literature of various products, companies and industries where an entrant company or product did indeed disrupt the established actors. Christensen (2000) found that such disruptive innovations tend to be smaller, simpler, cheaper, more reliable and convenient that established or preceding products, and still based on existing technologies. These characteristics bring us to view the recent proliferation of personal 3 D printers in a new light. Recent media attention has led some authors - and popular media - to consider 3 D printing as a new disruptive technology, even though the technology has existed for a good quarter of a century. Also, disruption is a relative phenomenon, meaning that there must be an established product to disrupt. However, the recent expiry of certain patents and the birth of an open-source 3 D printer project have led to the advent of a class of considerably low-priced, consumer-grade 3 D printers. These seem to fit Christensen's (2000) characteristics of a typical disruptive innovation remarkably well, yet the notion of personal 3 D printers as a potential disruptive innovation doesn't seem to have been researched in any detail and thus the knowledge on the phenomenon is scattered. The purpose of this case study is to study the proliferation of personal printers in detail and address whether they can indeed be considered a disruptive innovation. This entails studying e. g. the factors leading to their advent, the differences between the personal printers and entry-level industrial ones, business models, <b>unit</b> <b>sales,</b> <b>prices,</b> market shares and industry revenue. Based on Christensen's (2000) suggestion, also the development of personal 3 D printers' performance over time is charted and compared to entry-level industrial printers as well as assumed performance demands of the market. My results indicate that personal 3 D printers meet the general criteria for a (new-market) disruptive innovation, yet their proliferation has occurred in a fashion that doesn't cause immediate consequences for individual incumbent companies, even though the total 3 D printer market has no doubt been disrupted by the new product and new entrants. The case supports the view of significant market expansion {{as a result of a}} disruptive innovation's entry...|$|E

40|$|A {{dynamic model}} of the product {{lifecycle}} of (nearly) homogeneous durables in polypoly markets is established. It describes the concurrent evolution of the <b>unit</b> <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> of durable goods. The theory {{is based on the}} idea that the sales dynamics is determined by a meeting process of demanded with supplied product units. Taking advantage from the Bass model for first purchase and a logistic model for repurchase the entire product lifecycle of a durable can be established. For the case of a fast growing supply the model suggests that the mean price of the good decreases according to a logistic law. Both, the established <b>unit</b> <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> evolution are in agreement with the empirical data studied in this paper. The presented approach discusses further the interference of the diffusion process with the supply dynamics. The model predicts the occurrence of lost sales in the initial stages of the lifecycle due to supply constraints. They are the origin for a retarded market penetration. The theory suggests that the imitation rate B indicating social contagion in the Bass model has its maximum magnitude for the case of a large amount of available units at introduction and a fast output increase. The empirical data of the investigated samples are in qualitative agreement with this prediction...|$|R
40|$|This work {{provides}} a simulation-based approach of assessing {{the risk and}} uncertainty involved in estimating the expected earnings of an organization. The procedure involves using Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) in creating various possible outcomes and scenarios. The MCS {{is found to be}} more effective than single point estimates or guesswork. Hence, it is an efficient and useful tool in risk management analysis. The analysis of the output of the simulation reveals that the expected earnings is a little bit lower than the most likely forecasted value of N 30 m but there is 37 % chance that the expected earnings might drop below or rise above the estimated value by margin of N 10. 9 m and the wide range of possible outcomes make the venture to be very risky as uncertainties in <b>unit</b> <b>sales,</b> <b>unit</b> <b>price</b> or variable cost can push the earnings to assume any value within the wide range. It is also observed that a large increase in the <b>unit</b> <b>sales</b> and a moderate increase in the unit price will increase the expected revenue which will in turn increase the earnings. The regression analysis gives almost the same result as MCS...|$|R
40|$|A new microeconomic {{model is}} {{presented}} that aims at {{a description of}} the long-term <b>unit</b> <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> evolution of homogeneous non-durable goods in polypoly markets. It merges the product lifecycle approach with the price dispersion dynamics of homogeneous goods. The model predicts a minimum critical lifetime of non-durables in order to survive. Under the condition that the supply side of the market evolves much faster than the demand side the theory suggests that unsatisfied demands are present in the first stages of the lifecycle. With the growth of production capacities these demands disappear accompanied with a logistic decrease of the mean price of the good. The model is applied to electricity as a non-durable satisfying the model condition. The presented theory allows {{a deeper understanding of the}} <b>sales</b> and <b>price</b> dynamics of non-durables...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{contribute}} to the dynamic pricing literature by developing a finite horizon model for two firms offering substitutable and nonperishable products with different quality levels. Customers can purchase and store the products, {{even if they do}} not need them at the time, in order to use them in future. The stockpile of the products generated by customers affects the demand in future periods. Therefore, the demand for each product not only is a function of prices and quality levels, but also of the products' stockpile levels. In addition, the stockpile levels change the customers' consumption behavior; more product in a stockpile leads to more consumption. Therefore, we address not only the price and demand relationship but also the stockpiling and consumption relationship in a competitive environment. The decision variable of each firm {{at the beginning of each}} period is its <b>unit</b> <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> We use a deterministic dynamic program to calculate the equilibrium prices at the beginning of each period. By assuming that the market stockpile is public information, we show the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium. We next consider the case when the firms do not know the market stockpile. We then develop appropriate heuristics to calculate the optimal prices in each case. A numerical study is also provided to calculate the price levels in different scenarios and compare their performances. Pricing Revenue management Game theory Discrete choice model...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{advances}} in research and management practice {{in the area of}} pricing, and particularly in dynamic pricing and revenue management. At the same time, researchers and managers have made dramatic improvements in operations and supply chain management. The interactions between pricing and operations/supply chain performance, however, are not as well understood. In this paper, we examine this linkage by developing a deterministic, finite-horizon dynamic programming model that captures a price/demand effect as well as a stockpiling/consumption effect – price and market stockpile influence demand, demand influences consumption, and consumption influences the market stockpile. The decision variable is the <b>unit</b> <b>sales</b> <b>price</b> in each period. Through the market stockpile, pricing decisions in a given period explicitly depend on decisions in prior periods. Traditional operations models typically assume exogenous demand, thereby ignoring some of the market dynamics. Herein, we model endogenous demand, and we develop analytical insights into the nature of optimal prices and promotions. We develop conditions under which the optimal prices converge to a constant. In other words, price promotion is suboptimal. We also analytically and numerically illustrate cases where the optimal prices vary over time. In particular, we show that price dynamics may be driven by both (a) revenue effects, due to nonlinear market responses to prices and/or inventory, and (b) cost effects, due to economies of scale in operations. The paper concludes with a discussion of directions for future research...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model for}} designing the pricing and return-credit strategy for a monopolistic manufacturer of single-period commodities. That is, given the unit manufacturing cost and the <b>unit</b> retail <b>sale</b> <b>price,</b> the manufacturer determines: (i) the unit price C to be charged against the retailer; and (ii) the unit credit V {{to be given to}} the retailer for units returned. While the manufacturer is allowed to set C and V, the order quantity Q is set by the retailer in response to the manufacturer's C and V. Among the unexpected findings derived from our model are: (i) unless an external force supports the retailer, otherwise the manufacturer can usually design a (C, V) -scheme that gives himself the lion's share of the profit; (ii) depending on the risk attitudes of the manufacturer and the retailer, the optimal return policy can range from 'no returns allowed' to 'unlimited returns with full credit'; (iii) instead of losing his profit share to the retailer, a return-credits agreement can often be manipulated by a shrewd manufacturer to increase his profit. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Water {{production}} {{functions are}} used to model yield response to various levels of supplemental irrigation (SI), to assess water productivity coefficients, and to identify optimum irrigation under various input-output price scenarios. The SI production function is taken as {{the difference between the}} total water production function (irrigation + rain) and that of rainwater. Theoretical analysis of the unconstrained objective function shows that the seasonal depth of SI to maximize profit occurs when the marginal product of water equals the ratio of unit water cost to <b>unit</b> product <b>sale</b> <b>price.</b> Applying this analysis to wheat in northern Syria, the production functions of SI under different rainfall conditions are developed. Coupled with current and projected water costs and wheat <b>sale</b> <b>prices,</b> the functions {{are used to}} develop an easy-to-use chart for determining seasonal irrigation rates to maximize profit under a range of seasonal rainfall amounts. Results show that, for a given seasonal rainfall, there is a critical value for the ratio of irrigation cost to production price beyond which SI becomes less profitable than rainfed production. Higher product prices and lower irrigation costs encourage the use of more water. Policies supporting high wheat prices and low irrigation costs encourage maximizing yields but with low water productivity. The resulting farmer practice threatens the sustainability of water resources. Balancing profitability versus sustainability is a challenge for policy makers. Our analysis can help national and local water authorities and policy makers determine appropriate policies for water valuation and allocation; and assist extension services and farmers in planning irrigation infrastructure and farm water management.
