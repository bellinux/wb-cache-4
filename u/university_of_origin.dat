The tasseled cap originated at the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, where it was first introduced in 1879, and is influenced by the Norwegian student cap, the duskelue, which from 1856 had a tassel; during the period of the Swedish-Norwegian union (until 1905) a large number of Norwegian students studied at Chalmers. It later spread to the Royal Institute of Technology and the other Swedish engineering schools.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Postgraduate Hospital Education Environment Measure (PHEEM) questionnaire, is a {{valid and}} {{reliable}} instrument to measure the educational environment (EE) in postgraduate medical education. Aim: To evaluate the EE perceived by the residents of a postgraduate training program using the PHEEM. Material and Methods: The PHEEM was applied in 2010 - 2011 in 35 specialty programs. We calculated their individual results and compared means of both global and individual domain scores of the PHEEM, by gender, <b>university</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and nationality. Cronbach's alpha coefficients and D study (Generalizability theory) were performed for reliability. Results: Three hundred eighteen residents were surveyed (75. 7 % of the total universe). The mean score of the PHEEM was 105. 09 ± 22. 46 (65. 7 % of the maximal score) which is considered a positive EE. The instrument is highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0. 934). The D study found that 15 subjects are required to obtain reliable results (G coefficient = 0. 813). There {{were no significant differences}} between gender and <b>university</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Foreigners evaluated better the EE than Chileans and racism was not perceived. The programs showed a safe physical environment and teachers with good clinical skills. The negative aspects perceived were a lack of information about working hours, insufficient academic counseling, and scanty time left for extracurricular activities. Conclusions: This questionnaire allowed us to identify positive aspects of the EE, and areas to be improved in the specialty programs. The PHEEM is a useful instrument to evaluate the EE in Spanish-speaking participants of medical specialty programs...|$|E

Using a data set of individual labor disputes brought to French courts over the years 1996 to 2003, we examine the impact of labor court activity on labor market flows. First, we present a simple theoretical model showing the links between judicial costs and judicial case outcomes. Second, we exploit our model as well as the French institutional setting to generate instruments for these endogenous outcomes. In particular, we use shocks in the supply of lawyers who resettle close to their <b>university</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> Using these instruments, we show that labor court decisions have a causal effect on labor flows. More trials and more cases won by the workers cause more job destructions. More settlements, higher filing rates, and a larger fraction of workers represented by a lawyer dampen job destructions.

40|$|This paper takes a {{regional}} studies approach {{to assess the}} efficiency of technology-based spin-offs that benefited from financial and infrastructure aid. It does so by following the objectives of institutions for regional support and provides evidence on spin-offs created within the special case of a technology transfer network placed at Catalan universities. We contribute to the literature {{in at least two}} ways. First, we detect and conceptualise the specific regional objectives and the associated inputs and outputs needed to assess firms created at university-based support units. Second, an application provides empirical insights into regional mechanisms for firm creation. Results indicate that many efficient spin-offs have formal technology transfer agreements and emerge from universities with more technological background. Second stage analyses show that higher levels of innovation and specific academic knowledge or experience related with the <b>university</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> are associated with higher efficiency.

Furthermore the pattern of migration to the Netherlands showed that most immigrants come from the United States and United Kingdom; move to a university in the city of Amsterdam; and work in the research areas Nature; Law; or Language and Culture.

40|$|O presente relatório foi elaborado na sequência do estágio realizado na Divisão de Relações Externas do Núcleo de Cooperação Internacional da Faculdade de Letras da Universidade de Lisboa, o qual incidiu sobre a Internacionalização do Ensino Superior em Portugal através dos programas Europeus de Mobilidade. Este trabalho tem como objetivo efetuar uma análise dos estudantes Erasmus recebidos nos últimos cinco anos (2010 / 11 a 2014 / 15) na FLUL (Faculdade de Letras da Universidade de Lisboa), sendo este o programa que mais alunos internacionais traz à Faculdade. Esta análise nos permitirá, conhecer melhor o volume de estudantes, universidade de origem, áreas, duração da estadia, entre outros aspetos. O conhecimento acerca dos alunos não estaria completo sem a aplicação de um inquérito, onde se pretende perceber as razões para a escolha desta instituição de acolhimento e o porquê de terem escolhido Portugal e principalmente Lisboa como o seu destino de Erasmus, como descrevem a sua experiência Erasmus, saber as dificuldades e os desafios encontrados no acolhimento e integração na vida académica da Universidade de Lisboa depois de finalizarem a mobilidade, mencionando se voltariam a Portugal e quais os motivos. O relatório é constituído por quatro capítulos. Primeiramente, será feita uma contextualização a nível mundial, seguindo-se no capítulo dois a contextualização na Europa, no sentido de compreender quais as estratégias utilizadas, os obstáculos encontrados e os desafios que o Ensino Superior tem ultrapassado ao longo das últimas décadas. O capítulo três debruça-se sobre a internacionalização do ensino {{superior}} português que tem vindo a atrair um número crescente de estudantes estrangeiros, muitos dos quais usufruindo de bolsas financiadas por programas europeus de mobilidade.

This work aims to analyze the Erasmus students received {{in the last five}} years (2010 / 11 to 2014 / 15) at the Faculty of Letters in the University of Lisbon, which is the program that brings most international students to the Faculty. This analysis will allow us to understand better the volume of students, <b>university</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin,</b> areas, length of stay, and other aspects. The information about the students would not be complete without using a questionnaire, that serves to understand the reasons for choosing this host institution and why they have chosen Portugal and mainly Lisbon as their Erasmus destination.

The report consists of four chapters. Firstly, a contextualization will be carried out at world level, followed by the European contextualization in chapter two, in order to understand what strategies have been used, the obstacles encountered and the challenges that the Higher Education has exceeded in the last decades. This is followed by chapter three on the internationalization of Portuguese higher education, which has increasingly attracted a growing number of foreign students, many of whom have been awarded scholarships funded by European mobility programs.

This paper explores how collaboration merges and what the cultural impediments or challenges are. To do so we analysed how a network in the field of eBusiness research developed over time in the context of a specific EU-funded project and how cultural attributes and preferences for information exchange and media-preferences affect the networks. Based on Social Network Analyses making use of data collected on two moments in time, at the start of the project and after two years, we will not only give a description of the network but also explore how this network is affected by cultural and media preferences of members of the network. The results indicate that the network has expanded and became denser.
