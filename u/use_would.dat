5|$|Cooper {{had said}} that he thought of King Kong after he had a dream that a giant gorilla was terrorizing New York City. When he woke, he {{recorded}} the idea and used it for the film. He {{was going to have}} a giant gorilla fight a Komodo dragon or other animal, but found that the technique of interlacing that he wanted to <b>use</b> <b>would</b> not provide realistic results.|$|E
5|$|Hospital Based Service – Hospitals {{may provide}} their own {{ambulance}} {{service as a}} service to the community, or where ambulance care is unreliable or chargeable. Their <b>use</b> <b>would</b> be dependent on using the services of the providing hospital.|$|E
5|$|In April 1885, the Cosmos Club {{considered}} {{purchasing the}} house from the Tayloe family. The influential club already owned most of the block north of the Tayloe House, and was expanding rapidly. It valued the home at $60,000 and the furnishings at an additional $5,000. The Cosmos Club declined to buy the home after an investigation found {{that the cost of}} upgrading the Tayloe property for its <b>use</b> <b>would</b> be too costly.|$|E
5000|$|The {{iron and}} steel <b>used</b> <b>would</b> allow for the {{construction}} of 380 Eiffel Towers.|$|R
50|$|In {{classical}} cryptography, {{the running}} key cipher {{is a type}} of polyalphabetic substitution cipher in which a text, typically from a book, is used to provide a very long keystream. Usually, the book to be <b>used</b> <b>would</b> be agreed ahead of time, while the passage to be <b>used</b> <b>would</b> be chosen randomly for each message and secretly indicated somewhere in the message.|$|R
5000|$|For a {{lymphoma}} or leukemia screening {{the technique}} <b>used</b> <b>would</b> be {{a bone marrow}} biopsy.|$|R
5|$|In the 23 February 1859 {{edition of}} the Deseret News, the editors {{announced}} their approval of the two new letters and eventual intention to use them in the newsletter. However, due to the hot metal typesetting technology in use at the time, casting the new letters for <b>use</b> <b>would</b> have been a considerable expense, so it was never realized.|$|E
5|$|Interferometers {{are used}} in {{atmospheric}} physics for high-precision measurements of trace gases via remote sounding of the atmosphere. There are several examples of interferometers that utilize either absorption or emission features of trace gases. A typical <b>use</b> <b>would</b> be in continual monitoring of the column concentration of trace gases such as ozone and carbon monoxide above the instrument.|$|E
5|$|The DVD release {{included}} a behind-the-scenes featurette, film audio commentary from Mendes and Ball, and a storyboard presentation with discussion from Mendes and Hall. In the film commentary, Mendes refers to deleted scenes {{he intended to}} include in the release. However, these scenes are not on the DVD, as he changed his mind after recording the commentary; Mendes felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to <b>use</b> <b>would</b> detract from the film's integrity.|$|E
2500|$|The DMCRA of 2003 {{included}} {{a section of}} fair use amendments, including amendments to the exemptions described by Section 1201(c) of Title 17. [...] The bill exempted research into “technological measures” from infringement and enabled consumers to circumvent DRM, and qualified that using services for noninfringing <b>uses</b> <b>would</b> not be a violation. [...] The bill also explicitly stated that manufacturing and distributing hardware or software capable of noninfringing <b>uses</b> <b>would</b> likewise not be a violation.|$|R
50|$|It {{was decided}} that the {{excursions}} for which she was <b>used</b> <b>would</b> instead be undertaken by a chartered vessel, the St Seiriol.|$|R
5000|$|The tower <b>used</b> <b>would</b> {{often be}} a church tower, but the tower or balcony of a civic {{building}} {{might also be}} used.|$|R
5|$|The {{last two}} {{conditions}} {{were the most}} controversial, though after {{one and a half}} years, a compromise was reached: only buildings actually in <b>use</b> <b>would</b> be repaired, and pensions would be paid, but only when the officers actually retired. The British authorities authorised minimal repairs, to be made as cheaply as possible. The transfer was intended to be completed by the end of 1885, but was not finalised until 31 March 1886.|$|E
5|$|Fleury {{continued}} to battle {{drug and alcohol}} addictions, revealing in a November 2004 interview {{that he had not}} overcome the problems that ended his NHL career {{a year and a half}} earlier. He credits his second wife, Jennifer, with turning his life around after they met when he was playing for Horse Lake in 2005. Fleury feared that Jennifer's frustration with his drug <b>use</b> <b>would</b> cost him the relationship, and, with her help, quit drugs and drinking on September 18, 2005. They were married one year later and have a daughter, Skylah. Fleury also has a son and daughter, Beaux and Tatym, from his relationship with his first wife, Veronica, and a son, Josh, born in 1987 to his high school girlfriend, Shannon.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, Shawangunk, Montgomery and the Walden began {{applying}} for over $600,000 in TEA-21 grants {{to create a}} paved, Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA)-accessible trail between Walden and Wallkill. The total cost of paving the trail {{was expected to be}} $750,000, though it eventually ballooned to $1.5 million. The decision to pave the trail was vehemently opposed by horseback riders who felt it would endanger them, and protested at several public meetings by the Mid-Hudson Horse Trails Association. The decision was also opposed by nearby homeowners who believed an increase in trail <b>use</b> <b>would</b> threaten their privacy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} {{describe}} {{uses of the}} verb “esperar” in the Portuguese language, by assuming {{the hypothesis that the}} new grammaticalized <b>uses</b> <b>would</b> reveal an increasing way of (inter) subjectification. And it also assumes that this process would be related to the emergence of possible constructional patterns. In order to prove these hypotheses, we also accomplished a synchronic and diachronic survey that tried to demonstrate which <b>uses</b> <b>would</b> be earlier and [- (inter) subjective]. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Schools use {{a domain}} name that reflect their locale, and these {{state-based}} third-level domains are managed independently by the states. For example, {{a school in}} Western Australia would register schoolname.wa.edu.au. Similarly, replacing the bold part of these domains, Victoria <b>would</b> <b>use</b> [...]vic, Queensland <b>would</b> <b>use</b> [...]qld, South Australia <b>would</b> <b>use</b> [...]sa, Tasmania <b>would</b> <b>use</b> [...]tas, Northern Territory <b>would</b> <b>use</b> [...]nt and the Australian Capital Territory <b>would</b> <b>use</b> [...]act. However, after a change of internet services in Queensland State Schools their domain names were changed from schoolname.qld.edu.au to schoolname.eq.edu.au. This {{is not the case}} for private schools in Queensland. Often, domains can even contain a fourth level: for instance, a NSW public school might have the domain schoolname.schools.nsw.edu.au.|$|R
5000|$|The conditional, or [...] "future-in-the-past", {{forms are}} made analogously to these future forms, <b>using</b> <b>would</b> (and should) {{in place of}} will (and shall).|$|R
5|$|The {{concept of}} Sarah-Jane and K9 {{returning}} to Doctor Who was {{an idea of}} Russell T Davies from pitching the show in 2003. Such a <b>use</b> <b>would</b> show what would happen after a companion left the Doctor, without dwelling {{too much on the}} classic series. It was Davies' full intention for Sarah Jane to be used for this, and while Sladen originally declined a request, thinking her role would not be important, she changed her mind when she realised she would be {{the focal point of the}} adventure. After production of the episode was finished, Sladen was approached about a full spin-off series, The Sarah Jane Adventures, which was formally announced on 14 September 2006.|$|E
5|$|Theo Osterkamp {{pointed to}} the massed {{formations}} used by the British (Big Wing), and put their use down to the ineffectiveness of the 15 September raids. Göring was delighted {{with the news that}} the British were committing mass formations to battle. The Big Wing's <b>use</b> <b>would</b> allow the German fighters to engage and destroy RAF fighters in large numbers. However, the Germans had not realised this stratagem was by no means the uniform strategy in Fighter Command. Nevertheless, the OKL were still confident of victory. It blamed the bad weather and RAF's last-minute change of strategy for prolonging summer operations. Still, the Luftwaffe bomber crews were ordered to prepare winter quarters. The campaign turned to London for the duration of 1940. It would witness some large-scale daylight air battles, but it gradually turned to a campaign by night. It would become known as The Blitz.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument <b>use</b> <b>would</b> fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Stan Lee {{returned}} to writing the Bullpen Bulletins column. He would answer fan questions, and anyone whose question was <b>used</b> <b>would</b> receive a physical No-Prize.|$|R
25|$|In the December 2006 Pre-Budget Report the {{government}} announced that the sale of surplus electricity from installations designed for personal <b>use,</b> <b>would</b> {{not be subject to}} Income Tax. Legislation to this effect has been included in the Finance Bill 2007.|$|E
25|$|A {{merchant}} submarine {{is a type}} of submarine {{intended for}} trade, and being without armaments, it is not considered a warship like most other types of submarines. The intended <b>use</b> <b>would</b> be blockade running, or to dive under Arctic ice.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, then Climate Change Minister David Parker, Labour party, {{announced}} a similar {{proposal to the}} one in Australia, except that importation for personal <b>use</b> <b>would</b> have been allowed. However, this proposal was scrapped by the new government in December 2008.|$|E

50|$|The {{variation}} <b>used</b> <b>would</b> {{depend on}} the loading patterns, unit load parameters, and desired maneuverability of the slip sheet/unit load. Normally, {{the thickness of the}} slip sheet is less than 0.5 inches.|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{convert to}} other uses the goods of the Church,--to {{convert them to}} profane <b>uses</b> <b>would,</b> I need not say, be a sacrilege as horrible to Heaven as {{impossible}} to so pious a monarch--" ...|$|R
25|$|In {{view of the}} {{progressive}} tightening of the Building Regulations' requirements for energy efficiency since the 1970s (see the history section below), it might be expected that a significant cut in domestic energy <b>use</b> <b>would</b> have occurred, however this {{has not yet been}} the case.|$|E
25|$|While {{the use of}} the Cyrillic {{alphabet}} {{would strengthen}} ties with the U.S.S.R., the Latin alphabet is familiar to most Russian students, and its <b>use</b> <b>would</b> strengthen the ties between China and many of its Southeast Asian neighbours who are already familiar with the Latin alphabet.|$|E
25|$|The cypselas contain almost 7% {{oleic acid}} and 12½% {{linoleic}} acid, making the oil comparable to soybean, corn, sunflower and sesame oils. Commercial <b>use</b> <b>would</b> {{be dependent on}} plant breeding to improve crop yield, suitability for harvesting and for food processing, such as selection of spineless plants.|$|E
50|$|Another {{essential}} condition is use of water. A baptism {{in which some}} liquid that would not usually be called water, such as wine, milk, soup or fruit juice was <b>used</b> <b>would</b> not be considered valid.|$|R
50|$|The {{courts are}} {{supposed}} to be moved to new buildings on Adickesallee in Nordend in the forthcoming years, the character of the courts quarter would therefore completely change and new <b>uses</b> <b>would</b> be found for the area.|$|R
5000|$|Various {{compound}} constructions {{exist for}} denoting past habitual action. The sentence When I was young, I played football every Saturday might alternatively be phrased using used to (... I {{used to play}} ...) or <b>using</b> <b>would</b> (... I would play...).|$|R
