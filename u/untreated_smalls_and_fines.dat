50|$|In Java, the kebaya worn by {{ladies of}} Chinese ancestry is called kebaya encim, {{derived from the}} name encim or enci {{to refer to a}} married Chinese woman. It was {{commonly}} worn by Chinese ladies in Javan coastal cities with significant Chinese settlements, such as Semarang, Lasem, Tuban, Surabaya, Pekalongan and Cirebon. It marked differently from Javanese kebaya with its <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>finer</b> embroidery, lighter fabrics and more vibrant colors, made from imported materials such as silk <b>and</b> other <b>fine</b> fabrics. The encim kebaya fit well with vibrant-colored kain batik pesisiran (Javan coastal batik).|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the {{difference}} between the breeds was determined by the dog's weight. However, this led to Miniature Bull Terriers becoming so <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>fine</b> that they looked more like a Chihuahua than a Bull Terrier. So, in the 1970s, the weight limit was replaced with a height limit of under fourteen inches. They are usually no smaller than ten inches. According to the AKC, miniature bull terriers' weight must be proportionate to its height. However, they tend to range anywhere from 20-35 lbs.|$|R

He now mounted the ladder and, after carefully examining the window--which was of the make which we call, in England, latticed--he inserted the strip of iron, and tried to force back the fastening. This he failed in doing, being afraid to use much force lest the fastening should give suddenly, with a crash. He had, however, ascertained the exact position of the fastening.|$|R

Fashioning needles from small pieces of bone, with sinews for thread, and using their own tattered clothes as patterns, the two lads set to work; and by the following evening had manufactured doublets and trunks of deerskin, which were a vast improvement upon their late ragged apparel; and had, at a short distance, the appearance of being made of a bright brownish-yellow cloth.|$|R

The band of instrumentalists and singers was {{one of the largest in}} the county; <b>and,</b> unlike the <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>finer</b> Mellstock string-band, which eschewed all but the catgut, it included brass and reed performers at full Sunday services, and reached all across the west gallery.|$|R

40|$|Thermoplastic {{natural rubber}} based on {{blending}} of ENR- 50 /TPU and un-modified NR/TPU was prepared via dynamic vulcanization technique. Influences types of natural rubber (i. e., un-modified NR and ENR- 50) on mechanical and morphological {{properties of the}} blends were investigated. It {{was found that the}} blends with ENR- 50 exhibited superior properties than that of the blend with unmodified NR. This is attributed to the interactions between the functional groups of ENR molecules and polar functional groups in TPU molecules which caused higher interfacial adhesion and interaction between both phases. The chemical interactions were confirmed by ATR-FTIR. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} ENR- 50 /TPU blend showed <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>finer</b> grain morphology compared with the un-modified NR/TPU...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two basic}} {{processes}} used by the model maker to create models: additive and subtractive. Additive {{can be as simple}} as adding clay to create a form, sculpting and smoothing to the final shape. Body fillers, foam and resins are also used in the same manner. Most rapid prototyping technologies are based on the additive process, solidifying thin layered sections or slices one on top of each other. Subtractive is like whittling a solid block of wood or chiseling stone to the desired form. Most milling and other machining methods are subtractive, progressively using <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>finer</b> tools to remove material from the rough shape to get to the level of detail needed in the final model.|$|R
40|$|A set {{of ceramic}} samples based on silicon carbide with {{substantially}} varying integral porosity (from 1 to 10 %) was studied. The {{pore size distribution}} was examined by optical microscopy (for pores ranging from 10 mm to hundreds of microns in size), scanning electron microscopy (0. 5 - 10 mm), and small-angle X-ray scattering (0. 04 - 0. 20 mm). The obtained pore size distribution function was used to estimate the integral porosity of ceramics, which was compared with the estimates of porosity obtained by the dilatometric technique. Relative contributions of large, <b>small,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fine</b> pores into the integral porosity of ceramics were found. The average pore sizes and average distances between them were estimated for each range of pore sizes...|$|R

50|$|This {{means that}} the ESR in a CPU power supply must be less than 30 mΩ, {{otherwise}} the circuit malfunctions.Similar rules are valid for capacitance and ESL.

The ESL challenge has led to the stacked foil versions of polymer Al e-caps.

25|$|Atzompa {{has been}} making pottery for at least 500 years. It is widely known for its {{traditional}} green glazed cookware and ornamental pieces. The glaze for the green pieces was originally lead based but that was changed in the 1990s due to health concerns. The green glazed ware is mostly formed into utilitarian items such as pots, cazuelas, jars, bowls and more. More recently, artisans in the town have been experimenting with various other styles of pottery, mostly decorative times {{in a variety of}} styles. One of these is called “pastillaje” where very <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>fine</b> pieces of clay are formed and pressed onto the main surface of the piece to create decoration.

50|$|Their {{skills are}} {{and can be}} used to create any number of {{different}} things from giant rocks in a landscape or oversized stone blocks cladding the facade of a castle to statuary and ornate panelling, to more specialized pieces such as a vehicle hull for a fantasy film used in set construction. The material often utilised for large-scale rocks or columns is polystyrene because it is light and can be carved easily using a hot wire. Polystyrene {{can also be used to}} sculpt mid-sized items that are difficult to build in wood and too large for clay - an item such as a moulded chair can then be cast with plaster and reproduced in fibre-glass. Clay modelling is still preferable for any item needing detail and is always used for <b>smaller</b> <b>and</b> <b>finer</b> work.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a strategy able to derive and process high resolution images created {{by means of}} gnomonic projections. The implemented pipeline can be split into two phases: first, the sensor resolution of the camera is physically increased by acquiring and merging a set of images with a rotating camera equipped with a long focal lens; then the new set of gnomonic projections is processed with a 3 D reconstruction methodology {{able to deal with}} very large images. Several issues are addressed in the paper, starting from image acquisition up to 3 D modelling. Gnomonic projections have been demonstrated to be powerful tools when traditional pinhole images do not allow the reconstruction of <b>small</b> <b>and</b> <b>fine</b> details. Examples <b>and</b> comparisons aimed at determining the correctness of the mathematical approach for image orientation are illustrated as well...|$|R
