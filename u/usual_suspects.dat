5|$|After {{the success}} of the first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation, Sony {{contacted}} Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console. Revolution wanted {{to move away from the}} style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and The <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects.</b> The game engine was written specifically for the title. It was released to average reviews from critics, who praised the game's story, puzzles and graphics, but criticized its controls, action scenes and animation.|$|E

30|$|The main {{driver of}} {{information}} search and processing issues is a <b>usual</b> <b>suspect</b> known since the 1960 s: limited time (Schroder et al. 1967). Time pressure and time restrictions {{often lead to}} information overload (Misuraca and Teuscher 2013; Scheibehenne et al. 2010). Thus, human information search and processing biases are still used to getting their way in digitalized environments.|$|R

5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} collaborations with Bryan Singer on The <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects,</b> Superman Returns and X2, editor and composer John Ottman edited the film without a temp track, noting if {{the film was}} working well without music, it was becoming a strong product. Since Valkyrie drew its inspirations from previous World War II films like The Great Escape (1963), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Patton (1970), and Midway (1976), filmmakers initially had a cut where title cards introduced characters and their roles. When the cut was test screened with an American audience, the title cards were removed due to complaints that {{there were too many}} characters to follow.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unexpected}} {{success of the}} first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation, Sony contacted Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console. Revolution wanted {{to move away from the}} style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. According to executive producer Charles Cecil, the game was inspired by crime films Pulp Fiction and The <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects.</b> The game engine was written specifically for the title. In Cold Blood was released on 14 July and 10 October 2000 in Europe, and on 25 March and 30 May 2001 in North America for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows. While the PlayStation version is no longer available for purchase, the PC version can be purchased at GOG.com.|$|E
5|$|Fox, who had {{projected}} {{the budget}} at $75 million, rejected the treatment which they estimated {{would have cost}} $5 million more. Beast, Nightcrawler, Pyro, and the Danger Room had to be deleted before the studio greenlighted X-Men. Fox head Thomas Rothman argued that this would enhance the story, and Singer concurred that removing the Danger Room allowed him to focus on other scenes he preferred. Elements of Beast, particularly his medical expertise, were transferred to Jean Grey. Singer and DeSanto brought Christopher McQuarrie from The <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects,</b> and together did another rewrite. David Hayter simultaneously rewrote the screenplay, receiving solo screenplay credit from the Writers Guild of America, while Singer and DeSanto were given story credit. The WGA offered McQuarrie a credit, but he voluntarily took his name off when the final version was {{more in line with}} Hayter's script than his.|$|E
40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative {{bacillus}} {{that causes}} wide spectrum clinical infections. However, {{it is most}} frequently associated with hospital-acquired infection.

30|$|The other feature measured, {{which is}} the <b>usual</b> <b>suspect</b> of causing visual annoyance, is the window {{violation}}. Window violation occurs when an object with negative parallax does not fit the screen and, therefore, is cut by the screen edges. Having negative parallax, {{it is supposed to}} be out of the screen, which means that the view of screen edges should not be hidden. This generates an incoherent depth cue situation.|$|R
5000|$|Browne {{described}} the programme as [...] "a new experiment in Irish television". He claimed: [...] "This will be TV3's largest audience show to date with 150-200 people debating the important national {{issues of the}} day. There will be no panel of the <b>usual</b> important <b>suspects</b> - if the <b>usual</b> important <b>suspects</b> want to participate they will do so on the same basis as everyone else. This is democracy television." ...|$|R
5|$|Trainspotting {{director}} Danny Boyle was the producers' {{first choice}} {{to direct the}} film. Boyle and his producer met with effects supervisors to discuss the film, {{but he was not}} interested in pursuing the project and went on to make A Life Less Ordinary instead. Peter Jackson was also approached, but declined as he could not get excited about an Alien film. In 1995, after the release of The <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects,</b> 20th Century Fox approached Bryan Singer to direct. Jean-Pierre Jeunet was asked to direct, as the film's producers believed he had a unique visual style. Jeunet had just completed the script to Amélie and was surprised he was offered the job for Alien Resurrection, as he thought the franchise had finished with Alien 3 and believed that making a sequel was a bad idea. Jeunet, however, accepted the project with a budget of $70 million. He required an interpreter as he did not speak much English when filming began.|$|E

25|$|The 1995 film The <b>Usual</b> <b>Suspects</b> {{reveals that}} the narrator had been deceiving another character, and hence the audience, by inventing stories and {{characters}} from whole cloth.

40|$|Viewing {{technology}} shocks as {{the primary}} source of business cycles has resulted in many "puzzles" or counter-factual predictions of general equilibrium theory with respect to international movements of output, consumption, investment, employment, and net exports (Backus, Kehoe and Kydland, JPE 1992). There are few puzzles, however, when aggregate demand rather than aggregate supply is the source of uncertainty. In particular, the stylized openeconomy business cycle regularities are what standard general equilibrium theory predicts once the <b>usual</b> <b>suspect</b> [...] fickle consumers [...] is held responsible for the business cycle. The finding that preference shocks explain both domestic and international business cycles suggests the possibility of a unified explanation of the business cycle and the seasonal cycle, as both types of fluctuations share a common source: recurrent shifts in preferences. ...|$|R
30|$|For example, {{the trend}} towards {{integration}} between diagnostic and therapeutic {{functions in the}} same medical device was {{discussed in terms of}} the required changes in the skills of doctors, with deep implications in terms of patients’ attitudes (trust), administrative procedures, doctors’ status, liability and insurance issues, and the like. From the user perspective, there will be great advantages (in the same session the disease is identified and cured), but also sources of anxiety (there is no longer a time interval between diagnosis and therapy, which could be used by the patient and her family to make an informed decision, or to take a second opinion). The identification of these problems in functional terms, as opposed to extrapolation of existing devices (with associated conflict of interests of industry involved) helped to frame the discussion in a transparent way, reducing the <b>usual</b> <b>suspect</b> of vested interests from the industry side, or manipulation from hospitals.|$|R
