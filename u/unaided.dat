5|$|HIP 78530 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 7.18. It is incredibly faint, if visible at all, {{as seen from}} the <b>unaided</b> eye of an observer on Earth.|$|E
5|$|It can be {{seen with}} the <b>unaided</b> eye as a third-magnitude star. As seen from Tau Ceti, the Sun would be a third-magnitude star in the {{northern}} hemisphere constellation Boötes..|$|E
5|$|The star's {{apparent}} magnitude is 13.4, {{meaning that it}} cannot be seen with the <b>unaided</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 10.42, making it {{invisible to the}} <b>unaided</b> eye as seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|WASP-43 has one {{detected}} {{planet in}} its orbit, WASP-43b. The star has an apparent magnitude of 12.4, {{and thus is}} too faint {{to be seen with}} the <b>unaided</b> eye from Earth.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 12.4, WASP-43 cannot {{be seen with}} the <b>unaided</b> eye. The star is located approximately 80 parsecs (260 light years) away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|IK Pegasi (or HR 8210) is {{a binary}} star {{system in the}} {{constellation}} Pegasus. It is just luminous enough {{to be seen with}} the <b>unaided</b> eye, at a distance of about 150 light years from the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|In November 1943 some {{plutonium}} trifluoride {{was reduced}} to create the first sample of plutonium metal: a few micrograms of metallic beads. Enough plutonium was produced {{to make it the}} first synthetically made element to be visible with the <b>unaided</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{health-related}} {{quality of}} life (HRQL) after an attack of Guillain–Barré syndrome can be significantly impaired. About a fifth are unable to walk <b>unaided</b> after six months, and many experience chronic pain, fatigue and difficulty with work, education, hobbies and social activities. HRQL improves significantly in the first year.|$|E
5|$|WASP-15 {{is located}} at a {{distance}} of 308 parsecs (1,004 light years), and it has an estimated apparent magnitude of 10.9. It is, thus, not visible from Earth with the <b>unaided</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|GJ 3634 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.95. Thus, despite its proximity at 19.8 parsecs (64.6 light years) {{away from the}} Earth, it cannot be seen with the <b>unaided</b> eye. The star is of a similar distance from Earth as planet-bearing 51 Pegasi, which lies {{at a distance of}} 14.7 parsecs (47.95 light years).|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Karnataka had 54,529 {{primary schools}} with 252,875 {{teachers}} and 8.495 million students, and 9498 secondary schools with 92,287 teachers and 1.384 million students. There are {{three kinds of}} schools in the state, viz., government-run, private aided (financial aid {{is provided by the}} government) and private <b>unaided</b> (no financial aid is provided). The primary languages of instruction in most schools are Kannada and English.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-40 {{hosts the}} sixth {{planetary}} {{system to be}} discovered in the orbit of a star with a mass of over 1.8 solar masses. It lies 2700 parsecs (8806.4 light years) away from Earth, making it more distant than any previously verified planet discovered by Kepler, and has an apparent magnitude of 14.58. Thus, it is invisible to the <b>unaided</b> eye.|$|E
5|$|Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, {{and both}} nations {{came close to}} declaring war on each other, {{although}} neither could afford a direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay was too weak militarily {{to engage in a}} fight <b>unaided.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of anatomy {{is divided into}} macroscopic and microscopic anatomy. Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using <b>unaided</b> eyesight. Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy. Microscopic anatomy {{involves the use of}} optical instruments {{in the study of the}} tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the <b>unaided</b> eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E
5|$|Californium is a {{radioactive}} {{chemical element}} with symbol Cf and atomic number98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding curium with alpha particles (helium-4 ions). It is an actinide element, the sixth transuranium element to be synthesized, {{and has the}} second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the <b>unaided</b> eye (after einsteinium). The element was named after {{the university and the}} state of California.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} great {{distance}} from the Earth, all stars except the Sun appear to the <b>unaided</b> eye as shining points {{in the night sky}} that twinkle because of the effect of the Earth's atmosphere. The Sun is also a star, but it is close enough to the Earth to appear as a disk instead, and to provide daylight. Other than the Sun, the star with the largest apparent size is R Doradus, with an angular diameter of only 0.057 arcseconds.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer Aldous Huxley. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of keratitis, which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light {{perception}} {{and the other with}} an <b>unaided</b> Snellen fraction of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both corneas, complicated by hyperopia and astigmatism. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with atropine, to allow that eye to see around an opacity {{in the center of the}} cornea.|$|E
5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the <b>unaided</b> eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies of}} young adults who had used AAC since {{childhood}} report a generally good quality of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and <b>unaided</b> AAC approaches. More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services. Poorer outcomes were related to {{lack of access to}} appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E
5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} {{shortly after}} giving birth. Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant {{for nearly a}} year. For {{the first half of}} the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs <b>unaided</b> by its mother from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E
5|$|The three destroyers and 16 {{small boats}} left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 14:00 on 26 March 1942. They formed into {{a convoy of}} three lanes, with the destroyers in the middle. On arrival at St Nazaire the {{portside}} MLs were {{to head for the}} Old Mole to disembark their Commandos, while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to disembark theirs. Not having the range to reach St Nazaire <b>unaided,</b> the MTB and MGB were taken under tow by Campbeltown and Atherstone.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark is judged to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are <b>unaided,</b> although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E
5|$|WASP-13 is a sunlike, G-type {{star that}} is {{situated}} approximately 156 parsecs (509 light years) in the Lynx constellation. With an apparent magnitude of 10.42, the star cannot {{be seen with}} the <b>unaided</b> eye {{from the perspective of}} someone on Earth. The star's effective temperature, at 5826 K, is hotter than that of the Sun. However, its metallicity is similar; this can be seen in how the concentration of iron, or , is approximately 0. WASP-13's surface gravity is measured at 4.04 km/s2, while the rate at which it rotates is at most 4.9 km/s.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of , Epsilon Eridani is the 13th-nearest known star (and ninth nearest solitary star or stellar system) to the Sun as of 2014. Its proximity makes {{it one of the}} most studied stars of its spectral type. Epsilon Eridani is located in the northern part of the constellation Eridanus, about 3° east of the slightly brighter star Delta Eridani. With a declination of −9.46°, Epsilon Eridani can be viewed from much of Earth's surface, at suitable times of year. Only to the north of latitude 80°N is it permanently hidden below the horizon. The apparent magnitude of 3.73 can make it difficult to observe from an urban area with the <b>unaided</b> eye, because the night skies over cities are obscured by light pollution.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter had to walk to the scratch <b>unaided</b> within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. These rules still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|From the 1980s, {{improvements}} in technology {{led to a}} greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, {{and a reduction in}} their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices. Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Ewe. AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and <b>unaided</b> strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family. Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services. In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served. Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.|$|E
5|$|More {{effective}} tactics {{had to be}} used {{if there}} were to be no greater resources for the Command. Two major changes adopted by Coastal Command were sweeps over convoy routes and sweeps against U-boat transit routes. According to German and Italian submarine logs, both were effective and denied them the chance of shadowing convoys on the surface. It also rapidly increased the chances of a kill. The transit tactic over the Bay of Biscay resulted in many air-to-air and air-to-submarine combats, reaching its peak in 1943. As it was, in 1940 the Command was credited with just two sinkings with Navy vessels, one sunk <b>unaided,</b> and two damaged. The damaged ships could have been sunk had proper weapons been available.|$|E
5|$|Neptune is {{not visible}} to the <b>unaided</b> eye {{and is the only}} planet in the Solar System found by {{mathematical}} prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.|$|E
5|$|Nu Phoenicis is a yellow-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type F9V and magnitude 4.96. Lying some 49 light years distant, it is around 1.2 times as massive as our sun, {{and likely to}} be surrounded by a disk of dust. It is the closest star in the constellation that is visible with the <b>unaided</b> eye. Gliese 915 is a white dwarf only 26 light years away. It is of magnitude 13.05, too faint to be seen with the naked eye. White dwarfs are extremely dense stars compacted into a volume the size of the Earth. With around 85% of the mass of the Sun, Gliese 915 has a surface gravity of 108.39 ± 0.01 (2.45 · 108) cm·s−2, or approximately 250,000 of Earth's.|$|E
5|$|Pavo {{contains}} several {{variable stars}} of note. Lambda Pavonis {{is a bright}} irregular variable ranging between magnitudes 3.4 and 4.4; this variation can be observed with the <b>unaided</b> eye. Classed as a Gamma Cassiopeiae variable or shell star, it is of spectral type B2II-IIIe and lies around 1430 light years distant from Earth. Kappa Pavonis is a W Virginis variable—a subclass of Type II Cepheid. It ranges from magnitude 3.91 to 4.78 over 9 days and is a yellow-white supergiant pulsating between spectral classes F5I-II and G5I-II. NU and V Pavonis are pulsating semiregular variable red giant stars. NU has a spectral type M6III and ranges from magnitude 4.9 to 5.3, while V Pavonis ranges from magnitude 6.3 to 8.2 over two periods of 225.4 and 3735 days concurrently. V is a carbon star of spectral type C6,4(Nb) with a prominent red hue.|$|E
5|$|Realizing Arganan {{must have}} known of this, Zael refuses his knighthood and sets out with Calista to destroy Lazulis' cannon, which is powered by Lazulis' half of the Outsider. However, when the Gurak attack Lazulis they decide to instead help Arganan use the cannon to drive off the attack. The cannon's fire proves insufficient, and Arganan is mysteriously killed by its power. The Gurak overrun Lazulis. Calista and the mercenaries head out to {{retrieve}} Zangurak's half of the Outsider, only to find its power has already been taken. Once they remove it, the Gurak fortress starts to crumble, knocking Zael and Calista into the ocean. They are rescued by Gurak ships. On board is Jirall, who {{has been given a}} cursed sword by Zangurak for him to kill Zael. Realizing the sword is affecting Jirall's mind, Zael tries to save Jirall by disarming him, but the cursed sword moves <b>unaided</b> and kills Jirall. Meanwhile, the Gurak take Calista to Zangurak.|$|E
5|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage or blindness, special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse. It is technically safe to view only the total phase of a total solar eclipse with the <b>unaided</b> eye and without protection; however, {{this is a dangerous}} practice, as most people are not trained to recognize the phases of an eclipse, which can span over two hours while the total phase can only last a maximum of 7.5 minutes for any one location. People referred to as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles will travel to remote locations to observe or witness predicted central solar eclipses.|$|E
5|$|Stage directors, <b>unaided</b> by {{post-production}} {{effects and}} camera tricks, have used other methods {{to depict the}} ghost. In the late 19th century, elaborate productions of the play staged by Henry Irving employed {{a wide variety of}} approaches for this task. In 1877 a green silhouette was used to create a ghostlike image; ten years later a trick chair was used to allow an actor to appear {{in the middle of the}} scene, and then again from the midst of the audience. In 1895 a shaft of blue light served to indicate the presence of Banquo's spirit. In 1933 a Russian director named Theodore Komisarjevsky staged a modern retelling of the play (Banquo and Macbeth were told of their future through palmistry); he used Macbeth's shadow as the ghost. In 1936 Orson Welles directed the Federal Theatre Project production of the play, with an African-American cast that included Canada Lee in the role of Banquo.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightness}} of a star, {{as seen from}} Earth, is measured with a standardized, logarithmic scale. This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing {{brightness of}} the star. The faintest stars visible to the <b>unaided</b> eye are sixth magnitude, while the brightest, Sirius, is of magnitude −1.46. To standardize the magnitude scale, astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths. Thus, for many years, Vega {{was used as a}} baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales. However, this is no longer the case, as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux. This approach is more convenient for astronomers, since Vega is not always available for calibration.|$|E
