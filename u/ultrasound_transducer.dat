40|$|Small, high {{frequency}} (≥ 10 MHz) broadband <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers</b> are required in modern medical imaging systems to provide short range, high resolution images for studying of microstructures in soft tissues, {{such as the}} composition of small tumors or a vessel wall. The manufacturing of these probes using conventional methods, i. e. lapping and dicing, becomes difficult and expensive for {{high frequency}} applications {{and there is a}} need to produce small <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers</b> with low cost and high reliability. Being identified as one of the key technologies that has produced μ- scale, high volume products in a wide variery of markets such as electronics, telecommunications, automobiles, etc [...] ., Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) technology seems to deliver a good solution. This thesis presents the development of novel small-sized, high frequency broadband <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers</b> based on silicon processing borrowed from the MEMS industry. We have categorized the work in this thesis within two main themes: 1. The modeling, fabrication and characterization of silicon-polymer composite acoustic matching layers formed by MEMS techniques. Two different micromachining approaches have been employed: Deep Reactive Ion Etch (DRIE) and Anisotropic Wet Etch. The modeling of the micromachined composite materials was carried out both by analytical and finite element method (FEM) simulations. The properties of the fabricated composites were extracted via electrical impedance and pulse-echo measurements of air-backed transducers. 2. The design, fabrication and characterization of high frequency (15 MHz) broadband <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers,</b> where the composite materials described above were used as an intermediate layer in the stack of multiple matching layers. The main contributions are: 1. Fabrication and testing of silicon-polymer composites made by an advanced technique, DRIE, used as matching layers for 15 MHz <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers.</b> A method for extracting the composite properties via inversion scheme from electrical impedance measurements of air-backed transducers with composites as single matching layers was proposed. 2. Modeling of silicon-polymer composite materials and <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers</b> under different circumstances, i. e. in contact with fluid/solid media. This provides the understanding of the dynamic behavior of the silicon-polymer composite, helps to define the maximum allowable period sizes and properties of the composites without influence the transducer’s performance. The modeling was carried out by analytical calculations and FEM simulations. 3. Development of an in-house anisotropic wet etching process of silicon to form well-defined size, high aspect ratio, vertical sidewall trenches. This process is benificial for constructing of many MEMS devices for various applications such as biological, optical and energy harvesting sensors. 4. Development of an in-house fabrication process to manufacture high frequency broadband <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers</b> based on micromachining techniques, i. e. photolithography and anisotropic wet etch of (110) -oriented silicon wafers.

Design Quantitative study conducted at the Laboratory of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences and Technology of Piaui - NOVAFAPI, Teresina, Brazil. Setting Sample collection was performed in 10 clinics (20 <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers</b> and 20 contact electrodes). Main outcome measures Swabs were soaked with saline solution, inoculated in culture and incubated for filamentous fungi and yeast growth. Results Fourteen taxons were identified: Acremomium hyalinulum (Sacc.), Aspergillus terreus, Candida albicans, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Cladosporium elatum, Cladosporium oxysporum, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Cladosphialophora bantiana, Curvularia clavata, Curvularia senegalensis, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium decumbens, Scopulariopsis candida and Sporothrix schenckii. Aspergillus terreus, Cladosporium oxysporum, Sporothrix shenckii and Candida albicans were found most often on contact electrodes, and Penicillium decumbens and Cladosporium cladosporioides were found most often on <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers.</b> Conclusion Fungi were found {{on all of the}} contact electrodes and <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers.</b> Physiotherapy professionals need to improve the disinfection procedures for this equipment.

50|$|Principle: Photoacoustic {{tomography}} (PAT) {{works on}} the natural phenomenon of tissues to thermalelastically expand when stimulated with externally applied electromagnetic waves, such as short laser pulses. This causes ultrasound waves to be emitted from these tissues, which can then be captured by an <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducer.</b> The thermoelastic expansion and the resulting ultrasound wave {{is dependent on the}} wavelength of light used. PAT allows for complete non-invasiveness when imaging the animal. This is especially important when working with brain tumor models, which are notoriously hard to study.|$|E

50|$|Phonophoresis, {{also known}} as sonophoresis, {{is the use of}} {{ultrasound}} to enhance the delivery of topically applied drugs. Home ultrasound allows the application of topically applied analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents through the therapeutic application of ultrasound. It is widely used in hospitals to deliver drugs through the skin. Pharmacists compound the drugs by mixing them with a coupling agent (gel, cream, ointment) that transfers ultrasonic energy from the <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducer</b> to the skin. The ultrasound potentially enhances drug transport by cavitation, microstreaming, and heating.|$|E

40|$|Novel <b>ultrasound</b> <b>transducers</b> {{were created}} with a {{composite}} of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that was dip coated onto the end faces of optical fibers.

Ultrasound pulses were generated by illuminating the composite coating with pulsed laser light. At distances of 2 to 16 mm from the end faces, ultrasound pressures ranged from 0. 81 to 0. 07 MPa and from 0. 27 to 0. 03 MPa with 105 and 200 µm core fibers, respectively.
