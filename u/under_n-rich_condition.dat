Insertion of the c-GaN buffer layer suppressed In droplet formation in c-InN. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy investigations showed that the InN layers have zincblende structure with {{only a small fraction}} of oxide phase inclusions and no significant hexagonal InN is present. By systemically varying growth conditions, it was found that the c-InN growth is dominated mainly by In adatoms' surface diffusion and InN surface decomposition and three distinct regimes of c-InN growth are observed. The growth of c-InN on c-GaN/GaP(1 0 0) templates eventually followed a three-dimensional growth mode in the thermally activated growth regime and density and size distribution of c-InN dots significantly changed with substrate temperature and growth rate. These results provide a stronger understanding of the growth mechanism to design and engineer InN-based nanostructures with desired shapes for potential technological applications. close 0...|$|E

The results are compared with experimentally observed surface morphologies of (000 - 1) GaN layers grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The proposed kMC two-component model of GaN(000 - 1) surface where both types of atoms: nitrogen and gallium attach the surface and diffuse independently, explains that at relatively high rates of the step flow (miscut angle < 2 deg) the low diffusion of gallium adatoms causes surface instabilities and leads to experimentally observed roughening while for low rates of the step flow (miscut 4 deg), smooth surface can be obtained. In the presence of almost immobile nitrogen atoms under N-rich conditions, the growth is realized {{by the process of}} two-dimensional island nucleation and coalescence. Additionally, we show that higher crystal miscut, lower crystal growth rate or higher temperature results in similar effect of the smoothening of the surface. We show that the surface also smoothens for the growth conditions with very high N-excess. The presence of large number of nitrogen atoms changes locally mobility of gallium atoms thus providing easier coalescence of separated island. Comment: 23 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
30|$|Figure  3 {{shows the}} SEM images of surface {{morphology}} and cross sections of samples A to D. From the top view of sample A (A 1), {{one can see}} some obvious dark holes on the surface, indicating the formation of vacancies due to In accumulation in droplets. The formation of holes and droplets easily leads to a pretty rough surface (rms[*]=[*] 33, from AFM scanning result), as shown in Figure  3 A 2. As we know, the melting temperature of metal In is only about 157 °C. Thus, under {{the growth temperature of}} InN (550 °C), the pulsed deposition of In for a long duration time may form a thick liquid In layer on the surface. By the effect of surface tension, In droplets in large size would come into being quickly. This is the main reason governing the surface roughness. In order to reduce the roughness, the pulse time of TMI is reduced to 8  s for sample B. The obtained InN film shows better flatness (rms[*]=[*] 20) and dark holes have been well removed (Figure  3 B 2). According to the theoretical simulation of the kinetics of InN formation [17], if the thickness of indium film is larger than two atomic layers, the nitridation of this In film could not well form a InN epilayers in correct stoichiometric ratio (1 : 1) and the excessive In will lead to roughness. Thus, the TMI pulse time was further decreased down to 4  s. As shown in Figure  3 C 1, the islands of sample C begin to show regular shape relatively and the surface becomes more flat (rms[*]=[*] 14). Meanwhile, it can be observed that there are some islands in larger size, as indicated by arrow. The number of these types of large islands further increases in sample D (Figure  3 D 1), in which the TMI pulse time was set to 3  s. This trend of quality deterioration implies that the indium film deposited during the TMI period turns to be less than one atomic layer and fail to construct indium bilayer. This insufficient coverage of indium layer could not provide the advantage of nitridation of indium bi-layer structure. On the contrary, over-nitridation <b>under</b> <b>N-rich</b> <b>condition</b> leads to the deterioration of the InN film quality of sample D. Therefore, it could be determined that 4 -s pulsed supply of TMI in sample C is the optimal setting.|$|E

It is believed that N defects play important roles in achieving the high-temperature ferromagnetism in good samples. Motivated by these experimental advances, we use a full-potential density-functional-theory method and supercell approach to investigate N defects and their effects on ferromagnetism of (Al,Cr) N with N vacancies (V-N). We investigate the structural and electronic properties of V-N, single Cr atom, Cr-Cr atom pairs, Cr-V-N pairs, and so on. In each case, the most stable structure is obtained by comparing different atomic configurations optimized in terms of the total energy and the force on every atom, and then it is used to calculate the defect formation energy and study the electronic structures. Our total-energy calculations show that the nearest substitutional Cr-Cr pair with the two spins in parallel is the most favorable and the nearest Cr-V-N pair makes a stable complex. Our formation energies indicate that V-N regions can be formed spontaneously under N-poor condition because the minimal V-N formation energy equals - 0. 23 eV or Cr-doped regions with high enough concentrations can be formed <b>under</b> <b>N-rich</b> <b>condition</b> because the Cr formation energy equals 0. 04 eV, and hence real Cr-doped AlN samples are formed by forming some Cr-doped regions and separated V-N regions and through subsequent atomic relaxation during annealing. Both of the single Cr atom and the N vacancy create filled electronic states in the semiconductor gap of AlN. N vacancies enhance the ferromagnetism by adding mu(B) to the Cr moment each but reduce the ferromagnetic exchange constants between the spins in the nearest Cr-Cr pairs. These calculated results are in agreement with experimental observations and facts of real Cr-doped AlN samples and their synthesis. Our first-principles results are useful to elucidate the mechanism for the ferromagnetism and to explore high-performance Cr-doped AlN diluted magnetic semiconductors.

For Si-doped InN NWs, a reduced NW density is observed, in comparison to the undoped counterpart. At high Si doping, the InN NW morphology is improved leading to more uniform diameter NWs.

For growth on AlN buffer layers, we commonly observe films which consist of largely (0001) Ga polarity material, as confirmed by selective etch tests, with a varying coverage of (0001 ¯) N-face inversion domains threading along the growth direction.

30|$|Recently, indium nitride (InN) has {{attracted}} much attention due to its narrow band-gap energy (i.e., around 0.7 eV), existence of a surface accumulation layer, low electron effective mass, high carrier mobility, and high saturation velocity. These properties make InN a potentially useful material for the fabrication of high-electron-mobility transistors, high frequency devices, and full-spectrum solar cells [1 – 3]. However, the growth of high-quality InN films is difficult {{due to the lack}} of suitable substrates. It has been shown that hetero epitaxy of InN films on sapphire or Si often results in a high density of threading dislocation, due to the mismatches in lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient. This can be solved by growing one-dimensional (1 D) InN nanorods which are less sensitive to strain [4 – 8]. Recently, 1 D InN nanorods were successfully grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) [9 – 14]. However, 1 D InN nanorods prepared by CVD were normally grown through vapor-liquid-solid mechanism with a catalyst. The catalyst often introduces unintentional doping which might cause changes in electrical and optical properties of the nanorods. In addition, reaction temperature of CVD process is normally higher than the dissociation temperature of InN and nanorods growth rate was decreased by this phenomenon. On the other hand, it is known that morphology of InN prepared by PA-MBE depends strongly on the indium to nitrogen molecular flux ratio. To achieve InN nanorods, that need to grow InN nanorods <b>under</b> <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions</b> since InN form compact film when prepared under In-rich conditions [1].

40|$|III-nitride {{semiconductors}} are {{of great}} interest owing to their commercial and military applications due to their optoelectronic and mechanical properties. They have been synthesized successfully by many growth methods. Among them, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a promising epitaxial growth method owing to precise control of growth parameters, which significantly affect the film properties, composition, and thickness. However, the understanding of growth mechanism of III-nitride materials grown in this growth regime {{is far from being}} complete. In this dissertation, GaN and AIGaN growth mechanism under metal-rich conditions were investigated. The Ga surface desorption behavior during the growth was investigated systematically using reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED). It was found that desorption of Ga atoms from the (0001) GaN surfaces under different III-V ratios deviates from the zeroth-order kinetics in that the desorption rate is independent of the coverage of adsorbed atoms. The desorption energies of Ga are determined to be 2. 76 eV with the Ga coverage closing to 100 %, 1. 89 eV for a ~ 45 % coverage, and 0. 82 eV for a 10 % coverage, as monitored by the change of the RHEED specular beam intensity during growth. In addition, the GaN surface morphology under different III-V ratios on porous templates matches the dependence of Ga desorption energy on the metal coverage, and III/V ratio dominates the growth mode. In a related AIGaN growth mechanism study, a competition between A 1 and Ga atoms to incorporate into the film was found under metal-rich conditions. Employing this mechanism, A 1 xGa 1 -xN layers with precisely controlled A 1 mole fraction, x in the range 0 xxGa 1 -xN films was determined to be about 1 eV. The A 1 xGa 1 -xN layers grown under metal-rich conditions, as compared to that <b>under</b> <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions,</b> have a better structural and optical quality. Employing A 1 xGa 1 -xN layers grown under metal-rich conditions, a lateral geometry GaN/A 1 GaN MQW-based photodetector was fabricated.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of this thesis was to get more insight into the {{mechanisms}} driving the growth of nitride nanowires by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE). The influence of the group-III and group-V flux {{as well as the}} substrate temperature Tsub has been studied leading {{to the conclusion that the}} III-V ratio determines the growth mode. <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions</b> lead to nanowire growth and Tsub has an important influence. For GaN an increase of Tsub enhances the Ga desorption, thus lowering the III-V ratio, whereas for InN higher temperatures lead to a higher N evaporation and increases the III-V ratio. Ga desorption limits the temperature range to grow GaN nanowires and dissociation of InN is the limiting factor for InN nanowire growth. A reduction of the surface diffusivity on polar surfaces <b>under</b> <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions</b> explains the anisotropic growth. Growth kinetics of the nanowires show that there are two important contributions to the growth. The first is growth by direct impingement and its contribution is independent of the nanowire diameter. The second contribution comes from atoms, which absorb on the substrate or wire sidewalls and diffuse along the sidewalls to the top of the wire, which acts as an effective sink for the adatoms due to a reduced surface mobility on the polar top of the wires. This diffusion channel, which is enhanced at higher Tsub, becomes more significant for smaller wire diameters, because its contribution scales like 1 /d. Experiments with an interruption of the growth and sharp interfaces in TEM images of heterostructures show that the suggestion in literature of a droplet-mediated PA-MBE nitride growth has to be discarded. An accumulation or depletion of group-III adatoms during growth can lead to an increase or a reduction of the wire diameter. This can be compensated by changing one of the fluxes or the substrate temperature to produce wires with a uniform diameter. Despite a thin amorphous silicon nitride wetting layer on the substrate surface, both GaN and InN nanowires grow in the wurtzite structure and epitaxially in a one-to-one relation to the Si(111) substrate surface. There is no evidence for cubic phases. TEM images and optical studies display a high crystalline and optical quality of GaN and InN nanowires. Lattice constants determined from TEM images agree well with literature values for strain-free GaN and high-quality inn. The substrate induces some strain in the bottom part of the nanowires, especially in InN due to the lower Tsub than for GaN, which is released without the formation of dislocations. Only some stacking faults sometimes form at the base of the wires. Optical spectra also exhibit a band gap consistent with strain-free GaN in the upper part of the wires. For InN a band gap value of 0. 7 - 0. 8 eV has been determined at low temperatures in agreement with recent literature reports for InN of high crystalline quality. The doping concentration and the position of the Fermi-level in InN depend very much on the crystalline quality. In general the luminescence of GaN and InN improves with increased Tsub. For GaN the defect-related peaks decrease and in InN the carrier concentration is reduced, which changes the shape of the PL spectrum. Si- and Mg-doping can change the morphology of GaN nanowires, but the growth parameters can be chosen to produce wires with uniform diameter. Optical spectra confirm the effective incorporation of the dopant species in the nanowires despite a large nanowire surface and unfavourable growth conditions for doping, which are required for nitride nanowire growth. GaN and InN nanowires display a high mechanical and chemical resistance against common processing steps in spite of a high aspect ratio and large free surface. Producing contacts to the wires by e-beam lithography allows to determine the electrical behaviour of GaN, InN and Si-doped GaN nanowires. Fermi-level pinning due to surface states has a major influence on all nanowires especially for diameters below 100 nm. For GaN the pinning induces a depletion region, which depends on the doping concentration. The conductivity for small diameters is low for undoped GaN, but can be significantly enhanced by UV illumination or Si-doping. The diameter dependence of the photocurrent displays a rapid drop below a critical radius equal to the extension of the depletion layer and the wires show a fast photoresponse in this region caused by a lowering of the barrier for surface recombination. The carrier concentration of GaN nanowires can be determined from the critical radius and is enhanced by Si-doping. In InN nanowires the Fermi-level pinning in the conduction band induces a highly conductive surface accumulation layer and as a result the nanowires display very high currents several orders of magnitude higher than the GaN nanowires, independent of illumination. There is no pronounced diameter dependence...|$|R
40|$|Tungsten {{nitrogen}} (W-N) codoping {{has been}} known to enhance the photocatalytic activity of anatase TiO 2 nanoparticles by utilizing visible light. The doping effects are, however, largely dependent on calcination or annealing conditions, and thus, the massive production of quality-controlled photocatalysts still remains a challenge. Using density functional theory (DFT) thermodynamics and time-dependent DFT computations (TDDFT), we investigate the atomic structures of N doping and W N codoping in anatase TiO 2, as well as the effect of the thermal processing conditions. We find that W and N dopants predominantly constitute two complex structures: an N interstitial site near a Ti vacancy in the triple charge state ((V-Ti-N-i) (3 -)) and the simultaneous substitutions of Ti by W and the nearest O by N ((W-Ti-N-O) (+)). The latter case induces highly localized shallow in-gap levels near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM), whereas the (V-Ti-N-i) (3 -) defect complex yielded deep levels (1. 9 eV above the VBM). Electronic structures suggest that (W-Ti-N-O) (+) improves the photocatalytic activity of anatase by band gap narrowing, while (V-Ti-N-i) (3 -) degrades the activity by an in-gap state-assisted electron hole recombination, which explains the experimentally observed deep-level-related photon absorption. Through the real-time propagation of TDDFT, we demonstrate that the presence of (V-Ti-N-i) (3 -) attracts excited electrons from the conduction band to a localized in-gap state within a much shorter time than the flat band lifetime of TiO 2. On the basis of these results, we suggest that calcination <b>under</b> <b>N-rich</b> and O-poor <b>conditions</b> is desirable to eliminate the deep-level states caused by (V-Ti-N-i) (3 -) and to improve photocatalysisclos...|$|R
