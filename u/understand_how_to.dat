25|$|Nonetheless, Steinmetz also {{discusses}} three common character {{types of}} subordinates: ascendant, indifferent, and ambivalent who all react and interact uniquely, {{and must be}} treated, managed, and motivated accordingly. An effective leader must <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> manage all characters, and more importantly the manager must utilize avenues that allow room for employees to work, grow, and find answers independently.|$|E

The goal would be to fully <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use multiple co-operative interactions to best accelerate a reaction and impart selectivity. Ideally, rational catalyst design will eventually replace screening of families of catalysts and the choice of building blocks will become more systematic.|$|E

25|$|From the {{research}} that has been conducted on TCKs, {{it has been found}} that subjects are generally more tolerant of different cultures and of people of different backgrounds than subjects from the same home country who are not TCKs. In addition, TCKs generally feel that they are better able to adapt to new cultures and <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> behave appropriately in these new environments. Researcher and teacher Wenda Sheard surveyed some of her multi-cultural students, most of whom were either fluent in two or more languages, and found that many felt that they had an increased tolerance of other cultures. However, as one student explained, part of this tolerance was out of necessity for maintaining a healthy social life in one's new environment and culture.|$|E

25|$|The {{sacrifice}} {{of a bear}} for Artemis started with the Brauron cult. Every year a girl between five and ten years of age was sent to Artemis' temple at Brauron. The Byzantine writer Suidos relayed the legend in Arktos e Brauroniois. A bear was tamed by Artemis and introduced {{to the people of}} Athens. They touched it and played with it until one day a group of girls poked the bear until it attacked them. A brother of one of the girls killed the bear, so Artemis sent a plague in revenge. The Athenians consulted an oracle to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> end the plague. The oracle suggested that, in payment for the bear's blood, no Athenian virgin should be allowed to marry until she had served Artemis in her temple ('played the bear for the goddess').|$|E
25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young {{children}} tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.|$|E

500|$|In 1844, the Oregon territories {{voted to}} {{prohibit}} alcoholic beverages. [...] This was repealed in 1845, but prohibition was reinstated in a 1915, {{four years before}} the national alcohol prohibition. [...] When national prohibition was repealed in 1933, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) was created. Unlike states that allow liquor sales in grocery stores, liquor in Oregon is sold only in OLCC run liquor stores and establishments that have liquor licenses, and the OLCC has strict guidelines and training {{to ensure that all}} licensed venues <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> safely sell and serve alcoholic beverages.

500|$|The {{excessive}} {{volume of}} traffic on Deerfoot Trail is a contributing factor to the 10,000 collisions recorded between 2002 and 2007, including 24 fatalities. [...] Constable Jeff Klatt of the Calgary Police Service stated {{that there is a}} [...] "consensus among police officers that it’s dangerous to do traffic stops" [...] on Deerfoot Trail. [...] A 1993 incident in which a stolen vehicle struck and killed a police officer on Deerfoot was the catalyst for the Calgary Police Service's acquisition of a helicopter. [...] 2013 statistics confirmed that Deerfoot Trail had more crashes and traffic jams than any other road in Calgary. [...] Deerfoot has many entrances and exits in close proximity which exacerbates problems, but some have attributed a portion of the congestion to driver error. Constable Jim Lebedeff of the Calgary Police Service stated, [...] "a lot of people don’t understand, or don’t want to <b>understand,</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> merge properly.” [...] 30% of respondents to a 2016 poll stated that the main reason they avoid Deerfoot Trail is because they do not feel safe on the freeway.|$|E

500|$|When {{the studio}} hired Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston to direct Thor and , respectively, it made sure both {{directors}} {{were open to}} the idea of a shared universe and including Avengers set-up scenes in their films. Joe Russo stated, [...] "That's the exciting component of [...] 'What can we set up for the future?' You're constantly pitching out ideas that not only affect your movie, but may have a ripple effect that affects other films ... It's a weird sort of tapestry of writers and directors working together to create this universe that's sort of organic." [...] Anthony added, [...] "The great thing about the Marvel , just like the publishing , it's a very vast, inter-connected universe, where characters will have their rise and fall, so to speak, and hand off to other characters. As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters." [...] He added that, for directors to [...] "fit" [...] in at Marvel, they must <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> [...] "take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment", yet keep it connected.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Atlas Society, Ross related that her approach to Eve was inspired by Ayn Rand's objectivist philosophy. She said that Eve was [...] "always willing to make sacrifices, and there's always somebody willing, as Ayn Rand said, to take any sacrifices you {{might be willing to}} make." [...] She compared Eve to Catherine Halsey in Rand's 1943 novel, The Fountainhead, particularly around the middle of the novel, before Catherine [...] "was completely destroyed". Ross described Eve as [...] "a self-sacrificing animal", and emphasized that her character was distinct from her own self-identification as an individualist. Ross said that her portrayal of Eve was also influenced by Eve White, a character with dissociative identity disorder played by Joanne Woodward in the 1957 film The Three Faces of Eve. The actress researched books on sociopaths and psychopaths to help her approach Eve's desire to hide her past at any cost. During the filming process, she kept a diary to help her better <b>understand</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> approach future scenes. Ross also used the 2001 novel [...] to inform her interpretation of Eve's past. She expressed surprise that Eve's relationship with Julian was [...] "a real short courtship" [...] that turned the character from [...] "the innocent girl to the woman on the Studio 54 dance floor having sex". After adjusting her perception of Eve's past, Ross chose to play the character's descent into drugs and prostitution as [...] "more immediate, wild and impulsive" [...] and [...] "very untamed and unrestrained".|$|E
