25|$|From 1962 to 1972, Allen headed IP, the Communist Party's {{publishing}} house. Allen {{recalled that}} he initially {{did not wish}} to stay in book publishing, as he had no background in business affairs and <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would leave little time for research and writing. However, the retiring founder, Trachtenberg, had prevailed upon Allen to accept the position as chief of the financially-troubled firm.|$|E
25|$|While the {{diagnosis}} of brain death has become accepted {{as a basis for}} the certification of death for legal purposes, it should be clearly <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a very different state from biological death - the state universally recognized and understood as death. The continuing function of vital organs in the bodies of those diagnosed brain dead, if mechanical ventilation and other life-support measures are continued, provides optimal opportunities for their transplantation.|$|E
25|$|By a {{bilateral}} treaty signed in Stockholm on 3 March 1813, Sweden promised the British {{that they would}} make a common front against Napoleon's France. In return, the British would have to support the ambitions of Stockholm on Norway. Pragmatically, Karl XIV Johan indeed <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was time for Sweden to abandon Finland (lost in 1809) and to spread the kingdom westward. Besides, Great Britain offered the colony of Guadeloupe to Karl XIV Johan personally to seal this new alliance.|$|E

25|$|Several {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of general relativity it was realized that it cannot be the complete theory of gravity because it is incompatible with quantum mechanics. Later it was <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is possible to describe gravity {{in the framework of}} quantum field theory like the other fundamental forces. In this framework the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of virtual gravitons, {{in the same way as}} the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual photons. This reproduces general relativity in the classical limit, but only at the linearized level and postulating that the conditions for the applicability of Ehrenfest theorem holds, which is not always the case. Besides, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the Planck length.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} days of communication, diplomats and {{military}} commanders <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to provide some mechanism to protect the confidentiality of correspondence and to have some means of detecting tampering. Julius Caesar is credited with the invention of the Caesar cipher c. 50 B.C., which was created in order to prevent his secret messages from being read should a message fall into the wrong hands, {{but for the most part}} protection was achieved through the application of procedural handling controls. Sensitive information was marked up to indicate that it should be protected and transported by trusted persons, guarded and stored in a secure environment or strong box. As postal services expanded, governments created official organizations to intercept, decipher, read and reseal letters (e.g. the UK Secret Office and Deciphering Branch in 1653).|$|E

500|$|Early in 1868, Trollope was {{approached}} by E. S. Dallas, a fellow member of the Garrick Club. Dallas had just been appointed editor of Once A Week, a magazine published by the firm of Bradbury and Evans.

500|$|The Game Gear {{version was}} well received. In a {{retrospective}} review, Ron DelVillano from NintendoLife praised the game's {{wide variety of}} game modes but noted the soundtrack's lack of diversity. DelVillano also thought that the graphics had not aged well as of 2013, but accepted that games in the puzzle genre did not require prominent visuals. In similar vein, a reviewer from Joypad opined that the game's graphics were not [...] "a joy" [...] to look at, but <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "normal" [...] for a game of that genre. Neal Ronaghan of Nintendo World Report lauded the game's addicting and [...] "fun" [...] puzzle-orientated gameplay, but admitted it contained flaws due to {{the limitations of the}} Game Gear.|$|E

[...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So I took some young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E
500|$|By May 1968, Brodie was {{committed}} to writing the biography. [...] She <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could not be a}} full account. The study of Jefferson had become a virtual career for several living historians. [...] For instance, Dumas Malone {{was in the process of}} completing a six-volume biography of Jefferson, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975. Brodie decided to concentrate on a biography of “the private man.” She decided to build on several recently published articles on the historical controversy describing a reported sexual relationship between Jefferson and Sally Hemings, a quadroon slave said to be the half-sister of his late wife. The topic was timely during a period of increased national interest in race, sex, and presidential hypocrisy. [...] Brodie had personal reasons as well, having discovered that her husband had been conducting an extramarital affair.|$|E

500|$|In 1638, Roger Williams {{established}} {{a church in}} Providence which {{is now known as}} the First Baptist Church in America. The next Baptist congregation was established by John Clarke on Rhode Island and likely had its beginnings when he arrived on the island in 1638. [...] Massachusetts Governor John Winthrop wrote that there were [...] "professed Anabaptists" [...] on the island from 1640 to 1641. Boston lawyer Thomas Lechford wrote that there was a church on the island in 1640 of which Clarke was the elder or pastor, but he <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been dissolved. [...] Nevertheless, Clarke conducted public worship in Newport from the time of his arrival until 1644, when a church at Newport was founded. The church remains active as a Reformed Baptist Church and carries the name of United Baptist Church, John Clarke Memorial in honor of its founder.|$|E
500|$|... "The Same Old Story" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw thought the episode seemed [...] "all over the place", and wasn't {{sure what to}} think. She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl's eye in order to identity her killer, and the cliffhanger at the very end, when Walter states [...] "If you've read my file, then you know the truth about Peter's medical history". Travis Fickett of IGN thought {{it was better than}} the pilot; though it was [...] "laden with lots of clunky exposition and clichéd dialogue," [...] Fickett <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was needed to acquaint new viewers to the show. Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe {{has the potential to be}} a [...] "great show", and he also praised the production level as [...] "top notch", and Torv's performance as [...] "very good" [...] as she [...] "brings a unique presence to the show". The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C+, while Television Without Pity graded it with a B.|$|E
500|$|During World War II Mayall {{became an}} {{important}} influence on Lick Observatory's future. [...] Ever since 1931, when he had returned to Lick and Berkley after serving two years as an assistant at Mount Wilson, he had felt strongly that Mount Hamilton required a larger telescope. [...] The astronomers at Lick were proud {{of their ability to}} achieve important results with Lick's small [...] Crossley reflector. [...] Its diminutive size first became apparent in 1908, when Mount Wilson's [...] telescope saw first light. This was accentuated by the opening of the [...] Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in 1917, and Mount Wilson's even larger [...] Hooker telescope in 1919. [...] Mayall was adept at working with the small Crossley, but <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> could never really stand up to a competing telescope that collected nine times the amount of light. [...] This was only going to get worse when the [...] Hale Telescope was completed at Palomar Observatory. [...] Mayall and other young faculty at Lick thought that the older faculty such as Moore and Wright were too committed to the small telescopes and should have tried harder to obtain a larger reflector.|$|E

500|$|Later that year, Tubman {{became the}} first woman to lead an armed assault during the Civil War. When Montgomery and his troops {{conducted}} an assault on a collection of plantations along the Combahee River, Tubman served as a key adviser and accompanied the raid. On the morning of June 2, 1863, Tubman guided three steamboats around Confederate mines in the waters leading to the shore. Once ashore, the Union troops set fire to the plantations, destroying infrastructure and seizing thousands of dollars worth of food and supplies. When the steamboats sounded their whistles, slaves throughout the area <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was being liberated. Tubman watched as slaves stampeded toward the boats. [...] "I never saw such a sight," [...] she said later, describing a scene of chaos with women carrying still-steaming pots of rice, pigs squealing in bags slung over shoulders, and babies hanging around their parents' necks. Although their owners, armed with handguns and whips, tried to stop the mass escape, their efforts were nearly useless in the tumult. As Confederate troops raced to the scene, steamboats packed full of slaves took off toward Beaufort.|$|E
500|$|Digital Spy writer Catriona Wightman {{found the}} episode [...] "completely absurd" [...] but [...] "brillantly entertaining." [...] Morgan Glennon of BuddyTV wrote, [...] "Despite how ridiculous it was seeing {{character}} after character after character {{try to save}} Blair from her own stupid decisions, Gossip Girl really {{knows how to do}} big events. After 100 episodes, the show <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> needed to go big to top off the royal wedding storyline. So the wedding, and attendant quest to stop it, was as big, dramatic and heartfelt as Gossip Girl at its best." [...] Glennon also conceded about the Gossip Girl reveal, the show can still pull out those OMG moments. Glennon found Georgina [...] "amazing" [...] in the episode, [...] "you can't even take your eyes off her because she's so great in every scene." [...] However, The Atlantic Wire thought the writers [...] "should have waited until the last-ever episode to do the unveiling" [...] of Gossip Girl and questioned, [...] "isn't that indicative of the show's greater failings over these past four and a half years? That constant need of this once-promising show to tip its hand too soon?" [...] and concluded [...] "we think the time has finally come to remove Gossip Girl from our bookmarks." ...|$|E

In his cases he referred to the parties by name in his judgments rather than as [...] "plaintiff" [...] and [...] "defendant" [...] and used short sentences and a [...] "storytelling" [...] style of speech shown in the case Beswick v Beswick where his judgment started:Old Peter Beswick was a coal merchant in Eccles, Lancashire. He had no business premises. All he had was a lorry, scales, and weights. He used to take the lorry to the yard of the National Coal Board, where he bagged coal and took it round to his customers in the neighbourhood. His nephew, John Joseph Beswick, helped him in his business. In March 1962, old Peter Beswick and his wife were both over 70. He had had his leg amputated and was not in good health. The nephew was anxious to get hold of the business before the old man died. So they went to a solicitor, Mr. Ashcroft, who drew up an agreement for them.|$|E
