5|$|Fully aquatic mammals, the {{cetaceans}} and sirenians, {{have lost}} their legs and have a tail fin to propel themselves through the water. Flipper movement is continuous. Whales swim by moving their tail fin and lower body <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> propelling themselves through vertical movement, while their flippers are mainly used for steering. Their skeletal anatomy allows them to be fast swimmers. Most species have a dorsal fin to prevent themselves from turning upside-down in the water. The flukes of sirenians are raised <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in long strokes to move the animal forward, and can be twisted to turn. The forelimbs are paddle-like flippers which aid in turning and slowing.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. <b>Up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> quarks {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It did away with the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of her seventh and final journey for American Export, Siboney was handed over on 28May 1941 to the U.S.Army for transport duty. After a hasty outfitting, the redesignated USAT Siboney was put to work transporting troops. Based in New York, she made trips <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the Atlantic and into the Caribbean, and, {{by the end of}} 1941, had called at Bermuda, San Juan, Trinidad, St. John's, Charleston, Newport News, Cristóbal, Jamaica, and Panama.|$|E

5|$|Elementary fermions {{are grouped}} into three generations, each {{comprising}} two leptons and two quarks. The first generation includes <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> quarks, the second strange and charm quarks, {{and the third}} bottom and top quarks. All searches for a fourth generation of quarks and other elementary fermions have failed, and there is strong indirect evidence that {{no more than three}} generations exist. Particles in higher generations generally have greater mass and less stability, causing them to decay into lower-generation particles by means of weak interactions. Only first-generation (<b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down)</b> quarks occur commonly in nature. Heavier quarks can only be created in high-energy collisions (such as in those involving cosmic rays), and decay quickly; however, they are thought to have been present during the first fractions of a second after the Big Bang, when the universe was in an extremely hot and dense phase (the quark epoch). Studies of heavier quarks are conducted in artificially created conditions, such as in particle accelerators.|$|E

5|$|Iyo Railway {{bus service}} runs <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the peninsula, {{to and from}} Yawatahama, and offers express buses from Misaki to Matsuyama.
