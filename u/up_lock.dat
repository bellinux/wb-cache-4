5000|$|The series follows Sue Barton {{through her}} nurse's {{training}} {{and her work}} life. In Sue Barton: Student Nurse, Sue begins training as a student nurse. She meets her friends Kit and Connie in this book and also her husband-to-be, Dr Bill Barry. Sue manages to {{have a number of}} adventures as she trains, including falling down a laundry shaft and saving a feverish patient from jumping out of a window while recovering from appendix surgery. In Sue Barton: Senior Nurse, Sue finishes her training, which includes psychiatric nursing and obstetrics. She also becomes engaged to Bill {{at the end of this}} book. In publisher's note in a 1967 British edition of the book, Boylston stated that all the nursing incidents in the first two books were based on real events. The Kit, Connie and Bill characters were also based on real individuals and used their real names, while others used pseudonyms. She denied that Barton herself was an autobiographical portrait, saying [...] "I made her <b>up,</b> <b>lock,</b> stock and barrel.

5000|$|Boylston lost {{considerable}} sums {{of investment}} {{income in the}} Depression {{and in the early}} 1930s moved east to work again as a nurse.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Boylston began writing and publishing stories more seriously. She published articles and stories in The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's, and Argosy, and wrote a radio script for the Canadian Broadcasting Company. In 1936 Boylston published Sue Barton: Student Nurse, the first of her seven Sue Barton books. In publisher's note in a 1967 British edition of the book, Boylston stated that all the nursing incidents in the first two books were based on real events. The Kit, Connie and Bill characters were also based on real individuals and used their real names, while others used pseudonyms. She denied that Barton herself was an autobiographical portrait, saying [...] "I made her <b>up,</b> <b>lock,</b> stock and barrel. She is the kind of person and the kind of nurse I wished I were, and I {{had a lot of fun}} creating her." [...] The books followed the career of a red-haired nurse as she progressed through her training, career, marriage and motherhood, and sought to maintain her independence. They were significant in providing role models to girls who wanted careers from the 1930s to 1950s, and in being among those that defined the young adult category of literature. [...] The books were highly successful, selling millions of copies in English and translations, and were praised for their authentic representation of nursing practice and freedom from sentimentality. The books have remained in print ever since.|$|E

It will be also demonstrated that this property can be generalized {{to the case of}} PLLs based on coarse time-to-digital converters with mid- rise quantization, whose adoption speeds <b>up</b> <b>lock</b> transients. The results are assessed in a fabricated 3. 6 -GHz fractional-N digital phase-locked loop...|$|E

This paper simulates the {{separate}} lock with shear keys or with flat joints under different design conditions using the ANSYS programme, analyze the mechanical {{effect of the}} shear keys. The variation law of the joint opening，the vertical displacement and foundation stress of lock chamber in different working condition are investigated. The {{research shows that the}} joint opening is biggest under high water-level condition, but simultaneously, the influences of shear keys on the lock chamber structures is small. The vertical displacement and foundation stress of separate lock chamber with trapezoidal shear keys or with flat joints show the similar variation law. Under overhaul condition and built <b>up</b> <b>lock</b> chamber condition, the joint opening of lock with shear keys is smaller than that of lock with flat joints. Under the same conditions, the biggest vertical displacement of the lock with shear keys is smaller than that of lock with flat joints, and the foundation stress distribution of the former is more uniform...|$|E
