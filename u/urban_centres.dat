5|$|People {{from the}} {{overpopulated}} western highlands and the underdeveloped north {{are moving to}} the coastal plantation zone and <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> for employment. Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations {{in the south and}} east. Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the emperor}} by others might be gained at the daily {{reception}} (salutatio), a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their general approval or displeasure as a group at the games held in large venues. By the 4th century, as <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> decayed, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions.|$|E
5|$|During Gage's {{administration}} political tensions rose {{throughout the}} American colonies. As a result, Gage began withdrawing {{troops from the}} frontier to fortify <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> like New York City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, {{the need to provide}} adequate food and housing for these troops became urgent. Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and outbuildings, but not private residences.|$|E

Wood carving and oil painting are also popular in more <b>urban</b> <b>centres,</b> with many of the items produced being sold to tourists. There are several internationally recognised literary figures from Malawi, including poet Jack Mapanje, history and fiction writer Paul Zeleza and authors Legson Kayira, Felix Mnthali, Frank Chipasula and David Rubadiri.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} growth rate was higher {{during the decade}} of 1981–90 due to increased provision of social, economic and recreational facilities that caused the rural population to migrate to urban areas. The overall growth rate had declined {{over the last two}} decades due to poor returns in agriculture and increased migration of agricultural labourers to other <b>urban</b> <b>centres.</b> The population density of the town is high in the centre and low in the peripheral regions.|$|E
5|$|As {{successful}} self-determination movements {{spread throughout}} Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly {{frustrated by the}} nation's continued subservience to foreign rule. For the other side, many enculturated indigenous Africans who were fully integrated into the Portugal-ruled social organization of Portuguese Mozambique, in particular those from the <b>urban</b> <b>centres,</b> reacted to the independentist claims {{with a mixture of}} discomfort and suspicion. The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast-paced development projects.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixteenth}} century perhaps ten per cent of the {{population}} lived {{in one of the}} many burghs. A characteristic of Scottish burghs were long main streets of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today. Many houses in Scottish towns had forms derived from those in major <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> in Tuscany and the Low Countries, although realised with traditional Scottish techniques and materials. Timber-framed houses were common across <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> in Europe, but, perhaps because of the shortage of large timbers and an abundance of workable stone in Scotland, houses with only timber fronts were more common. Despite the logistical problems timbered houses enjoyed a resurgence in the late sixteenth century, particularly in Edinburgh where there were large numbers of board, jettied and boarded construction. Increasingly half-timbered houses occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town houses of merchants and the urban gentry. By the late seventeenth century these had taken on a recognisably Flemish or Dutch appearance. They were often narrow, with four stories, gabled and crow stepped, but often built in stone and harl. They sometimes had ground floor arcades or piazzas. Most wooden thatched houses have not survived, but stone houses of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-story Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements.|$|E
5|$|Kuching, {{like most}} towns in Sarawak, has {{connections}} to other <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> and settlements by water transport. Between {{the banks of}} Sarawak River, near the city centre, many 'tambang' (traditional roofed wooden sampan) can be seen carrying passengers from one riverbank to another. For those staying along the river banks, it is a short way to getting to the city-proper. The wharf for express boats servicing transport to further areas such as Sibu and Bintulu, {{is located in the}} east of the city at the Sim Kheng Hong Port (formerly known as the Tanah Puteh Port) in Pending.|$|E
5|$|Railroads {{reached their}} {{maturity}} {{in the early}} 20th century, as trains carried the bulk of land freight and passenger traffic in the industrialized countries of the world. By the mid-20th century, however, they had lost their preeminent position. The private automobile had replaced the railroad for short passenger trips, while the airplane had usurped it for long-distance travel, especially in the United States. Railroads remained effective, however, for transporting people in high-volume situations, such as commuting between the centres of large cities and their suburbs, and medium-distance travel of less than about 300 miles between <b>urban</b> <b>centres.</b>|$|E

Remote areas are classified as remote <b>centres</b> (<b>urban</b> <b>centre</b> population > 4,999) through to those areas with less than 5,000 inhabitants. The Commonwealth Department of Health utilises a similar classification structure called the Australian Standard Geographical Classification - Remoteness Area which {{was created by the}} Australian Bureau of Statistics. Alongside its 'Districts of Workforce Shortage' data, the Department provides interactive mapping of the Country.|$|R
5|$|Since the 2006 state election, the Democractic Action Party (DAP) has derived the {{majority}} of its support from <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> and became the largest opposition party in Sarawak. In 2010, it formed the Pakatan Rakyat coalition with Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and Parti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS); the latter two parties had become active in Sarawak between 1996 and 2001. Sarawak is the only state in Malaysia where West Malaysia-based component parties in the BN coalition, especially the UMNO, have not been active in state politics.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 Malaysian Census {{reported}} {{the population of}} Sabah at 3,543,500, being the third most populous state in Malaysia and have the highest non-citizens population at 870,400. However, as Malaysia {{is one of the}} least densely populated countries in Asia, Sabah is particularly sparsely populated with most of the population concentrated in the coastal areas since towns and <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> have massively expanded. People from Sabah are generally called Sabahans and identify themselves as such. There is an estimate of 42 ethnic groups with over 200 sub-ethnic groups with their own language, culture and beliefs which predicted to be increase more in the future due to high interracial marriage and recent migration.|$|E

5|$|The {{main area}} of inhabitation of Bantu ethnic {{minorities}} in Somalia {{has historically been}} in village enclaves in the south, particularly between the Jubba and Shebelle river valleys {{as well as the}} Bakool and Bay regions. Beginning in the 1970s, more Bantus began moving to <b>urban</b> <b>centres</b> such as Mogadishu and Kismayo. The displacement caused by the onset of the civil war in the 1990s further increased the number of rural minorities migrating to urban areas. As a consequence of these movements, Mogadishu's traditional demographic makeup changed significantly over the years.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} habitats of {{this species}} were the semi-arid savanna, thornveld, and light woodland typical of southern Africa. When settled agriculture arrived in its range about a thousand years ago, it adapted to cultivated land, and since the arrival of settlement, it has moved into towns. The Cape sparrow prefers habitats with an annual rainfall of less than , though in desert areas it is usually found near watercourses or watering holes. While it occurs in <b>urban</b> <b>centres,</b> it prefers parks, gardens, and other open spaces, and has a low reproductive success in more built-up areas.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's natural {{resources}} {{are very well}} suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. <b>Urban</b> <b>centres</b> are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.|$|E
