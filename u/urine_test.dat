Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. <b>Urine</b> <b>test</b> kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E

She cooperated with the USADA and provided them with the necessary information to prove that it was a mistake. Her story checked out and she was cleared with a public warning. The positive test did not require Solo to withdraw from any pre-Olympic matches.|$|E

Though a <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of his hair in October. Since {{it was his first}} recorded offence with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged. He later claimed to have accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. Because he was not charged, he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E

This assisted the federation in detecting athlete's potential usage of banned substances, including steroids, human growth hormone, EPO and blood doping. In addition to the mandatory blood tests, the IAAF also conducted around 500 <b>urine</b> <b>tests</b> at the championships in three groups: all medallists were subjected to <b>urine</b> <b>tests,</b> those showing biological passport anomalies were targeted, and random <b>urine</b> <b>tests</b> were also applied. Continuing with procedures initiated at the 2005 edition, all <b>urine</b> <b>tests</b> were scheduled for long-term storage to allow retrospective testing in future. All athlete samples were processed at the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory accredited by the World Anti-Doping Agency.|$|R

25|$|In July 2007, Sherk {{successfully}} {{defended his}} title against Hermes França at UFC 73. After the fight, the California State Athletic Commission (CSAC) announced that Sherk had {{tested positive for}} Nandrolone, a banned steroid, in a <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> the day prior to the fight. After testing positive for 12ng/ml of Nandrolone, Sherk was fined $2,500 and suspended from competing in California for one year. Sherk's suspension was reduced to six months after appealing his allegations on December 4, 2007, making him eligible to fight in early January 2008. Sherk argued that errors were made in lab testing procedures. He asserted that the lab had failed to properly test the vials used in earlier, positive tests for any remaining steroid content, which may have resulted in his sample becoming contaminated. Quest Diagnostics and the CSAC denied any errors were made.|$|E

500|$|As {{detectable}} {{levels of}} myoglobinemia and myoglobinuria occur, blood tests and urine tests may show {{elevated levels of}} myoglobin. For example, a <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> strip may reveal a positive result for [...] "blood", even though no red blood cells can be identified on microscopy of the urine; this occurs because the reagent on the test strip reacts with myoglobin. The same phenomenon may happen in conditions that lead to hemolysis, the destruction of red blood cells; in hemolysis the blood serum is also visibly discolored, while in rhabdomyolysis it is normal. If kidney damage has occurred, microscopy of the urine also reveals urinary casts that appear pigmented and granular.|$|E

A second test conducted by an independent laboratory showed normal testosterone levels. Braun appealed the positive drug test in January 2012, and a three-member panel overturned the results on a 2-to-1 vote on February 22, 2012.

The International Tennis Federation's report on the matter states that [...] "the very low estimated concentration of benzoylecgonine (42 ng/ml) was such that it would go unreported in many drug testing programmes such as that of the US military, which uses a screening threshold of 150 ng/ml." [...] As the amount was so low, Hingis appealed, arguing the likely cause was contamination rather than intentional ingestion. In January 2008, the International Tennis Federation's tribunal suspended Hingis from the sport for two years, effective from October 2007.|$|E
2500|$|The proper {{interpretation}} of the data is considered controversial only by those opposed to amalgam. The vast majority of past studies have concluded that amalgams are safe. However, although {{the vast majority of}} patients with amalgam fillings are exposed to levels too low to pose a risk to health, many patients (i.e. those in the upper 99.9 percentile) exhibit <b>urine</b> <b>test</b> results which are comparable to the maximum allowable legal limits for long-term work place (occupational) safety. Two recent randomized clinical trials in children discovered no statistically significant differences in adverse neuropsychological or renal effects observed over a five-year period in children whose caries were restored using dental amalgam or composite materials. In contrast, one study showed a trend of higher dental treatment need later in children with composite dental fillings, and thus claimed that amalgam fillings are more durable. However, the other study (published in JAMA) cites increased mercury blood levels in children with amalgam fillings. The study states, [...] "during follow-up [...] 1.0 to 1.5 μg higher in the amalgam group than in the composite group." [...] EPA considers high blood mercury levels to be harmful to the fetus and also states that, [...] "exposure at high levels can harm the brain, heart, kidneys, lungs, and immune system of people of all ages." [...] Currently, EPA has set the [...] "safe" [...] mercury exposure level to be at 5.8 μg of mercury per one liter of blood. While mercury fillings themselves do not increase mercury levels above [...] "safe" [...] levels, they have been shown to contribute to such increase. However, such studies were unable to find any negative neurobehavioral effects.|$|E
