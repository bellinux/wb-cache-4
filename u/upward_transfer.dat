This blocking pattern causes Rossby waves with zonal wavenumber 1 and/or 2 {{to grow to}} unusually large amplitudes. The growing wave propagates into the stratosphere and decelerates the mean zonal winds. Thus the polar night jet weakens and simultaneously becomes distorted by the growing planetary waves. Because the wave amplitude increases with decreasing density this easterly acceleration process is not effective at fairly high levels. If the waves are sufficiently strong the mean zonal flow may decelerate sufficiently so that the winter westerlies turn easterly. At this point planetary waves may no longer penetrate into the stratosphere [...] ). Hence further <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> of energy is completely blocked and a very rapid easterly deceleration and the polar warming occur at this critical level, which must then move downward until eventually the warming and zonal wind reversal affect the entire polar stratosphere.|$|E

A significant portion {{of community college students}} aspire to transfer to a four-year college or university, but only 23 % to 40 % make this transition within six years of initial enrollment with disturbing racial/ethnic disparities. Existing studies offer sociological explanations for the persistent disparity in <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> rates between White community college students and lower rates for African American and Latino community college students. The present theory-driven study aims to better explicate the social psychological factors that motivate community college students interested in <b>upward</b> <b>transfer.</b> This study seeks to better understand whether the constructs central to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) explain variation in African American and Latino students’ intentions to transfer from a community college to a four-year college or university. Structural equation modeling was used with a sample of 154 African American and 831 Latino community college students enrolled at 6 institutions across the United States to test and extend the theory of planned behavior. Additional questions assessed whether policy-relevant collegiate experiences moderate intentions to transfer. Study findings support the importance of racial/ethnic-specific patterns, with clear distinctions between TPB predictors of transfer intentions for African American and Latino students. For the Latino students, significant attitudes reflected underlying beliefs about the instrumentality of transfer; subjective norms reflected expectations of non-academic; and academic individuals; and control considerations included lack of academic capacity and financial constraints. The results also show that students who participated in developmental education courses or had a positive perception of transfer climate report differences in intentions to transfer. Future research should go beyond TPB concepts to better understand social psychological mechanisms that motivate transfer intentions for African American community college students.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between ocean surface waves and the overlying wind {{leads to a}} transfer of momentum across the air–sea interface. Atmospheric and oceanic models typically allow for momentum transfer to be directed only downward, from the atmosphere to the ocean. Recent observations have suggested that momentum can also be <b>transferred</b> <b>upward</b> when long wavelength waves, characteristic of remotely generated swell, propagate faster than the wind speed. The effect of <b>upward</b> momentum <b>transfer</b> on the marine atmospheric boundary layer is investigated here using idealized models that solve the momentum budget above the ocean surface. A variant of the classical Ekman model that accounts for the wave-induced stress demonstrates that, although the momentum flux due to the waves penetrates {{only a small fraction}} of the depth of the boundary layer, the wind profile is profoundly changed through its whole depth. When the <b>upward</b> momentum <b>transfer</b> from surface waves sufficiently exceeds the downward turbulent momentum flux, then the near-surface wind accelerates, resulting in a low-level wave-driven wind jet. This increases the Coriolis force in the boundary layer, and so the wind turns in the opposite direction to the classical Ekman layer. Calculations of the wave-induced stress due to a wave spectrum representative of fast-moving swell demonstrate <b>upward</b> momentum <b>transfer</b> that is dominated by contributions from waves in the vicinity of the peak in the swell spectrum. This is in contrast to wind-driven waves whose wave-induced stress is dominated by very short wavelength waves. Hence the role of swell can be characterized by the inverse wave age based on the wave phase speed corresponding to the peak in the spectrum. For a spectrum of waves, the total momentum flux is found to reverse sign and become upward, from waves to wind, when the inverse wave age drops below the range 0. 15 – 0. 2, which agrees reasonably well with previously published oceanic observations...|$|R
40|$|We {{explain how}} <b>upward</b> <b>transfers</b> from adult {{children}} to their elderly parents might evolve as an interrelated feature of a deepening intergenerational division of labor. Humans have a particularly {{long period of}} juvenile dependence requiring both food and care time provided mainly by younger and older adults. We suggest that {{the division of labor}} evolves to exploit comparative advantage between young and old adults in fertility, childcare and foraging. Eventually the evolving division of labor reaches a limit when the grandmother's fertility reaches zero (menopause). Continuing, it may hit another limit when the grandmother's foraging time has been reduced to her subsistence needs. Further specialization can occur only with food transfers to the grandmother, enabling her to reduce her foraging time to concentrate on additional childcare. We prove that this outcome can arise only after menopause has evolved. We describe the conditions necessary for both group selection (comparative steady state reproductive fitness) and individual selection (successful invasion by a mutation), and interpret these conditions in terms of comparative advantages. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 My {{dissertation}} utilizes an explanatory, sequential mixed-methods {{research design}} to assess factors influencing community college students' transfer probability to baccalaureate-granting institutions and to present promising practices {{in colleges and}} states directed at improving <b>upward</b> <b>transfer,</b> particularly for low-income and first-generation college students. First, the dissertation features multi-level random-effects model analyses to better understand how factors such as students' academic and social integration, community college characteristics and expenditures, and state transfer policy components influence community college students' 2 / 4 transfer probability[1] over a recent six-year period (utilizing the Beginning Postsecondary Study 2003 - 2009). Second, comparative case studies of six community colleges[2] in three states (Florida, Georgia, and Washington) report about how community colleges and state policy leaders currently engage in experimentation and innovation[3] in seeking to improve students' 2 / 4 transfer, and how they use data to inform decision-making on this issue. The case studies consider ways in which community college and state policy leaders make decisions regarding improving students' transfer prospects, the types of promising initiatives being implemented, and what is being learned from them. The case study design used above-average compared to average performers[4] to illustrate field implementation dynamics that may influence student transfer outcomes, and provide deeper examination of issues affecting community college students as they are making the decision to transfer to a four-year institution, {{with the goal of}} improving policies and practices. Similar to other researchers' findings, I found that most state policy variables[5] designed to affect transfer demonstrated little or no statistical association with the probability of transfer, after controlling for state wealth (gross state product per capita (GSP), shown {{to be associated with the}} historic rise of state cooperative agreements facilitating transfer in the 1980 s and 1990 s). Gross state product per capita is also highly positively correlated with the percentage of the state's population with bachelor's degrees, also significantly associated with increased <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> probability. The close correlation between state wealth and the proportion of state residents with a bachelor's degree education are likely proxies for a state's social capital and stronger demand for affordable access to college education by state residents, which may be accomplished through 2 / 4 transfer educational options in the state's public higher education sector. Even though state transfer policy components did not show significant overall effects in the multi-level regression, the presence of common course numbering was associated with increased transfer probability among first generation students (to earn a bachelor's degree), compared with non-first generation students. Findings from the case studies center on four main areas: 1) the role of academic and transfer advising, 2) data use for decision support with respect to improving students' progress toward transfer, 3) leadership strategies for developing and assessing interventions to increase transfer, and 4) the role of state policies in framing and supporting colleges to improve students' <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> rates. This dissertation identifies some promising strategies, interventions, and practices among colleges with above-average transfer rates compared with colleges with average transfer rates. While colleges have implemented a range of interventions to improve supports for <b>upward</b> <b>transfer,</b> such as mandatory student advising, transfer fairs and transfer advising programs, there is still considerable room for improvement. Even among the better-performing colleges, too many students, particularly those most at risk of not transferring, may not have sufficient, coordinated supports to successfully complete transfer from their lower-division courses to upper-division coursework leading to a bachelor's degree. [1] " 2 / 4 transfer" is an abbreviated term for <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> by community college or lower-division students to a bachelor's degree program or baccalaureate-granting institution. Institutions that primarily award associate's degrees are generally two-year institutions, based on the model of completion of an associate's degree program in two years. Baccalaureate-granting institutions and programs are generally modeled to be completed in four years, and may be called four-year institutions. [2] Georgia does not have community colleges. Rather, the University System of Georgia has 15 "access institutions" called state colleges that are primarily associates' degree granting institutions, and most offer limited baccalaureate degrees. My case study institutions include two of these access institutions. Most of Florida's community colleges have their own baccalaureate degree programs in specialized occupational fields, including one of the case study colleges selected in that state. For simplicity, I refer to colleges as community colleges throughout the paper, though different institutions may offer some range of baccalaureate programs or be in the process of obtaining approval for a bachelor's degree program(s). [3] "Experimentation" may take the form of a grant-supported new initiative with an evaluation component that includes quasi-experimental design, or it may be more loosely structured as a new initiative or policy change designed to improve student success outcomes associated with transfer, accompanied by documentation and evaluation of the results. Research on innovation has emphasized how organizational teaming structures can support creative decision-making and the generation of new knowledge guiding change in values, beliefs, and behaviors in the organization (Nilsson, 2003). [4] College <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> rate for the fall 2006 first-time-in-college cohort was used as a basis for analysis finding outliers (+ 2 standard deviations), using state-level data (Florida and Washington used three year transfer rates, and Georgia used four-year transfer rates for the fall 2006 cohort). While the average-performing colleges selected in Florida and Washington were average performers according to state-level data on <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> rates, there is also evidence from the IPEDS data on transfer-out rates for first-time, full-time students that three-year transfer rates were rising from 2008 - 2011. [5] State articulation and transfer policies include several components, as catalogued by the Education Commission of the States (ECS) in 2001 and 2010 (imputed here for 2005 - 06, two years after BPS 2003 students' postsecondary entry). ECS transfer policy components are: presence of articulation and transfer legislation; cooperative agreements between institutions and/or departments at 2 - and 4 -year institutions; transfer data reporting to state higher education commissions, departments, and authorities; transfer incentives and rewards (such as priority admission and scholarships); presence of a statewide course articulation guide; statewide common core or general transferable curriculum; and common course numbering (across two and four-year institutions) ...|$|E

Drawing on this literature, this paper examines intergenerational transfers between small farmers and their non-coresident children in the rural area around the city of Altamira, Pará, Brazil. We apply GoM (Grade of Membership) models to create profiles of private transfers, using data collected in 2005 by a team from Indiana University. The results show three profiles: low intergenerational transfers, high levels of transfers of visits and help, {{and high levels of}} transfers of visits and money. There is no clear difference in profile by birth order, but we do find sex differences in profile.

The <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> of heat from ocean to atmosphere is examined for an Arctic "lead, " {{a break in}} the Arctic ice which allows contact between the cold atmosphere and the relatively warm ocean. We employ a large-eddy modelto compute explicitly the three-dimensional turbulent response of the atmosphere to a lead of 200 m width. The surface heat flux creates a turbulent "plume " of individual quasi-random eddies, not a continuous updraft, which penetrate into the stable atmosphere and transport heat upward. Maximum updraft velocities and turbulence occur downwind of the lead rather than over the lead itself, because the development time of an individual thermal eddy is longer than its transit time across the lead. The affected vertical region, while shallow over the lead itself, grows to a height of 65 m at 600 m downwind of the lead; beyond that, the depth of the turbulent region decreases a...|$|E

In order to observe the practical consequences of errors in a survey; the District Level Household and Facility Survey (DLHS- 3) is used as an example dataset.

Illiteracy, rural residence and poor economic condition are the major factors that lead to age misreporting. Female were excluded from the eligible age group, to reduce the duration of interview.

40|$|Stably {{stratified}} canopy flow {{in complex}} terrain {{has been considered}} a difficult condition for measuring net ecosystem–atmosphere exchanges of carbon, water vapor, and energy. A long-standing advection error in eddy-flux measurements is caused by stably stratified canopy flow. Such a condition with strong thermal gradient and less turbulent air is also difficult for modeling. To understand the challenging atmospheric condition for eddy-flux measurements, we use the renormalized group (RNG) k –ϵ turbulence model to investigate the main characteristics of stably stratified canopy flows in complex terrain. In this two-dimensional simulation, we imposed persistent constant heat flux at ground surface and linearly increasing cooling rate in the upper-canopy layer, vertically varying dissipative force from canopy drag elements, buoyancy forcing induced from thermal stratification and the hill terrain. These strong boundary effects keep nonlinearity in the two-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations high enough to generate turbulent behavior. The fundamental characteristics of nighttime canopy flow over complex terrain measured by {{the small number of}} available multi-tower advection experiments can be reproduced by this numerical simulation, such as (1) unstable layer in the canopy and super-stable layers associated with flow decoupling in deep canopy and near the top of canopy; (2) sub-canopy drainage flow and drainage flow near the top of canopy in calm night; (3) <b>upward</b> momentum <b>transfer</b> in canopy, downward heat transfer in upper canopy and <b>upward</b> heat <b>transfer</b> in deep canopy; and (4) large buoyancy suppression and weak shear production in strong stability...|$|R

The results show that, the response of temperature under SP onset involves a significant positive anomaly, with a symmetric distribution about the equator over the Indian Ocean region in the lower troposphere (850 [*]hPa) and a negative anomaly in the lower stratosphere (50 [*]hPa). Meanwhile, in the area 30 °N and 30 °S of the equator, most parts of the lower stratosphere feature a positive anomaly. This indicates that SP El Niño events are more conducive than SU events to warming the lower stratosphere. The atmospheric circulation structure over the tropical Indian Ocean is beneficial to the <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> of warm air to the upper layer. In contrast, the structure over the tropical Pacific Ocean favors the warming of upper air.

An important activity of highly nonlinear semidiurnal internal tides having peak-to-peak isopycnal displacements of up to 80 m is identified.

40|$|Background: After {{the reunification}} of Germany, {{mortality}} among older eastern Germans converged quickly with western German levels. Simultaneously, the pension benefits of eastern Germans rose tenfold. Objective: We make use of German reunification as a natural experiment to show that, first, increasing financial transfers from the elderly to their children led to increasing reverse transfers {{in the form of}} care; and, second, this {{rise in the number of}} hours spent on care led to a reduction in old-age mortality. Method: As a first step, we calculated intergenerational transfer profiles by age for eastern and western Germany to determine whether any changes in downward and in <b>upward</b> <b>transfers</b> in the form of time and money occurred since reunification. We use generalized linear regression to test whether rising pensions led to an increase in the number of hours spent on care, and whether this increase led to a reduction in old-age mortality. We use different macro level data sources to test our hypothesis, including mortality rates and time use surveys for East and West Germany and information on private intergenerational transfers from the National Transfer Accounts project for Germany. Results: We show that since German reunification, intergenerational downward transfers more than doubled in percentage terms in the east. This was predominantly caused by the sharp increase in pension benefits since the fall of the Berlin Wall. At the same time, mortality among pensioners dropped markedly, and converged 1 to western German levels. We further show that the rise in pension income was strongly correlated with the increase in social support and the decline in mortality among older eastern Germans. Discussion: Our result suggest that there was an interfamilial monetary transfer from the elderly to the young in exchange for social support. This mutual beneficial exchange may have helped to improve the survival of older East Germans after the reunification...|$|R

The wind-driven wave regime is found to occurmost often in themidlatitude storm tracks where wind speeds are generally high. The wave-driven wind regime is found to be prevalent in the tropics where wind speeds are generally light and swell can propagate from storms at higher latitudes. The inverse wave age is also a useful indicator of the degree of coupling between the local wind and wave fields. The climatologies presented emphasize the nonequilibrium that exists between the local wind and wave fields and highlight the importance of swell in the global oceans. 1...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet-B (UVB, 280 – 320 nm) {{radiation}} {{is a natural}} component of sunlight that harms organisms and disturbs natural communities in surface waters. A natural planktonic assemblage of organisms (� 240 �m) was studied in a mesocosm experiment for 7 d under varying conditions of UVB radiation: UVB excluded, natural radiation, and UVB enhanced at two different levels. The dynamics of several populations at different trophic levels comprising heterotrophic bacteria (� 1 �m), heterotrophic flagellates (2 – 10 �m), small phytoplankton (� 5 �m), large phytoplankton (5 – 20 �m), and ciliates (15 – 35 �m) were monitored during the experiment. Enhanced UVB provoked {{a significant decrease in}} the number of ciliates (66 %) and large phytoplankton (63 %) relative to natural UVB conditions. The severe effects of UVB radiation on ciliates and large phytoplankton communities shown here would strongly limit <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> of mass and energy. The decline of predator abundance (ciliates) under UVB stress relative to natural conditions resulted in a positive feedback between enhanced UVB radiation and prey abundances, shown by increased abundances of bacteria (49 %), heterotrophic flagellates (up to 300 %), and small phytoplankton (41 %). Similarly, with respect to carbon partitioning, the decrease in ciliate and diatom carbon biomass (64 and 56 %, respectively) under enhanced UVB exposure was balanced by an increase in the carbon biomass of heterotrophi...|$|E
40|$|The {{retention}} of gas within corroded magnox sludge waste at Sellafield, UK and secondary reprocessing waste at Hanford, USA has significant economic and safety implications for decommissioning various nuclear legacy buildings, including the magnox swarf storage silos and first generation magnox storage pond. A series of laboratory scale gas retention tests within magnesium hydroxide soft sediments have revealed a 4 - 51 Pa yield stress range where consolidated beds could retain sufficient gas to become buoyant {{with respect to}} a water supernatant. Density inversion could lead to a Rayleigh-Taylor style instability which could result in an <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> of radioactive material from the consolidated bed. The applicable yield stress range suggests that such rollover events may occur in weaker sediment than previously hypothesized, based on current understanding of the fluidization and stable channel mechanisms for gas release from weak and very strong sediments respectively. Xray computed tomography images of gas retained by 7 Pa yield stress soft sediment reveal both a stable foam layer {{at the top of the}} bed and regions dense with microbubbles which could provide pathways for gas transport through the bed. Extension of these pathways, hidden below the surface of the sediment, to the container walls and the foam layer could represent a novel mechanism for gas release from intermediate strength sediments of < 100 Pa yield stress...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEmissions of sulphur 1, 2 and {{transition}} metals 3, 4 from magmas {{in the shallow}} crust have global impacts on human society by affecting climate after volcanic eruptions 5, 6 and by forming giant copper and gold ore deposits, which are massive anomalies of sulphur {{as well as of}} the ore metals themselves 3, 4, 7, 8. These emissions vastly exceed the amounts that could have been derived from the associated magmas themselves 2. Intrusion of denser, hotter, vapour-and sulphide-saturated magma beneath the cooler and more buoyant bodies that are finally erupted is the most probable source of the excess sulphur and metals in eruptive or hydrothermal systems 1, 4, 9, 10. However, the mechanism for the selective <b>upward</b> <b>transfer</b> of sulphur and metals remains poorly understood, because their main carrier phase, sulphide melt, is dense and is generally assumed to settle to the bottoms of magma bodies. Here we show, by experimental observation and by gas speciation and mass balance models, that such transfers may be achieved by the flotation of compound drops 11 comprising droplets of sulphide melt attached to vapour bubbles. By proposing and demonstrating the feasibility of a novel physical mechanism for upward mobility of sulphide liquids, our work provides a mechanism for massive atmospheric releases of sulphur and contradicts widely held assumptions that dense sulphide liquids rich in sulphur, copper, and gold will remain sequestered in the crust...|$|E
40|$|Using {{the fiscal}} {{datasets}} from 1993 to 2003 in China, this paper studies fiscal disparities and the equalization effects of fiscal transfers {{at the county}} level. The results indicate that there are huge fiscal disparities across regions, {{and this kind of}} inequality takes on a lasting upward trend. The persistence of fiscal inequality is very high, and also trends <b>upward.</b> Moreover, <b>transfers</b> from upper governments exaggerate fiscal disparities at the county level. The earmarked subsidies and tax rebates are the most unequal fiscal transfer schemes. The factor transfers have some equalization effects when we take per capita fiscal ability calculated by fiscal-supported population into account, but neutralization effects disappear from the viewpoint of per-capita fiscal ability averaged by total population. Fiscal disparities, Fiscal transfers, Equalization effect, County-level jurisdictions...|$|R

40|$|An earth {{outgoing}} longwave radiation (OLWR) {{climate model}} is presented. The model uses the <b>upward</b> radiative <b>transfer</b> parameterization of Thompson and Warren (1982) for radiation calculations, and a climatologic dataset from Crutcher and Meserve (1970) and Taljaard et al. (1969) to provide data on temperature, dewpoint, and geopotential height for various altitudes. Using {{the model for}} a monthly average radiation budget study, clear sky cases of OLWR were calculated for the global average, zonal averages, and global distributions. The regional results on North and South America were compared with GOES data and were found to agree well. The clear sky case shows that the OLWR field is highly modulated by water vapor, especially in the tropics, where the strongest longitudinal variations in OLWR occur. In the high latitudes, where cold air contains less water vapor, OLWR is basically modulated by the surface temperature...|$|R
