Here and there in a scattered cordon stood the six trusty negro soldiers leaning motionless upon their rifles, and each throwing a shadow which looked as solid as himself.

From the obtained data, it was found that asphalt mixed with 15 % of ENR+ 40 % MA achieves a high stability (16, 632 Newton), air voids of 2. 5 %, flow of 2. 9 mm and mineral voids of 14. 6 %.
