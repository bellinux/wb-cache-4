5|$|Returning to Bedford, Flick hunted, raised horses, built buildings, {{and became}} {{involved}} in selling real estate. He also scouted for Cleveland. Only four 19th century baseball players, including Flick, were still alive in 1970. In his later years, Flick still answered requests for autographs from his fans. Proud of his longevity, Flick often completed autographs by writing the date and his age above or <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> signature.|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 1969, Eduardo Mondlane {{was killed}} by {{explosives}} smuggled into his locale. Many sources state that, {{in an attempt to}} rectify the situation in Mozambique, the Portuguese secret police assassinated Mondlane by sending a parcel to his office in Dar es Salaam. Inside the parcel was a book containing an explosive device, which detonated upon opening. Other sources state that Eduardo was killed when an explosive device detonated <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> chair at the FRELIMO headquarters, and that the faction responsible was never identified.|$|E
60|$|He smiled deprecatingly {{but did not}} speak. He was a tall, lean man, quite round-shouldered and of studious appearance. He wore double eyeglasses, <b>underneath</b> which <b>his</b> {{eyes were}} {{somewhat}} watery. The smile upon his thin features was a stationary one, not as if assumed, but molded with the features and lacking geniality.|$|R

"Wittgenstein was {{insisting that}} a {{proposition}} {{and that which}} it describes must have the same 'logical form', the same 'logical multiplicity', Sraffa made a gesture, familiar to Neapolitans as meaning something like disgust or contempt, of brushing the <b>underneath</b> of <b>his</b> chin with an outward sweep of the finger-tips of one hand.

5|$|With {{the signing}} of Danish goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard, Manchester United allowed Amos to join Oldham Athletic on loan for the {{remainder}} of the season on 7 January 2011, although he would continue to train with Manchester United once a week. He made his debut against Swindon Town the next day and kept a clean sheet. However, three days later, he conceded all six goals in a 6–0 defeat at home to Southampton; he allowed Adam Lallana's 20-yard shot <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> body for the second goal, and he was rounded by Lee Barnard for the sixth.|$|E
5|$|Antichrist Superstar was {{recorded}} at Nothing Studios in New Orleans by an extensive group of musicians, {{including members of}} Marilyn Manson (namely the band's eponymous vocalist, Twiggy Ramirez, Madonna Wayne Gacy, Daisy Berkowitz, and Ginger Fish) and Nine Inch Nails (guitarists Robin Finck and Danny Lohner, and drummer Chris Vrenna). Manson, Trent Reznor and frequent Nine Inch Nails mixer Sean Beavan produced the record, alongside former Skinny Puppy member and longtime producer Dave Ogilvie. The process of creating the album was reputedly a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments involving sleep deprivation, near-constant drug use, as well as self-harm, with Manson indicating that he would regularly insert sewing needles <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> own fingernails. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, with most of this directed toward founding member Daisy Berkowitz.|$|E
5|$|In late May and June he {{collected}} and experimented {{on a number}} of the new Sopwith Pups which began to reach British units in January. He was impressed with the aircraft's agility and flew it often. During this period he met the now famous ace Albert Ball who advised him attack tactics against reconnaissance and bomber aircraft. Ball advised McCudden to fly <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> target, in the blind spot of the observer, and angle his guns directly above then fire. McCudden was intrigued at the prospect and believed this offered a much better chance of shooting down an enemy aircraft. It is not clear if, or how often, McCudden implemented Ball's advice in battle and how many of his victories were claimed that way. McCudden's principal tactics did stress surprise and minimal risk.|$|E

60|$|Northwick did {{not think}} of Wilmington; he thought of himself, and in the depths of his guilty soul, in those secret places <b>underneath</b> all <b>his</b> pretences, where he really knew himself a thief, he {{wondered}} if his child's strength would be against her forgiving his weakness. What we greatly dread we most unquestioningly believe; and it did not occur to him to ask whether impatience with weakness was a necessary inference from strength. He only knew himself to be miserably weak.|$|R
5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> arms.|$|E

25|$|Mithril is {{referenced}} in The Eleven Little Roosters by Christoph Weiss as {{he describes}} how he (as Chris Demarais) survived being shot by arrows in Ten Little Roosters; he had been wearing Mithril armour <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> clothes when he was attacked, although he lost his memory as a result.|$|E
60|$|He {{advanced}} {{a step or}} two {{farther into}} the room, a slim, effeminate-looking person of barely medium height, dressed with the utmost care, of apparently no more than middle age but with crow's-feet about his eyes and sagging pockets of flesh <b>underneath</b> them. <b>His</b> closely trimmed, sandy moustache was streaked with grey, his eyes were a little bloodshot, he had the shrinking manner of one who suffers from habitual nervousness. Josephine, after her first start of surprise, watched him with coldly questioning eyes.|$|R
60|$|Tennyson's work, disencumbered of {{all that}} uninteresting {{accretion}} which he had inherited or copied, resolves itself, like {{that of any other}} man of genius, into those things which he really inaugurated. <b>Underneath</b> all <b>his</b> exterior of polished and polite rectitude there was in him a genuine fire of novelty; only that, like all the able men of his period, he disguised revolution under the name of evolution. He is only a very shallow critic who cannot see an eternal rebel {{in the heart of the}} Conservative.|$|R

25|$|In {{contrast}} to his predecessors François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard, who employed a red or grey undercoat as a base colour {{on which to build}} up the painting, David employed the white background of the canvas directly <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> colours, as some of his unfinished works show, such as his first attempt at a portrait of Bonaparte or his sketch of the Tennis Court Oath.|$|E
25|$|The Kents teach Clark he must {{conceal his}} otherworldly origins and use his fantastic powers to do good. Clark creates the costumed {{identity}} of Superman {{so as to}} protect his personal privacy {{and the safety of}} his loved ones. As Clark Kent, he wears eyeglasses to disguise his face and wears his Superman costume <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> clothes so that he can change at a moment's notice. To complete this disguise, Clark avoids violent confrontation, preferring to slip away and change into Superman when danger arises, and suffers occasional ridicule for his apparent cowardice.|$|E
25|$|In The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy (2001–2003) by Peter Jackson, the Nazgûl {{are almost}} always {{concealed}} by cloaks; however, they appear as white ghostly corpses to Frodo when he is wearing the Ring. The Nazgûl attack the inn themselves. Their deafeningly loud shrieks and fell beasts are highlighted. During the siege of Minas Tirith, the Witch-king of Angmar wears a distinctive helmet over his hood resembling a mask and a crown, {{as opposed to the}} crown worn <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> hood in the book. Their shrieks are distorted recordings of producer and screenwriter Fran Walsh's scream.|$|E
60|$|In stature Gian Maria {{was short}} and inclining, young though he was, to corpulency. His face was round and pale and flabby; his eyes blue and beady; his mouth sensual and cruel. He {{was dressed in a}} suit of lilac velvet, trimmed with lynx fur, and slashed, Spanish fashion, in the sleeves, to show the shirt of fine Rheims linen <b>underneath.</b> About <b>his</b> neck hung a gold chain, bearing an Agnus Dei, which {{contained}} a relic of the True Cross--for Gian Maria pushed his devoutness to great lengths.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{assessment}} comes from friendly debriefing or interview. The interviewing officer may be relaxed and casual, but <b>underneath</b> the surface <b>his</b> attitude {{is one of}} deliberate purpose: {{he is trying to}} find out enough to make an initial judgment of the man sensing the subject's motivations, emotional state and mental processes.|$|R
60|$|He {{changed his}} clothes slowly and unwillingly. I had to bully him, I had almost to shove {{him to the}} airship and tuck him up upon its wicker flat. Single-handed I made but a clumsy start; we scraped along {{the roof of the}} shed and bent a van of the propeller, and for a time I hung <b>underneath</b> without <b>his</b> {{offering}} a hand to help me to clamber up. If it hadn't been for a sort of anchoring trolley device of Cothope's, a sort of slip anchor running on a rail, we should never have got clear at all.|$|R
25|$|Pacha {{does not}} {{discover}} Kuzco until he arrives {{back at the}} village. After the shock and surprise at being a talking llama, Kuzco orders Pacha to return him to the capital. Pacha offers, but only if Kuzco would change his mind about Kuzcotopia. Kuzco refuses the offer and sets off on his own, but quickly ends up {{in trouble with the}} local wildlife. Pacha arrives to rescue him, and extends his offer. Kuzco accepts Pacha's help, though secretly plans to go back on his word once he is safe. The two survive many ordeals in the jungle, and Pacha finds Kuzco has a good side to him <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> ego.|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} {{of their bodies}} when returned by the British authorities to their families supports this assertion. There were extensive signs of discolouring, which seemed to indicate extensive bruising. The army doctor claimed that large staining could occur, and this {{would depend on the}} way the bodies had been lying. He also said that Clancy had been hit with up to five bullets, which made eight wounds; Dick McKee had three wounds caused by two bullets. He said McKee had no bayonet wounds, but there was a bullet lodged <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> skin on the right of his chest. Clune, he said, had nine wounds caused by seven bullets. T. Ryle Dwyer also states that David Neligan was adamant that they had not been bayoneted.|$|E
25|$|Despite her {{attempt on}} his life, which Bennet survived {{with the help}} of Emile Danko, he refuses to start hunting down superhumans as a vigilante, preferring instead to try and start the new Company under better pretenses. While eating in the {{restaurant}} <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> apartment, Tracy Strauss approaches him, apparently to taunt him of his impending death. However, Bennet offers her a unique opportunity to simply walk away; if she does, he pledges to get Danko off her trail—permanently. After recruiting The Haitian to erase Danko's memories, Tracy shows up to kill him, only to find that Danko no longer remembers her. As she leaves, she hears Danko being attacked by an unknown assailant, Edgar, from the carnival, only to be attacked herself. Afterwards, she calls Bennet who discovers a key the assailant was after on Danko's body.|$|E

The two combatants hurtled through jungle flora and fauna in mortal battle. Ikenga mustered the last gram of strength in a titanic muscle flex as he twisted {{the neck of the}} beast which broke with such nerve shattering crack. There were few groans and whimperings followed by death thrubs and ghostly silence pervaded the vast jungle. The Edo and Ododo warriors were stupefied by the incredible spectacle and in a momentary recovery they retreated in disarray.|$|R

25|$|Bilbo {{wore the}} mithril shirt during the Battle of the Five Armies, {{and took it}} {{with him when he}} left the Shire. He donated it to the Mathom-house, a museum in Michel Delving. However he later {{reclaimed}} it for his journey to Rivendell. There, some years later, he gave the shirt to Frodo Baggins when the younger hobbit embarked on his quest in The Lord of The Rings. Frodo wore the mail <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> tunic and other shirt unbeknownst {{to the rest of the}} fellowship. The mail saved Frodo's life when he was hit by a spear thrust from an orc during the battle in the Chamber of Mazarbul, and again when an orc-arrow struck him while escaping Moria. Later, it protected him from another orc-arrow while crossing the River Anduin. In the , Frodo is speared once but survives much to the disbelief of the Fellowship. Upon opening his tunic he reveals the mithril mail much to the amazement of Gimli and Aragorn.|$|E
25|$|Alonso {{started the}} season by {{qualifying}} fifth in Australia; {{by the end}} of the first lap he had moved up to third. He eventually managed to use the pit stops to his advantage by pitting early and jumping Vettel. Alonso held onto second until the end of the race. In Malaysia, Alonso qualified on the second row of the grid in third. Going into the second corner he tapped the back of Vettel and damaged his front wing, the team told him to stay out instead of pitting, hoping that the wing would not break, so that Alonso would be able to pit for slick tyres at the right time. However while going down the main straight at the start of the second lap, his front wing broke off and went <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> car sending it into the gravel trap and into retirement. Alonso then won his home race, the , by fighting through from fifth; however, seventh place in Monaco after that again lost him points and left him 29 points behind Vettel.|$|E
25|$|Elton (Joe Cushley) - Mrs Dribelle's dim-witted sidekick. He is a hardman {{who always}} wears a woolly hat with badges and a denim jacket. He knows that Bodger has a badger {{in the flat}} after Badger hits {{him on the head}} with a frying pan. He is {{incredibly}} stupid and is always trying to prove to Mrs Dribelle that there is a badger in the flat by all means possible, but he never succeeds. In one episode he dressed up as Mrs Dribelle's mother to trick Simon into believing Mrs Dribelle had nowhere to live, so that she could get Simon {{to move out of the}} flat. However Badger, who could see Elton's underpants <b>underneath</b> <b>his</b> skirt, knew it was Elton so he tried to show Simon the underpants. First he pulled the lever when Elton was sitting on the bed which made the bed go back, but it still did not work so Badger thought of another way to show Simon the underpants by turning the vacuum cleaner on, which sucked up the skirt Elton was wearing. Simon then saw the underpants and realised it was Elton. Even though Mrs Dribelle features in Series 7, Elton did not feature after Series 6. He was last seen in the episode 'Badger's Party' where he was attacked by children who were St John Badger Scouts.|$|E
