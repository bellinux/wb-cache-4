40|$|Objective To {{determine}} whether <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> {{at home is}} equally safe and equally effective as <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> in an outpatient setting for patients with psoriasis. Design Pragmatic multicentre single blind randomised clinical trial (PLUTO study). Setting Dermatology departments of 14 hospitals in the Netherlands. Participants 196 patients with psoriasis who were clinically eligible for narrowband (TL- 01) <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy.</b> The first 105 consecutive patients were also followed for one year after therapy. Intervention <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> at home using a TL- 01 home phototherapy unit compared with standard narrowband <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> in an outpatient setting. Both therapies were done in a setting reflecting routine daily practice in the Netherlands. Main outcome measures The main outcome measure was effectiveness {{as measured by the}} proportion of patients with a 50 % or more reduction of the baseline psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) or self administered psoriasis area and severity index (SAPASI), called the PASI 50 and SAPASI 50 (relevant treatment effect). Another outcome of effectiveness was the percentage reduction in median scores on the PASI as well as SAPASI. Also the proportions of patients reaching the PASI 75 and SAPASI 75 (successful treatment effect), and the PASI 90 and SAPASI 90 (almost complete clearance) were calculated. Other secondary outcomes were quality of life (SF- 36, psoriasis disability index), burden of treatment (questionnaire), patients' preferences and satisfaction (questionnaire), and dosimetry and short term side effects (diary). Results 82 % of the patients treated at home compared with 79 % of the patients treated in an outpatient setting reached the SAPASI 50 (difference 2. 8 %, 95 % confidence interval - 8. 6 % to 14. 2 %), and 70 % compared with 73 % reached the PASI 50 (- 2. 3 %, - 15. 7 % to 11. 1 %). For patients treated at home the median SAPASI score decreased 82 % (from 6. 7 to 1. 2) and the median PASI score decreased 74 % (from 8. 4 to 2. 2), compared with 79 % (from 7. 0 to 1. 4) and 70 % (from 7. 0 to 2. 1) for patients treated in an outpatient setting. Treatment effect as defined by the mean decline in PASI and SAPASI scores was significant (P 0. 3). Total cumulative doses of ultraviolet B light were similar (51. 5 v 46. 1 J/cm(2), difference 5. 4, 95 % confidence interval - 5. 2 to 16. 0), and the occurrence of short term side effects did not differ. The burden of undergoing <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> was significantly lower for patients treated at home (differences 1. 23 to 3. 01, all P <= 0. 001). Quality of life increased equally regardless of treatment, but patients treated at home more often rated their experience with the therapy as "excellent" (42 %, 38 / 90) compared with patients treated in the outpatient department (23 %, 20 / 88; P= 0. 001). Conclusion <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> administered at home is equally safe and equally effective, both clinically and for quality of life, as <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> administered in an outpatient setting. Furthermore, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> at home resulted in a lower burden of treatment and led to greater patients' satisfaction.

40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} costs and cost {{effectiveness}} of phototherapy with ultraviolet B light provided at home compared with outpatient <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> for psoriasis. Design Cost utility, cost effectiveness, and cost minimisation analyses performed alongside a pragmatic randomised clinical trial (the PLUTO study) {{at the end of}} phototherapy (mean 17. 6 weeks) and at one year after the end of phototherapy (mean 68. 4 weeks). Setting Secondary care, provided by a dermatologist in the Netherlands. Participants 196 adults with psoriasis who were clinically eligible for narrowband (TL- 01) <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> were recruited from the dermatology departments of 14 hospitals and were followed until the end of phototherapy. From the end of phototherapy onwards, follow-up was continued for an unselected, consecutive group of 105 patients for one year after end of phototherapy. Interventions <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> provided at home (intervention) and conventional outpatient <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> (control) in a setting reflecting routine practice in the Netherlands. Both treatments used narrowband ultraviolet B lamps (TL- 01). Main outcome measures Total costs to society, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as calculated using utilities measured by the EQ- 5 D questionnaire, and the number of days with a relevant treatment effect (>= 50 % improvement of the baseline self administered psoriasis area and severity index (SAPASI)). Results Home phototherapy is at least as effective and safe as outpatient phototherapy, therefore allowing cost minimisation analyses (simply comparing costs). The average total costs by the end of phototherapy were (sic) 800 for home treatment and (sic) 752 for outpatient treatment, showing an incremental cost per patient of (sic) 48 (95 % CI (sic) - 77 to (sic) 174). The average total costs by one year after the end of phototherapy were (sic) 1272 and (sic) 1148 respectively (difference (sic) 124, 95 % CI (sic) - 155 to (sic) 403). Cost utility analyses revealed that patients experienced equal health benefits-that is, a gain of 0. 296 versus 0. 291 QALY (home v outpatient) by the end of phototherapy (difference 0. 0052, - 0. 0244 to 0. 0348) and 1. 153 versus 1. 126 QALY by one year after the end of phototherapy (difference 0. 0267, - 0. 024 to 0. 078). Incremental costs per QALY gained were (sic) 9276 and (sic) 4646 respectively, both amounts well below the normally accepted standard of (sic) 20 000 per QALY. Cost effectiveness analyses indicated that the mean number of days with a relevant treatment effect was 42. 4 versus 55. 3 by the end of phototherapy (difference - 12. 9, - 23. 4 to - 2. 4). By one year after the end of phototherapy the number of days with a relevant treatment effect were 216. 5 and 210. 4 respectively (6. 1, - 41. 1 to 53. 2), yielding an incremental cost of (sic) 20 per additional day with a relevant treatment effect. Conclusions Home <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> for psoriasis is not more expensive than phototherapy in an outpatient setting and proved to be cost effective. As both treatments are at least equally effective and patients express a preference for home treatment, the authors conclude that home phototherapy should be the primary treatment option for patients who are eligible for phototherapy with ultraviolet B light...|$|E

40|$|Background: Targeted {{ultraviolet}} B (T-UVB) phototherapy in vitiligo {{is usually}} administered twice or thrice {{a week on}} non-consecutive days. It is difficult for many patients to adhere to this regimen, forcing them to discontinue treatment. Aim: The study aimed to compare the efficacy of twice-weekly and once-weekly targeted <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> regimens in vitiligo. Methods: Sixty patients with non-segmental vitiligo on the face, neck or trunk {{were divided into two}} groups of 30 patients each. The patients in group A received targeted ultraviolet B twice weekly, while those in group B received targeted ultraviolet B once weekly. Repigmentation was monitored and graded as excellent (≥ 75 % repigmentation), good (50 − 74 % repigmentation) and poor (< 50 % repigmentation). The extent of repigmentation at each body site (primary outcome measure), the number of doses required for initiation of pigmentation, and the cumulative dose of targeted ultraviolet B administered was calculated and compared between both groups. Results: A total of 90 lesions (48 in the twice weeklygroup and 42 in the once weekly group) were treated on the face, neck and trunk. Excellent results were obtained in 62. 5 % (30 / 48) of lesions treated twice weekly, and 64. 3 % (27 / 42) in lesions treated once weekly. The mean number of doses required for initiation of pigmentation was 4. 69 in the twice weekly group, and 4. 35 in the once weekly group. The patients in the twice weekly group received a mean cumulative dose of 8. 26 J/cm 2, while the once weekly group received 7. 69 J/cm 2. No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the outcome, with respect to the total repigmentation, the number of doses till onset of pigmentation, as well as the cumulative dose of targeted UVB. Conclusion: Once-weekly targeted <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> appears to be as efficacious as the twice-weekly regimen in vitiligo...|$|E

Objectives We performed {{a pilot study}} to evaluate RCM as a noninvasive tool for monitoring <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> in psoriasis. Methods In six patients with psoriasis, lesional and nonlesional skin was selected for RCM imaging using a standardized protocol. Well-known histological features of psoriasis were visualized: parakeratosis, acanthosis, agranulosis, papillomatosis, presence of epidermal inflammatory cells, increased number of papillary capillaries and increased capillary blood flow. RCM imaging was performed before the first irradiation with UVB phototherapy, after nine irradiations, at clearance and 12 weeks after clearance. In four patients, 4 -mm punch biopsies were obtained and stained with haematoxylin-eosin. Additionally, immunohistochemical staining was performed with monoclonal antibodies specific for CD 31, CD 3, filaggrin, K 16, Ki 67 and CD 1 a for correlation to RCM images. Results There was a high correlation between clinical, RCM and histological features. Normalization of RCM and histological features corresponded highly to clinical improvement of psoriasis. Conclusions This study {{is the first to}} establish the use of RCM as an effective tool for noninvasive monitoring of UVB phototherapy in patients with psoriasis.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy and safety of the EL compared with clobetasol propionate (CP) in the prurigo form of AD. METHODS: In a prospective randomized within-patient controlled study, 13 patients with a prurigo form of AD were randomized to receive EL on one side and topical CP on the other side. Laser treatment was performed twice a week for 10 weeks. Clinical responses were evaluated using Physician Assessment of Individual Signs, Physician Global Assessment, Patient Global Assessment and photographic documentation. Histopathological changes were evaluated and duration of remission was monitored during a 6 -month follow-up period. RESULTS: Both treatments resulted in a significant improvement of all outcome measures after 10 weeks of treatment. During follow up, the EL showed more improvement compared with CP. Histopathology demonstrated marked decrease of epidermal thickness and inflammatory infiltrate at the EL-treated sites. No significant side-effects occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the EL can safely and effectively be used in the treatment of the prurigo form of AD. For the long term, the EL might be a good alternative to topical corticosteroids and an option in case of therapy-resistant patient...|$|R
40|$|Netherton {{syndrome}} (NS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} genodermatosis caused by SPINK- 5 mutations. The SPINK- 5 gene encodes the serine protease inhibitor LEKTI and is located on chromosome 5 q 32. Unopposed degradation of corneodesmosomes {{is the basis for}} a severely impaired skin barrier function in patients with NS. Effective treatments for patients with NS are limited. Some success has been achieved with local application of corticosteroids or tacrolimus/pimecrolimus (1). Retinoids, acitretin as well as isotretinoin, have been used systemically, with variable benefits, whilst higher doses mostly worsen the disease, probably because of deteriorating effects on the skin barrier (2). Cyclosporine and oral corticosteroids are also prescribed to patients with NS (3, 4). There is one report of the successful use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), but this therapy has some clear limitations (5). Recently, Maatouk et al. (6) reported clinical improvement in Netherton syndrome with narrowband <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy.</b> A similar response was observed by Kaminska et al.

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vitiligo and {{alopecia}} areata are common, disfiguring skin diseases. Treatment {{options are}} limited and include nontargeted approaches, such as corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, narrow band <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy,</b> and other immune-modifying agents. The {{purpose of this}} article is to review shared, novel mechanisms between vitiligo and alopecia areata, as well as discuss how they inform the development of future targeted treatments. RECENT FINDINGS: Vitiligo and alopecia areata are both autoimmune diseases, and striking similarities in pathogenesis have been identified at the level of both the innate and adaptive immune system. Increased reactive oxygen species and high cellular stress level have been suggested as the initiating trigger of the innate immune system in both diseases, and genome-wide association studies have implicated risk alleles that influence both innate and adaptive immunity. Most importantly, mechanistic studies in mouse models of vitiligo and alopecia areata have specifically implicated an interferon (IFN) gamma-driven immune response, including IFNgamma, IFNgamma-induced chemokines, and cytotoxic CD 8 T cells as the main drivers of disease pathogenesis. These recent discoveries may reveal an effective strategy to develop new treatments, and several proof-of-concept clinical studies support this hypothesis.

40|$|Skin {{disorders}} {{associated with}} {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) can markedly affect a patient's {{quality of life and}} can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Uremic pruritus, which is frequently encountered in patients with CKD, is considered to be an inflammatory systemic disease rather than a local skin disorder. Biomarkers of inflammation are increased in patients with uremic pruritus and an imbalance of the endogenous opioidergic system might be involved in the complex pathogenesis of the disease. Treatment options for uremic pruritus include emollients, topical capsaicin cream, <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy,</b> gabapentin, oral activated charcoal and nalfurafine, a kappa-opioid-receptor agonist. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy is triggered by an imbalance of promoters and inhibitors of vascular calcification, caused by the inflammatory changes that occur in uremia. Promising therapeutic strategies for calcific uremic arteriolopathy include bisphosphonates and intravenous sodium thiosulfate. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a devastating condition {{associated with the use of}} gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with CKD. At present, no therapies are available for this complication. Preventive measures include use of iodine-based contrast agents, particularly in patients with CKD stage 4 and 5. If gadolinium contrast is necessary, administration of low volumes of the more stable macrocyclic ionic types of gadolinium-based contrast agent is advocated. Hemodialysis following gadolinium exposure might offer benefits but evidence is lacking. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{overview}} of the cutaneous porphyrias. It is a narrative review based on the published literature and my personal experience; it is not based on a formal systematic search of the literature. The cutaneous porphyrias are a diverse group of conditions due to inherited or acquired enzyme defects in the porphyrin–haem biosynthetic pathway. All the cutaneous porphyrias can have (either {{as a consequence of the}} porphyria or as part of the cause of the porphyria) involvement of other organs as well as the skin. The single commonest cutaneous porphyria in most parts of the world is acquired porphyria cutanea tarda, which is usually due to chronic liver disease and liver iron overload. The next most common cutaneous porphyria, erythropoietic protoporphyria, is an inherited disorder in which the accumulation of bile-excreted protoporphyrin can cause gallstones and, rarely, liver disease. Some of the porphyrias that cause blistering (usually bullae) and fragility (clinically and histologically identical to porphyria cutanea tarda) can also be associated with acute neurovisceral porphyria attacks, particularly variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria. Management of porphyria cutanea tarda mainly consists of visible-light photoprotection measures while awaiting the effects of treating the underlying liver disease (if possible) and treatments to reduce serum iron and porphyrin levels. In erythropoietic protoporphyria, the underlying cause can be resolved only with a bone marrow transplant (which is rarely justifiable in this condition), so management consists particularly of visible-light photoprotection and, in some countries, narrowband <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy.</b> Afamelanotide is a promising and newly available treatment for erythropoietic protoporphyria and has been approved in Europe since 2014...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Narrow-band <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> is an {{effective}} treatment for psoriasis. However, there is considerable variability {{in the number of}} treatment sessions needed to achieve psoriasis clearance. While several clinical and treatment-related factors predict time to clearance, the effect of itching and scratching on the number of irradiation sessions is insufficiently understood. OBJECTIVE: Predictors of the time to clearance were assessed in patients with psoriasis who were referred for UVB treatment in a randomized double-blind comparison of irradiation regimens for UVB phototherapy. METHODS: After randomization to either UVB irradiation with a suberythematogenic or an erythematogenic regimen, patients were irradiated with 20 % and 40 % incremental doses, respectively, three times weekly. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score was measured at baseline and every 4 weeks, and itching and habitual scratching were measured at baseline. RESULTS: Among the 77 patients who achieved psoriasis clearance (90 % reduction of PASI), itching and scratching were correlated with the number of irradiation sessions needed to achieve clearance, with higher levels of itch and scratching predicting more sessions. These effects remained significant after controlling for the initial PASI score, irradiation schemes, minimal erythema dose (MED), skin type, cumulative dose, protocol adjustments and lifestyle factors (smoking habits and alcohol consumption). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with higher levels of itch and scratching need more irradiation sessions to achieve clearance of psoriasis with UVB phototherapy. Systematic assessment of the severity of itch and scratching, followed by short-term itch-coping programmes for patients at risk, might be a cost-effective, adjunct to UVB therapy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundProgressive macular hypomelanosis (PMH) is a cosmetically {{disturbing}} {{skin disorder}} that is poorly understood with indefinite treatment. The {{aim of the}} present study was to clinically outline PMH and study its pathogenesis. Based upon the literature suggesting improvement of PMH with antibiotic therapy to decrease Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) colonization, different treatment modalities were tried to reach the best treatment option. Patients and methodsThis study included 12 newly diagnosed PMH selected patients who attended Tanta University Hospital outpatient clinic of Dermatology and Venereology from June 2009 to March 2010. Patient's lesions were subjected to wood's lamp and potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination as well as biopsies used in histological, immunohistochemical, bacteriological and electron microscopic examination. A randomized clinical trial with different treatment modalities was applied. ResultsThe patient's mean age was 25 ± 10. 8 with significant female predominance (P= 0. 0001). Reduction of epidermal melanosomes and tyrosine activity together with difference in distribution of S 100 proteins in hypopigmented skin was demonstrated. Abnormal distribution of tonofilaments was noticed inside keratinocytes with increased apoptosis. P. acnes were detected in hair follicles of 83. 3 % hypopigmented lesions. Administration of local and systemic antimicrobial treatment with narrow band <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> (NBUVB) <b>phototherapy</b> for 3 months was the best treatment modalities. ConclusionThe etiology of PMH is multifactorial where genetic predisposition, the presence of P. acnes and hormonal imbalance play the main role.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> is an {{established}} treatment option for psoriasis. The optimum dosage regimen {{still has to}} be determined. Within-subject comparisons do {{not take into account the}} systemic effects of UVB phototherapy. The area of the body treated with low-dose UVB may benefit from the systemic effects of the site treated with a higher UVB dose. OBJECTIVES: To study the time to clearance in patients with psoriasis in a randomized controlled trial, in which patients were treated with narrowband UVB in either a high-dose or a low-dose regimen. METHODS: One hundred and nine patients were randomized to a high-dose regimen (group 1) or to a low-dose regimen (group 2). Patients of group 1 and 2 were irradiated with 40 % and with 20 % incremental doses, respectively, three times weekly. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) was measured at baseline and at every 4 -week control visit. Treatment was stopped in cases of clearance (90 % reduction of baseline PASI). RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the number of patients achieving clearance. The high-dosage scheme resulted in four fewer treatments with no significant differences in cumulative UV dose, although more protocol adjustments were required in the beginning of the study because of erythema. After 3 months a significantly better clinical outcome was seen after high-dose UVB therapy. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose UVB therapy results in fewer treatments with better long-term efficacy, with cost-effective benefits for hospital and patients. Therefore UVB phototherapy in a high-dose regimen for psoriasis is recommended. However, a protocol adjustment in the second week with a high-dose regimen is desirable to prevent erythema...|$|R

Considering the existing evidence, pregnancy does not tend to have a negative influence on psoriasis, as in most women who experience a change in the severity and course of their psoriasis during pregnancy, the change {{is more likely to be}} reported as an improvement. This assumption can be applied more convincingly to plaque-type psoriasis, while an exception may be represented by generalized pustular psoriasis, which has been somehow linked to impetigo herpetiformis. Conflicting findings emerged from the few available studies that explored the effect of psoriasis on pregnancy outcomes. Recent studies found an association between moderate-to-severe psoriasis and some pregnancy complications, including pregnancy-induced hypertensive diseases, and have emphasized a trend toward a newborn with low birth weight in patients with psoriasis, especially in those suffering from severe forms. The safety profile during pregnancy is not completely known for many drugs used to treat psoriasis. Moisturizers and low- to moderate-potency topical steroids or <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> represent the first-line therapy for pregnant patients. Many dermatologists may, however, recommend discontinuing all drugs during pregnancy, in consideration of medico-legal issues, and also taking into account that common forms of psoriasis do not compromise the maternal and fetal health. Anyway, for those women whose psoriasis improves during pregnancy, the interruption of any therapy for psoriasis can be a reasonable strategy. The objective of this paper was to review the most relevant literature data on psoriasis in pregnancy, trying to give concurrently practical information about clinical and prognostic aspects, as well as counseling and management.

40|$|Introduction: Narrowband <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> (NBUVB) is {{safe and}} {{effective}} treatment for psoriasis. Vitamin D {{plays an important role}} in pathogenesis of psoriasis. It is known that psoriasis patients have low serum 25 (OH) D levels, which increase after NBUVB. We assessed serum 25 (OH) D levels, its correlation with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), and the effect of NBUVB on 25 (OH) D levels among Indian psoriasis patients. Materials and Methods: A prospective study comprising 30 adults with psoriasis with no major comorbidities (PASI > 10 and off-therapy > 4 weeks) was conducted. PASI was estimated at baseline among patients and repeated after receiving 12 weeks of NBUVB therapy. Thirty age and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited to compare 25 (OH) D levels at baseline and at 12 weeks. Patient demographic parameters, treatment dose, duration, side effects, and its impact on 25 (OH) D levels and PASI were serially evaluated. Results: A total of 30 patients presenting with psoriasis and 30 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. Mean baseline PASI (M: F = 19 : 11) among patients with mean age 36. 8 (± 7. 7) years was 20. 5 (± 6. 3) and all patients were either 25 (OH) D deficient (n = 14) or insufficient (n = 16). Their baseline 25 (OH) D levels were significantly lower than controls (25. 93 nmol/L vs 47. 54 nmol/L; P < 0. 001). After NBUVB therapy (average cumulative dose 20. 76 ± 7. 1 J/cm 2; average treatment sessions 32. 57 ± 1. 9), there was a significant improvement in PASI as well as 25 (OH) D (P < 0. 05). There was no correlation between the mean improvement in PASI and 25 (OH) D after 12 weeks of therapy. Twelve (40 %) patients had therapy-related side effects [pruritus (n = 8), erythema (n = 4) ], none had major side effects. Conclusion: Improvement in PASI and serum 25 (OH) D levels after NBUVB in psoriasis is significant but poorly correlated with each other. Vitamin D may not be the lone mediator of the therapeutic effects of NBUVB on psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|The high {{prevalence}} and chronic nature of psoriasis leads to high costs {{in relation to}} the treatment and control of the disease. A number of clinical trials have shown that a combination therapy of calcipotriol cream (Daivonex/Dovonex), Leo Pharmaceutical Products) and <b>ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> (UVB) decreases the total number of UVB exposures required compared to UVB treatment alone. From a societal point of view, the addition of calcipotriol to UVB therapy could achieve cost savings due to the fewer UVB treatments needed and the reduced travelling and time off work for patients. Fewer UVB exposures may also have other beneficial effects, i. e., shortened waiting lists and less risk to patients of developing cancer or photoaging of the skin. To compare the cost-effectiveness of treating psoriatic patients in the Netherlands with calcipotriol cream used daily combined with twice weekly UVB treatments to emollient used daily combined with UVB given 3 times weekly. Based on the clinical results from a Canadian trial, a decision-analytical model was constructed to simulate treatment outcomes and estimate the costs of managing psoriatic patients in the Netherlands over a period of 20 weeks from initiation of therapy. Unit costs and details of standard treatment protocols were collected from Dutch dermatology centres in hospitals and the community for use in the model. Other therapies, such as topical corticosteroids, tar or dithranol were not investigated in this analysis. The total cost of managing psoriatic patients in the Netherlands over a 20 -week period is estimated as EUR 1, 175. 90 for those treated with calcipotriol and UVB and EUR 1, 212. 14 for patients treated with emollient and UVB. Thus, the former treatment, adding calcipotriol to UVB phototherapy, provides a minor cost saving of EUR 36. 24 (3 %) compared to the cost of UVB treatment alone. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that these results are sensitive to changes in the cost of UVB treatment. Calcipotriol treatment combined with UVB phototherapy is a cost-neutral alternative to UVB phototherapy used with an emollient. The patients achieve treatment success in the same time on both treatments but the former, with calcipotriol, requires less exposure to UVB radiation. The additional drug costs from using calcipotriol are offset by savings from the fewer UVB sessions required. Essential beneficial effects for patients are less inconvenience, less risk of developing photoaging of the skin and less exposure to potentially carcinogenic radiation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pruritus is a {{disabling}} {{complication of}} cholestatic liver disorders. Its management remains challenging. <b>Ultraviolet</b> <b>B</b> (UVB) <b>phototherapy</b> {{has been successfully}} used to treat pruritus in other indications. METHODS: This is an observational case series. The study population consists of 13 patients (10 females, mean age 52 years) with pruritus due to different cholestatic liver disorders: PBC (n= 4), PSC (n= 2), drug-induced (n= 3) and persistant cholestasis after LT (n= 4). Serum alkaline phosphatase were: 686 ± 363 μ/l and serum bile acids: 147 ± 15 μmol/l. In all patients conventional medical treatment had failed to control pruritus. Perception of pruritus was recorded by the visual analogue scale (VAS). RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 3 years. Ten patients (77 %) had more than 60 % reduction in perceived pruritus of which 4 had a more than 80 % reduction. Median { 25 %- 75 % percentiles} VAS score before and after treatment decreased from 8. 0 [8. 0 - 10 } to 2. 0 { 1. 5 - 2. 1 } (P< 0. 001). The mean number of irradiations required to obtain this effect was 26 ± 17 (average duration of phototherapy: 8 weeks). No significant changes in cholestatic serum markers were observed. Four patients (30 %) needed an additional phototherapy course because of recurrent pruritus and {{in all of them}} again a marked improvement of pruritus was observed. The therapy was well tolerated, except in 2 patients who developed during retreatment pronounced erythema in one and paraesthesia in the other. CONCLUSIONS: UVB phototherapy appears to be a promising and well tolerated treatment also for cholestasis-associated pruritus. status: publishe...|$|R

Owing to its limited penetration, the direct effects of UVB are mostly restricted to cells residing in the epidermis and papillary dermis, and are associated with epidermal depletion of Langerhans' cells (LC) and T cells. It {{has been argued that}} the depletion of the skin-resident T-cell population may be due to a combination of UVB-induced apoptosis and decreased recruitment from the blood due to lower expression of the required adhesion and homing molecules. We have previously demonstrated that UVB treatment can alter the expression of adhesion molecules by blood lymphocytes, and as these can be influenced by cytokines, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether UVB irradiation can also influence the cytokine production of circulating T cells. Four patients with active chronic plaque psoriasis were treated daily with narrow-band 312 nm UVB irradiation and blood samples obtained before treatment and weekly thereafter for 2 weeks. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cultured with a streptococcal superantigen or a conventional streptococcal antigen preparation, and cell culture supernatants were assayed for various cytokines. When stimulated with the superantigen, PBMCs from UVB-treated psoriasis patients secreted greater amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10, and showed markedly decreased production of IL- 1 beta, IL- 2, IL- 5 and IL- 6 compared to the pre-treatment values; the production of IFN-gamma, IL- 8 and IL- 12 p 70 were also decreased but did not reach statistical significance. Thus, the combination of UVB-induced apoptosis, increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and decreased trafficking to the skin may help to explain the beneficial effects of UVB treatment on psoriasis and why disease remission can sometimes be sustained for a prolonged period...|$|R
40|$|Results of <b>ultraviolet</b> (UV) <b>B</b> <b>phototherapy</b> can be {{improved}} by the application of calcipotriol, but {{studies are needed to}} decide how the two treatments should be combined. We studied the effect of UVB after application of calcipotriol ointment (50 microg g- 1) and calcipotriol cream (50 microg g- 1) and determined the optimal time of application of calcipotriol when combined with UVB phototherapy (280 - 350 nm), in a single-blinded randomized vehicle-controlled study of 37 healthy adult volunteers. Calcipotriol ointment or cream was applied randomly on five areas on the back at different time intervals from UVB irradiation. One area was left untreated as the control. Application times were the evening before, the morning before, 2 h before, immediately before, and immediately after irradiation. UVB irradiation was administered by TL 20 W/ 12 fluorescent tube lamps at increasing doses (20, 25, 32, 40, 50 and 64 mJ cm- 2) to six subunits of each test area. Clinical assessment was performed 24 h after UVB irradiation by a blinded investigator. Calcipotriol ointment and cream were applied in 19 and 18 subjects, respectively, and erythema was measured for each application time quantified. We found that erythemal reactions were significantly smaller when calcipotriol ointment or cream was applied immediately before irradiation compared with all other application times. To explain these findings, a vehicle control study was performed. No difference in erythema was seen between calcipotriol medication and the vehicle controls. Spectrophotometric analysis of the calcipotriol cream and ointment showed no UV absorbance in the UVB range. No signs of photosensitization were noted. In conclusion, the vehicles of the calcipotriol ointment and cream inhibit the induction of erythema by UVB irradiation if applied immediately before phototherapy. Consequently, calcipotriol ointment and cream should not be applied directly before UVB irradiation; however, they may be applied at any time up to 2 h prior to or immediately after UVB irradiation.
