25|$|Recent {{advances}} in vehicle electronics {{have led to}} a move towards fewer, more capable computer processors on a vehicle. A typical vehicle in the early 2000s would have between 20 and 100 individual networked microcontroller/Programmable logic controller modules with non-real-time operating systems. The current trend is toward fewer, more costly microprocessor modules with hardware memory management and real-time operating systems. The new embedded system platforms allow for more sophisticated software applications to be implemented, including model-based process control, artificial intelligence, and <b>ubiquitous</b> <b>computing.</b> Perhaps {{the most important of these}} for Intelligent Transportation Systems is artificial intelligence.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} <b>ubiquitous</b> mobile <b>computing</b> has widely been {{regarded}} as the convergence of pager-like communications technology and laptop-like computational power, enabling applications that span both realms of functionality. However, <b>ubiquitous</b> mobile <b>computing,</b> coupled {{with the proliferation of}} microprocessor-controlled appliances and networking, creates another important new application arena: that in which mobile computers act as controllers for, and interfaces to, appliances and services in the surrounding environment. This position paper explores the convergence of computation with communications and control applications, and the models of mobile computing that consequently arise. Established applications and models are positioned relative to this framework, and hitherto unexplored control-based models of mobile computation are described. 1 Introduction Mobile computing technology is often (e. g., in [1]) regarded as the convergence of tools from two distinct walks of life, namel [...] ...|$|R
