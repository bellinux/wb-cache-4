5|$|A coda {{is a short}} {{pattern of}} 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations. They were {{once thought to be}} a way by which {{individuals}} identified themselves, but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas, and the same codas are used by multiple individuals. However, each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> individuals. Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects. Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas. In breeding grounds, codas are almost entirely produced by adult females. Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas, it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{several studies}} have also {{utilized}} oligonucleotide usage patterns to identify the differences across diverse microbial communities. Examples of such methodologies include the dinucleotide relative abundance approach by Willner et al. and the HabiSign approach of Ghosh et al.

Smoke Imix ruled Copán for 67years and died on 15June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> him in place of his name on AltarQ.

5|$|Although {{probable}} {{prokaryotic cell}} fossils date to almost 3.5billion years ago, most prokaryotes {{do not have}} distinctive morphologies and fossil shapes cannot be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> them as archaea. Instead, chemical fossils of unique lipids are more informative because such compounds do not occur in other organisms. Some publications suggest that archaeal or eukaryotic lipid remains are present in shales dating from 2.7billion years ago; such data have since been questioned. Such lipids have also been detected in even older rocks from west Greenland. The oldest such traces come from the Isua district, which include Earth's oldest known sediments, formed 3.8billion years ago. The archaeal lineage {{may be the most}} ancient that exists on Earth.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, {{under the assumption}} that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H.|$|E

5|$|Cytochemical {{stains on}} blood and bone marrow smears are helpful in the {{distinction}} of AML from ALL, and in subclassification of AML. The combination of a myeloperoxidase or Sudan black stain and a nonspecific esterase stain will provide the desired information in most cases. The myeloperoxidase or Sudan black reactions are most useful in establishing the identity of AML and distinguishing it from ALL. The nonspecific esterase stain is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> a monocytic component in AMLs and to distinguish a poorly differentiated monoblastic leukemia from ALL.|$|E
5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In {{the early stages of}} the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated with images of birds and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{diagnostics}} are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> {{infectious diseases}} such as chlamydia, influenza virus and tuberculosis; or specific strains such as H1N1 virus. Genetic identification can be swift; for example a loop-mediated isothermal amplification test diagnoses the malaria parasite and is rugged enough for developing countries. But despite these advances in genome analysis, in 2013 infections are still more often identified by other meanstheir proteome, bacteriophage, or chromatographic profile. Molecular diagnostics are also used to understand the specific strain of the pathogenfor example by detecting which drug resistance genes it possessesand hence which therapies to avoid.|$|E
