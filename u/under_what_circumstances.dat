5|$|In 1192, the Chronicle of Mann {{records that}} Ragnall {{and his sons}} were {{defeated}} in a particularly bloody battle against Áengus. The chronicle does not identify {{the location of the}} battle, or elaborate <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> it was fought. However, {{it is possible that the}} conflict took place in the northern part of the meic Somairle domain, where some of Áengus' lands may have lain. Although the hostile contact between Ragnall and Áengus could have been result of Ragnall's rise in power at Dubgall's expense, the clash of 1192 may also mark Ragnall's downfall.|$|E
5|$|Dietrich v The Queen, is an {{important}} legal case, stemming from an incident that took place on 17 December 1986, that was decided in the High Court of Australia on 13 November 1992. It concerned {{the nature of the}} right to a fair trial, and <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> indigent defendants (defendants who cannot afford legal representation) should be provided with legal aid by the state. The case determined that although there is no absolute right to have publicly funded counsel, in most circumstances a judge should grant any request for an adjournment or stay when an accused is unrepresented. It is {{an important}} case in Australian criminal law, and also in Australian constitutional law, since it is one of many cases in which some members of the High Court have found implied human rights in the Australian Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{responsibilities}} of the Provincial Assembly included defining provincial and municipal budgets and levying the taxes necessary to support them; providing primary and secondary schools (higher education was {{the responsibility of the}} national government); oversight and control of provincial and municipal expenditures; and providing for law enforcement and maintenance of police forces. The Assemblies also controlled the creation and abolishment of, and salaries for, positions within provincial and municipal civil services. The nomination, suspension and dismissal of civil servants was reserved for the president (governor) of the province, but how and <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> he could exercise these prerogatives was delineated by the Assembly. The expropriation of private property (with due monetary compensation) for provincial or municipal interests was also a right of the Assembly. In effect, the Provincial Assembly could enact any kind of law—with no ratification by Parliament—so long as such local laws did not violate or encroach upon the Constitution. However, provinces were not permitted to legislate in the areas of criminal law, criminal procedure laws, civil rights and obligations, the armed forces, the national budget or matters concerning national interests, such as foreign relations.|$|E

Under this framework, several currently available techniques are studied and generalized to accommodate more complex features.

In addition, we propose a general use of Rao-Blackwellization to improve performances.

25|$|The {{origin of}} soy bean {{cultivation}} remains scientifically debated. Early Chinese records mention that soybeans were {{a gift from}} the region of Manchuria and the Korean peninsula. Recent research, however, indicates that seeding of wild forms started early (before 5000 BCE) in multiple locations throughout East Asia The Great Soviet Encyclopedia claims soybean cultivation originated in China about 5000 years ago. Some scholars suggest that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BCE. However, the oldest preserved soybeans resembling modern varieties in size and shape were found in archaeological sites in Korea dated about 1000 BCE Radiocarbon dating of soybean samples recovered through flotation during excavations at the Early Mumun period Okbang site in Korea indicated soybean was cultivated as a food crop in around 1000–900 BCE. Soybeans from the Jomon period in Japan from 3000 BCE are also significantly larger than wild varieties. The cultivation of soybeans began in the eastern half of northern China by 2000 BCE, but is almost certainly much older. Soybeans became an important crop by the Zhou Dynasty (c. 1046 BCE–256 BCE) in China. However, the details of where, when, and <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> soybean developed a close relationship with people are poorly understood. Soy bean was unknown in South China before the Han period From about the first century CE to the Age of Discovery (15–16th century), soybeans were introduced into across South and Southeast Asia. This spread was due to the establishment of sea and land trade routes. The earliest Japanese textual reference to the soybean is in the classic Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters), which was completed in 712 CE.|$|E

500|$|It is {{not known}} <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstances</b> she first {{traveled}} to Athens. The discovery of a 4th-century grave inscription that mentions the names of Axiochus and Aspasius has led historian Peter K. Bicknell to attempt a reconstruction of Aspasia's family background and Athenian connections. His theory connects her to AlcibiadesII of Scambonidae (grandfather of the famous Alcibiades), who was ostracized from Athens in 460BC and may have spent his exile in Miletus. Bicknell conjectures that, following his exile, the elder Alcibiades went to Miletus, where he married {{the daughter of a}} certain Axiochus. Alcibiades apparently returned to Athens with his new wife and her younger sister, Aspasia. Bicknell argues that the first child of this marriage was named Axiochus (uncle of the famous Alcibiades) and the second Aspasios. He also maintains that Pericles met Aspasia through his close connections with Alcibiades's household. While in Athens, Aspasia may have also had affairs with the philosopher Anaxagoras and the general Jason of Lira ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{methodology}} of study of complex phenomena emerging in stock markets. This methodology {{is based on the}} use of distributed, multi-agent models with minimal knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities that has proven a powerful modeling tool for complex biological systems. Unlike neural and "neo-connectionist" models, ours' allow a comparative and incremental evaluation of their validity and relevance to the observed phenomena. The possibility of their application to the modeling and study of stock market phenomena is demonstrated on a simple example of a central agency that regulates the behavior of the investors : we show how a "blind" or myopic behavioral model reproduces results found in the literature and how the mutation of the model according to the parameters' values or the adaptation structures gives rise to a series of complex phenomena comparable to those observed in reality. 1 Introduction Why do prices fluctuate and <b>under</b> <b>what</b> <b>circumstance</b> [...] ...|$|R

Every symplectic scheme which is constructed from Darboux transformation and compatible with the Hamiltonian equation will satisfy this normalization condition.
