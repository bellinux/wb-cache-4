5|$|Alates are {{collected}} when {{the rainy season}} begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights {{to which they are}} attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried <b>until</b> <b>crisp.</b> Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.|$|E
500|$|Vegetable chips may be {{prepared}} with sliced vegetables that are fried, deep-fried, baked, dehydrated, or simply dried. Vegetable chips may be produced {{from a variety}} of root vegetables and leaf vegetables, such as carrot, turnip, parsnip, beet, radish, taro root, sweet potato, garlic, zucchini, cassava, kale, spinach, fennel and jicama, among others. Some baked versions utilize vegetables that are sliced, lightly tossed in oil, and then oven-baked <b>until</b> <b>crisp.</b> Vegetable chips prepared using this method have been described as more healthful compared to deep fried chips, particularly when prepared using [...] "heart-healthy" [...] olive oil.|$|E
500|$|Like other boletes, porcini can be dried {{by being}} strung {{separately}} on twine and hung {{close to the}} ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer {{on top of a}} boiler or hot water tank. Another method is drying in an oven at [...] for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to [...] <b>until</b> <b>crisp</b> or brittle. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a pressure cooker or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as carrettiere (carter's sauce). The drying process is known to induce the formation of various volatile substances that contribute to the mushroom's aroma. Chemical analysis has shown that the odour of the dried mushroom is a complex mixture of 53 volatile compounds.|$|E

5000|$|A Lancashire oatcake bears {{a passing}} {{resemblance}} to a Derbyshire oatcake, but is made without wheat flour or milk, and shaped as an approximate 11 x 6 in oval, smooth {{on one side}} and rough on the other, and traditionally cooked on a bakestone. It may be eaten moist, rolled up like a pancake with a filling, or dried hung over a rack <b>until</b> a <b>crisp</b> cracker. The dried version served with a beef and cowheel stew is known as [...] "stew and hard". Once common throughout Lancashire, it is now rarely found. The same cake is also cooked in West Yorkshire and Craven, and is thus sometimes referred to as the Pennine oatcake, although in Yorkshire the recipe often incorporated approximately 20% buttermilk.|$|R
50|$|To cook fiddleheads, it is {{advised to}} remove the brown papery husk before washing in several changes of cold water, then boil or steam them. Boiling reduces the {{bitterness}} {{and the content of}} tannins and toxins. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention associated a number of food-borne illness cases with fiddleheads in the early 1990s. Although they did not identify a toxin in the fiddleheads, the findings of that case suggest that fiddleheads should be cooked thoroughly before eating. The cooking time recommended by health authorities is 15 minutes if boiled and 10 to 12 minutes if steamed. The cooking method recommended by gourmets is to spread a thin layer in a steam basket and steam lightly, just <b>until</b> tender <b>crisp.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1945 by Charles Brook, and the name arose because of an error in a photo-processing shop; instead of writing [...] "C. Brook" [...] on a film, a clerk wrote [...] "Seabrook". Original {{production}} was in Allerton, but in 1979-80 a larger factory opened in the Princeville area of Bradford; production continued at the Allerton factory <b>until</b> 2004. Seabrook's <b>crisps</b> are distributed widely {{in the north of}} England, and increasingly in the south, and are also sold through mail order.|$|R
50|$|There are {{variations}} in the method of preparation, but generally the following method is observed. Wheat flour (and/or refined flour), salt and masala are mixed.

The resulting bright green kernels are then pounded in large wooden mortars and pestles until flat. They are then toasted dry on pans or baked <b>until</b> <b>crisp.</b>|$|E
50|$|The peperoncino is {{especially}} important in Calabrian cuisine. In late summer, peperoncini are stitched on wires and hung from buildings. They are left to dry in spots with sunlight and ventilation to conserve them, allowing their use in cooking until the next harvest. They are eaten whole, fried <b>until</b> <b>crisp,</b> crushed, powdered or as a paste. A typical peperoncino from Calabria rates 15,000 to 30,000 on the Scoville scale.|$|E
50|$|Green (unripe) plantains are peeled, sliced length-wise, diagonally, or width-wise, {{and then}} fried twice. The raw slices of plantains are fried {{for one to}} two {{minutes on each side}} until they are golden in color, and removed and patted to remove excess cooking oil. Afterwards, they are pounded flat with a hinged utensil made for the task, called a tostonera, or less {{conveniently}} with any kitchen utensil that has a large enough flat surface, for instance between two plates. The flattened plantain slices are then fried once again <b>until</b> they are <b>crisp</b> and golden brown.|$|R
50|$|I fu mie or yi fu mein is a crispy {{deep fried}} thick noodle dish {{served in a}} thick savoury sauce with pieces of meat or seafood and vegetables.

The dish is one of popular noodle dishes in Chinese Indonesian cuisine. The type of noodle being used in this dish is the thick yi mein noodle, hence the origin of its name. It is quite similar to mie kering from Makassar.|$|R
50|$|An éclair is an oblong pastry {{made with}} choux dough {{filled with a}} cream and topped with icing. The dough, {{which is the same}} as that used for profiterole, is {{typically}} piped into an oblong shape with a pastry bag and baked <b>until</b> it is <b>crisp</b> and hollow inside. Once cool, the pastry is then filled with a vanilla-, coffee- or chocolate-flavoured custard (crème pâtissière), or with whipped cream, or chiboust cream; and then iced with fondant icing. Other fillings include pistachio- and rum-flavoured custard, fruit-flavoured fillings, or chestnut purée. The icing is sometimes caramel, in which case the dessert may be called a bâton de Jacob.|$|R
50|$|The {{preparation}} of croutons is relatively simple. Typically the cubes of bread are coated in oil or butter (which may be seasoned or flavored for variety) and then baked. Some commercial preparations use machinery to sprinkle various seasonings on them. Alternatively, {{they may be}} fried lightly in butter or vegetable oil, <b>until</b> <b>crisp</b> and brown, {{to give them a}} buttery flavor and crunchy texture. Some croutons are prepared with the addition of cheese.|$|E
5000|$|Oatcakes {{made for}} drying were left <b>until</b> <b>crisp</b> on a fixture called the bread flake. Flake, {{pronounced}} [...] "fleeak", {{is from the}} Old Norse fleki meaning a hurdle.

Pieces are deep-fried (without removing excess flour) <b>until</b> <b>crisp</b> and golden.|$|E
50|$|Granola is {{a breakfast}} food and snack food {{consisting}} of rolled oats, nuts, honey or other sweeteners such as brown sugar, and sometimes puffed rice, {{that is usually}} baked <b>until</b> it is <b>crisp,</b> toasted and golden brown. During the baking process, the mixture is stirred to maintain a loose breakfast cereal consistency. Dried fruit, such as raisins and dates, and confections such as chocolate are sometimes added. Granola, particularly if it includes flax seeds, {{is often used to}} improve digestion. Granola is often eaten in combination with yogurt, honey, fresh fruit (such as bananas, strawberries or blueberries), milk or other forms of cereal. It also serves as a topping for various pastries, desserts or ice cream.|$|R
5000|$|An Arizona cheese crisp (simply [...] "cheese crisp" [...] in the region) is an open-faced, flour tortilla {{covered in}} {{shredded}} cheese. It {{is put on}} a metal pizza pan that has been brushed with butter or margarine and put under a broiler <b>until</b> it gets <b>crisp.</b> It {{is similar to a}} quesadilla, but distinct in that a cheese crisp is not folded over, and that it is also baked until the tortilla becomes crisp. Common cheeses to use include in various combinations are Oaxaca, Monterey Jack, or cheddar. Cheese crisps sometimes are topped with onions, cilantro, or peppers. [...] The cheese crisp {{is said to have been}} made famous by El Charro Café in Tucson, Arizona.|$|R
5000|$|A {{grilled cheese}} {{sandwich}} is assembled {{by creating a}} cheese filling between two slices of bread, which is then heated <b>until</b> the bread <b>crisps</b> and the cheese melts. It is sometimes combined with an additional ingredient such as peppers, tomatoes, or onions, though many other ingredients may be used. Several different methods of heating the sandwich are used, depending on the region and personal preference. Common methods include being cooked on a griddle, grilled, fried in a pan or made in a panini grill or sandwich toaster. This last method {{is more common in}} the United Kingdom, where the sandwiches are normally called [...] "toasted sandwiches" [...] or [...] "toasties", and in Australia, where they are called [...] "jaffles or [...] "toasties".|$|R
