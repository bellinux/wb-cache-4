25|$|Kriyamana is {{everything}} that we produce in the current life. All kriyamana karmas flow in to sanchita karma and consequently shape our future.

25|$|MWI response: the {{splitting}} can {{be regarded}} as causal, local and relativistic, spreading at, or below, the speed of light (e.g., we are not split by Schrödinger's cat <b>until</b> <b>we</b> look in the box). For spacelike separated splitting you can't say which occurred first — but this is true of all spacelike separated events, simultaneity is not defined for them. Splitting is no exception; many-worlds is a local theory.|$|E

25|$|According to Givens (1999), {{the process}} of nonverbal {{communication}} or negotiation is to send and receive messages {{in an attempt to}} gain someone’s approval or love. Courtship, which may lead to love, is defined as a nonverbal message designed to attract sexual partners. During courtship, we exchange nonverbal communication gestures to tell each other to come nearer and nearer <b>until</b> <b>we</b> touch. Essential signals in the path to intimacy include facial nuzzles, kissing and caressing each other.|$|E
25|$|It is not <b>until</b> <b>we</b> get to {{the sphere}} of the {{separate}} daemonical powers of nature that the opposition {{between good and evil}} begins, and the daemonical power is appeased by means of a stubbornness which it finds there congenial to it; the good daemonical power makes happy those in whom it takes up its abode, the bad ruins them; for eudaimonia is the indwelling of a good daemon, the opposite the indwelling of a bad one.|$|E

25|$|<b>Until</b> <b>we</b> {{find out}} what the {{relevant}} psychological predictors are for which racial classification per se is merely a 'stand-in' variable, {{we have no choice but}} to include race (or other group membership) as a predictive variable along with the test scores or other predictive measures. On the other hand, if the overprediction of the minority group's criterion performance is not too extreme, it may seem reasonable to many to leave it uncorrected, thereby giving the benefit of the slight predictive bias to the presumably disadvantaged group.|$|E
25|$|With the {{way that}} {{everything}} is being done, with people like Trent Reznor and Radiohead, it was very inspiring to us that when you're doing things on your own {{you can do whatever}} you want. Not that we're going to give records away but this time we're starting a label, we want to build it up first and have the freedom to release exclusive things whenever we want. That's something we've always been able to do <b>until</b> <b>we</b> were on Epic, so it's nice that we're able to do that again.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) has a six-stage {{classification}} {{that describes}} {{the process by which}} a novel influenza virus moves from the first few infections in humans through to a pandemic. This starts with the virus mostly infecting animals, with a few cases where animals infect people, then moves through the stage where the virus begins to spread directly between people, and ends with a pandemic when infections from the new virus have spread worldwide and it will be out of control <b>until</b> <b>we</b> stop it.|$|E

25|$|If {{we want to}} fix {{the value}} of n prior to the {{experiment}} {{then we have to}} take the balls one by one <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have n balls. The balls are therefore no longer independent. This gives a slightly different distribution known as Wallenius' noncentral hypergeometric distribution. It is far from obvious why these two distributions are different. See the entry for noncentral hypergeometric distributions for an explanation of the difference between these two distributions and a discussion of which distribution to use in various situations.|$|E
25|$|A very {{different}} kind of search came to prominence in the 1990s, based on the mathematical theory of optimization. For many problems, it is possible to begin the search with some form of a guess and then refine the guess incrementally until no more refinements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill climbing: we begin the search at a random point on the landscape, and then, by jumps or steps, we keep moving our guess uphill, <b>until</b> <b>we</b> reach the top. Other optimization algorithms are simulated annealing, beam search and random optimization.|$|E
25|$|Red {{worked on}} new {{material}} for <b>Until</b> <b>We</b> Have Faces during their 2009–2010 tours. They travelled with a portable case that unfolds into a mini recording studio, {{allowing them to}} put down ideas {{in the green room}} at venues. In a departure from their usual songwriting methods, much of the demo material stemmed from Rauch's rhythms he developed for song ideas on his home kit, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to develop their parts from them. Barnes said the band wanted to direct the album towards the idea of someone finding their own identity, and drew inspirations from various sources, including the novel Till We Have Faces by C.S. Lewis.|$|E

25|$|An {{analytic}} proposition is true {{by nature}} {{of the meaning of}} the words in the sentence — we require no further knowledge than a grasp of the language to understand this proposition. On the other hand, a synthetic statement is one that tells us something about the world. The truth or falsehood of synthetic statements derives from something outside their linguistic content. In this instance, weight is not a necessary predicate of the body; <b>until</b> <b>we</b> are told the heaviness of the body we do not know that it has weight. In this case, experience of the body is required before its heaviness becomes clear. Before Kant's first Critique, empiricists (cf. Hume) and rationalists (cf. Leibniz) assumed that all synthetic statements required experience to be known.|$|E
25|$|Why {{is it that}} we {{are sure}} a {{particular}} activity — e.g. Olympic target shooting — is a game while a similar activity — e.g. military sharp shooting — is not? Wittgenstein's explanation is tied up with an important analogy. How do we recognize that two people we know are related to one another? We may see similar height, weight, eye color, hair, nose, mouth, patterns of speech, social or political views, mannerisms, body structure, last names, etc. If we see enough matches we say we've noticed a family resemblance. It is perhaps important to note that this is not always a conscious process — generally we don't catalog various similarities <b>until</b> <b>we</b> reach a certain threshold, we just intuitively see the resemblances. Wittgenstein suggests that {{the same is true of}} language. We are all familiar (i.e. socially) with enough things which are games and enough things which are not games that we can categorize new activities as either games or not.|$|E
25|$|But {{beyond the}} general {{fact that it}} enjoyed great wealth and prosperity, {{advantages}} which it doubtless owed to the noted fertility of its territory, we have scarcely any information concerning the history of Heraclea <b>until</b> <b>we</b> reach a period when it was already beginning to decline. We cannot doubt that it took part with the Tarentines in their wars against the Messapians and Lucanians, and {{it appears to have}} fallen gradually into a state of almost dependence upon that city, though without ever ceasing to be, in name at least, an independent state. Hence, when Alexander, king of Epirus, who had been invited to Italy by the Tarentines, subsequently became hostile to that people, he avenged himself by taking Heraclea, and, as already mentioned, transferred to the Thurians the general assemblies that had previously been held there. During the war of Pyrrhus with the Romans, Heraclea was the scene of the first conflict between the two powers, the consul Laevinus being totally defeated by the Epirot king in a battle (subsequently called the Battle of Heraclea) fought between the city of Heraclea and the river Siris, 280BCE.|$|E
