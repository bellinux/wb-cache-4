5|$|The Interim Committee {{held its}} first meeting on 9 May 1945. Stimson began by {{outlining}} its broad terms of reference, which included advising the President on wartime controls {{and the release of}} information, and making recommendations on post-war controls and policies related to nuclear energy, including legislation. The Interim Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the Interim Committee's involvement.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} omission {{from the}} Atomic Energy of 1946 was {{any mention of}} non-governmental <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy, since military applications overshadowed all others at the time. The restrictions of the act related to secrecy, the control of fissile materials, the ownership of patents and the operation of production facilities placed a number of legal roadblocks {{in the way of}} private nuclear power stations.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later {{asked him for}} a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement {{extended}} both {{commercial and}} military cooperation into the post-war period. The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons {{would not be}} used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July 1945, Wilson agreed that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.|$|E
5|$|World War II was {{the deadliest}} {{conflict}} in human history, marked by 50 million to 85 million fatalities, {{most of which}} were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the deliberate genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, starvation, disease and the first <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons in history.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces {{then began}} {{preparing}} for the invasion of mainland Japan, Operation Downfall. I Corps was assigned as one of four Corps {{under the command of}} the Sixth Army, with a strength of 14 divisions. I Corps was to lead the assault on Miyazaki, in southern Kyūshū, with the 25th, 33rd, and 41st Infantry Divisions. Opposing them would be the Japanese 57th Army, with the 154th, 156th, and 212th Japanese Infantry Divisions. Before the assault could be launched, Japan surrendered, following the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as {{outlined}} in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of whom were civilians) and remain the only <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|In May 1945 an Interim Committee {{was created}} to advise and report on wartime and postwar {{policies}} regarding the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> energy. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee the scientific panel offered its opinion {{not just on the}} likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its likely military and political impact. This included opinions on such sensitive issues as whether or not the Soviet Union should be advised of the weapon in advance of its use against Japan.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Alfonsín {{refused to}} foster {{diplomatic}} relations with the Brazilian military government, and only did so when the dictatorship ended and José Sarney became president. One of their initial concerns was to increase Argentine–Brazilian trade. Both presidents met in Foz do Iguaçu and issued a joint declaration about the peaceful <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> power. A second meeting in Buenos Aires strengthened the trade agreements. Argentina and Brazil signed the Program of Integration and Economic Cooperation (PICE), and in 1988 both countries and Uruguay agreed to create a common market. This led to the 1991 Treaty of Asunción, that created the Mercosur.|$|E

5|$|Nuclear waste {{policy in}} Germany is in flux. German {{planning}} for a permanent geologic repository began in 1974, focused on salt dome Gorleben, a salt mine near Gorleben about 100 kilometers northeast of Braunschweig. The site was announced in 1977 with plans for a reprocessing plant, spent fuel management, and permanent disposal facilities at a single site. Plans for the reprocessing plant were dropped in 1979. In 2000, {{the federal government and}} utilities agreed to suspend underground investigations for three to ten years, and the government committed to ending its <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> power, closing one reactor in 2003.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E
5|$|The French author Jules Roy {{suggests}} that Admiral Radford discussed with the French {{the possibility of}} using nuclear weapons in support of the French garrison. Moreover, John Foster Dulles reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Điện Biên Phủ, and a similar source claims that the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden was aware of the possibility of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons in that region.|$|E

5|$|While Radford {{remained}} Eisenhower's {{principal adviser}} for the budget, they differed {{on matters of}} foreign policy. Radford advocated the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons and a firm military and diplomatic stance against China. Early in his tenure, he suggested to Eisenhower a preventive war against China or the Soviet Union while the U.S. possessed a nuclear advantage and before it became entangled in conflicts in the Far East. Eisenhower immediately dismissed this idea.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{announced}} that the British government concurred with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee. As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, {{the leader of the}} Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference.|$|E
5|$|A {{subcommittee}} of the S-1 Executive Committee, chaired by James B. Conant, and consisting of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, was appointed {{to look into the}} issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, half of which were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half could detect from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the Metallurgical Laboratory who could respond to any reports of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons or radioactive poisons.|$|E

5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons. This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when}} the Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E
5|$|Burnet {{was opposed}} to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> power in Australia owing to the issues of nuclear proliferation. He later {{retracted}} his objections to uranium mining in Australia, feeling that nuclear power was necessary while other renewable energy sources were being developed. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he was also vocal in the anti-smoking movement; {{he was one of}} the first high-profile figures in Australia to educate the public on the dangers of tobacco, and he appeared in a television advertisement criticising the ethics of tobacco advertising, and broadcasters for displaying such material. He and fellow activists were surprised that the commercial was allowed to run briefly, before being taken off air by the station, which only further generated attention for the anti-smoking campaign. A former smoker, he had rejected the habit in the 1950s after several friends died. Burnet was also a critic of the Vietnam War and called for the creation of an international police force.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{legislative}} session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, {{he announced that}} he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet. The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher. Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan. The plan called for expansion of solar, wind, and biomass energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as coal gasification and carbon capture and sequestration. Although the plan called for an exploration of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> power, Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.|$|E
