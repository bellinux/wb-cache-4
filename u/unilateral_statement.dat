5000|$|A {{reservation}} {{in international law}} is a caveat to a state's acceptance of a treaty. A reservation {{is defined by the}} 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) as: a <b>unilateral</b> <b>statement,</b> however phrased or named, made by a State, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, whereby it purports to exclude or to modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that State.

5000|$|... 1.The judges {{concluded}} that Minister Kuo received a bribe of USD 20,000, {{on a single}} piece of weak evidence, which is the testimony of Lee Tsung-hsien. However, Lee’s testimony is contradictory and written record and the recording of his oral statements prove that his testimony is “fabricated.” No physical evidence of any kind shows that Minister Kuo had accepted the bribe was ever produced. If this is sufficient to prove bribery, then any person can accuse anyone else based on his own <b>unilateral</b> <b>statement,</b> and Taiwan will never be at peace.|$|E

5000|$|Reservations are {{essentially}} caveats to a state's {{acceptance of a}} treaty. Reservations are <b>unilateral</b> <b>statements</b> purporting to exclude or to modify the legal obligation {{and its effects on}} the reserving state. These must be included at the time of signing or ratification, i.e. [...] "a party cannot add a reservation after it has already joined a treaty".|$|R
40|$|Ed Swaine 2 ̆ 7 s Article, Reserving, sheds new {{theoretical}} {{light on}} an old and vexing question in international law: what rules should govern the common practice of filing unilateral reservations to multilateral treaties? The regulation of these unilateral opt-out devices has been a longstanding irritant for international legal scholars. The default rules governing reservations in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties are complex, ambiguous, and often counterintuitive. And the practice of states-both those that reserve {{and those that do}} not-is little better. States often bargain around the default rules by negotiating treaty-specific risk management provisions (but frequently do not). They sometimes object to plausibly treaty-incompatible reservations (but just as often do not). And they sometimes allow treaty bodies to review the validity of reservations (but they also challenge that authority, claiming for themselves the sole power to judge their treaty partners 2 ̆ 7 <b>unilateral</b> <b>statements)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Great Britain {{shared the}} general {{objective}} of the Monroe Doctrine, albeit from an opposite standpoint and ultimate aim, and even wanted to declare a joint statement to keep other European powers from further colonizing the New World. The British Foreign Secretary George Canning {{wanted to keep the}} other European powers out of the New World fearing that its trade with the New World would be harmed if the other European powers further colonized it. In fact, for many years after the Monroe Doctrine took effect, Britain, through the Royal Navy, was the sole nation enforcing it; the U.S. lacking sufficient naval capability. Allowing Spain to re-establish control of its former colonies would have cut Great Britain off from its profitable trade with the region. For that reason, Canning proposed to the U.S. that they mutually declare and enforce a policy of separating the New World from the Old. The U.S. resisted a joint statement because of the recent memory of the War of 1812, leading to the Monroe administration's <b>unilateral</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|My Lords, {{a patent}} {{specification}} is a <b>unilateral</b> <b>statement</b> by the patentee, in {{words of his}} own choosing, addressed to those {{likely to have a}} practical interest in the subject matter of his invention (i.e. [...] "skilled in the art"), by which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or process for which the letters patent grant him a monopoly. It is called [...] "pith and marrow" [...] of the claim. A patent specification should be given a purposive construction rather than a purely literal one derived from applying to it the kind of meticulous verbal analysis in which lawyers are too often tempted by their training to indulge. The question in each case is: whether persons with practical knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it could have no material effect upon the way the invention worked.|$|E
40|$|In {{the next}} decade, centres for {{research}} on the safety, tolerability or bioequivalence of new molecular entities will be confronted with numerous compounds, a narrowing time frame for performing Phase I research activities, and a growing demand for healthy volunteers for participation in non-therapeutic drug studies. A written informed consent (WIC), although required by law for medical investigators, appears {{to be similar to}} a contract, but strictly speaking it is not. A WIC is a <b>unilateral</b> <b>statement</b> by a healthy volunteer declaring to take on a number of obligations and to have understood that he has certain rights. The volunteer must accept or reject the statement as a whole because no individual alterations are allowed. Despite this, it is felt that the WIC assists in maintaining a balance between non-exploitation and the struggle for profit by avoiding unrealistic expectations on both sides...|$|E
40|$|The author {{claims that}} there are two {{unilateral}} acts which are of fundamental importance for further development of Polish-German relations: the declaration of the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of 1 August 2004, and the declaration of the Polish People’s Republic of 23 August 1953 in which Poland resigned from its claims for war reparations. In {{the second part of the}} paper the author argues with the thesis proposed by prof. Eckart Klein who is of an opinion that the validity of Chancellor Schroder’s statement is questionable as it is contradictory to ius cogens applying to crimes against humanity (art. 50 of the 1 st Geneva Convention of 12 August 1949). The author’s view is that Poland’s overtaking of German possessions was not an unlawful and lawlessness act because it was performed pursuant to the will of the Allies expressed i. a. in Potsdam Conference’s Declaration, and was the consequence of the manner in which Germany started, carried out and ended the war. The author also emphasises the importance of the law of equity and expresses a hope that if there arises an international dispute, the International Court of Justice will construe Potsdam Declaration in such a spirit. In the remaining part of the paper the author claims that Poland’s resignation from reparation claims in 1953 might be pronounced invalid due to the fact that it was made under duress exercised by the Soviet Union on Poland (coal blackmail).) Consequently, Poland’s sovereignty was violated, the result of which was a statement of will characterised with absolute invalidity. The conclusion is that every tension arising from <b>unilateral</b> <b>statements</b> or acts should be solved through friendly diplomatic relations between neighbouring states...|$|R
50|$|The federal chancellor's {{dual role}} as {{executive}} officeholder and heavyweight party official well-connected {{to the legislature}} makes him or her far {{more powerful than the}} formally senior federal president. Actual executive authority thus lies with the chancellor and his or her ministers, while the federal president is a figurehead rather than an actual head of government. Austria's presidents are largely content with their ceremonial role, striving for the role of impartial mediator and dignified Elder Statesman, and more or less consistently steer clear of the murky waters of hands-on politics. The stern frown worn by the late president Thomas Klestil while swearing in Wolfgang Schüssel's controversial cabinets was at the time widely considered the strongest <b>unilateral</b> political <b>statement</b> made by any Austrian president. In recent times, however, the current holder of office, Heinz Fischer, has been known to comment on current political issues from time to time.|$|R
40|$|The paper shall {{focus on}} the {{presentation}} of the reasoning stated in the ICJ Advisory Opinion on the accordance with international law of the unilateral declaration of independence in respect of Kosovo and the significance of the said reasoning in the actual context of international law in respect of new statehood. The paper shall try to point out the existence of an intent of the ICJ by its Advisory Opinion to state a new understanding of the statehood considering that the context of the unilateral independence statement and the capacity in which its authors acted is of sufficient importance to rule on the legality of such statement. By avoiding to rule on the coexistence of the right to territorial integrity and the right of self determination as rights connected with the <b>unilateral</b> <b>statement</b> of independence, the Court lost the opportunity to settle the relation between the two rights {{in the context of the}} remedial secession solution in favor of a multiethnic group which was subject to gross human rights violation in the past. Assuming the jurisdiction on the Advisory Opinion, the Court proved itself willing to show that issues which were till now considered purely political and subject to decision of the political organs of the UN may become, even in a narrow approach, points of law...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a game {{played by a}} state sponsor of terrorism, a terrorist group, and the target of terrorist attacks. The sponsoring state wishes to see as much damage inflicted on the target of attack as possible, but wishes to avoid retaliation. To do so, {{his relationship with the}} terrorist group must remain ambiguous. The target of attack, for his part, wishes to bring these attacks to an end as quickly as possible and will consider the option of retaliating against the sponsor to do so. We approach the problem by introducing an “evidence” variable in a dynamic setting. We show that the interplay of different strategic and non-strategic effects boils down to three qualitatively different scenarios, determined by key parameters. Based on this result, two alternative instruments to retaliation are identified in order to resist terrorist activities. First, assuming that the target is able to change some parameters by monetary investments, the paper provides an economic analysis of how to invest optimally {{in order to make the}} sponsor lose incentives to support the terrorist group. Second, we propose changing the structure of the game. Here, the key insight is that the target country can make a <b>unilateral</b> <b>statement</b> as to his strategy. The sponsor cannot do so as he is in fact claiming that there is no cooperation with terrorist groups. While our discussion, in this article, is motivated by an important problem in contemporary counterterrorism policy, it applies more generally to the study of secret coalitions.
