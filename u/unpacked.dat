5|$|After {{inviting}} {{reporters in}} mid-April, Samsung launched the Galaxy SIII during the Samsung Mobile <b>Unpacked</b> 2012 event at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London, United Kingdom, on 3 May 2012, instead of unveiling their products {{earlier in the}} year during either the World Mobile Congress or Consumer Electronics Show (CES). One explanation for this decision is that Samsung wanted to minimize the time between its launch and availability. The keynote address of the hour-long event was delivered by Loesje De Vriese, Marketing Director of Samsung Belgium.|$|E
5|$|In {{their first}} weeks on board, the Expedition 1 crew members {{activated}} critical {{life support systems}} and computer control, as well as <b>unpacked</b> supplies left behind for them by previous supply missions. At this time the station {{did not have enough}} electricity to heat all three pressurized modules, so Unity was left unused and unheated. Unity had been used {{for the past two years}} to allow U.S. flight controllers to command ISS systems and read station system data.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{start of}} the expedition occurred when the crew docked to the station on 2 November 2000, aboard the Russian spacecraft Soyuz TM-31, which had launched two days earlier. During their mission, the Expedition 1 crew activated various systems on board the station, <b>unpacked</b> equipment that had been delivered, and hosted three visiting Space Shuttle crews and two unmanned Russian Progress resupply vehicles. The crew was very busy throughout the mission, which was declared a success.|$|E

40|$|Unprecedented {{data rates}} that are {{expected}} at the LHC put high demand on {{the speed of the}} detector data acquisition system. The CSC subdetector located in the Muon Endcaps of the CMS detector has a data readout system equivalent in size to that of a whole Tevatron detector (60 VME crates in the CSC DAQ equal to the whole D 0 DAQ size). As a part of the High Level Trigger, the CSC data <b>unpacking</b> runs online {{and it needs to be}} able to cope with high data rates online. Early versions of the <b>unpacking</b> code used bit shifts and masks to <b>unpack</b> binary data. To reduce the <b>unpacking</b> time we decided to switch to bit field based data <b>unpacking.</b> The switch allowed us to gain an order of magnitude in speed. In this paper we explain how bit field data <b>unpacking</b> works and why it is dramatically faster compared to conventional bit shift and mask methods...|$|R
5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids. Additional rules stated that any boat carrying passengers required a licensed pilot, typically costing $25 ($680), although some prospectors simply <b>unpacked</b> their boats and let them drift unmanned through the rapids {{with the intent of}} walking down to collect them on the other side. During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Flying Corps (AFC) {{was formed}} in March 1914 and it was soon {{deployed}} to German New Guinea, with one BE2c aircraft and crew dispatched with the AN, although the colonies surrendered before the plane was even <b>unpacked.</b> The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist the Indian Army in protecting British oil interests {{in what is now}} Iraq. The Corps later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front throughout the remainder of the war. Organised into four operational squadrons in France and the Middle East and another four training squadrons in England, the AFC remained part of the AIF.|$|E
5|$|In their haste, Cope and Marsh did {{not always}} follow up on their discoveries (or, more commonly, those made by their subordinates). For example, after the {{discovery}} by Benjamin Mudge of the type specimen of Allosaurus in Colorado, Marsh elected to concentrate work in Wyoming; when work resumed at Garden Park in 1883, M. P. Felch found an almost complete Allosaurus and several partial skeletons. In addition, one of Cope's collectors, H. F. Hubbell, found a specimen in the Como Bluff area of Wyoming in 1879, but apparently did not mention its completeness, and Cope never <b>unpacked</b> it. Upon unpacking in 1903 (several years after Cope had died), it {{was found to be}} one of the most complete theropod specimens then known, and in 1908 the skeleton, now cataloged as AMNH 5753, was put on public view. This is the well-known mount poised over a partial Apatosaurus skeleton as if scavenging it, illustrated as such by Charles R. Knight. Although notable as the first free-standing mount of a theropod dinosaur, and often illustrated and photographed, it has never been scientifically described.|$|E

40|$|People often {{underestimate}} {{their future}} personal spending. Across four studies we examined an "unpacking" intervention to reduce this bias.

In each case, <b>unpacking</b> the details of expected expenses increased spending predictions.

40|$|Abstract—Current malware {{is often}} {{transmitted}} in packed or encrypted form to prevent examination by anti-virus software. To analyze new malware, researchers typically resort to dynamic code analysis techniques to <b>unpack</b> the code for examination. Unfortunately, these dynamic techniques {{are susceptible to}} a variety of anti-monitoring defenses, as well as “time bombs” or “logic bombs, ” and can be slow and tedious to identify and disable. This paper discusses an alternative approach that relies on static analysis techniques to automate this process. Alias analysis can be used to identify the existence of <b>unpacking,</b> static slicing can identify the <b>unpacking</b> code, and control flow analysis can be used to identify and neutralize dynamic defenses. The identified <b>unpacking</b> code can be instrumented and transformed, then executed to perform the <b>unpacking.</b> We present a working prototype that can handle a variety of malware binaries, packed with both custom and commercial packers, and containing several examples of dynamic defenses.

5|$|The 1st AIF {{included}} the Australian Flying Corps (AFC). Soon after {{the outbreak of}} war in 1914, two aircraft were sent to assist in capturing German colonies {{in what is now}} north-east New Guinea. However, these colonies surrendered quickly, before the planes were even <b>unpacked.</b> The first operational flights did not occur until 27 May 1915, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist the Indian Army in protecting British oil interests in what is now Iraq. The corps later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front throughout the remainder of World War I. By the end of the war, four squadrons—Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4—had seen operational service, while another four training squadrons—Nos. 5, 6, 7 and 8—had also been established. A total of 460 officers and 2,234 other ranks served in the AFC. The AFC remained part of the Australian Army until 1919, when it was disbanded; later forming the basis of the Royal Australian Air Force.|$|E

30|$|Modern malware {{variants}} {{are always}} equipped with sophisticated packers such as ASPack (2017), ASProtect (2017), UPX (2017), VMProtect (2017), ZProtect (2017), etc., which allow the malware variants bypass traditional and modern detection systems. These packers include {{two kinds of}} packers: encryption packers and compression packers, which work by taking an existing application, packing it, and then wrapping an <b>unpacking</b> utility around it, the <b>unpacking</b> utility works to <b>unpack</b> the inner executable in memory and transfers execution to it. The problem {{lies in the fact}} that there is nothing inherently malicious about a packer or <b>unpacking</b> code (Treadwell et al. 2009). When ignoring the packers, it is hard to detect if an executable is malicious due to the encryption or compression of the executable, which prevents detection systems from getting original features, especially for static analysis.|$|R
