30|$|Tight {{sandstone}} gas, as {{an important}} <b>unconventional</b> natural <b>gas</b> resource, shows great resource potential and is widely distributed {{around the world with}} geological reserves reaching 210  ×  1012  m 3. Based on the material basis, reservoir genesis, source–reservoir contact relations, and accumulation mechanisms of tight gas, we infer that tight gas in China exhibits favorable reservoir formation conditions and great resource potential. The tight gas resource is mainly found in the Ordos, Sichuan, Tarim, Junggar, and Turpan-Hami Basins of central-western China. This resource has promoted global <b>unconventional</b> natural <b>gas</b> exploration and production under existing technical conditions.|$|R

[...] The managing director of Aura Energy, Dr Bob Beeson, a professional geologist with over 35 years of experience in mineral exploration and development, explained the company's position in Sweden.

[...] Dr Beeson said he was very excited about the project's potential, particularly as the Motala shale may share some similarities with a highly successful play in North America. [...] "Gas flows of up to 50 cubic metres per hour have been reported from drill holes used to extract water, so it is definitely worth investigation," [...] he said.

2500|$|Determining which {{fracking}} {{technique is}} appropriate for well productivity depends largely on {{the properties of the}} reservoir rock from which to extract oil or gas. [...] If the rock is characterized by low-permeability — which refers to its ability to let substances, i.e. gas, pass through it, then the rock may be considered a source of tight gas. [...] Fracking for shale gas, which is currently also known as a source of <b>unconventional</b> <b>gas,</b> involves drilling a borehole vertically until it reaches a lateral shale rock formation, at which point the drill turns to follow the rock for hundreds or thousands of feet horizontally. [...] In contrast, conventional oil and gas sources are characterized by higher rock permeability, which naturally enables the flow of oil or gas into the wellbore with less intensive hydraulic fracturing techniques than the production of tight gas has required. The decades in development of drilling technology for conventional and unconventional oil and gas production has not only improved access to natural gas in low-permeability reservoir rocks, but also posed significant adverse impacts on environmental and public health.|$|E

Drawing on the theories of social representations and framing, we test the hypothesis that legacies of natural resource extraction—conceptualized here as collective schemata of interpretation—shape perceptions and actions toward new forms of energy development. Based on an analysis of survey data from the “Twin Tiers” regions of New York and Pennsylvania (n= 590), we find that negatively perceived legacies of past resource dependence, net of other factors, lead to opposition and political behaviors related to <b>unconventional</b> oil and <b>gas</b> development.
