40|$|Linear {{railroad}} {{facilities have}} been producing an adverse {{impact on the}} environment by polluting it with oil products for an extensive period of time. The authors of the article consider several mechanisms of contamination and the pattern of its spread into soils. Currently, areas that used to be unsuitable for development as <b>urban</b> <b>lands</b> for geological or environmental reasons are now being intensively developed. The study is exemplified by a city outstretched onto the complex terrain. Complex topography contemplates geological, tectonics-related, hydrological conditions, exogenous processes and anthropogenic factors. In this connection, the main purpose of the study is to analyze the geo-ecological factors that impact <b>urban</b> <b>lands</b> in complex geo-morphological conditions with a view to their functional use against minimal environmental risks to assure the most favorable conditions for humans. Towards this end, the authors have applied the following theoretical and practical methods of research, including a pilot study, namely (1) the geomorphological analysis of <b>urban</b> <b>lands,</b> (2) the monitoring and analysis of the anthropogenic impact produced onto various constituents of the environment, and (3) development of methods of functional use of <b>urban</b> <b>lands</b> in complex geomorphological conditions. The authors have monitored contaminated lands to develop their recommendations for their development in complex geomorphological conditions, namely: 1. Urban development planning should be performed with consideration for the geomorphological elements taken as a whole, as they are closely connected to one another. 2. Selection of methods of rehabilitation of <b>urban</b> <b>lands</b> must be preceded by the zoning of the territory based on its geological and environmental properties.
