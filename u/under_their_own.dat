The four Home Nations of the United Kingdom—England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland—also send separate teams.|$|E
5|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{governors of}} the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick and Islands of Guernsey do not by and <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> authority grant assent, nor, as proxies, as the British crown's representative, deliver royal assent, to legislation emulating from the respective legislatures of these islands.|$|E
5|$|There was {{consideration}} that Aer Lingus {{would take over}} the Little Red routes <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> brand with the Little Red fleet repainted. However they declined to do this stating that they wanted more flexibility with the returned aircraft to support their current fleet and operation.|$|E

5000|$|In 2001 it was {{purchased}} by the French conglomerate corporation LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy). [...] In 2015 Donna Karan left as chief designer at Donna Karan International, to focus on her Urban Zen brand and Urban Zen Foundation philanthropy. LVMH sold Donna Karan International, with the 'Donna Karan' and 'DKNY' brands, to the G-III Apparel Group in 2016 for $650 million. G-III, based in New York City, is a manufacturer and distributor of clothing and accessories <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>owned</b> brands, licensed brands, and private label brands.|$|R

5|$|Most gliders do {{not have}} engines or at least engines that would allow a {{take-off}} <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> power. Various methods are therefore used to get airborne. Each method requires specific training, therefore glider pilots must be in current practice {{for the type of}} launch being used. Licensing rules in some countries, such as the USA, differentiate between aerotows and ground launch methods, due to the widely different techniques.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and durable, yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> weight on land.|$|E
5|$|The Notitia lists a {{large number}} of units with barbarian names. This was {{probably}} the result of the transformation of irregular allied units serving <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> native officers (known as socii, or foederati) into regular formations. During the Principate, regular units with barbarian names are not attested until the 3rd century and even then rarely e.g. the ala I Sarmatarum attested in 3rd-century Britain, doubtless an offshoot of the Sarmatian horsemen posted there in 175.|$|E

25|$|The {{realm of}} human agency is bounded. Individuals produce society, {{but they do}} so as {{historically}} located actors, and not <b>under</b> conditions of <b>their</b> <b>own</b> choosing.|$|R
5|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the title}} ("commander") suggests that voivodes had significant military duties. They were the supreme leader of the troops recruited in the counties under their jurisdiction. Although law obliged noblemen {{to fight in the}} king's army, Transylvanian nobles fought under the command of the voivode. Furthermore, the voivodes had their own private retinue, formed primarily by armed noblemen. Their right to raise an army <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> flag was confirmed by legislation in 1498.|$|E
5|$|Attribution {{is often}} {{difficult}} with Farsari's photographs because 19th-century photographers frequently acquired each others' images and sold them <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> names. This {{may be due to}} the commonplace exchange of stock and negatives between various commercial photographers, or due to the number of freelance amateurs who sold their work to more than one studio. Thus a photograph identified as by Farsari might actually be by Beato, Stillfried & Andersen or Kusakabe. A case in point is the photograph of an Officer's Daughter, variously attributed to Farsari, Stillfried, Kusakabe or even Suzuki Shin'ichi.|$|E
5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove {{all but two of}} the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing to be broken up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that absence is generally viewed as [...] "mildly deviant workplace behavior". For example, {{people tend to}} hold negative stereotypes of absentees, <b>under</b> report <b>their</b> <b>own</b> absenteeism, and believe <b>their</b> <b>own</b> attendance record is better than that of their peers. Negative attributions about absence then bring about three outcomes: the behavior is open to social control, sensitive to social context, and is a potential source of workplace conflict.|$|R
50|$|The TR-22, TR-22C, and TR-33 {{were very}} small 2-meter FM {{transceivers}} that were entirely self-contained, including a telescoping antenna and rechargeable battery. They each {{came with a}} microphone and carrying case with shoulder strap. These transceivers were manufactured by Trio-Kenwood in Japan and marketed worldwide as TR-2200 and TR-2300 <b>under</b> <b>their</b> manufacturer's <b>own</b> brands.|$|R
25|$|The Germans {{could not}} {{remove all the}} signs, so adopted the V Sign as a German symbol, {{sometimes}} adding laurel leaves <b>under</b> it, painting <b>their</b> <b>own</b> V's on walls, vehicles and adding a massive V on the Eiffel Tower.|$|R
5|$|In early 1946, British fan John Carnell {{launched}} a new science fiction magazine titled New Worlds, published by Pendulum Publications. The first issue appeared in July 1946 and failed to sell well. The second issue, in October of that year, sold better, but Pendulum {{went out of business}} before the end of 1947 with only one more issue released. A group of sf fans, including Carnell and Frank Cooper, decided to restart the magazine <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> control, and formed Nova Publications Ltd. The fourth issue appeared in April 1949.|$|E
5|$|The city clerk is Buster Brown. The City of Omaha administers twelve departments, {{including}} finance, police, human rights, {{libraries and}} planning. The Omaha City Council is {{the legislative branch}} and is made up seven members elected from districts across the city. The council enacts local ordinances and approves the city budget. Government priorities and activities are established in a budget ordinance approved annually. The council takes official action through the passage of ordinances and resolutions. Nebraska's constitution grants the option of home rule to cities with more than 5,000 residents, meaning they may operate <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> charters. Omaha {{is one of only}} three cities in Nebraska to use this option, out of 17 eligible. The City of Omaha is currently considering consolidating with Douglas County government.|$|E
5|$|The pier {{suffered}} {{structural damage}} {{due to the}} Great Storm of 1987, and access from the shore was removed for safety reasons in 1991. The West Pier Trust continued to offer regular tours of the pier throughout the 1990s. In 1998, the National Lottery pledged £14 million to restore the pier, but the West Pier Trust {{was unable to find}} a suitable partner to help with restoration. The owners of the Palace Pier, who had become financially self-sufficient <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> means, claimed unfair competition. In 2001, English Heritage identified the pier as the most at-risk Grade I listed structure in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Virginia {{is divided}} into 95 {{counties}} and 38 independent cities, the latter acting in many ways as county-equivalents. This general method of treating cities and counties on par with each other is unique to Virginia; only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the United States, each in a different state. Virginia limits the authority of cities and counties to countermand laws expressly allowed by the Virginia General Assembly under {{what is known as}} Dillon's Rule. In addition to independent cities, there are also incorporated towns which operate <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> governments, but are part of a county. Finally there are hundreds of unincorporated communities within the counties. Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions, such as villages or townships.|$|E
5|$|Zveno-SPB saw limited but {{successful}} combat {{use during}} the German-Soviet War. In the opening stages, the Black Sea Fleet Air Force was tasked with destroying industrial targets in Nazi Germany-allied Romania. The {{most important of these}} was the King Carol I Bridge over Danube which carried the Ploieşti-Constanţa oil pipeline. After several failed attempts to destroy the heavily protected bridge with conventional bombers, the task was given to the Zveno squadron. As a combat test, it was decided to first attack the Constanţa oil depot. On 26 July 1941, two Zveno-SPB aircraft performed a successful attack on the depot in broad daylight with no losses. The fighters disconnected 40km (22 NM, 25mi) from the target and returned to the home airfield <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> power.|$|E
5|$|After the 2000 acquisition, Renault renamed Samsung Motors as Renault Samsung Motors (RSM). That year, the company's sales {{began to}} improve. Journalists {{attribute}} {{this to the}} success of the first car manufactured at Busan in taxi fleets (the SM5), which led to increased confidence of the model within the rest of their customer base. During the following years, the company introduced a new vehicle range, including the SM3 in 2002, the SM7 in 2004 and the crossover QM5 in 2007. Over time, RSM changed its products from a Nissan-based architecture to a Renault-based one. As part of the Renault group, Renault Samsung basically became an export-oriented manufacturer. Despite not being exported <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> brand, Renault Samsung-manufactured vehicles have over the time been rebadged as Renault or Nissan, and sold in markets such as Europe (QM5 and SM5), Russia, Ukraine, Mexico, Egypt, Central and South America, the Middle East (SM3 and SM5), China (SM7), Australia (QM5), or the United States and Canada (the Rogue).|$|E
25|$|On 1 July, {{following}} the preliminary bombardment, the Ulstermen quickly took the German front line. But intelligence was so poor that, {{with the rest}} of the division attacking under creep bombardment (artillery fired in front or over men; they advance as it moves), the Ulstermen would have come <b>under</b> attack from <b>their</b> <b>own</b> bombardment at the German first line.|$|R

The last GMA {{was held in}} 2004 and the SRA was born {{a few months later}} to encompass stations from all four languages that MediaCorp broadcast in: English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Czechoslovak trams (Tatra T3) and jet {{trainers}} (L-29) were {{the standard for}} all Comecon countries, including the USSR, and other countries could develop <b>their</b> <b>own</b> designs but only for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> needs, like Poland (respectively, Konstal trams and TS-11 jets). Poland was a manufacturer of light helicopters for Comecon countries (Mi-2 of the Soviet design). The USSR developed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> model Kamov Ka-26 and Romania produced French helicopters <b>under</b> license for <b>their</b> <b>own</b> market. In a formal or informal way, often the countries were discouraged from developing <b>their</b> <b>own</b> designs that competed with the main Comecon design.|$|R
5|$|Based on the {{uncertain}} direction and slow {{speed of the}} drift, Nansen calculated that it might take the ship five years to reach the pole. In January 1894 he had first discussed with both Henriksen and Johansen the possibility of making a sledge journey with the dogs, from Fram to the pole, though they made no immediate plans. Nansen's first attempts to master dog-driving were an embarrassing failure, but he persevered and gradually achieved better results. He also discovered that the normal cross-country skiing speed {{was the same as}} that of dogs pulling loaded sledges. Men could travel <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> power, skiing, rather than riding on the sledge, and loads could be correspondingly increased. This, according to biographer and historian Roland Huntford, amounted to a revolution in polar travel methods.|$|E
5|$|Communications {{between the}} brigade and {{battalion}} headquarters and the forward company positions broke down {{at this stage}} and runners had to be despatched to pass a message asking for artillery support. Meanwhile, the supply situation for the Australians also became desperate as they had consumed all of their rations and {{had run out of}} water. The water situation was solved by digging a well within the perimeter, but it became clear that reinforcements were required. The Australian divisional commander, Bridgeford, subsequently placed a squadron of Matilda tanks under Major Kenneth Arnott from the 2/4th Armoured Regiment at the 7th Brigade commander's disposal, and {{over the course of the}} day these tanks were brought up towards the 25th's position from Toko where they had been put ashore from landing craft. Engineers were used to bridge a number of creeks and streams, while bulldozers were also employed to improve the terrain or to pull the tanks along when they were unable move <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> power.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall beginning in 1961, which increased tensions between East and West, Brundage was successful in securing a joint German team for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Nevertheless, the East Germans, supported by IOC members from Warsaw Pact nations, aspired to have their own team. They made a major breakthrough when the IAAF (led by the Marquess of Exeter, the former Lord Burghley) recognized a separate East German team beginning with the 1966 European Athletics Championships. The East Germans did their best to get Brundage's support, and, at the IOC session at Mexico City in 1968, they were granted full membership, with their own team <b>under</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> flag, which they displayed on West German soil four years later at the Opening Ceremony at Munich. Brundage, while finally supporting full membership for East Germany, considered the matter a defeat for Olympic ideals.|$|E
50|$|Amid tight {{security}} {{from the}} Australian forces present, {{the election was}} peaceful and orderly, with no violence related to the election reported. However within a day of votes being counted, irregularities began to appear. These include 87 marked voting papers found at a booth before polls opened as well as children <b>under</b> 17 with <b>their</b> <b>own</b> registration cards attempting to vote.|$|R
50|$|The Assembly walked {{round the}} palace, repulsed by bayonets on all sides, {{only to return}} and submit. On the motion of Couthon the Convention voted for the {{suspension}} and internment (arrestation chex eux) of twenty-nine Girondin members together with ministers Claviere and Lebrun, but stipulated {{that they should be}} placed <b>under</b> arrest at <b>their</b> <b>own</b> homes <b>under</b> guard of a gendarme.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, UNDER CODE officially {{closed its}} doors. As a result, many bands signed to the label split up, such as Nega, Megaromania, DALI, Vior Gloire. A {{handful of other}} acts {{remained}} active, such as FUTURISM・BOYZ, 凛 (LIN), and REALies. Several musicians related to <b>UNDER</b> CODE formed <b>their</b> <b>own</b> labels, such as GOEMAN Records formed by REALies' frontman Rayka, and King Zebra formed by 朱's (SUZAKU) vocalist 樹 (Itsuki).|$|R
