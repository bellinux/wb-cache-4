India, in the past has condemned all acts of aggression and has also supported the United Nations' peace-keeping activities. By 2004, the Indian Army had participated in 37 UN peace-keeping operations. India {{played a key role in}} the passing of a <b>UN</b> <b>resolution</b> in 2003, which envisaged better co-operation between the Security Council and the troop-contributing countries. India has also been in favour of nuclear disarmament.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, 2016 {{under the}} Obama Administration, the United States abstained from United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, {{effectively}} {{allowing it to}} pass. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly criticized the Administration's actions, and the Israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6million in United States dollars, on January 6, 2017. On January 5, 2017, the United States House of Representatives voted 342–80 to condemn the <b>UN</b> <b>Resolution.</b>|$|E
50|$|Those {{who opposed}} the war in Iraq did not regard Iraq's {{violation}} of <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions</b> to be a valid case for the war, since no single nation has the authority, under the UN Charter, to judge Iraq's compliance to <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions</b> and to enforce them. Furthermore, critics argued that the US was applying double standards of justice, noting that other nations such as Israel are also in breach of <b>UN</b> <b>resolutions</b> and have nuclear weapons.|$|R

5|$|The {{first stage}} of the 1948 War, {{referred}} to as the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine, started following the ratification of <b>UN</b> <b>Resolution</b> 181 on November 29, 1947, which granted Israel the mandate to declare independence. This was declared on May 14, 1948 and the next night, the armies of a number of Arab states invaded Israel and attacked Israeli positions.|$|E
5|$|Among the U.S. {{delegation}} to the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City, Keyes was selected by Reagan as deputy chairman. In that capacity, Keyes negotiated {{the language of the}} Mexico City Policy to withhold federal funds from international organizations that support abortion. Additionally, Keyes fought against an Arab-backed <b>UN</b> <b>resolution</b> calling for investigation of Israeli settlements. The measure passed, 83–2, with 15 abstentions and only Israel and the U.S. voting against it. Reagan again appointed Keyes to represent the U.S. at the 1985 Women's Conference in Nairobi.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{campaign}} was criticized for high civilian casualties, including bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Milošević finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3June 1999, ending the Kosovo War. On 11June, Milošević further accepted <b>UN</b> <b>resolution</b> 1244, under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo, and part of KFOR's mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions, in addition to deterring violence. In August–September 2001, the alliance also mounted Operation Essential Harvest, a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia. , 4,882KFOR soldiers, representing 31countries, continue {{to operate in the}} area.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, at the UN, {{although}} the UN members and US were initially divided {{on how to}} respond to Chinese intervention in Korea, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire soon rallied the UN members towards US. Immediately afterward, a <b>UN</b> <b>resolution</b> that condemned China as an aggressor was passed on February 1. In the opinion of historian Bevin Alexander, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire had damaged the international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes, and this later made it difficult for China to either join the UN or to deny US support for Taiwan. The Korean War, which ultimately ended at the 38th parallel, would drag on for another two bloody years due to the Chinese demand for all UN forces to be withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1962 that Australia voted for a <b>UN</b> <b>resolution</b> condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister Garfield Barwick. Initially in opposition, until he was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was a vocal {{advocate}} of independence for Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting Namibian independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, were active internationally in their support of independence for Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia {{was involved in the}} UN process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, and two years later it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia. Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978, and made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.|$|E
5|$|Germany {{advocated}} quick {{recognition of}} Croatia, stating that {{it wanted to}} stop ongoing violence in Serb-inhabited areas. It was opposed by France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, but the countries agreed to pursue a common approach and avoid unilateral actions. On 10 October, {{two days after the}} Croatian Parliament confirmed the declaration of independence, the EEC decided to postpone any decision to recognize Croatia for two months, deciding to recognize Croatian independence in two months if the war had not ended by then. As the deadline expired, Germany presented its decision to recognize Croatia as its policy and dutya position supported by Italy and Denmark. France and the UK attempted to prevent the recognition by drafting a United Nations resolution requesting no unilateral actions which could worsen the situation, but backed down during the Security Council debate on 14 December, when Germany appeared determined to defy the <b>UN</b> <b>resolution.</b> On 17 December, the EEC formally agreed to grant Croatia diplomatic recognition on 15 January 1992, relying on opinion of the Badinter Arbitration Committee. The Committee ruled that Croatia's independence should not be recognized immediately, because the new Croatian Constitution did not provide protection of minorities required by the EEC. In response, the President Franjo Tuđman gave written assurances to Robert Badinter that the deficit would be remedied. The RSK formally declared its separation from Croatia on 19 December, but its statehood and independence were not recognized internationally. On 26 December, Yugoslav authorities announced plans for a smaller state, which could include the territory captured from Croatia, but the plan was rejected by the UN General Assembly.|$|E
