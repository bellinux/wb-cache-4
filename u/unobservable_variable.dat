Structural learning is the estimation of the links of the network. In terms of whether {{the structure of the}} network is known and whether the variables are all observable, there are four types of learning Bayesian networks cases. In this paper, first introduce two cases of learning Bayesian networks from complete data: known structure and <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables</b> and unknown structure and <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables.</b> Next, we study two cases of learning Bayesian networks from incomplete data: known network structure and <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables,</b> unknown network structure and <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{exogenous}} impact {{function is}} defined as the derivative of a structural function with respect to an endogenous variable, other <b>variables,</b> including <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables</b> held fixed. <b>Unobservable</b> <b>variables</b> are fixed at specific quantiles of their marginal distributions. Exogenous impact functions reveal the impact of an exogenous shift in a variable perhaps determined endogenously in the data generating process. They provide information about the variation in exogenous impacts across quantiles of the distributions of the <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables</b> that appear in the structural model. This paper considers nonparametric identification of exogenous impact functions under quantile independence conditions. It is shown that, when valid instrumental variables are present, exogenous impact functions can be identified as functionals of conditional quantile functions that involve only observable random variables. This suggests parametric, semiparametric and nonparametric strategies for estimating exogenous impact functions. ...|$|R

However, EKF is inadequate for nonlinear PK/PD models, and MLE is known to be biased downwards.

The performances of EKF and DMF are compared through simulations, and it is found that the results based on DMF are more accurate than those given by EKF with respect to mean absolute error.

40|$|The role of Poverty Alleviation Programs (PAP) in �ghting {{poverty and}} {{ensuring}} {{the satisfaction of}} basic economic needs is well known. How- ever, informational asymmetries create the need for adequate instruments to prevent fraud. This paper provides a static model of adverse selection where the gov- ernment (principal) aims to minimize the costs of a PAP that ensures that all individuals have access to an exogenously de�ned minimum in- come level. Agents may di¤er in their income-generating ability and disutility of labor. Under the di¤erent informational environments, we study the ef- fectiveness of workfare (that involves unpaid and unproductive work in the public sector) as a screening device, based on the comparison with standard monitoring. We �nd that when disutility of labor is the only <b>unobservable</b> <b>variable,</b> a workfare policy is ine¢ cient because it �crowds out�private sector work and signi�cantly increases {{the costs of the}} program. Under this informa- tional context, monitoring may be the best instrument for preventing fraud. When income-generating ability is the only <b>unobservable</b> <b>variable,</b> choosing between workfare and monitoring depends not only on the cost function associated with the latter, but also on income distribution. The analysis of this case would suggest that a workfare policy might be inef- �cient in the context of undeveloped countries where income distribution exhibits strong inequalities, but appropriate in developed ones. These conclusions suggest that a mixed policy combining workfare and monitor- ing may be optimal when both income-generating ability and disutility of labor are unknown. ...|$|E

40|$|Steven for {{organizing}} a study group on econometrics and statistics in spring 2011. Without that study group, {{nothing in this}} paper is possible. This paper develops new methods for social interactions identification. The contributions are threefold. First, for Manski’s (1993) reflection problem, this paper offers an effective method of decomposing endogenous effects and exogenous effects by the spectral decompositions of social effect matrices. Second, for the identification problem arising from the presence of unobservable group-level heterogeneity (so that the errors are not orthogonal to the observable exogenous variables), this paper offers {{a detailed analysis of}} differencing methods and provides a method to minimize information loss from differencing. Third, for the identification problem arising from the absence of observable individual-level heterogeneity (so that there is no instrument for the endogenous effect terms), this paper develops a method of identifying parameters by spectral decompositions of covariance matrices. The method of variance contrasts proposed by Graham (2008) is a special case of this method. While Graham’s method assumes homoskedasticity and no within-group correlations in <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables</b> and identifies only the social interaction parameter, this paper’s covariance matrix decomposition method allows heteroskedasticity and within-group correlations in <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables</b> and identifies the social interaction parameter and all second moments of the <b>unobservable</b> <b>variables.</b> ...|$|R

The model assumes that the co-movements of indicators have a common element that can be summarized as a single underlying and <b>unobservable</b> <b>variable,</b> the “state of the economy” (Stock and Watson, 1988). The model utilizes the Kalman filter smoothing approach which smooths the index across time and across indicators and results in index movements that are less pronounced during expansions and recessions.
