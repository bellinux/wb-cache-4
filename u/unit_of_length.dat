5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} {{is one of}} the oldest algorithms in common use. It appears in Euclid's Elements (c. 300 BC), specifically in Book 7 (Propositions 1–2) and Book 10 (Propositions 2–3). In Book 7, the {{algorithm is}} formulated for integers, whereas in Book 10, it is formulated for lengths of line segments. (In modern usage, one would say it was formulated there for real numbers. But lengths, areas, and volumes, represented as real numbers in modern usage, are not measured in the same units and there is no natural <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length,</b> area, or volume; the concept of real numbers was unknown at that time.) The latter algorithm is geometrical. The GCD of two lengths a and b corresponds to the greatest length g that measures a and b evenly; in other words, the lengths a and b are both integer multiples of the length g.|$|E
30|$|Determination of units: For {{every word}} in the test sentence, we first searched for <b>units</b> <b>of</b> maximum <b>length</b> which are quinphones or <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>length</b> equal to the <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the word if the word is {{comprised}} of fewer than five phones. If <b>units</b> <b>of</b> maximum <b>length</b> were not found, then we searched for <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>length</b> which is one less than the maximum length, and so on. In short, we joined <b>units</b> <b>of</b> maximum <b>length</b> when they were available in the database or used backoff <b>units</b> <b>of</b> shorter <b>lengths.</b> This approach resulted in fewer joins and a more natural and faster synthesis.|$|R

25|$|In 1670, John Wilkins, {{the first}} {{president}} of the Royal Society, published his proposal for a decimal system of measure, in his work An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language. His proposal envisaged a system of units in which the base <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length</b> was defined by a pendulum that had a period of one second, and the base unit of mass was defined by a cube of rainwater having sides equal to the base <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length.</b> He recycled the existing names of units of measure, so that there were 10 lines in an inch, 10inches in a foot, and so on. A century later, his concept of defining unit mass in terms of a cube of water with edges of unit length was one of the fundamental concepts of the metric system.|$|E
25|$|A floating-point {{system can}} be used to represent, with a fixed number of digits, numbers of {{different}} orders of magnitude: e.g. the distance between galaxies or the diameter of an atomic nucleus can be expressed with the same <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length.</b> The result of this dynamic range is that the numbers that can be represented are not uniformly spaced; the difference between two consecutive representable numbers grows with the chosen scale.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{meaning of the}} word dimension, in Fourier's Theorie de la Chaleur, was the numerical value of the exponents of the base units. For example, acceleration was considered to have the dimension 1 with respect to the <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length,</b> and the dimension −2 with respect to the unit of time. This was slightly changed by Maxwell, who said the dimensions of acceleration are LT−2, instead of just the exponents.|$|E

25|$|Although {{not defined}} by the pendulum, the final length chosen for the metre, 10−7 of the pole-to-equator {{meridian}} arc, {{was very close to}} the length of the seconds pendulum (0.9937 m), within 0.63%. Although no reason for this particular choice was given at the time, it was probably to facilitate the use of the seconds pendulum as a secondary standard, as was proposed in the official document. So the modern world's standard <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length</b> is certainly closely linked historically with the seconds pendulum.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the plane}} was {{described}} in a so-called Cartesian coordinate system, a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane {{by a pair of}} numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances from the point to two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length.</b> Each reference line is called a coordinate axis or just axis of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin, usually at ordered pair (0, 0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.|$|E
25|$|Having {{difficulties}} in communicating with German scientists, the Scottish inventor James Watt, in 1783, {{called for the}} creation of a global decimal measurement system. A letter of invitation, in 1790, from the French National Assembly to the British Parliament to help create such a system using the length of a pendulum as the base <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length</b> received the support of the British Parliament, championed by John Riggs Miller, but when the French overthrew their monarchy and decided to use the meridional definition of the metre as their base unit, Britain withdrew support. The French continued alone and created the foundations of what is now called the Système International d'Unités and is the measurement system for most of the world.|$|E

25|$|In {{the discussions}} {{leading up to}} the French {{adoption}} of the metric system in 1791, the leading candidate for the definition of the new <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length,</b> the metre, was the seconds pendulum at 45° North latitude. It was advocated by a group led by French politician Talleyrand and mathematician Antoine Nicolas Caritat de Condorcet. This was one of the three final options considered by the French Academy of Sciences committee. However, on March 19, 1791 the committee instead chose to base the metre on the length of the meridian through Paris. A pendulum definition was rejected because of its variability at different locations, and because it defined length by a unit of time. (However, since 1983 the metre has been officially defined in terms of the length of the second and the speed of light.) A possible additional reason is that the radical French Academy didn't want to base their new system on the second, a traditional and nondecimal unit from the ancien regime.|$|E
25|$|Planometria, or, The Whole Art of Surveying of Land was a {{pamphlet}} written in 1650 by Leybourn and published under the pseudonym Oliver Wallinby. Leybourn expanded {{this into a}} full book, The Compleat Surveyor which {{was first published in}} 1653, by his own press. This was the first book published on the subject that did not contain an extensive argument justifying surveying. The book outlined the various instruments used in surveying, and how they were employed. This book was one of the standard references in the field {{for the remainder of the}} 17th century and into the 18th century. The book instructed property surveyors on the construction of property maps, and how to make the appropriate coloured inks for the maps. At this time, the use of private estates maps was starting to become fashionable, to the extent that some very pleased clients would display the coloured maps for their guests to view. The book also contains instructions on mathematical measures. The section on the use of Gunter's chains as a <b>unit</b> <b>of</b> <b>length</b> shows early use of decimals in surveying. Leybourn would later expand and clairify this in his 1657 work Arithmetick, Vulgar, Decimal and Instramental.|$|E
