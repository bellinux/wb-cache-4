40|$|Container trailer {{manufacturing}} is {{a growing}} industry in Sri Lanka. Only two organizations {{are involved in this}} business and the monthly production was recorded as 100 to 125 trailers. Like other manufacturing industries, trailer industry also faces problems due to trailer failures and difficulties to improve the trade. Failures are mainly due to lack of design stage analysis of the product. The primary objective of my research project is to analyze trailer failure problems and suggest solutions to improve the trailer industry in Sri Lanka. The methodology of this research is a combination of research training programme, questionnaire based study and a finite element analysis of the trailer solid model. Research training programme was arranged in a leading manufacturing and servicing organization in Sri Lanka by the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Moratuwa. It was very useful to understand the trailer manufacturing concepts, designs, trailer failures and the general problems faced by the trailer industry. Questionnaires are produced to two different categories of industries such as Trailer manufacturers and <b>Trailer</b> <b>users.</b> Questionnaires for <b>trailer</b> manufacturers are oriented towards identifying the techniques used by manufacturers to control the failures especially in design stage and identifying their problems and limitations in manufacturing trailers. Questionnaires for <b>trailer</b> <b>users</b> are oriented towards identifying trailer failures. A finite element analysis was carried out to study the present design of a particular type of trailer to identify the efficiency in design and to present any solutions if needed. Further, there were several rounds of semi-structured interviews with technical specialists, designers, supervisors and welders who were involved in trailer manufacturing. By the combination of all the efforts, it is found that trailer failures are mainly due to the problems due to design, fabrication, materials and parts selection, human resource and trailer misuse. Suggestions to present trailer problems and future improvements in trailer manufacture are produced...|$|R

40|$|The {{subjective}} {{nature of}} gender inequality motivates {{the analysis and}} comparison of data from real and fictional human interaction. We present a computational extension of the Bechdel test: A popular tool to assess if a movie contains a male gender bias, by looking for two female characters who discuss about something besides a man. We provide the tools to quantify Bechdel scores for both genders, and we measure them in movie scripts and large datasets of dialogues between users of MySpace and Twitter. Comparing movies and users of social media, we find that movies and Twitter conversations have a consistent male bias, which does not appear when analyzing MySpace. Furthermore, the narrative of Twitter {{is closer to the}} movies that do not pass the Bechdel test than to those that pass it. We link the properties of movies and the <b>users</b> that share <b>trailers</b> of those movies. Our analysis reveals some particularities of movies that pass the Bechdel test: Their trailers are less popular, female users are more likely to share them than male users, and users that share them tend to interact less with male users. Based on our datasets, we define gender independence measurements to analyze the gender biases of a society, as manifested through digital traces of online behavior. Using the profile information of Twitter users, we find larger gender independence for urban users in comparison to rural ones. Additionally, the asymmetry between genders is larger for parents and lower for students. Gender asymmetry varies across US states, increasing with higher average income and latitude. This points to the relation between gender inequality and social, economical, and cultural factors of a society, and how gender roles exist in both fictional narratives and public online dialogues. ...|$|R
