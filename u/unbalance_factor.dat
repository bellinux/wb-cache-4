40|$|The {{unbalanced}} non-sinusoidal operation {{represents a}} common steady {{state of the}} modern distribution power grids. The unbalance is produced by supplying of unbalanced loads or by different unbalanced faults.

A control algorithm is presented for an APLC to compensate harmonics and <b>unbalance</b> <b>factor.</b> Sensing load currents, dc bus voltages compute reference currents of APLC. APLC driving signals are produced with the reference signals via a hysteresis band current controller. The case of distorted supply voltage condition has been considered.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{electric}} {{railway system}} becomes an efficient mass transportation in large urban areas. A railway electrification system supplies electric power to railway trains through the transformers. Therefore, the transformer {{is a key}} component to help reduce problems of the unbalance of voltage and current in the power grid. As electric trains have their power delivered on a single-phase system, the single-phase transformer causes the unbalance of voltage and current in the power system network, with which the railway electrification system is connected. In order to alleviate these problems, special transformers, i. e. Scott transformer and Le-Blanc transformer, have been proposed {{to be used in}} the railway electrification system. This paper focuses on developing the special transformer models for using in DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. The developed models have been verified with a simple train system in order to study the effectiveness of reduction of voltage <b>unbalance</b> <b>factors</b> from the three types of transformers. In addition, the developed special transformer models can be applied in a large-scale power system network for power quality problem analysis...|$|R
40|$|The probrem {{in regard}} to driving of a {{monocyclic}} motor is how to choose a static phase converter allowing a satisfactory starting，acceleration and load characteristics. For an ideal operation，the static phase converter should be continuously varied with the velocity of the motor, but in practice it is common that {{the choice of the}} static phase converter is to be done when it is started, accelerated and it is being driven at the rated speed. Upon this，the author tried his analysis by means of symmetrical component theory，as shown in Fig. 1, on troque, <b>unbalance</b> <b>factors</b> and the phase current at the time of starting. The results thus obtained，being represented as functions of four parameters without any dimension，could be applied to given rated motors. Therefore the comparison of starting with various kinds of static phase converter became very simple and easy to be done. Among three kinds of combinations of L, C, and R as elements of static phase converter, the combination where L and C were used was revealed to be most excellent, while a completely balanced state was observed when the impedance angle of the motor was 30 °, y= 1 and k= 2. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractToday, {{efficiency}} is {{considered as one}} of the most effective ways of increasing economic growth by many planners and economic policy makers in different countries; further, huge investments made in this regard. On the other hand, the issue of budget deficit was introduced in economic literature since 1980 s. Within this decade, current budget deficit significantly increased in the USA. Emerging of this phenomenon prompted many economists to establish public sector as the macroeconomic <b>unbalancing</b> <b>factor,</b> on the contrary to Keynesy who regarded public sector as the balance factor, particularly in developing countries since developing countries deal with specific problems such as foreign debt, high inflation, difficulties of payment balances, exchange parallel markets as well as various external shocks. Therefore, this research tried to study the effect of growth, efficiency and government budget deficit in MENA selected countries within 2000 - 2013 by using the recommended static panel models. Results of the estimated relations for the first model in which government budget deficit is the dependent variable indicate positive effect of economic growth and inflation rate variables as well as the negative effect of labor productivity and government budget deficit. Moreover, the second model in which economic growth is the dependent variable demonstrates the positive effect of labor productivity index and economic growth. In addition, negative correlation of government budget deficit with economic growth is also maintained...|$|R

40|$|Small-scale, residential, and {{distributed}} energy resources (DER), which are electric vehicles (EVs), heat pumps (HPs), and photovoltaic (PV) arrays, were studied to evaluate {{their impact on the}} UK future residential demand and their impact on UK distribution networks. Centralized and decentralized controllers were planned in order to defer reinforcement, while connecting DER units to distribution networks. The centralized controller allocates EV charging durations considering network constraints. The decentralized controller adjusts EV and HP loads based on consumer satisfaction, network constraints, and electricity prices. Normal probability distribution and median filter were used to predict aggregated power of EVs, HPs, and PV arrays on a half-hourly basis over a year. Because of an expected surplus of PV power generation, a considerable demand reduction followed by a sharp demand increase will occur with these residential DER units during summer days in 2035. A low voltage section of test network was used to study the impact of uncontrolled EV charging loads on a three-phase four-wire system. Different combinations of EVs, HPs, and PV arrays were used to investigate their uncertainties in a low voltage section of real network. Real-world trials were used to generate the individual power of residential customers and DER units. Results of unbalanced power flow indicated that network constraints exceeded their limits with a high number of these low carbon technologies. Using an extended section of the test network, the central controller maintains voltage magnitudes, voltage <b>unbalance</b> <b>factors,</b> and power flows within their limits, by re-allocating EV charging durations accordingly. The decentralized controller was designed to minimize electricity bills of EV and HP users. This controller adjusts EV and HP loads to maintain consumer satisfaction and network constraints within their specified boundaries. Consumer satisfaction was determined using mathematical models of EV battery state-of-charge levels and the indoor temperatures of HP houses. The decentralized controller was used to connect predicted numbers of EVs and HPs to a real distribution network, while overcoming the need for network reinforcement, third parties (aggregators), and extensive communication systems...|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} study (part of the Czech 400 kV system was added with a new substation), the task was to find the lowest value of <b>unbalance</b> <b>factor</b> mf for vectors Î_T 1 and Î_T 3 with minimal costs and changes to the system. Since the {{reduction}} of unbalance {{was performed on the}} existing part of the system (there was only a small extension for the new substation), the transmission system operator suggested an appropriate place for possible transposition in section C, and the current unbalance reduction was achieved by changing the phase sequence arrangements in section C (by changing the matrix Ẑ_C). Technically, this requires to install two inverse transposition towers at {{the beginning and the end}} positions of section C. Generally, the current unbalance can be reduced by different topology changes or their combinations. The final suitable measure must satisfy transmission system operator requirements and economical and environmental aspects and depends on many aspects in real electrical system. This paper is primarily focused on the unbalance calculation and not on the measure design. Hence, the section C transposition should be understood only as an example with presented impacts on the <b>unbalance</b> <b>factor.</b>|$|E
