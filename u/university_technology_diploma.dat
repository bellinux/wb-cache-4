30|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{that all these}} studies form a foundation for further understanding university-industry <b>technology</b> transfer and <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations in China, some limitations can be observed as follows. First, the definitions of <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations in these studies are vague. Second, while many forms of university and industry links and <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations are discussed, few examine them {{from the perspective of}} their historical development. Third, none of them have systematically examined the organizational characteristics of <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations. These challenges call for proper analytical frameworks for studying <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations in China and among which the development of a typology of <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations in China is the most urgent.|$|R

30|$|Although {{the paper}} {{focuses on the}} {{development}} of a typology of <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations, the analysis of their organizational characteristics also provides some practical implications for different stakeholders. First, it provides a solid basis for Chinese policymakers to consider what optimal models of <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations are. Although several forms of <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations co-exist in China, the tendency is that they become more independent, have more professional management, and take more financial accountability. Thus, when planning future development of <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations, it may be worthwhile to retain these features. While there may be several scenarios for future <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organizations, we envision that one option is to develop some kind of more professional <b>university</b> <b>technology</b> transfer organization which is no longer an administrative organization like the current technology transfer offices in universities, but primarily provides fully integrated services for technology transfer and operates according to market mechanisms.|$|R
