40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of the industrial sector in Sri Lanka, {{there is a high}} demand for clear span buildings to cater for the factories. Plastic design for portal frame has become popular in these days. However in Sri Lanka, most Designers adopt elastic design due to the scarcity of analytical and design software dealing with plastic design. There is no proper way of plastic analysis unlike the elastic analysis. Reactions for the plastic analysis are calculated after analyzing a number of collapse mechanisms. Clear guide lines for the portal frame with tapered sections are not given in BS 5950 except for some recommendation given in Appendix G. In this research, design of portal frames with tapered sections are done plastically and elastically but it was observed that plastic analysis is much difficult to detect the exact position of the plastic hinge. Then elastic design was done with tapered sections using CADD A 3 D Software package. Variable section properties were taken into consideration by dividing the member into small elements with the guide line given in BS 5950 and in particular appendix G, covering a span range of 20 m to 50 m for the spacing of 4. 5 m, 6. 0 m and 9. 0 m with eave height of 4. 5 m and 6. 0 m using 355 N/mm 2 and 275 N/mm 2 strength steel plates.

40|$|Classically, waveguides are {{structures}} with <b>uniform</b> <b>sections</b> or are periodic {{along an}} axis. Vibrations of these waveguides {{can be described}} by wave modes and propagation constants relating the displacements and forces in two sections of the waveguide. Here, waveguides of non <b>uniform</b> <b>sections</b> are considered. More precisely, we consider waveguides which have sections with size increasing proportionally to the distance from an origin. This is for instance {{the case for a}} domain exterior to a convex body. Using a finite element model of a small section of the guide, the wave finite element method (WFE) can be used to find propagation constants and wave modes relating the displacements and forces at the two extremities of the finite element section. Then, it is shown that the wave modes and propagation constants in a section are simply related to the same quantities in other sections but for different frequencies. From this set of waves, general solutions in the waveguide can be computed.

40|$|Sound {{propagation}} in {{an acoustic}} waveguide is examined using a hybrid numerical technique. Here, the waveguide {{is assumed to}} be infinite in length with an arbitrary but uniform crosssection. Placed centrally within the guide is a short component section with an irregular, nonuniform, shape. The hybrid method utilises a wave based modal solution for a <b>uniform</b> <b>section</b> of the guide and, using either a mode matching or point collocation approach, matches this to a standard finite element based solution for the component section. Thus, one needs only to generate a transverse finite element mesh in <b>uniform</b> <b>sections</b> of the waveguide and this significantly reduces the number of degrees of freedom required. Moreover, utilising a wave based solution removes the need to numerically enforce a non-reflecting boundary condition at infinity using a necessarily finite mesh, which is often encountered in studies that use only the standard finite element method. Accordingly, the component transmission loss may readily be computed and predictions are presented here for three examples: an expansion chamber, a converging-diverging duct and a circular cylinder. Good agreement with analytic models is observed, and transmission loss predictions are also presented for multi-mode incident and transmitted sound fields. 2 Kirby, JASA I...|$|R
