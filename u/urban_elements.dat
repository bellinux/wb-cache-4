500|$|A {{number of}} LCL {{branches}} remained with the LM, {{and there were}} mass resignations from the LCL on the whole. Eastick was relatively unconcerned: the LCL had a massive membership of over 30,000 and the LM's split did little to dent it—Eastick admitted 200 individual resignations. In the meantime, the LCL tried to introduce a requirement for members to make [...] "pledge" [...] {{that they were not}} aligned with [...] "an outside political body". This prompted a second wave of resignations, notably from sections of the Young Liberal Movement. Despite its leader's show of confidence, many in the LCL were concerned that the expulsion of LM elements had apparently backfired; it also prompted some disillusioned parliamentarians to suggest that rural and <b>urban</b> <b>elements</b> in the LCL could not coexist.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{introduces}} {{rules for}} building new urban squares, and for fixing existing {{ones that are}} dead. The public square as a fundamental <b>urban</b> <b>element</b> behaves both as a node and as a connector of the urban fabric. Like the components of an organism, each <b>urban</b> <b>element</b> is itself highly complex, and this conception contradicts postwar design trends based on abstract simplistic ideas: those are imposed {{in order to control}} instead of stimulating social life. Urban structures, infrastructure, human beings, their activity nodes, and all their interconnections come together to form a “super-organism”, a complex and dynamic whole that is the city. This happens only when the geometry of the urban fabric is encouraged to develop in a living manner. The basic element of this “super-organism” is urban space that works with informational processes. In European culture, the square connects the local urban space with other squares, streets, and roads with a strong pedestrian use. A living city works through its connections to reach the properties of a “super-organism”...|$|R
40|$|Satisfaction {{with the}} {{residential}} neighbourhood {{is an important}} indicator of housing and neighbourhood quality and condition that may affect an individual’s quality of life. Identification of factors which determine the satisfaction provides important inputs to the monitoring {{of the success of}} policies to achieve sustainable development. This paper explores the notion of sustainable urban form and social sustainability through evaluating the influence of <b>urban</b> form <b>elements</b> as determinants of neighbourhood satisfaction. <b>Urban</b> form <b>elements</b> claimed to have various significant impacts of sustainability. Several studies have explored the links between urban form and social sustainability in which urban form is able to improve access to facilities, social interactions, quality of life that would lead to a better neighbourhood satisfaction. This paper focuses on aspects that would contribute to the quality of life by examining the satisfaction of local residents with their neighbourhood in relation to the different <b>urban</b> form <b>elements.</b> This study adopted a quantitative method approach and data were collected through a questionnaire survey and observation survey. Findings revealed, that several <b>urban</b> form <b>elements</b> i. e. density, housing type and land use mix have a certain level of influence to improve the neighbourhood satisfaction among the local residents...|$|R
2500|$|In Tik-Tok of Oz, Baum {{included}} maps in the endpapers which definitively situated Oz on {{a continent}} with its neighboring countries. Oz {{is the largest}} country on the continent unofficially known as Nonestica (this name was proposed by Robert R. Pattrick {{for the whole of}} the countries surrounding Oz; Pattrick proposed [...] "Ozeria" [...] for the whole continent, but that name is generally unused in fan discussions), which also includes the countries of Ev, Ix, and Mo, which has also been known as Phunniland, among others. Nonestica is, according to the map, in the Nonestic Ocean. A fair amount of evidence in the books point to this continent as being envisioned as somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean. At the opening of Ozma of Oz, Dorothy Gale is sailing to Australia with her Uncle Henry when she is washed overboard (in a chicken coop, with Billina the yellow hen), and lands on the shore of Ev—a rare instance in which an outsider reaches the Oz landmass through non-magical (or apparently non-magical) means. Palm trees grow outside the Royal Palace in the Emerald City, and horses are not native to Oz, both points of consistency with a South-Pacific location; illustrations and descriptions of round-shaped and domed Ozite houses suggest a non-Western architecture. Conversely, Oz has technological, architectural, and <b>urban</b> <b>elements</b> typical of Europe and North America {{around the turn of the}} twentieth century; but this may involve cultural input from unusual external sources (see History below). Ruth Plumly Thompson asserts in her first Oz book, The Royal Book of Oz, that the language of Oz is English, which also suggests European or American influence.|$|E

40|$|Globalization {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} issues that changes cities. Global competition makes cities to need a range of solutions in order to be different from opponents and attract more economical investments. Branding is a customary topic for economics but globalization, attracting more investments and tourists to cities caused the topic an emerging subject for urban design and planning. Contemporary researches on integrated sustainable city can be turned into reality with city branding approaches. One of the fundamental decisions of urban studies approaches is to manage urban and spatial planning according to the <b>urban</b> design <b>elements</b> on city branding and identity of place. City branding is a smart solution for urban development, creation of jobs and providing a greater place to live and work. Advertisement and communication technologies could have a key effect on city branding. Mobile apps and websites can be used to deliver city branding goals and a lot of cities used ICT as a key policy to present their brand. But <b>urban</b> design <b>elements</b> on city branding should be represented in these activities in order to express the unique brand of the city and the elements are not the same in different cities. These elements should be identified and appraised in the cities rather than relying on stereotypical responses to a commercial order. This study considers key urban design disciplines and previous attitudes on city branding to offer a framework for <b>urban</b> design <b>elements</b> on city branding. This concept introduces the elements in main approaches and dimensions. In order to introduce <b>urban</b> design <b>elements</b> on city branding, this study uses a laboratory experiment that happened during Fourth International Conference on Urban and Extra Urban Studies 2013, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and concluded fourteen <b>urban</b> design <b>elements</b> for Amsterdam brand...|$|R

In urban design /planning point of view urbanization must then be essential to recognize and deal as physical <b>urban</b> <b>element</b> change (built areas, tree covered areas, green/grass areas, streets and paved areas, and bare lands) to identify its effect on its microclimate while that change occurred in a particular area, then being calculated as thermal comfort change. Since the research study is framed on Time Rate Change Method; sense of aerial photographs from the Survey Department at different intervals," over respective time period of 50 years, provide information regarding <b>urban</b> physical <b>element</b> change.

This was when people began to feel the need to regain some kind of shared dimension where the spaces for trade and social interaction could coexist.

Urban infrastructure maintenance management deals with complex decision making process. The reasons for a complexity are: lots of participants, multi-disciplinarity, huge quantity of information, limited budget, conflict goals and criteria. These facts indicate that decision making processes in urban infrastructure management undoubtedly belong to ill-defined problems. In order to cope with such complexity and to help project managers during decision making processes this research proposes an application of multicriteria methods.
