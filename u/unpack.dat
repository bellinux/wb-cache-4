40|$|Research in task {{duration}} judgment {{has shown that}} <b>unpacking</b> a multifaceted task into components prior to estimating its duration increases estimates. In three studies, we find that <b>unpacking</b> a complex task can increase, decrease, or leave unaffected {{task duration}} estimates depending on the typicality of the <b>unpacked</b> components and their temporal position in the task sequence. <b>Unpacking</b> atypical long components increases task duration estimates, while <b>unpacking</b> atypical short components decreases estimates (Study 1). <b>Unpacking</b> atypical early components increases task duration estimates, while <b>unpacking</b> atypical late components decreases estimates (Study 2). <b>Unpacking</b> typical early or late components leaves estimates unaffected (Study 3). We explain these results {{based on the idea}} that task duration estimation involves a mental simulation process, and by drawing on theories of <b>unpacking</b> in probability judgment that emphasize the role of the typicality of the <b>unpacked</b> components. These findings hint at a deep conceptual link between probability judgment and task duration estimation but also show differences, such as the influence that temporality exerts on estimated duration. © 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|R

5|$|During April 1944, No. 78 Wing {{received}} {{orders to}} move again, {{this time to}} support Operation Reckless, the American landing at Hollandia in western New Guinea. The main party of the squadron departed Cape Gloucester on 17 April bound for Tadji airstrip on the mainland of New Guinea, and its Kittyhawks arrived there on the 24th of the month. No. 78 Squadron began flying patrols over the American beachhead at Hollandia the next day. The squadron continued to provide air defence for Hollandia and Tadji throughout early May. From 7 to 10 May a detachment of 16 Kittyhawks from No. 78 Squadron operated from the Hollandia beachhead; owing to food shortages in the area the pilots arrived with rations for four days loaded in their aircraft. On 15 May the unit moved permanently to an airfield near Hollandia, from which it escorted USAAF bombers and formed part of the force protecting the US Army landings at Wakde on 17 May and Biak on the 27th. Overall, the squadron flew 601 sorties during May. Its operations over Biak included its only air-to-air combat of the war. On 3 June, 16 Kittyhawks from No. 78 Squadron intercepted a group of 12 Nakajima Ki-43 fighters and two Nakajima B5N bombers near Biak. The Australian airmen downed five Ki-43s and two B5Ns {{for the loss of}} one Kittyhawk and its pilot. This was the last major air battle fought by the RAAF during the Pacific War. On 10 June, eight No. 78 Squadron Kittyhawks were escorting a convoy when they sighted a Japanese Kawasaki Ki-61 fighter. Two of the Australian aircraft attacked the Ki-61 and shot it down near Japen Island. This was the final aerial victory achieved by the RAAF during the New Guinea campaign. No. 78 Squadron continued to fly defensive patrols over Hollandia until 20 July, when it was redeployed to Noemfoor island. This was the squadron's sixth move in nine months, and the intensive effort needed to pack and <b>unpack</b> stores on each occasion caused widespread fatigue among airmen and ground crew.|$|E

25|$|The 8 LMQs {{have two}} key purposes. Firstly, {{they act as}} a ‘professional {{knowledge}} organiser’.

25|$|The FIDONET {{program was}} what later {{became known as}} a mailer. FIDO was {{modified}} to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a node number for the machine the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then <b>unpack</b> the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.|$|E

40|$|The current {{research}} work aimed {{to access the}} contamination level of aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1, and G 2 in the household spices that are widely consumed in huge amounts. 200 different spice samples, 100 packed and 100 <b>unpacked,</b> were analyzed for the aflatoxins profile by HPLC with an incidence of 61. 5 % contamination out of which 53. 66 % samples exceed the EU limit. The results disclosed that the <b>unpacked</b> samples are more contaminated {{as compared to the}} packed samples except for white cumin seeds. Among packed and <b>unpacked</b> samples of spices, the maximum value of aflatoxins was detected in fennel, that is, 27. 93 [*]μg/kg and 67. 04 [*]μg/kg, respectively. The lowest concentration of aflatoxin was detected in cinnamon in packed form (0. 79 [*]μg/kg) and in the <b>unpacked</b> samples of white cumin seeds which is 1. 75 [*]μg/kg.

40|$|Consumers use affective {{evaluations}} of past hedonic experiences {{in their future}} decision-making.

Results from two experiments show that mental <b>unpacking</b> interacted with experience enjoyment to alter past evaluations in two ways: if the enjoyment of the experience was high, <b>unpacked</b> recalls increased remembered enjoyment, but <b>unpacking</b> decreased remembered enjoyment if the experience enjoyment was low.

[...] In his letter sent to President Carter and others, Stein also observes: [...] "Aside from the one-sided nature of the book, meant to provoke, there are recollections cited from meetings where I was the third person in the room, and my notes of those meetings show little similarity to points claimed in the book." [...] He adds: [...] "Being a former President does not give one a unique privilege to invent information or to <b>unpack</b> it with cuts, deftly slanted to provide a particular outlook.

His conservatism often conflicts with the wishes of his teenage daughter Layla, although he loves her dearly (in fact the main reason he has custody of her is that when his ex-wife came to visit him after he moved to Mercy she saw that the only thing he had bothered to <b>unpack</b> was his daughter's picture on the wall). He wears a taqiyah and a shalwar kameez and constantly rants and raves and complains about everything, to the point that most of his acquaintances consider him obnoxious.

He calls most non-Muslims [...] "imbeciles" [...] and [...] "infidels", although it is rather obvious that he is not any sort of dangerous fanatic but just a harmless crank. In the episode [...] "The Letter", Baber takes an interest in a female motivational speaker (played by Andrea Martin) who is stranded in Mercy, who in turn becomes interested in him.

[...] His bringing in the overzealous Rahaloon resulted in the mosque being removed from the church. [...] Later Amaar made amends with Baber when he was reinstated as Imam. [...] Baber performed Amaar and Rayyan's wedding and they left for their honeymoon. [...] Upon their return it is revealed that Baber is the current Imam and is good friends with Reverend Thorne.|$|E
