5|$|A more {{detailed}} procedure adopted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was as follows: the initial mixture of actinides is processed with ion exchange using lithium chloride reagent, then precipitated as hydroxides, filtered and dissolved in nitric acid. It is then treated with high-pressure elution from cation exchange resins, and the berkelium phase is oxidized and extracted <b>using</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedures described above. Reduction of the thus-obtained berkelium(IV) to the +3 oxidation state yields a solution, which is nearly free from other actinides (but contains cerium). Berkelium and cerium are then separated with {{another round of}} ion-exchange treatment.|$|E

5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, <b>using</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after {{the opening of the}} railway through March in 1846, and fell dramatically in the early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{lands on}} the surface of Zebes and explores the planet, {{traveling}} through the planet's caverns. She eventually comes across Kraid, an ally of the Space Pirates, and Ridley, the Space Pirates' commander, and defeats them both. Along the way, Samus finds and destroys Mother Brain. However, while Samus leaves the planet in her gunship, it is attacked by Space Pirates, causing it to crash back onto Zebes, near the Space Pirate Mothership. Exploring the Mothership, Samus eventually reaches the Mecha Ridley, a mechanized form of Ridley. After defeating it, Samus escapes the planet <b>using</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Space Pirate's shuttles, while the Mothership self-destructs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Using</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above definitions, dinosaurs can be {{generally}} described as archosaurs with hind limbs held erect beneath the body. Many prehistoric animal groups are popularly {{conceived of as}} dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and pelycosaurs (especially Dimetrodon), but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs, and none had the erect hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded {{the size of a}} domestic cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.|$|E

25|$|Although braille {{notation}} {{was designed}} {{for people who are}} blind or visually impaired to read, prior to the introduction of the Perkins Brailler, writing braille was a cumbersome process.
