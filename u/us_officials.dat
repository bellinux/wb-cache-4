5|$|According to Obama {{administration}} officials, <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> did {{not share}} information about the raid {{with the government of}} Pakistan until it was over. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen called Pakistan's army chief Ashfaq Parvez Kayani at about 3am local time to inform him of the Abbottabad Operation.|$|E
5|$|The Iranian {{government}} accused Israel of {{complicity in}} the killings. In 2011 and 2012, Iranian authorities arrested a number of Iranians alleged to have carried out the assassination campaign on behalf of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence service). Western intelligence services and <b>U.S</b> <b>officials</b> reportedly confirmed the Israeli connection. In June 2012, the Iranian government was confident that it had arrested all the assassins.|$|E

5|$|After {{the coup}} on 1 November 1963, in which Diệm and Nhu were killed the {{following}} day, Thơ was appointed Prime Minister by Minh's military junta five days later, on 6 November 1963. He {{was the leading}} civilian in the provisional government overseen by the Military Revolutionary Council (MRC). Minh had earlier promised <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> that the civilians would be above the generals in the hierarchy. In addition, he was minister for finance and the economy. Thơ's appointment was not universally popular, with some leading figures privately lobbying for a clean break from the Diệm era.|$|E
5|$|After {{the seizure}} of the 377 hostages, NATO did not carry out further air strikes, but it did {{continue}} regular air patrol operations {{in support of the}} no-fly zone. On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many <b>US</b> <b>officials,</b> he may have been deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E
5|$|Captain Sharif Ali bin Zeid, 34, a Jordanian {{military}} intelligence officer, {{was killed in}} the attack. He was the Jordanian handler of al-Balawi and the liaison between him and the CIA. Bin Zeid was a cousin to King Abdullah II of Jordan. Bin Zeid's wake was held in the Royal Palace. King Abdullah II and Queen Rania attended his funeral. Official Jordanian news reports said that he died while performing humanitarian service in Afghanistan. His death shed light on the U.S.-Jordanian intelligence partnership, which is rarely acknowledged publicly, yet seen by <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> as highly important for their counter-terrorism strategy.|$|E

5|$|Fischer {{lived for}} a time in Japan. On July 13, 2004, acting in {{response}} to a letter from <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials,</b> Japanese immigration authorities arrested him at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila, Philippines. Fischer resisted arrest, and claimed to have sustained bruises, cuts and a broken tooth in the process. At the time, Fischer had a passport (originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages) that, according to <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials,</b> had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest-warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation. Despite the outstanding arrest-warrant in the U.S., Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid. The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility. Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period, and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell.|$|E
5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. This was not {{strictly}} for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare {{made it more difficult}} for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the primary goal by the late 1820s. On August 19, 1825, <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined the boundaries of the region's tribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Seoul {{newspapers}} {{reported on}} a book Chung published about the events of 1950, raising awareness of the allegations inside South Korea. In that same year, the U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service in Korea dismissed one No Gun Ri petition by asserting that any killings took place during combat. The survivors' committee retorted {{that there was no}} battle at No Gun Ri, but <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> refused to reconsider.|$|E

5|$|In {{a meeting}} of the Croatian and US Governments and {{military}} officials held on 29 November 1994, the Croatian representatives proposed an attack on Serb-held territory from Livno in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in order to draw off part of the forces besieging Bihać and to prevent its capture by the Serbs. The <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> gave no response to the proposal and Operation Winter '94 was ordered the same day. Besides contributing to the defence of Bihać, the attack advanced positions held by the HV and the HVO nearer to supply routes vital to the RSK.|$|E
5|$|Mass demonstrations {{took place}} in Syria condemning US President Harry Truman for {{recognizing}} Israel. Synagogues were attacked in Damascus as were the offices of General Motors. <b>US</b> <b>officials</b> were frustrated at Quwatli for not attempting to stop the demonstrations. When Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon signed armistice agreements with Israel between February and April 1949, Syria under Quwatli {{did not do so}} and refused to send a delegation to attend truce negotiations in Rhodes in March.|$|E
5|$|Most Native Americans in {{the region}} decided against joining the uprising, and so the {{conflict}} ended after <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> responded with a show of military force. Ho-Chunk chiefs surrendered eight men {{who had participated in}} the violence, including Red Bird, who American officials believed to be the ringleader. Red Bird died in prison in 1828 while awaiting trial; two other men convicted of murder were pardoned by President John Quincy Adams and released.|$|E

5|$|On April 19, clashes {{erupted in}} Quảng Ngãi Province between the Buddhists and the VNQDD, {{prompting}} the local ARVN commander Tôn Thất Đính to forcibly restrain the two groups.

5|$|Realizing the North Vietnamese {{would try}} to destroy the installation, Secord advised the U.S Embassy in Vientiane to {{evacuate}} all U.S. personnel. However, high-ranking <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as it helped {{save the lives of}} U.S. pilots every day it remained in operation. In December 1967, a communist military offensive in the region was signalled by a series of skirmishes. On 15December, CIA-led Hmong reconnaissance patrols detected both North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao battalions moving against Nam Bac, at the time the stronghold of the Royal Lao Army.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program was in place, he reacted to the news calmly. The Soviet leader said he was pleased by the news and {{expressed}} the hope that the weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to <b>US</b> <b>officials</b> when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E

5|$|The record shows, {{that for}} nearly thirty years, {{elements}} of the U.S. Department of Justice {{have been engaged in}} world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some <b>U.S.</b> <b>officials,</b> and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.|$|E
5|$|<b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> {{said that}} the CIA {{conducted}} a review of intelligence supplied by al-Balawi, examining whether he supplied false information about U.S. successes amid valid data used to establish his credibility. The investigation included a review of a list of senior al Qaeda and Taliban operatives reported killed in U.S. drone strikes since January 2009. The National Counterterrorism Center conducted its own review of the intelligence al-Balawi provided, two officials said.|$|E
5|$|<b>U.S.</b> <b>officials</b> {{said there}} were 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, {{including}} Osama bin Laden.

The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound.
