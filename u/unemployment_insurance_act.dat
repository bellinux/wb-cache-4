In 1926 she {{supported}} the TUC's decision {{to hold a}} General Strike, and also the decision to call it off after nine days. Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour candidate at Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of unemployment benefit. Her private view, that entitlement to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely shared in the Labour Party or the TUC. When the committee made recommendations along these lines she signed the report, which became {{the basis of the}} <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Act</b> 1927. Bondfield's association with this legislation permanently shadowed her relationship with the Labour movement.|$|E

25|$|In {{domestic}} policy, {{a number}} of social security reforms were carried out during Smuts’s second period in office as Prime Minister. Old-age pensions and disability grants were extended to 'Indians' and 'Africans' in 1944 and 1947 respectively, although there were differences {{in the level of}} grants paid out based on race. The Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1941 “insured all employees irrespective of payment of the levy by employers and increased the number of diseases covered by the law,” and the <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Act</b> of 1946 introduced unemployment insurance on a national scale, albeit with exclusions.|$|E

Changes were also made to the taxation system that resulted in the poor paying less tax and the rich paying more.|$|R

He moved to the India Office in September 1904, and from March 1907 to October 1911 he was private secretary to successive Parliamentary Under-Secretaries for India, most notably Edwin Montagu. In October 1911 he was promoted to HM Treasury as private secretary to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, at a time when Lloyd George was introducing his controversial National Insurance Bill. In November 1912 Lloyd George appointed him to the National Health Insurance Commission, as one of a team of promising young civil servants (including John Anderson, Warren Fisher, Arthur Salter, and Claud Schuster) nicknamed the [...] "Loan Collection" [...] as they had been hand-picked from across the civil service. Gowers wrote later, [...] "This gigantic task of bringing the National Health and <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Acts</b> into operation taught the Service what it could do, and the control of the whole of the social and economic life of the nation during the war drove home the lesson."

50|$|In the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald, Brown became Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health in November 1931. The {{following}} year the official Liberal Cabinet ministers {{resigned from the}} government and Brown was promoted to become Secretary for Mines. In 1935 when MacDonald was succeeded as Prime Minister by Stanley Baldwin, Brown entered the Cabinet as Minister of Labour. This proved controversial as many believed that the Minister of Transport Leslie Hore-Belisha, had a stronger claim to be the next Liberal National to enter the Cabinet, though as unemployment was one of the government's biggest problems, many others felt that Brown's appointment to the job was not one to envy. He held the post {{for the next five years}} under both Baldwin and his successor, Neville Chamberlain. One of his most prominent achievements was the <b>Unemployment</b> <b>Insurance</b> (Agriculture) <b>Act,</b> 1936 which extended social security to nearly all workers in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. In another sphere he oversaw the formation of the National Joint Advisory Committee which assisted in wage control, compulsory arbitration, and direction of labour.
