40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} chord finding system {{that is based on}} <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> spaces (CPS) {{introduced}} by Gatzsche et al. in 2008 [1] and Hidden Markov Models (HMM). The classifier HMM works with the output of the CPS that is directly calculated from the chromagram (Figure 1). The CPS displays harmonic events clearer than the common used chromagram. Therefore it is appropriate for chord analysis. Another <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> space – introduced in 2006 by Harte, Sandler and Gasser [2] – will be used for comparison. Several papers showed that the CPS_HSG is also useful for chord detection. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is to give an {{overview}} of existing <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> spaces, its special properties and application for semantic audio analysis. Beside this the symmetry model is proposed as a framework to describe the inter-model relationships between different <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> spaces. Similar to color spaces in vision musical pitch spaces organize pitches in a way that semantic/cognitive/theoretical/physical relationships between tones become geometrically apparent. Within the last years pitch spaces were mainly subject of music theory. But they become more and more interesting for semantic analysis of musical audio signals. Pitch spaces can be applied tokey and chord recognition, similarity calculation of musical pieces, genre estimation, tension analysis or harmonic change detection...|$|R

50|$|Pitch is the {{distance}} between a point on one tooth and the corresponding point on an adjacent tooth. It is a dimension measured along a line or curve in the transverse, normal, or axial directions. The use of the single word pitch without qualification may be ambiguous, {{and for this reason}} it is preferable to use specific designations such as transverse <b>circular</b> <b>pitch,</b> <b>normal</b> base pitch, axial pitch.|$|R
5000|$|Axial pitch, px : Linear {{pitch in}} an axial plane {{and in a}} pitch surface. In helical gears and worms, axial pitch has the same value at all diameters. In gearing of other types, axial pitch may be {{confined}} to the pitch surface and may be a circular measurement. The term axial pitch is preferred to the term linear pitch. The axial pitch of a helical worm and the <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> of its worm gear are the same.|$|R

These numbers (or at least one of them) is often chosen among primes to create an even contact between every cog of both wheels, and thereby avoid {{unnecessary}} wear and damage. An even uniform gear wear is achieved by ensuring the tooth counts of the two gears meshing together are relatively prime to each other; this occurs when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each gear tooth count equals 1, e.g. GCD(16,25)=1; if a 1:1 gear ratio is desired a relatively prime gear may be inserted in between the two gears; this maintains the 1:1 ratio but reverses the gear direction; a second relatively prime gear could also be inserted to restore the original rotational direction while maintaining uniform wear with all 4 gears in this case. Mechanical engineers, at least in continental Europe, usually use the module instead of <b>circular</b> <b>pitch.</b> The module, just like the <b>circular</b> <b>pitch,</b> can be used for all types of cogs, not just evolvent based straight cogs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel method for detecting harmonic boundaries in musical audio signals. These boundaries are very useful for chord analysis because they define temporal chord limits. This harmonic change driven (event driven) analysis of musical audio signals {{is a better}} basis for a following chord analysis than the traditionally frame based only concept. The method itself works with <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> spaces (CPS). CPSs summarize high level aspects of the audio signal like semantic and music theoretical relationships. Using CPSs entails good results in detecting harmonic changes...|$|R

There are two teams of 8 players; one on one raid; and no player leaves the field. If 2 stopers attack a player, a foul is declared.

50|$|Standard profile angles are {{established}} {{in connection with}} standard proportions of gear teeth and standard gear cutting tools. Involute gears operate together correctly after a change of center distance, and gears designed for a different center distance can be generated correctly by standard tools. A change of center distance is accomplished by changes in operating values for <b>pitch</b> diameter, <b>circular</b> <b>pitch,</b> diametral pitch, pressure angle, and tooth thicknesses or backlash. The same involute gear may be used under conditions that change its operating pitch diameter and pressure angle. Unless {{there is a good}} reason for doing otherwise, it is practical to consider that the pitch and the profile angle of a single gear correspond to the pitch and the profile angle of the hob or cutter used to generate its teeth.|$|R

40|$|A non-traction pericyclic {{continuously}} variable transmission system technology is described. Pericyclic motion involves oscillation, nutation and stepless <b>circular</b> <b>pitch</b> indexing.

Preferred non-traction pericyclic CVT conceptual designs are (i) high power density gearless roller/cam systems or (ii) advanced bevel type face gear systems. P-CVTs have a control system and three main components: a reaction control rotor; a pericyclic motion converter; an output rotor.
