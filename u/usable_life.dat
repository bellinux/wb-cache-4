50|$|Liquid shellac has {{a limited}} shelf life (about 1 year), so {{is sold in}} dry form for {{dissolution}} before use. Liquid shellac sold in hardware stores is often marked with the production (mixing) date, so the consumer can know whether the shellac inside is still good. Some manufacturers (e.g., Zinsser) have ceased labeling shellac with the production date but the production date may be discernible from the production lot code. Alternatively, old shellac may be tested {{to see if it}} is still usable: a few drops on glass should quickly dry to a hard surface. Shellac that remains tacky for a long time is no longer <b>usable.</b> Storage <b>life</b> depends on peak temperature, so refrigeration extends shelf life.|$|R
50|$|High-pressure sodium lights {{have a long}} <b>usable</b> bulb <b>life,</b> and {{six times}} more light output per watt of energy {{consumed}} than a standard incandescent grow light. Due to their high efficiency {{and the fact that}} plants grown in greenhouses get all the blue light they need naturally, these lights are the preferred supplemental greenhouse lights. But, in the higher latitudes, there are periods of the year where sunlight is scarce, and additional sources of light are indicated for proper growth. HPS lights may cause distinctive infrared and optical signatures, which can attract insects or other species of pests; these may in turn threaten the plants being grown. High-pressure sodium lights emit a lot of heat, which can cause leggier growth, although this can be controlled by using special air-cooled bulb reflectors or enclosures.|$|R
40|$|The {{stiffness}} {{of a flat}} specimen, made of graphite epoxy (T 300 / 934), was measured during reverse fatigue loading. Laminates of basic layup, unidirectional cross-ply and angle-ply, as well as multidirectional (isotropic) layup, were tested. It was found that all the laminates exhibit rapid stiffness degradation on the last (third) fatigue stage. Except for the 0 -deg unidirectional laminate, the last stage starts at about 70 to 80 percent of the fatigue life, regardless of the load level and the final mode of failure (tension or compression). It is shown that, for this material, stiffness degradation {{is a result of}} crack accumulation, mainly along the fibers, even for the fiber dominated laminates. This general phenomenon can serve to predict <b>usable</b> safe <b>life</b> of laminates under fatigue loading...|$|R

40|$|Elements of {{gas turbine}} degradation, such as {{compressor}} fouling, are recoverable through maintenance actions like compressor washing. These actions increase the <b>usable</b> engine <b>life</b> and optimise {{the performance of}} the gas turbine. However, these maintenance actions are performed by a separate organization to those undertaking fleet management operations, leading to significant uncertainty in the maintenance state of the asset. The uncertainty surrounding maintenance actions impacts prognostic efficacy. In this paper, we adopt Bayesian on-line change point detection to detect the compressor washing events. Then, the event detection information is used as an input to a prognostic algorithm, advising an update to the estimation of remaining useful life. To illustrate the capability of the approach, we demonstrated our on-line Bayesian change detection algorithms on synthetic and real aircraft engine service data, in order to identify the compressor washing events for a gas turbine and thus provide demonstrably improved prognosis...|$|R

40|$|Biological fouling {{is one of}} the scourges {{of reverse}} osmosis (RO) {{membrane}} plant operation. Once established, biological fouling can be difficult and expensive to remove. Even when it is removed, it can quickly re-establish, resulting in increased energy costs, increased chemical costs, loss of production as a result of cleaning downtime and a significant burden for operation teams. 2 Chloramine dosing has long been established as an effective strategy for biological fouling control for reverse osmosis in wastewater reuse applications. While almost ubiquitous in those applications, for groundwater treatment applications, the use of chloramine is not as widespread. Previous studies (Lozier 2005) using chloramine on surface and groundwater RO systems showed undesirable increase in salt transport, which can adversely impact treated water quality and decrease <b>usable</b> membrane <b>life.</b> This affect was hypothesized as possibly resulting from iron catalysis of the chloramine to more potent oxidants, such as free chlorine, which may have oxidized the polyamide membrane structure.

40|$|Linear {{response}} theory, {{the backbone}} of non-equilibrium statistical physics, has recently been extended to explain how and why non-ergodic renewal processes are insensitive to simple perturbations, such as in habituation. It was established that a permanent correlation resulted between an external stimulus and the response of a complex system generating non-ergodic renewal processes, when the stimulus is a similar non-ergodic process. This is the principle of complexity management, whose proof relies on ensemble distribution functions.
