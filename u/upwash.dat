The V {{formation}} is often supposed to boost the efficiency and range of flying birds, particularly over long migratory routes. All the birds except the first fly in the <b>upwash</b> from one of the wingtip vortices of the bird ahead. The <b>upwash</b> assists each bird in supporting its own weight in flight, in the same way a glider can climb or maintain height indefinitely in rising air. Geese flying in a V formation save energy by flying in the updraft of the wingtip vortex generated by the previous animal in the formation. Thus, the birds flying behind do not need to work as hard to achieve lift. Studies show that birds in a V formation place themselves roughly at the optimum distance predicted by simple aerodynamic theory. Geese in a V-formation may conserve 12–20% of the energy they would need to fly alone. Red knots and dunlins were found in radar studies to fly 5km per hour faster in flocks than when they were flying alone. The birds flying at the tips and at the front are rotated in a timely cyclical fashion to spread flight fatigue equally among the flock members. The formation also makes communication easier and allows the birds to maintain visual contact with each other.|$|E

5000|$|This {{sideways}} influence (<b>upwash</b> on the outboard, downwash on the inboard) {{is the key}} to the lifting-line theory. Now, if {{the change}} in lift distribution is known at given lift section, it is possible to predict how that section influences the lift over its neighbors: the vertical induced velocity (<b>upwash</b> or downwash, [...] ) can be quantified using the velocity distribution within a vortex, and related to a change in effective angle of attack over neighboring sections.|$|E

50|$|The <b>upwash</b> and {{downwash}} {{associated with}} the generation of lift {{is the source of}} aerodynamic interaction between the wing and stabilizer, which translates into a change in the effective angle of attack for each surface. The influence of the wing on a tail is much more significant than the opposite effect and can be modeled using the Prandtl lifting-line theory; however, an accurate estimation of the interaction between multiple surfaces requires computer simulations or wind tunnel tests.|$|E
50|$|The wingtips of {{the leading}} bird in an echelon create a pair of {{opposite}} rotating line vortices. The vortices trailing a bird create an underwash, which creates an induced drag for the bird. At the same time these vortices create an <b>upwash</b> that can aid the flight of following birds. In a 1970 study the authors claimed that each bird in a V formation of 25 members can achieve a reduction of induced drag {{and as a result}} increase their range by 71%.|$|E

In contrast, birds flying in a stream immediately one behind another do not have wingtip coherence in their flight pattern and their flapping is out of phase, as compared to birds flying in V patterns, {{so as to avoid}} the detrimental effects of the downwash due to the leading bird's flight.|$|E

The mechanism for <b>upwash</b> formation is studied and momentum models for the <b>upwash</b> sheet are postulated. An approximate method for computing the ground isobar pattern of jet and <b>upwash</b> deflection zones is presented and compared with test data. A method for computing the <b>upwash</b> impingement force {{in the absence of}} secondary induced flow effects is also presented and reasonably good agreement is achieved with experimental data for cylindrical fuselage shapes of circular and rectangular cross section...|$|E
40|$|A direct {{assessment}} of two-dimensional wind-tunnel wall interference using <b>upwash</b> component measured on two interfaces has been formulated by the Prandtl-Glauert equation {{of the flow}} field and solved by the Fourier transform technique. The analytic formulae obtained for the interference of <b>upwash</b> and pressure on the model are presented. The formulae have been applied successfully to the analytic models for lifting and blockage interferences induced by the general linear slotted and perforated tunnel wall boundary conditions.

A theoretical investigation was conducted, using linearized theory, {{to determine the}} combined effects of <b>upwash</b> and camber on drag due to lift for rectangular wings at supersonic speeds. Both the case of body <b>upwash</b> and {{the case of a}} uniform <b>upwash</b> field were considered. Previous studies have shown that body <b>upwash</b> and wing camber, acting separately, each reduce the drag due to lift for a rectangular wing. In the present investigation {{it was found that the}} individual effects as measured by the criterion [ [...] . ] are additive and that there is a further gain which increased with decreasing aspect ratio. For the basic wing-body configuration investigated, with wing having a reduced aspect ratio of two, the <b>upwash</b> effect was much larger than the camber effect. For a complete aircraft configuration with lifting nose, optimum camber reduced the drag at a given lift by a somewhat smaller percentage than it did for an isolated wing.

The isolated twin jet tests revealed unstable fountains over a range of spacings and jet heights, regions of below ambient pressure on the ground, and negative pressure differential in the <b>upwash</b> flow field. A separate computer code was developed for vertically oriented, incompressible jets. This model more accurately reflects fountain behavior without fully formed wall jets, and adequately predicts ground isobars, <b>upwash</b> dynamic pressure decay, and fountain lift force variation with height above ground...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} fuselage-induced <b>upwash</b> on the {{flapwise}} motion of a hinged rotor blade is considered. The typical <b>upwash</b> field is simulated through the flow {{produced by a}} moving point source. The resulting blade response is then approximated by its rigid flapping and first bending mode. The perturbation blade pitch variation required to alleviate its response to the <b>upwash</b> {{in the sense of}} either reducing the increased hub shear or minimization of the blade overall time averaged deflection, is determined. Calculations are carried out for a model rotor and for the case with increased Lock number. The results are presented in graph form. It is found that the minimum blade deflection criteria suppress the rigid flapping by a large amount and reduce the peak-to-peak value of the blade hub shear by at least 50 percent without causing an additional increase in blade stresses...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} made of the <b>upwash</b> {{interference}} caused by the wind tunnel walls at a Mach number of 0. 20. The wind tunnel has slotted horizontal walls and solid vertical walls and the wind tunnel model is a wing-fuselage combination typical of a short take-off and landing (STOL) transport. Measurements were made of the model forces and angle of attack. The experimental results are compared to theoretical solutions for the <b>upwash</b> interference. This comparison enabled an indirect determination of one of the constants in the slotted wall boundary condition. The magnitude of the experimental <b>upwash</b> interference is also compared to the accuracy of the data. This comparison indicates {{that it is difficult to}} make definite conclusions based on the experimental data. Suggestions are made for future research which could provide a practical means of accurately determining the wall-interference velocities in wind tunnels with rigid slotted walls...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} RSRA {{fuselage}} configurations on rotor performance and loads have been quantified analytically {{by means of}} currently available potential flow and rotor analysis. Four configurations of the Rotor Systems Research Aircraft (RSRA) were considered in this study. They were: (1) fuselage alone (conventional helicopter); (2) fuselage with auxiliary propulsion; (3) fuselage with wings (auxiliary lift); and (4) fuselage with both auxiliary lift propulsion. The rotor system investigated was identical to a CH- 47 D front rotor except that it had four instead of three blades. Two scaled-down {{versions of the same}} rotor were also analyzed to determine the effect of rotor scale on the fuselage <b>upwash</b> effects. The flight conditions considered for the <b>upwash</b> study are discussed.

40|$|As {{part of the}} NASA F- 14 {{high angle}} of attack flight test program, a nose mounted {{hemispherical}} flow direction sensor was calibrated against a fuselage mounted movable vane flow angle sensor. Significant discrepancies were found {{to exist in the}} angle of attack measurements. A two fold approach taken to resolve these discrepancies during subsonic flight is described. First, the sensing integrity of the isolated hemispherical sensor is established by wind tunnel data extending to an angle of attack of 60 deg. Second, two probable causes for the discrepancies, pneumatic lag and <b>upwash,</b> are examined. Methods of identifying and compensating for lag and <b>upwash</b> are presented. The wind tunnel data verify that the isolated hemispherical sensor is sufficiently accurate for static conditions with angles of attack up to 60 deg and angles of sideslip up to 30 deg. Analysis of flight data for two high angle of attack maneuvers establishes that pneumatic lag and <b>upwash</b> are highly correlated with the discrepancies between the hemispherical and vane type sensor measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{boundary}} layer over concave surfaces can be unstable due to centrifugal forces, {{giving rise to}} Goertler vortices. These vortices create two regions in the spanwise direction—the <b>upwash</b> and downwash regions. The downwash region is responsible for compressing the {{boundary layer}} toward the wall, increasing the heat transfer rate. The <b>upwash</b> region does the opposite. In the nonlinear development of the Goertler vortices, it can be observed that the <b>upwash</b> region becomes narrow and the spanwise–average heat transfer rate is higher than that for a Blasius boundary layer. This paper analyzes {{the influence of the}} spanwise wavelength of the Goertler the heat transfer. The equation is written in vorticity-velocity formulation. The time integration is done via a classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. The spatial derivatives are calculated using high-order compact finite difference and spectral methods. Three different wavelengths are analyzed. The results show that steady Goertler flow can increase the heat transfer rates to values close to the values of turbulence, without the existence of a secondary instability. The geometry (and computation domain) are presente...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Langley V/STOL tunnel to determine the <b>upwash</b> flow angles {{in the region of}} the nacelle inlets of a representative powered-lift transport configuration operating at high lift coefficients. The <b>upwash</b> angles were indicated by tufts and measured from photographs. A potential-flow program was used to estimate these flow angles. Large upflow angles exist near the inlets of the nacelles; the highest value (67. 3 deg) occurred with flaps at 15, 35, 55 deg, an angle of attack of 25. 7 deg, and a thrust coefficient of 4. The upflow angle was found to be strongly dependent on the circulation lift, regardless of the flap deflection, angle of attack, or thrust coefficient used to generate this circulation lift. The potential-flow calculations away from the nacelle inlets agreed fairly well with the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases are}} considered: (1) rigid body motion of an airfoil-flap {{combination}} consisting of vertical translation of given amplitude, rotation of given amplitude about a specified axis, and rotation of given amplitude {{of the control}} surface alone about its hinge; the <b>upwash</b> for this problem is defined mathematically; and (2) sinusoidal gust of given amplitude and wave number, for which the <b>upwash</b> is defined mathematically. Simple universal formulas are presented for the most important aerodynamic coefficients in unsteady thin airfoil theory. The lift and moment induced by a generalized gust are evaluated explicitly {{in terms of the}} gust wavelength. Similarly, in the control surface problem, the lift, moment, and hinge moments are given as explicit algebraic functions of hinge location. These results can be used together with any of the standard numerical inversion routines for the elementary loads (pitch and heave) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of a practical turbulence model for the complex flows with strong streamline curvature associated with powered-lift aircraft was investigated. The approach was to modify existing models that were compatible with the widely used kappa-epsilon model already available in an existing 3 D Navier-Stokes code. The state-of-the-art of current turbulence models was examined. Several models that provide curvature corrections to the kappa-epsilon model were numerically investigated. An algebraic Reynolds stress model, which provides additional physics, was also examined. Test cases including an impinging jet, an impinging jet in a crossflow, and two adjacent impinging jets with the resultant <b>upwash</b> fountain were calculated. The first two test cases could be modeled reasonsbly well {{with some of the}} models. The <b>upwash</b> fountain could not be modeled with sufficient accuracy, which is consistent with the findings of other investigators...|$|E

40|$|An {{engineering}} methodology {{based on}} an empirical data base and analytical fluid dynamic models was developed for the prediction of propulsive lift system induced aerodynamic effects for multiple lift jet VTOL aircraft operating in the hover mode {{in and out of}} ground effect. The effects of aircraft geometry, aircraft orientation (pitch, roll) as well as height above ground are considered. Lift jet vector and splay directions fit the airframe, lift jet exit flow conditions, and both axisymmetric and rectangular nozzle exit geometry are also accommodated. The induced suckdown flows are computed from the potential flowfield induced by the turbulent entrainment of both the free jets and wall jets in ground effect and from the free jets alone out of ground effect. The methodology emphasized geometric considerations, computation of stagnation lines and fountain <b>upwash</b> inclination, fountain <b>upwash</b> formation and development, and fountain impingement on the airframe...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{experimental}} and theoretical {{investigations into the}} effect of fuselage <b>upwash</b> on fighter aircraft wing performance are reported. Wind tunnel trials were performed on 4 percent scale models of two supersonic fighters. The trials were run at Mach 1. 6 - 2. 0, an Re of 2, 000, 000 and at angles of attack (AOA) of - 4 to 20 deg. Measurements were made of lift, drag and pitching moments. Two linearized theory supersonic aerodynamic prediction codes, PAN AIR and the SDAS lift analysis, were used to predict the same aerodynamic coefficients. The fuselage AOA augmented the lift and pitching moment at 0, 2 and 5 deg. The contribution mainly arose from the fuselage-induced <b>upwash.</b> The PAN AIR code gave superior data for the fuselage aerodynamics and effects, although both codes accurately predicted the overall lift and moment increments due to the fuselage AOA...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{indirect}} turbulence measurements for real-time estimation of parameters in a linear longitudinal dynamics model in atmospheric turbulence was studied. It is shown that measuring the atmospheric turbulence {{makes it possible}} to treat the turbulence as a measured explanatory variable in the parameter estimation problem. Commercial off-the-shelf sensors were researched and evaluated, then compared to air data booms. Sources of colored noise in the explanatory variables resulting from typical turbulence measurement techniques were identified and studied. A major source of colored noise in the explanatory variables was identified as frequency dependent <b>upwash</b> and time delay. The resulting <b>upwash</b> and time delay corrections were analyzed and compared to previous time shift dynamic modeling research.

40|$|A {{research}} fan {{stage is}} acoustically tested in an anechoic wind tunnel with a 41 m/sec tunnel flow. Two stator vane numbers giving cut-on and cut-off conditions are tested at three rotor stator spacings ranging from 0. 5 to 2. 0 rotor chords. Hot-film anemometer turbulence measurements are {{made at the}} leading edge of the stator for each spacing, and a crossed film anemometer is radially transversed to define streamwise and <b>upwash</b> characteristics of the rotor blade wakes. Trends in the acoustic results are observed in the front and aft quadrants at 80 % design fan speed. Aft quadrant results demonstrate a fundamental tone 9 dB lower for the 25 vane stator than for the 11 vane stator, while overtone levels are 3 dB higher. The cut-off criterion strongly controls fundamental tone level at all spacings, and spacing trends of the wake-defect <b>upwash</b> component show good agreement with corresponding cut-on acoustic tone levels...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{publications}} on the source-distribution methods {{for evaluating the}} aerodynamics of thin wings at supersonic speeds is summarized, extended, and unified. Included {{in the first part}} are the deviations of: (a) the linearized partial-differential equation for unsteady flow at a substantially constant Mach number. b) The source-distribution solution for the perturbation-velocity potential that satisfies the boundary conditions of tangential flow at the surface and in the plane of the wing; and (c) the integral equation for determining the strength and the location of sources to describe the interaction effects (as represented by <b>upwash)</b> of the bottom and top wing surfaces through the region between the finite wing boundary and the foremost Mach wave. The second part deals with steady-state thin-wing problems. The third part of the report approximates the integral equation for unsteady <b>upwash</b> and includes a solution of approximate equation.

For the basic experiments, 49. 5 mm-diameter jets were used, oriented normal to a simulated round plane, with pressurized, heated air providing a jet. The experimental data consisted of: (1) the effect of jet height and temperature on the ground, model, and <b>upwash</b> pressures, and temperatures, (2) the effect of simulated aircraft surfaces on the isolated flow field, (3) the jet-induced forces on a three-dimensional body with various strakes, (4) the effects of non-uniform coannular jets. For the uniform circular jets, temperature was varied from room temperature (24 C) to 232 C. Jet total pressure was varied between 9, 300 Pascals and 31, 500 Pascals. For the coannular jets, intended to represent turbofan engines, fan temperature was maintained at room temperature while core temperature was varied from room temperature to 437 C.

Evaluation of previous predictions for perforated and slotted tunnels suggests that a hybrid slotted tunnel (i. e., a slotted tunnel with closed slats and perforated slots) should offer minimum corrections for <b>upwash,</b> flow curvature and solid blockage. This suggestion is confirmed by the present computer studies {{of a range of}} rectangular hybrid slotted tunnels. The computer studies are for tunnel working section height to breadth ratios of 0. 835 and 0. 600 over the Mach number range from 0 to 0. 85.

The fountain <b>upwash</b> flow, generated by the impingement of two axisymmetric, compressible, turbulent jets onto a ground plane was studied using laser-based particle image velocimetry and laser Doppler velocimetry. Measurements were made with nozzle pressure ratios of between 1. 05 and 4, nozzle height-to-diameter ratios of between 2. 4 and 8. 4, nozzle splay angles of between 15 degrees and a nozzle spacing-to-diameter ratio of seven.
