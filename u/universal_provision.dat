60|$|All {{that has}} been said tends {{to show how the}} {{principle}} contended for makes the gift of life more valuable, and has, it may be hoped, led to the conclusion that its legitimate operation is to make men worthier of that gift: in other words, not to degrade but to exalt human nature. But the subject must not be dismissed without adverting to the indirect influence of the same principle upon the moral sentiments of a people among whom it is embodied in law. In our criminal jurisprudence there is a maxim, deservedly eulogised, that it is better that ten guilty persons should escape, than that one innocent man should suffer; so, also, might it be maintained, with regard to the Poor Laws, that it is better for the interests of humanity among the people at large, that ten undeserving should partake of the funds provided, than that one morally good man, through want of relief, should either have his principles corrupted, or his energies destroyed; than that such a one should either be driven to do wrong, or be cast to the earth in utter hopelessness. In France, the English maxim of criminal jurisprudence is reversed; there, it is deemed better that ten innocent men should suffer, than one guilty escape: in France, there is no <b>universal</b> <b>provision</b> for the poor; and we may judge of the small value set upon human life in the metropolis of that country, by merely noticing the disrespect with which, after death, the body is treated, not by the thoughtless vulgar, but in schools of anatomy, presided over by men allowed to be, in their own art and in physical science, among the most enlightened in the world. In the East, where countries are overrun with population as with a weed, infinitely more respect is shown to the remains of the deceased: and what a bitter mockery is it, that this insensibility should be found where civil polity is so busy in minor regulations, and ostentatiously careful to gratify the luxurious propensities, whether social or intellectual, of the multitude! Irreligion is, no doubt, much concerned with this offensive disrespect shown to the bodies of the dead in France; but it is mainly attributable to the state in which so many of the living are left by the absence of compulsory provision for the indigent so humanely established by the law of England.|$|E

40|$|Internet {{has shown}} {{itself to be}} a {{catalyst}} for economic growth and social equity but its potency is thwarted {{by the fact that}} the Internet is off limits for the vast majority of human beings. Mobile phones [...] -the fastest growing technology in the world that now reaches around 80 % of humanity [...] -can enable universal Internet access if it can resolve coverage problems that have historically plagued previous cellular architectures (2 G, 3 G, and 4 G). These conventional architectures have not been able to sustain <b>universal</b> service <b>provisioning</b> since these architectures depend on having enough users per cell for their economic viability and thus are not well suited to rural areas (which are by definition sparsely populated). The new generation of mobile cellular technology (5 G), currently in a formative phase and expected to be finalized around 2020, is aimed at orders of magnitude performance enhancement. 5 G offers a clean slate to network designers and can be molded into an architecture also amenable to <b>universal</b> Internet <b>provisioning.</b> Keeping in mind the great social benefits of democratizing Internet and connectivity, we believe that the time is ripe for emphasizing <b>universal</b> Internet <b>provisioning</b> as an important goal on the 5 G research agenda.

40|$|This paper {{relates to}} the current {{discussion}} about how to measure the net cost and the unfair burden of <b>universal</b> service <b>provision</b> in network industries. The established profitability cost approach compares the profit of a universal service provider (USP) with and without a universal service obligation (USO). This paper argues that the net cost of <b>universal</b> service <b>provision</b> critically depends on the regulatory counterfactual and hence the USPs strategy space without USO. On the one hand, a strong USO limits the USPs means to position itself in the market, which offers cream-skimming opportunities and invites competition. On the other hand, a simple game-theoretic entry analysis shows that the USO may effectively serve as a valuable strategic commitment device to deter entry. Hence, the USO may be valuable to the USP despite causing inefficient operations. From a policy perspective, this constitutes a counter-intuitive result for {{the definition of the}} USO: the stricter it is regulated, the more detrimental it may be to competition and, therefore, the smaller is its burden on the US...|$|R
