Phase diagrams of the SSL/chitosan systems were obtained at both pH 4. 0 and 5. 7 by preparing concentrated solutions and mixing them at different ratios. Optical microscopy revealed that the complexes formed at pH= 4. 0 were smaller than those formed at pH= 5. 7 and {{that the size of}} the complexes decreased as the SSL/chitosan ratio was reduced.

The kinetic data for polymerizations carried out with Cp*RuCl(PPh 3) 2, show that molecular weights increase linearly with conversion with an average initiation efficiency of 0. 77. The molecular weights obtained in the kinetic study with Cp*RuCl[P(4 -CF 3 -C 6 H 4) 3] 2 also increase with conversion but show a marked deviation below the theoretical molecular weights. This behavior was explained by the gradual, irreversible, oxidation of catalyst Cp*RuCl[P(4 -CF 3 -C 6 H 4) 3] 2 as confirmed by 31 P-NMR spectroscopy. Catalyst Cp*RuCl(PPh 3) 2 promotes the polymerization with a rate of polymerization higher than that obtained using Cp*RuCl[P(4 -CF 3 -C 6 H 4) 3] 2; {{this is consistent with the}} better electron donating properties of PPh 3 versus P(4 -CF 3 -C 6 H 4) 3.

Imidazole and its dimer form very strong beryllium bonds with both BeH 2 and BeF 2, accompanied by a significant geometry distortion of the Lewis acid. More importantly, we have found a clear cooperativity between these two noncovalent interactions, since the intermolecular HB between the two imidazole molecules in the dimer-BeX 2 complex becomes much stronger than in the isolated dimer, whereas the beryllium bond becomes also stronger in the dimer-BeX 2 complex, with respect to that found in the imidazole-BeX 2 complex. The effects of beryllium bonds are also dramatic {{on the strength of}} intramolecular HBs. Depending on to which center the BeX 2 is attached, the intramolecular HB becomes much stronger or much weaker. The first situation is found when the beryllium derivative is attached to the HB donor, whereas the second occurs if it is attached to the HB acceptor. The first effect can be so strong as to produce a spontaneous proton transfer, as it is actually the case of the malonaldehyde-BeF 2 complex. © 2012 American Chemical Society. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Deposits over 1010 steel were successfully obtained from electroplated baths <b>using</b> <b>the</b> <b>complexes</b> without any addition of free additives, at pH = 4. 5 (H(2) SO(4) /Na(2) SO(4)). These deposits showed better morphologies than deposits obtained from CuSO(4) solution either in the absence or presence of oxalate ion as additive (40 mmol L(- 1)), at pH = 4. 5 (H(2) SO(4) /Na(2) SO(4)) It is suggestive that the starting metal plating coordinated with additives influences the electrode position processes, providing deposits with corrosion potentials shifted over + 200 mV in 0. 5 mol L(- 1) NaCl (1 mV s(- 1)). The resistance against corrosion is sensitive {{to the type of}} additive-complex used as precursor. The complex with ethylenediamine presented the best deposit results with the lowest pitting potential (- 0. 27 V vs 3. 0 mol L(- 1) CE). It was concluded that the addition of free additives to the electrodeposition baths is not necessary when working with previously coordinated additives. Thus, the complexes generated in ex-situ are good alternatives as plating precursors for electrodeposition bath. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The development of particles that are easily synthesised and tunable for each application, combining biocompatibility, easy bioconjugation and a high detection signal as a label, is highly desired. In this work, we describe a one-step synthesis of poly [styrene-co-(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) ], PSHEMA, core-shell particles containing [Ru(4, 4 '-dicarboxilate- 2, 2 '-bpy) (3) ] luminescent complexes. These particles show monodispersity, biocompatibility, easy functionalization and dye incorporation to focus on bioapplications, such as cell-tracking and diagnostics. The monomers assemble during the polymerization and produce core-shell structures with hydrophilic-hydrophobic character. This allows the concentration of hydrophilic ruthenium complexes onto the shell and incorporation of hydrophobic molecules (e. g. diphenylanthracene) due to the hydrophobic character of styrene. The incorporation of the Ru complex resulted in higher photostability compared to the free dye.

Therefore, the knowledge of structure-function relationship can provide important information for designing functional materials. This dissertation aims to gain fundamental knowledge through structural analysis of nano-sensing materials for explosives and bio-diagnosis {{in order to enhance}} the sensitivity. The main project of my research involved the investigation into the fluorescence and quenching mechanisms of pyrene with a series of organic salts and/or polystyrene of a variety of architectures as well as the function of explosive detection. The major findings of this dissertation includes: (1) the formation of pyrene excimers can be enhanced by high solvent vapor pressure annealing with the polystyrene (2) tetrabutylammonium cation (TBA+) can effectively suppress the fluorescence but hexafluorophosphate anion (PF 6 -) with TBA+can counteract this effect at high solvent vapor pressure driven by temperature. This process is reasoned by dynamic quenching, (3) Polystyrene can effectively lower LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbit) level of pyrene, thus facilitating the detection of the nitro-aromatic explosives. This process is presumably accomplished through radiationless energy transfer from polystyrene emission to pyrene absorption resulting in the efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) to explosives, (4) the diffusion coefficients of 2, 4 -DNT (dinitrotoluene) through pyrene/polystyrene films was evaluated and film thickness is found to be a key parameter affecting the diffusion of 2, 4 -DNT.

40|$|A {{synthesis}} {{of a small}} library of rhodium(I) and iridium(I) complexes that combine different types of N-heterocyclic carbenes with pyridines and phosphines was developed. The complexes were tested for the hydrogenation of the simple olefins, 1 -octene, cyclohexene, 1 -methyl- 1 -cyclohexene and 2, 3 -dimethyl- 2 -butene. Three major trends were observed: first, complexes having iridium and {{a combination of a}} phosphine and a NHC prove to be more effective than those with a combination of a pyridine and a NHC. Second, the complex with the much bulkier IMes ligand is more reactive than those with IMe for unhindered alkenes (1 -octene and cyclohexene). For tertiary and quaternary alkenes, however, the less hindered IMe complexes are able to hydrogenate these substrates considerably faster. Lastly, the use of the BARF counterion produced the fastest catalyst from the series. The reactivity of [Ir(cod) (IMe) P(n-Bu) 3]BARF is superior to Crabtree 2 ̆ 7 s catalyst for the hydrogenation of simple olefins. Another advantage of this NHC-phosphine series is that the reaction progress can be followed visually.

The reactivity of the resultant complexes is also probed, while testing of the complexes for catalytic activity in a range of carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions is documented. Chapter 1 introduces the concepts of 'hemi-lability' and 'trans-influence', along with heteroditopic bidentate ligands, and specifically examines imine- and phosphine-based ligands, particularly aminophosphines. The nature of the phosphorus centre in terms of its steric and electronic properties is surveyed, and the bonding of phosphines and imines with metals is discussed. A review of transition metal-catalysed olefin oligomerisation and polyketone formation then follows. Finally, the aims of this work are outlined. Chapter 2 introduces the PNP ligand {lcub}(Pri 2 N) 2 PCH 2 C(=NPri) CH 2 P(NPri 2) 2 {rcub}, previously synthesized within the Dyer group. The reactivity and coordination chemistry of this ligand are then explored, and the reactivity of the resultant complexes probed. The complex [PdCl(Me) (PNP) ] has been crystallographically characterised.
