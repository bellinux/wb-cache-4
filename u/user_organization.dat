It also means private clouds based on converged infrastructure are compatible with public cloud platforms based on OpenStack technology, such as RackSpace and Nebula. The benefit is that <b>user</b> <b>organization</b> can decouple their applications from being tied to a particular hardware platform.

Funded {{in part by the}} BMBF (formerly BMFT- German Federal Ministry of Research and Technology,) their goal was the development of a simple and low-cost system. In 1991, after the completion of this work, an independent, nonprofit <b>user</b> <b>organization,</b> the Association for Promotion of Bus-compatible Interfaces e.V., now doing business as AS-International e.V., was founded. This was necessary to address legislation concerning anti-competitive business practices. The developing companies effectively relinquished their rights in the core technology. Consequently and as stated in its constitution, AS-International is the owner and guardian of the trademark AS-Interface®, and owns the rights and the specification to the AS-Interface technology. Therefore, any company producing technology with AS-Interface products is required {{to be a member of}} AS-International Association. Additionally, the organization represents the technology in international regulatory bodies, organizes and hosts educational seminars, and promotes advancements of the technology. According to AS-International, the organization's mission is the promotion of bus-able interfaces for sensors and actuators.|$|E

The introduction section outlines a risk assessment process although there are more specific standards covering this area such as ISO/IEC 27005. The use of information security risk analysis to drive the selection and implementation of information security controls is an important feature of the ISO/IEC 27000-series standards: {{it means that the}} generic good practice advice in this standard gets tailored to the specific context of each <b>user</b> <b>organization,</b> rather than being applied by rote. Not all of the 39 control objectives are necessarily relevant to every organization for instance, hence entire categories of control may not be deemed necessary. The standards are also open ended {{in the sense that the}} information security controls are 'suggested', leaving the door open for users to adopt alternative controls if they wish, just so long as the key control objectives relating to the mitigation of information security risks, are satisfied. This helps keep the standard relevant despite the evolving nature of information security threats, vulnerabilities and impacts, and trends in the use of certain information security controls.|$|E
