500|$|In March 2010, Yoshiki filed {{a lawsuit}} against Nexstar Corporation, for 375 million yen in damages. The band's {{contract}} with the company included the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recordings,</b> the initial deal was for 600 million yen in advance royalties and contract money, which the band claims not to have received. Between 2008 and 2009, the company also sponsored several concerts around Asia and Japan, not having paid performance fees and merchandise sales to X Japan. In all, the total unpaid amount is more than 900 million yen. The lawsuit sought only 375 million yen for the revenue earned from the concerts, with an additional claim of 600 million yen in case the trial proceeded. Yoshiki's side eventually won the lawsuit in 2014, where the Tokyo District Court ordered Nexstar to pay 660 million yen in damages.|$|E

50|$|The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> field <b>{{recording}}s</b> in avant-garde, musique concrète, experimental, and, more recently, Ambient {{music was}} evident {{almost from the}} birth of recording technology.

40|$|AbstractThe {{central issue}} {{addressed}} {{in this study is}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> video <b>recordings</b> to help foster the reflective practice of pre-service teachers. For the study, we used a qualitative research methodology to investigate and discuss the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> video <b>recordings</b> in the classroom as a means of promoting reflection among pre-service teachers of EFL. This study also reports on the participants’ experiences, reactions and perceptions towards the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> video <b>recordings</b> <b>of</b> their teaching in the practicum. In this study, the data were provided whereby the video-recordings of both the actual teaching and the post-conferences held over three weeks. The three participants also kept reflective journals and answered an open-ended questionnaire. The results revealed that the video inclusion helped them to raise awareness particularly about the problems of their L 2 use, the unfamiliarity between themselves and the students, and the effect of their moods on the day of teaching. Furthermore, the participants expressed a strong belief in the value and effectiveness of watching their teaching episodes weekly as to reach several questions, realizations and changes about their teaching practices in the practicum...|$|R
50|$|Despite its <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recordings</b> {{of actual}} musical {{instruments}} {{in lieu of}} internally generated sounds, the Optigan suffered from poor tonal quality due {{not only to the}} bandwidth limitations of its optical system but its mechanical system as well. The Optigan concept was {{similar to that of the}} Mellotron (early sampling technology) but while the Mellotron used magnetic tape, the Optigan borrowed its technology from motion picture optical soundtrack technology and its amplitude modulated format.|$|E

On July 1, the band appeared at Club Nokia in Los Angeles where they performed an acoustic setlist, and recorded a music video for the new song, [...] "Born to Be Free". On July 4, the two founding members Toshi and Yoshiki, appeared in Paris at the Japan Expo 2010 where they performed some songs. During the following month, X Japan and Yoshiki were featured in numerous newspapers and websites such as ABC News, the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Sun-Times. X Japan performed at Lollapalooza 2010 in Grant Park, Chicago on August 8. In the following days, Yoshiki did a Q&A article with the Phoenix New Times and was interviewed by ABC News.|$|E
40|$|For {{the past}} decade, the primary <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recordings</b> in higher {{education}} has been to make live lectures available to students for review (lecture capture). However, {{with the rise of}} podcasting and the increased focus on interaction as a means to engage students, current web-based lecture technologies (WBLT) are capable of much more than simply recording and distributing a live lecture. This study aimed to discover what teaching staff are currently doing, and what they would like to be doing with WBLT for learning and teaching. Data were drawn from initial focus groups conducted with 10 academic teaching staff at Swinburne University of Technology, as well as an online survey that was distributed to all Swinburne staff with a lecture capture account. Three key requirements for a university-wide WBLT system were identified: flexibility in where and when recordings can be made, flexibility in control over those recordings, and the desire to be able to interact with the recordings and incorporate them {{as an integral part of}} the course. These findings indicate that teaching staff want to innovate in their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recordings</b> and need to be supported to do so through the adoption of an appropriate recording solution...|$|E

40|$|Background : Audio {{recording}} of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions has been recommended {{but not yet}} widely adopted. It {{is believed to have}} positive effects on later recall and reflection by the patient and on supervisory quality and accuracy for therapists. Aims : To evaluate self-reported attitudes and behavior regarding audio {{recording of}} therapy sessions in both patients and therapists in a setting where such recording is routinely carried out. Method : In a center specializing in CBT for anxiety disorders, 72 patients completed a questionnaire at the start of therapy and 31 patients completed a questionnaire at the end of therapy. Fifteen therapists also completed a similar questionnaire. Results : Ninety percent of patients reported listening to recordings between therapy sessions to some extent. The majority reported discussing the recordings with their therapist. Patients typically planned to keep the recordings after therapy ended. Most patients and therapists endorsed positive attitudes towards the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recordings.</b> Similar advantages (e. g. improving memory for sessions) and disadvantages (e. g. practical issues and feeling self-conscious) of recordings were generated by patients and therapists. Therapists were more likely than patients to express concern about recordings being distressing for patients to listen to. Both patients and therapists regarded the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recordings</b> for therapist peer supervision purposes favorably. Conclusion : The use of audio recording of sessions as an adjunct to therapy (where patients listen to recordings between sessions) and for therapist supervision is rated as both highly acceptable and useful by both therapists and patients...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} attitudes of tutors who were participant-researchers on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>recordings</b> in the {{promotion}} of a more collaborative feedback. Using interviews and focus group discussions, it explores the attitude of tutors towards role reversal that the promotion of a more collaborative feedback might induce. It found that although teacher educators are ostensibly positively disposed to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> strategies and devices {{for the promotion of}} collaborative feedback, there are potential areas of resentment which might be easily overlooked. It identifies procedural issues and a potential failure to cater for differentiation as limitations to the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>recordings</b> in the facilitation of a more collaborative feedback. The study advocates that the positive elements associated with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> digital recording as a tool for facilitating collaborative feedback are sufficient to recommend it for use in other fields...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{recognize}} the recorded voice as one’s own was explored in two groups of chil-dren, one aged 4 - 5 and the other aged 7 - 8.

The results indicate that 4 to 5 year-old children perform as well as 7 to 8 year-old children when identifying their own recorded voice. Moreover, a time span of 1 - 2 weeks be-tween recording and identification does not af-fect the younger children’s performance, while the older children perform significantly worse after this time span.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using recordings of therapy sessions for client self-witnessing {{is not a}} new idea. However, understanding how recordings contribute to identity development has not been widely discussed or documented. This understanding has relevance for therapists employing therapeutic practices that seek to position clients well for rich reflection and development. This practice account discusses an identity shift for a client that occurred after listening to recordings of her therapy sessions. It considers the influence of recordings in that shift. Potential developments for the therapeutic relationship are also considered, including repositioning for clients, the benefits of client-initiated inquiry, and impact on power relations. The article advocates for the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recordings</b> for client witnessing and reflection and invites therapists to consider the possibilities of incorporating client-initiated inquiry and therapist-initiated inquiry...|$|E
40|$|Literature {{has shown}} that obesity {{associated}} to diabetes imposes difficulties to glycemic control. Studies suggest that adult patients with diabetes present greater difficulty to diet adherence when compared to physical activity and medication. However, studies indicate that self-monitoring and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>recordings</b> help adults with chronic diseases adhere to diets and follow instructions prescribed by health professionals. The present study investigated the effects of self monitoring and compliance to diet rules on two obese adult females diagnosed with diabetes attending a university hospital. Nineteen home visits were made to each patient where they were interviewed following schedules and self monitoring register protocols. Data collected was assessed according to three descriptive categories (meal with adherence, no adherence and no meal) and three stages of self-monitoring (no planning, planning and maintenance). The results suggest that self-monitoring followed by a training in eating behaviors proved {{to be effective in}} increasing adherence to nutritional rules.
