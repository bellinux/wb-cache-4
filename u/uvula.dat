5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the observation that the size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine <b>uvula,</b> faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E

The consonant is sometimes transliterated into [...] "g", sometimes [...] "k", and sometimes [...] "q" [...] in English. Another example is the Russian letter [...] "Х" [...] (kha). It is pronounced as the voiceless velar fricative , like the Scottish pronunciation of [...] in [...] "loch". This sound is not present in most forms of English, and is often transliterated as [...] "kh", as in Nikita Khrushchev.

40|$|Children {{born with}} palatal {{microforms}} are often clinically mismanaged due to difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. These difficulties are exacerbated by anatomical and physiological differences in clinical presentation. Although {{a variety of}} physical and functional findings related to palatal microforms have been documented, {{there is no consensus}} on what features or combination of features lead to velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) in this population. This study was designed to evaluate and compare the velopharyngeal musculature and related structures in children with palatal microforms and VPD with age and sex-matched noncleft controls with normal velopharyngeal anatomy. Nineteen subjects, four with palatal microforms and VPD, and 15 noncleft controls with normal velopharyngeal anatomy and normal speech and resonance participated in this study. Subjects were scanned at rest using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols specially designed to assess the velopharyngeal musculature. Measures of the levator veli palatini muscle (levator), musculus <b>uvulae,</b> and related velopharyngeal and craniometric structures were obtained. After controlling for the effect of vocal tract size, children with palatal microforms demonstrated quantitative and qualitative differences in the velopharyngeal musculature compared to noncleft controls. These differences included levator diastasis, abnormal attachment to the hard palate, and irregular dispersal of the levator muscle in the velar midline. Absence of the musculus <b>uvulae</b> was observed in three of four subjects with palatal microforms. Children with palatal microforms demonstrated decreased acuity of the velar genu angle and decreased alpha angle compared to noncleft controls, and these differences were statistically significant. Findings from this study demonstrate that children with palatal microforms and VPD present with velopharyngeal anatomy that is quantitatively and qualitatively different compared to noncleft controls with normal speech and resonance. Results from the present study are the first to demonstrate quantitative and qualitative differences in the velopharyngeal musculature in children with palatal microforms and VPD using MRI. This study adds valuable information to the body of literature documenting velopharyngeal differences in children with palatal microforms and VPD, and may help improve clinical diagnostic and treatment approaches...|$|R
2500|$|Although {{symptoms}} {{can vary}} greatly between affected individuals, even those {{within the same}} family, symptoms normally begin in infancy and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes. [...] The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords. [...] The hoarse voice {{can be one of}} the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease. Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs. This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance. [...] Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars. The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly. [...] White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, buccal mucosa, tonsils, <b>uvula,</b> epiglottis and frenulum of the tongue. This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom. Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments. Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease.

40|$|Upper airway dilator muscles play an {{important}} role in the pathophysiology of sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAHS). The mechanical and structural characteristics of these muscles remain unknown. The aim of this study was to compare the physiologic, metabolic, and fiber type characteristics of one upper airway dilator muscle (musculus <b>uvulae,</b> MU) in 11 SAHS and in seven nonapneic snorers. The different analyses were done on MU obtained during uvulo-palato-pharyngoplasty. Snorers and SAHS differed only in their apnea + hypopnea indices (11. 5 +/- 5. 9 and 34. 2 +/- 14. 6 /h, respectively, mean +/- SD). Absolute twitch and tetanic tension production of MU was significantly greater in SAHS than in snorers while the fatigability index was similar in the two groups. Protein content and anaerobic enzyme activities of MU were significantly greater in SAHS than in snorers; no difference was observed for aerobic enzyme activities. The total muscle fiber cross-sectional area of MU was significantly higher in SAHS (2. 2 +/- 0. 9 mm 2) than in snorers (1. 1 +/- 0. 7 mm 2). The surface occupied by type IIA muscle fibers of MU was larger in SAHS (2. 00 +/- 0. 96) than in snorers (0. 84 +/- 0. 63 mm 2).

40|$|Abstract Physiologic, metabolic, and histochemical {{characteristics}} of one upper airway (UA) dilator muscle (musculus uvulae; MU) differ between sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (SAilS) and nonapneic snorers. We hypothesized that {{these differences in}} MU characteristics could result from the cumulative effects of the diurnal and nocturnal intermittent contractions of UA muscles in order to compensate for a permanent increase in UA collapsibility. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the influence of UA collapsibility on MU characteristics. Seventeen SABS and three nonapneic snorers, who underwent an uvulo-palato-pharyngoplasty as a treatment for snoring or SAilS, participated in the study. Awake and sleeping UA critical pressure (Pcrit) was measured during continuous positive or negative airway pressure trials by analysis of the relationship between maximal inspiratory flow and the upstream pressure of flow-limited breathing cycles. Maximum isometric twitch (Pt) and tetanic tension (Po), fatigability measurements, activities of marker enzymes for anaerobic and aerobic-oxidative profile, and fiber type proportions and areas of MU were determined. There was a significant positive relationship between Pt, Po, and Pcrit measured during wakefulness and sleep. The fatigability index was negatively correlated with awake Pcrit values (r =- 0. 79). Activity level of the anaerobic enzymes as well as the percentage of surface occupied by type I and type hA muscle fibers as correlated with awake Pcrit.

His chief goals consisted of researching the history of all the cities the expedition would visit and collecting information about the languages of the groups they would meet along the way. The painters Johann Christian Berckhan (died 1751) and Johann Wilhelm Lürsenius (died around 1770), both of whom were part of the academic component, got special instructions.
