5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} the front office. COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms.</b> Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E
5|$|In 1529, Pedrarias Dávila sent an {{expedition}} led by Martín de Estete to annex {{the territory of}} El Salvador to his domains in neighbouring Nicaragua, {{going so far as}} to distribute the unconquered natives of the Gulf of Fonseca in encomienda to his followers. At the time, Diego de Rojas was in command of the Spanish forces attempting to pacify indigenous resistance centred on Popocatepet. In January or February 1530, Martín de Estete captured Rojas, and marched on San Salvador, but was unable to gain the support of the residents there, and set up camp at Perulapan (modern San Martín Perulapán), just to the south, which he called Ciudad de los Caballeros ("City of the Knights"). The acting governor of Guatemala, Francisco de Orduña, sent his captain Francisco López at the head of {{an expedition}} to drive out the interlopers. López left Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala in March 1530 with thirty cavalry, and an unspecified body of infantry. The residents of San Salvador rose <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms</b> to join the relief force; Estete abandoned his camp and retreated towards Nicaragua, taking with him 2000 enslaved Cuzcatlecos. López pursued Estete and caught up with his forces after crossing the Lempa River. Estete and his second-in-command fled for Nicaragua, and his soldiers surrendered to López. Diego de Rojas was freed, and the slaves recovered. This intervention put an end to Pedrarias Dávila's hopes of securing El Salvador as part of Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|In Higueras, Cerezeda became ill, and {{lacked the}} ability to provide strong leadership. He was unable to expand the conquered area, and the Spanish treated the {{indigenous}} population with customary harshness, resulting in population decline as the natives either succumbed to their ruthless treatment, or fled into the hills. The natives that remained were increasingly hostile, and refuse to work for their encomendero overlords. This resistance crystallised around Sicumba; ever more indigenous warriors rallied to his cause, and areas that had been superficially conquered rose <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms</b> against the Spanish. Areas that had previously fallen to the Spanish were lost, and they were encircled in a small region centred on Buena Esperanza. The colonists were demoralised, fearing a massive Indian attack at any moment, and were desperately short of provisions since the encomienda towns refused to supply them. The colonists openly questioned Cerezeda's leadership, and new factions formed, with treasurer Diego García de Solís leading the opposition. Rumours of the riches of Peru lured Spaniards away from the faltering colony in Honduras-Higueras, and forty or fifty men deserted in search of better fortune elsewhere. Although precious metals had been discovered close to Buena Esperanza, {{it was impossible to}} mine them due to the hostility of the Indians. In spite of Cerezeda's opposition, García de Solís appealed directly to the governor of Guatemala, Pedro de Alvarado, who had recently returned from Ecuador. Such was the desperate situation that García de Solís travelled personally to Guatemala with ten soldiers, leaving Buena Esperanza in October 1535, and arriving in Santiago de Guatemala in late November.|$|E

25|$|The Basques – Kingdom of Navarre and the Basque Provinces ("Biscay") – had {{supported}} the king against the Habsburg pretender, and initially retained their home rule (fueros). However, the centralising drive of the Spanish Crown did not spare them.

Philip V sent over troops and the uprising (matxinada) was quelled in blood. Despite his military success, eventually Philip V backed down on his decision, brought customs back to the Ebro river (1719). The Basques managed to keep their traditional institutions and laws.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the many}} losses inflicted on the Xiongnu, {{rebellion}} soon broke out and former enslaved people rose <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms.</b> Around 80 BC, the Xiongnu attacked the Wusun in a punitive campaign and soon the Wusun monarch requested military support from the Han empire. In 72 BC, the joint forces of the Wusun and Han invaded {{the territory of the}} Luli King of the Right. Around 40,000 Xiongnu people and many of their lifestock were captured before their city was sacked after the battle. The very next year, various tribes invaded and raided the Xiongnu territory from all fronts; Wusun from the west, Dingling from the north, and Wuhuan from the east. The Han forces had set out in five columns and invaded from the south. According to Hanshu, this event marks the beginning of Xiongnu decline and the dismantlement of the confederation.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{demarcation}} of the Durand Line, the British began {{connecting the}} region {{on its side}} of the Durand Line to the vast and expansive Indian railway network. Meanwhile, Abdur Rahman Khan conquered the Nuristanis and made them Muslims. Concurrently, Afridi tribesmen began rising <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms</b> against the British, creating a zone of instability between Peshawar and the Durand Line. Further, frequent skirmishes and wars between the Afghan state and the British Raj starting in the 1870s made travel between Peshawar and Jalalabad almost impossible. As a result, travel across the boundary was almost entirely halted. Further, the British recruited {{tens of thousands of}} local Pashtuns into the British Indian Army and stationed them throughout British India and southeast Asia. Exposure to India, combined with the ease of travel eastwards into Punjab and the difficulty of travel towards Afghanistan, led many Pashtuns to orient themselves towards the heartlands of British India and away from Kabul. By the time of Indian independence, political opinion was divided into those who supported a homeland for Muslim Indians in the shape of Pakistan, those who supported reunification with Afghanistan, and those who believed that a united India would be a better option.|$|E

They created, {{with the help of}} the Cumans and the Vlachs living on the left bank of the Danube, a new state, the Second Bulgarian Empire between the Balkan Mountains and the Danube (to the south of the future Wallachia). [...] The new state was called '"Bulgaria and Vlachia" [...] in Western sources. For example, in 1204 the pope elevated the head of the Bulgarian church to the rank of [...] "primas" [...] (primate) [...] "of all Bulgaria and Vlachia".

500|$|Outside his Cumbrian principality and the {{southern}} fringe of Scotland-proper, David exercised little power in the 1120s, and {{in the words of}} Richard Oram, was [...] "king of Scots in little more than name". He was probably in that part of Scotland he did rule for most of the time between late 1127 and 1130. However, he was at the court of Henry in 1126 and in early 1127, and returned to Henry's court in 1130, serving as a judge at Woodstock for the treason trial of Geoffrey de Clinton. It was in this year that David's wife, Matilda of Huntingdon, died. Possibly as a result of this, and while David was still in southern England, Scotland-proper rose <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms</b> against him.|$|E
500|$|Two Serbian monks, Damjan Ljubibratić and Pavle, were {{dispatched}} by Patriarch Jovan Kantul to Pope Clement VIII in 1597. Patriarch Jovan {{assured the}} pope of his [...] "loyalty and obedience" [...] to the Church of Rome, and sought help [...] "to liberate the Serb {{people from the}} Ottomans". The monks made an exhibition to the papal curia on Serbian history and, among other things, petitioned the pope to send an army to Herceg Novi, which would aid vojvoda Grdan on the land; the tribes of Zupci, Nikšić, Piva, Banjani, Drobnjaci and Gacko would rise <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms.</b> From there, {{they would go to}} Onogošt (Nikšić), where all chieftains of all Montenegro, Dukađin, and the nearby lands, would gather. In the case of action, they could count on 100,000 fighters. It was said that since the Ottomans took Saint Sava from the Serbs [...] "God does not help them any more, Christians kill them from every side". The curia then accused the monks, of [...] " [...] to God for our Evil." [...] The monks asked the pope, with the support of Serb spiritual and secular leaders, to send a respectable Christian to oversee them.|$|E

500|$|Sondheim later {{expressed}} {{his view of}} de Mille's directing, calling her [...] "a horror. [...] She treated the actors and singers like dirt and treated the dancers like gods... I think, an extremely insensitive woman, an excellent writer, and a terrible director, in terms of morale, anyway. [...] That was my first experience of bad behavior in the theatre." [...] However, Rufus Smith, who played the minor role of the football coach, stated, [...] "Never again in my life will I experience {{what it is like}} to stop a show cold, by doing exactly what she taught me". [...] The immense job of directing the play finally proved too big for de Mille, who stated [...] "I can't do the new dances and the new songs and the new book," [...] and Hammerstein stepped in to direct the dialogue. [...] According to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, at this point the cast was <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms</b> over de Mille's treatment of them. [...] James Mitchell, one of the dancers in the production, later stated that de Mille was better at directing dancers than actors, as actors come to the stage with preconceived notions about how to play a part, and dancers do not.|$|E
500|$|Burnside {{gained a}} public library with a {{collection}} of 7,800 books in 1961 after it was first suggested in February 1959; the cost of establishing a library for the residents was more affordable since the Libraries Act 1955 had been passed. The Burnside Swimming Centre opened in 1966; the swimming centre was a pet project of then-Mayor George Bolton, who had a grand vision of what he wanted Hazelwood Park, where the centre was to be located, to become. Bolton met unprecedented public opposition in 1964 when the idea was first unveiled. The substantial elderly population of Burnside (15%) was wholly opposed to the idea, suggesting the influx of troublemakers and noise was hardly worth the effort. The cost was estimated at £75,000 (£ as of [...] ). While architects were resigning over the scale of the proposed development and a number of residents were <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>arms,</b> the Adelaide newspapers had a ball; cartoonists throughout 1964 spent many of their daily cartoons covering the debacle. With the failure of a poll to decide the fate of the idea on 24 March the Sunday Mail published the headline [...] "Burnside Says NO to Swim Pool". Mayor Bolton was not dismayed by the result; he pushed ahead with his idea and announced new plans in December. After a strong public campaign and minor changes to the project a poll in February 1965 voted strongly in favour of the idea. The Mayor had won his battle and it was named the George Bolton Swimming Centre in his honour upon opening.|$|E
