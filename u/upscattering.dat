40|$|We study Compton <b>upscattering</b> of low-frequency photons in a {{converging}} flow {{of thermal}} plasma. The photons escape diffusively and electron scattering {{is the dominant}} source of opacity. We solve numerically and approximately analytically the equation of radiative transfer {{in the case of}} spherical, steady state accretion into black holes. Unlike previous work on this subject, we consider the inner boundary at a finite radius and this has a significant effect on the emergent spectrum. It is shown that the bulk motion of the converging flow is more efficient in <b>upscattering</b> photons than thermal Comptonization, provided that the electron temperature in the flow is of order a few keV or less. In this case, the spectrum observed at infinity consists of a soft component coming from those input photons which escaped after a few scatterings without any significant energy change and of a power law which extends to high energies and is made of those photons which underwent significant <b>upscattering.</b> The luminosity of the power law is relatively small compared to that of the soft component. The more reflective the inner boundary is, the flatter the power-law spectrum becomes. The spectral energy power-law index for black-hole accretion is always higher than 1 and it is approximately 1. 5 for high accretion rates.

We provide a model, that identifies and explains the origin of the QPOs and how they are imprinted on the properties of power-law flux component. We argue the existence of a bounded compact coronal region which is a natural consequence of the adjustment of Keplerian disk flow to the innermost sub-Keplerian boundary conditions near the central object and that ultimately leads to the formation of a transition layer (TL) between the adjustment radius and the innermost boundary. The model predicts two phases or states dictated by the photon <b>upscattering</b> produced in the TL: (1) hard state, in which the TL is optically thin and very hot (kT ~ 50 keV) producing photon <b>upscattering</b> via thermal Componization; the photon spectrum index Gamma~ 1. 7 for this state is dictated by gravitational energy release and Compton cooling in an optically thin shock near the adjustment radius; (2) a soft state which is optically thick and relatively cold (kT~ 5 keV); the index for this state, Gamma~ 2. 8 is determined by soft-photon <b>upscattering</b> and photon trapping in converging flow into BH.

40|$|We {{discuss a}} {{scenario}} where the DAMA modulation effect {{is explained by}} a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) which <b>upscatters</b> inelastically to a heavier state and predominantly couples to the spin of protons. In this scenario constraints from xenon and germanium targets are evaded dynamically, due to {{the suppression of the}} WIMP coupling to neutrons, while those from fluorine targets are evaded kinematically, because the minimal WIMP incoming speed required to trigger <b>upscatters</b> off fluorine exceeds the maximal WIMP velocity in the Galaxy, or is very close to it. In this scenario WIMP scatterings off sodium are usually sensitive to the large-speed tail of the WIMP velocity distribution and modulated fractions of the signal close to unity arise in a natural way. On the other hand, a halo-independent analysis with more conservative assumptions about the WIMP velocity distribution allows to extend the viable parameter space to configurations where large modulated fractions are not strictly necessary. We discuss large modulated fractions in the Maxwellian case showing that they imply a departure from the usual cosine time dependence of the expected signal in DAMA. However we explicitly show that the DAMA data is not sensitive to this distortion, both in time and frequency space, even in the extreme case of a 100 % modulated fraction. Moreover the same scenario provides an explanation of the maximum in the energy spectrum of the modulation amplitude detected by DAMA in terms of WIMPs whose minimal incoming speed matches the kinematic threshold for inelastic <b>upscatters.</b> For the elastic case the detection of such maximum suggests an inversion of the modulation phase below the present DAMA energy threshold, while this is not expected for inelastic scattering. This may allow to discriminate between the two scenarios in a future low-threshold analysis of the DAMA data. Comment: 28 pages, 11 figures, updated to published versio...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} model for the {{spectral}} formation of Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) prompt emission, where the phenomenological Band's function is usually applied to describe the GRB prompt emission. We suggest that the GRB prompt emission is mainly a result of two <b>upscattering</b> processes. The first process is the Comptonization of relatively cold soft photons of the star off electrons of a hot shell of plasma of temperature T_e of the order of 10 ^{ 9 } K (or kT_e~ 100 keV) that moves sub-relativistically with the bulk velocity V_b substantially less than the speed of light c. In this phase, the Comptonization parameter Y is high and the interaction between a blackbody-like soft seed photon population and hot electrons leads to formation of a saturated Comptonization spectrum modified by the sub-relativistic bulk outflow. The second process is an <b>upscattering</b> of the previously Comptonized spectrum by the plasma outflow once it becomes relativistic. This process gives rise to the high-energy power-law component above the peak in the EF(E) -diagram where F(E) is the energy flux. The latter process can be described by a convolution of the Comptonized spectrum with a broken-power-law Green function. Possible physical scenarios for this second <b>upscattering</b> process are discussed.

40|$|Resonant Compton <b>upscattering</b> is commended as a {{mechanism}} that produces a hard gamma-ray spectrum while suppressing X-rays. This model, however, has severe physical and observational limitations. Effective X-ray suppression places a lower limit on the electron density; above this limit X-rays scatter multiple times, so the single-scattering approximation of this mechanism is invalid. Multiple scattering produces a spectrum that is much harder than the single-scattering spectrum. As the Thomson optical depth of a power-law electron beam approaches unity, photon spawning commences at a high rate and physically invalidates the underlying electron distribution. The Compton <b>upscattering</b> model is therefore only valid over a narrow range of electron densities.
