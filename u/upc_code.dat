5000|$|The IRD {{engineers}} {{first had}} to develop a reliable process of hot stamping the magnetic stripe to the plastic cards. This was {{necessary in order to}} meet the close tolerances required to reliably encode and read the data on the Magnetic Stripe Cards by magnetic write/read heads. The magnetic stripe was encoded with a single track of data utilizing the IBM Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code format. The Delta Distance C Optical Bar Code was developed by the IBM Systems Development Division working at Research Triangle Park in Raleigh North Carolina headed up by George J. Laurer. Other members of the group were N. Joseph Woodland, Paul McEnroe, Dr. Robert Evans, Bernard Silver, Art Hamburgen, Heard Baumeister and Bill Crouse. The IBM group in Raleigh was competing with RCA, Litton-Zellweger and other companies who were working with the National Retail Merchants Association NRMA to develop a standard optical bar code to be used in the retail industry. NRMA wanted an optically readable code that could be printed on products allowing purchasers to rapidly [...] "check out" [...] at the new electronic cash register/checkout counters being developed. The code would also be used for production and inventory control of products. Of the many optical bar codes submitted to NRMA by IBM and other companies, NRMA finally selected the later version of the IBM bar code known as the Delta Distance D Optical Bar Code format. The Delta Distance C Code was an earlier version of the UPC Universal Product Code. The <b>UPC</b> <b>code</b> was selected in 1973 by NRMA as their standard and has become the World Wide Standard that we all know today as the UPC Uniform Product Code.|$|E

In this paper, we discuss a ground-breaking concept of RFID based smart shopping cart in the field of retail merchandise. Our whole shopping experience is often marred by the long checkout lines. Soon we can end this problem by replacing the ubiquitous Universal Product <b>Code</b> (<b>UPC)</b> bar <b>code</b> by smart labels, known as radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. The key idea here is to provide assistance in everyday shopping in terms of reduction in time spent, eliminating the daily hassle of locating the right product and standing in long lines. The primary goal is to provide a technology oriented, reduced cost, time saving, hassle free, commercially oriented system for an enhanced shopping experience [...] Keywords — RFID (radio frequency identification), ZigBee, universal product code(UPC). introduction: With the growing economy, urbanization, industrial growth in recent years, there has been a significant change in the global market. With the grocery sector playing an important part in the worldwide economy, it {{has become one of the}} most convenient and diverse business across the globe. The emergence of RFID makes the traditional retail process faster, transparent and efficient. With the proposed system, soon, when the <b>UPC</b> <b>codes</b> would be replaced by RFID tags these tags would communicate with an electronic reader (through an infrared sensor) that will detect every item in the cart and this reader would be connected to a large network that will send information of the products to the retailer and product manufacturers (through ZigBee).

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} Smart Tupperware, {{a system}} for automatically maintaining inventory status of kitchen foodstuffs {{for the purpose of}} updating the user’s shopping list on a PDA (personal digital assistant). Commercial kitchen containers were instrumented with microcontrollers and a variety of sensors to determine the volume, weight, and optical properties of dry goods commonly stored in the kitchen. The containers periodically “wake-up ” and wirelessly communicate to a base station PC regarding their inventory status. The base station maintains a web page for each of the containers, creating a distributed database of foodstuff properties. The purpose of this distributed database is to eliminate the need for human annotation of each inventory item, making the inventory system totally transparent to the user. Once the container has determined its contents by matching with the distributed database, the fill status is automatically updated on the user’s PDA via WiFi. A custom application on the PDA organizes the shopping list for both inventoried and non-inventoried items. An optional barcode scanner on the PDA facilitates greater information gathering from the <b>UPC</b> <b>code</b> at point of sale. I I...|$|E
40|$|The next {{generations of}} {{supercomputers}} {{are projected to}} have {{hundreds of thousands of}} processors. However, as the numbers of processors grow, the scalability of applications will be the dominant challenge. This forces us to reexamine some of our fundamental ways that we approach the design and use of parallel languages and runtime systems. In this paper we show how the globally shared arrays in a popular Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) language, Unified Parallel C (UPC), can be combined with a new collective interface to improve both performance and scalability. This interface allows subsets, or teams, of threads to perform a collective together. As opposed to MPI’s communicators, our interface allows set of threads to be placed in teams instantly rather than explicitly constructing communicators, thus allowing for a more dynamic team construction and manipulation. We motivate our ideas with three application kernels: Dense Matrix Multiplication, Dense Cholesky factorization and multidimensional Fourier transforms. We describe how the three aforementioned applications can be succinctly written in UPC thereby aiding productivity. We also show how such an interface allows for scalability by running on up to 16, 384 processors on the Blue-Gene/L. In a few lines of <b>UPC</b> <b>code,</b> we wrote a dense matrix multiply routine achieves 28. 8 TFlop/s and a 3 D FFT that achieves 2. 1 TFlop/s.

40|$|At the 2008 CS MANTECH Conference, a {{paper was}} {{presented}} summarizing {{the growth of}} compound semiconductor enabled electronic devices outpacing many other semiconductor markets[1]. This paper provides an update to those trends, primarily focusing on smartphones. The rapid growth of smartphones {{in the past two}} years has validated the assertion that mobile communications devices will consume many functions that previously were independent stand-alone products including pagers, alarm clocks, appointment books, watches, MP 3 players, cameras and portable navigation devices. Besides functions just described, the growth of smartphones has enabled a new set of services that exploit the integration of these technologies to provide more convenience to the consumers. For example, in 2008 the use of barcodes was discussed to provide an efficient means of entering detailed information into the handset, such as addresses or contact information. In 2009 a number of barcode reader applications emerged that allow the consumer, when visiting a store, to image a product’s barcode with the camera on their smartphone, send that <b>UPC</b> <b>code</b> to a webservice, and have the webservice return the price from competitor’s stores. In the 2008 paper, a Wi-Fi enabled TV from Hewlett Packard was discussed that enabled multimedia streaming content from your home network as an example of the proliferation of Wi-Fi into more consumer devices beyond the primary application of connecting lap top computers to the internet. This makes Wi-Fi modems the second largest market behind cellular enabled devices for compound semiconductor devices. There is a company that recently announced a Wi-Fi enabled body weight scale that sends its measurement to a web service where you can monitor your weight on your computer or your smarthphone.

Using different weights on neighboring numbers means that most transpositions change the check digit; however, because all weights differ by an even number, this does not catch transpositions of two digits that differ by 5, (0 and 5, 1 and 6, 2 and 7, 3 and 8, 4 and 9), since the 2 and 5 multiply to yield 10.|$|R
