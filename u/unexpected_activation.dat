40|$|Memory is {{becoming}} one of the major power consumers in computing systems. Therefore, energy efficient memory management is essential. Modern memory systems employ sleep states for energy saving. To utilize this feature, existing research activities have concentrated on increasing spatial locality to deactivate as many blocks as possible. However, they did not count the <b>unexpected</b> <b>activation</b> of memory blocks due to cache eviction of deactivated tasks. In this paper, we suggest a software-based power state management scheme for memory, which exploits temporal locality to relieve the energy loss from the <b>unexpected</b> <b>activation</b> of memory blocks from cache eviction. The suggested scheme SW-NAP makes a memory block remain deactivated during a certain tick, which has no cache miss over the block. The evaluation shows that SW-NAP is 50 % better than PAVM, which is an existing software scheme, and worse than PMU, which is another approach based on the specialized hardware by 20 %. We also suggest task scheduling policies that increase the e. ectiveness of SW-NAP and they saved up to 7 % additional energy. open 1...|$|E

40|$|The lower {{areas of}} the hierarchically {{organized}} visual cortex are strongly retinotopically organized, with strong responses to specific retinotopic stimuli, and no response to other stimuli outside these preferred regions. Higher areas in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex show a weak eccentricity bias, and are mainly sensitive for object category (e. g., faces versus buildings). This study investigated how the mapping of eccentricity and category sensitivity using {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} is affected by a retinal lesion in two very different low vision patients: a patient with a large central scotoma, affecting central input to the retina (juvenile macular degeneration), and a patient where input to the peripheral retina is lost (retinitis pigmentosa). From the retinal degeneration, we can predict specific losses of retinotopic activation. These predictions were confirmed when comparing stimulus activations with a no-stimulus fixation baseline. At the same time, however, seemingly contradictory patterns of <b>activation,</b> <b>unexpected</b> given the retinal degeneration, were observed when different stimulus conditions were directly compared. These <b>unexpected</b> <b>activations</b> were due to position-specific deactivations, indicating the importance of investigating absolute activation (relative to a no-stimulus baseline) rather than relative activation (comparing different stimulus conditions).

To achieve a similar frequency and extent of AR activations during general anesthesia compared to waking state, a lower cut-off for statistical inferences (p[*]<[*] 0.05 or p[*]<[*] 0.01 vs. p[*]<[*] 0.001) had to be applied.

40|$|Since it {{was first}} {{introduced}} to {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) in 1998 [1]–[4], independent component analysis (ICA) {{has proved to be a}} powerful method for exploratory analysis of fMRI data. It has been used to uncover <b>unexpected</b> <b>activations</b> in fMRI data derived from brain activation in response to very complex stimuli, including driving [5] or watching a movie [6], and to infer connectivity between brain regions [6]. ICA has been used to characterize other sources of variability in the fMRI signal besides task-related activity [2], [3] as well as challenging some of the assumptions inherent in other fMRI analysis methods [7]–[9]. As a data-driven fMRI analysis technique, the philosophy of ICA is often in disagreement with hypothesis-driven methods, such as multivariate linear regression [10]. In data-driven methods, as few assumptions as possible are made to reveal what is in the data. In hypothesis-driven methods, fairly rigid assumptions—e. g., all the assumptions associated with determining the least squares (LS) estimates of the coefficients in multiple linear regression [11]—are specified, and specific hypotheses are tested. As most scientific inquiry is hypothesisdriven, this latter approach is clearly desirable. However, as we still do not currently understand the underlying nature of all the sources of fluctuation within fMRI data [12], there is the risk of substantially violating one or more of the underlying assumptions, possibly resulting in misinterpretations [13]. Until fMRI data are sufficiently well understood so that the major sources of variability are well characterized and models are developed that incorporate these sources of variability, data-driven methods including ICA will continue to play an important role in fMRI analysis.

40|$|The {{closed-loop}} control of rehabilitative technologies by neural commands {{has shown a}} great potential to improve motor recovery in patients suffering from paralysis. Brain–machine interfaces (BMI) {{can be used as}} a natural control method for such technologies. BMI provides a continuous association between the brain activity and peripheral stimulation, with the potential to induce plastic changes in the nervous system. Paraplegic patients, and especially the ones with incomplete injuries, constitute a potential target population to be rehabilitated with brain-controlled robotic systems, as they may improve their gait function after the reinforcement of their spared intact neural pathways. This paper proposes a closed-loop BMI system to control an ambulatory exoskeleton—without any weight or balance support—for gait rehabilitation of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. The integrated system was validated with three healthy subjects, and its viability in a clinical scenario was tested with four SCI patients. Using a cue-guided paradigm, the electroencephalographic signals of the subjects were used to decode their gait intention and to trigger the movements of the exoskeleton. We designed a protocol with a special emphasis on safety, as patients with poor balance were required to stand and walk. We continuously monitored their fatigue and exertion level, and conducted usability and user-satisfaction tests after the experiments. The results show that, for the three healthy subjects, 84. 44 ± 14. 56 % of the trials were correctly decoded. Three out of four patients performed at least one successful BMI session, with an average performance of 77. 6 1 ± 14. 72 %. The shared control strategy implemented (i. e., the exoskeleton could only move during specific periods of time) was effective in preventing unexpected movements during periods in which patients were asked to relax. On average, 55. 22 ± 16. 69 % and 40. 45 ± 16. 98 % of the trials (for healthy subjects and patients, respectively) would have suffered from <b>unexpected</b> <b>activations</b> (i. e., false positives) without the proposed control strategy.

We evaluated the minimal length required for formation of bona fide LF substrates using substrate phage display. Phage-based selection yielded a substrate that is cleaved seven times more efficiently by LF than the peptide targeted in the protein kinase MKK 6. Site-directed mutagenesis within the metal-binding site in the LF active center and within phage-selected substrates revealed a complex pattern of LF-substrate interactions. The elementary steps of LF-mediated proteolysis were resolved by the stopped-flow technique. Pre-steady-state kinetics of LF proteolysis followed a four-step mechanism as follows: initial substrate binding, rearrangement of the enzyme-substrate complex, a rate-limiting cleavage step, and product release.

Using a kisspeptin-green fluorescent protein mouse model, the present study examined whether the neuropeptides kisspeptin, dynorphin, and NKB modulate the electrical activity of ARN kisspeptin neurons in the adult male mouse. Cell-attached recordings showed that kisspeptin itself {{had no effect on}} kisspeptin neuron firing. Dynorphin and the ̃-opioid receptor agonist U 50 - 488 evoked a potent suppression of all ARN kisspeptin neuron firing that was blocked completely by the ̃-opioid receptor antagonist nor- Binaltorphimine. Both NKB and Senktide, a neurokinin 3 receptor agonist, exerted a potent stimulatory action on ̃ 95 % of ARN kisspeptin neurons. Although the selective neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists SB 222200 and SR 142801 blocked the effects of Senktide on kisspeptin neurons, they surprisingly had no effect on NKB activation of firing. Studies with selective neurokinin 1 receptor (SDZ-NKT 343) and neurokinin 2 receptor (GR 94800) antagonists revealed that the activation of kisspeptin neurons by NKB was only blocked completely by a cocktail of antagonists against all 3 tachykinin receptors.

The {{aim of this study}} was to delineate the alternative mechanisms that lead to the activation of such AR variants as they are unresponsive to hormone stimulation, and to outline consequences of the loss of the LBD/AF- 2 region on their functional properties. By using an MMTV-luciferase reporter construct and LY 294002, UO 126, or ZD 1839, inhibitor of PI 3 K, MEK 1 / 2, and EGFR signaling pathway respectively, we demonstrated that phosphorylation was required for full transcriptional activities of one these AR variants, the Q 640 X mutant AR. Western-blot analyses confirmed that these inhibitors affect the phosphorylation status of this AR variant. Furthermore, studies of the intranuclear colocalization of the Q 640 X AR with cofactors, such as CBP, GRIP- 1, and c-Jun, reveal that the transcriptional complex that forms around the mutant AR is different to that formed around the wild type AR. We demonstrated that CBP and c-Jun are highly recruited by the mutant AR, and this leads to an <b>unexpected</b> <b>activation</b> of AP- 1, NFAT, and NFkappaB transcriptional activities.

In quiescent cells stimulated to proliferate and in elutriated cell populations enriched in the various cell cycle phases the R 2 protein levels are correlated to R 2 mRNA levels that are low in G 0 /G 1 -phase cells but increase dramatically at the G 1 /S border.

HNSCC patients undergoing chemotherapy commonly develop anemia, {{a condition in which}} the body lacks mature red blood cells (RBCs). Erythropoietin (EPO) is a systemically circulating hormone in the body that regulates the production of RBCs and is applied to treat anemia. Recently, several studies implicated shortened life expectancy of cancer patients by EPO administration. It may be due to an <b>unexpected</b> <b>activation</b> of survival and proliferation pathways of cancer cells by EPO {{because of the presence of}} ectopically expressed erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) on the surface of cancer cells. The current study tests the biological effects of EPO and EPOR in HNSCC. A shRNA-mediated knockdown of the EPOR gene was applied to two specific cell lines, HN 4 and its metastatic derivative HN 12. Knockdown of EPOR decreased proliferation in both HN 4 and HN 12 cells. To our surprise, application of EPO to HN 12 control cell line downregulated proliferation in these high EPOR-expressing cells. Conversely, EPO increased proliferation in a breast cancer cell line, MCF- 7. Although EPO greatly impacted HNSCC proliferation, no significant difference was found in migration of these cells upon its application. It was indicated that the pathway responsible for proliferative effects in HNSCC from EPOR association could be due to activation of the PI- 3 /Akt pathway, judged by its phosphorylation of AKT. However, we need to further elucidate the contradictive biological mechanisms of downregulation of HNSCC and upregulation of MCF- 7 proliferation. We also need to expand the number of screened cell lines and confirm the relevance of our observation. Collected together, these findings confirm the hypothesis that EPO and EPOR can impact HNSCC tumor progression, and that their effects may vary among cancer types.

Metal homeostasis genes have therefore been used for these purposes. Engineered accumulation levels, however, have often been far from expected, and transgenic plants frequently display phenotypic features not related to the physiological function of the introduced gene. In this review, we focus on an aspect often neglected in research on plants expressing metal homeostasis genes: the specific regulation of endogenous metal homeostasis genes of the host plant in response to the transgene-induced imbalance of the metal status. These modifications constitute one of the major mechanisms involved in the generation of the plant’s phenotype, including <b>unexpected</b> characteristics. Interestingly, <b>activation</b> of so-called metal cross-homeostasis has emerged as a factor of primary importance. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Current (TSDC) signals {{measured}} in polymers {{at the glass}} transition Tg often exhibit intricate shapes that much depend on the thermal history and on the non-stationary condition used during experiments. This peculiar behavior is frequently {{explained in terms of}} a physical singularity of the molecular motions. We show that this singularity, i. e. <b>unexpected</b> values for <b>activation</b> energy and pre-exponential factor, obtained around Tg, result from the misuse of the Arrhenius law for treating the experimental data obtained in non-stationary experimental conditions. A simple model using time dependent configurational entropy for the material evolution and using a single Debye relaxation for the dielectric relaxation process is therefore proposed to explain the experimental behavior. The influence of the heating rate and of a non-Debye relaxation on the TSDC signal is also studied and clearly shows that the peculiar behavior of TSDC peaks can originate from the conjugated effects of entropy relaxation and non-Debye response.

40|$|The first aim of our PET {{study was}} to {{replicate}} previous findings concerning the brain areas activated by a verbal working memory task. The second aim was to specify the neural basis of the central executive, using a task of working memory updating. Our data confirm that the lower left supramarginal gyms and premotor area are the key regions subserving short-term verbal memory processes. They also suggest that the updating memory task is related to mid-dorsolateral prefrontal activation most probably responsible for the updating function of the central executive. An <b>unexpected,</b> predominantly right <b>activation</b> occurred in the inferior parietal region during the verbal memory updating task, which we related to a visuospatial strategy used to maintain the information in short-term memory. A third purpose was to explore the brain regions activated by a nonverbal, visual memory task, and our results confirm {{the importance of the}} superior occipital gyrus in the visual short-term memory.

If the computer system a user was communicating with {{was too busy to}} accept input, it could send a code to mechanically interlock the keyboard so the user could not press any keys. The keyboard was also locked when the computer was typing, to avoid damaging the mechanism or interleaving user input and computer output in a confusing manner. Though done to protect the print mechanism from damage, an <b>unexpected</b> keyboard lock <b>activation</b> could cause minor injury to a typist with a heavy touch. There was little obvious warning that the keyboard had locked or unlocked, other than a faint click from the interlock solenoid, easily drowned out by the printer and fan noise in many computer facilities. There was a small indicator light, but this was of little help to fast touch typists whose gaze was fixed on copy they were transcribing.|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a triplex TaqMan-based quantitative PCR assay for the human polyomaviruses JC (JCPyV) and BK (BKPyV). The assay simultaneously detects and quantifies both JCPyV and BKPyV in human clinical samples, and it includes an internal amplification control consisting of murine polyomavirus (MuPyV) plasmid DNA. We developed the assay for the Roche LightCycler 480 platform with the reporter dyes VIC, 6 -FAM, and Cy 5 for MuPyV, BKPyV, and JCPyV, respectively. The assay had a high specificity for BKPyV and JCPyV when either viral genome was present alone or in mixed samples over a range of 101 to 107 copy numbers per reaction. The analytical sensitivity was 50 copies for BKPyV and 10 copies for JCPyV. The use of the MuPyV internal control ensured monitoring {{of the quality of}} the extraction and of PCR inhibition, even in samples such as cerebrospinal fluid and plasma in which controls based on host genes cannot be effectively used. In addition, we developed a similar assay using a different dye configuration (6 -FAM, VIC, and NED) that could be used on an ABI 7500 Fast platform. This assay had sensitivities similar to those of the LightCycler 480 configuration for BKPyV and JCPyV when either viral genome was present alone, but the sensitivity of detection of BKPyV was greatly decreased when an excess of JCPyV (> 100 -fold) was present in the sample. This internally controlled combined assay offers greater convenience and cost-effectiveness compared to separate assays for each virus and can also detect <b>unexpected</b> PyV <b>activations</b> by testing for both viruses in all samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of alkaloids is rather specific to certain plant species. However, berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, is relatively broadly {{distributed in the}} plant kingdom. Thus, berberine biosynthesis has been intensively investigated, especially using Coptis japonica cell cultures. Almost all biosynthetic enzyme genes have already been characterized at the molecular level. Particularly, two transcription factors (TFs), a plant-specific WRKY-type TF, CjWRKY 1, and a basic helix-loop-helix TF, CjbHLH 1, were shown to comprehensively regulate berberine biosynthesis in C. japonica cells. In this study, we characterized the promoter region of some biosynthetic enzyme genes and associated cis-acting elements involved in the transcriptional regulation via two TFs. The promoter regions of three berberine biosynthetic enzyme genes (CYP 80 B 2, 4 ′OMT and CYP 719 A 1) were isolated, and their promoter activities were dissected by a transient assay involving the sequentially truncated promoter::luciferase (LUC) reporter constructs. Furthermore, transactivation activities of CjWRKY 1 were determined using the truncated promoter::LUC reporter constructs or constructs with mutated cis-elements. These results suggest the involvement of a putative W-box in the regulation of biosynthetic enzyme genes. Direct binding of CjWRKY 1 to the W-box DNA sequence was also confirmed by an electrophoresis mobility shift assay and by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. In addition, CjbHLH 1 also activated transcription from truncated 4 ′OMT and CYP 719 A 1 promoters independently of CjWRKY 1, suggesting the involvement of a putative E-box. <b>Unexpected</b> transcriptional <b>activation</b> of biosynthetic enzyme genes via a non-W-box sequence and by CjWRKY 1 {{as well as the}} possible involvement of a GCC-box in berberine biosynthesis in C. japonica are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Differentiation of T helper (Th) subset 2 {{effector}} lymphocytes {{is thought}} to foreclose on IFN-γ gene expression. Using an IL- 4 locus modified to detect transcriptional induction of this effector cytokine gene in developing Th 2 cells, we show here that these cells contributed effectively to a long-term memory population. A memory CD 4 subset formed efficiently from an activated population after transcriptional induction of the IL- 4 locus and differentiation into an IL- 4 -producing subset with Th 2 characteristics. Memory lymphocytes derived from Th 2 cells with IL- 4 locus activation remained committed to transcriptional competence of Th 2 cytokine genes when reactivated and cultured under strong Th 1 -polarizing conditions. This commitment to transcriptional competence at Th 2 cytokine gene loci upon recall activation indicates that linear differentiation is a substantial component of type 2 memory. Strikingly, however, descendants of the Th 2 population could turn on IFN-γ expression when reactivated after a quiescent period, revealing an <b>unexpected</b> flexibility allowing <b>activation</b> of the forbidden IFN-γ gene after reactivation and growth...|$|R
40|$|Catalysis {{is often}} {{little more than}} a word to phenomenologically {{describe}} the fact that a reaction follows a pat 1 that leads to products of an unexpected kind or of <b>unexpected</b> yield. Low <b>activation</b> energy barriers for intermediates are recognized as the most likely cause why a system deviates from the thermodynamic pull towards minimizing its free energy and ends up in a metastable state. Seldom is the mechanism known. This i: particularly true for heterogeneous catalysis under hydrothermal conditions with minerals as catalysts. It is commonly assumed that catalytic action takes place across solid-fluid interfaces and that, on the atomic level, interfaces are just 2 -dimensional contacts. This makes it difficult to understand, for instance, the assembly of long-chain carboxylic (fatty) acids. 3 y studying single crystals that grew from a melt in the presence of H 2 O and CO 2, we can show: (1) that numerals take up the fluid components into solid solution, (2) that some-thing happens converting them to -educedH and C, (3) that C atoms segregate into dislocations and tie C-C bonds. The products are medium-to-long chain Cn protomolecules, with some C-H attached, pre-assembled in the dislocations. Upon solvent extraction, these proto-molecules turn into carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids. This observation suggests that, in a very elementary step, catalysis under hydrothermal conditions leading to fatty acids involves the pre-assembly of Cn entities in the interface that is not 2 -D but extends into the 3 rd dimension, with dislocations as synthesis sites...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{summarize}} {{a number}} of recent modeling studies related to the potential for fault reactivations and induced seismicity during underground CO 2 injection. The model simulations were conducted using coupled multiphase fluid flow and geomechanics, including fault-frictional weakening enabling analysis of sudden (seismic) fault rupture, with some of the numerical analyses extended to dynamic modeling of seismic source, wave propagation, and ground motion. These model simulations show that the critical factors in determining the likelihood and magnitude of such an event are the local in situ stress field, fault orientation and size, fault strength, and injection pressure. We analyzed the case of activation of a 1 km long minor fault that might have gone undetected during the site investigation and show that the maximum seismic magnitudes would likely be less than about 3. 6, even if the entire 1 km fault would to be activated. We then include seismic wave propagation generated by the rupture and show how the acceleration and deceleration of the rupture generate waves and result in a peak ground acceleration of about 0. 1 g, except for a localized – 0. 6 g of horizontal peak acceleration at the faults intersection with the ground surface. The modeling shows that these are high frequency events that would not cause any substantial damage but could certainly be felt by the local population. We may also considered that fault reactivation, even associated with relatively small seismic or aseismic events, could potentially increase CO 2 seepage out of the intended storage complex and therefore reduce the effectiveness of a CO 2 storage operation. Under these circumstances, we recommend a staged, learn-as-you-go approach, involving a gradual increase of injection rates combined with continuous monitoring of geomechanical changes, as well as siting beneath a multiple layered overburden for multiple flow barrier protection, should an <b>unexpected</b> deep fault <b>activation</b> occur...|$|R
