50|$|Adhesives may be broadly {{divided in}} two classes: {{structural}} and pressure-sensitive. To form a permanent bond, structural adhesives harden via {{processes such as}} evaporation of solvent (for example, white glue), reaction with UV radiation (as in dental adhesives), chemical reaction (such as two part epoxy), or cooling (as in hot melt). In contrast, pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) form a bond simply by the application of light pressure to marry the adhesive with the adherend. Pressure-sensitive adhesives are designed with a balance between flow and resistance to flow. The bond forms because the adhesive is soft enough to flow, or wet, the adherend. The bond has strength because the adhesive is hard enough to resist flow when stress {{is applied to the}} bond. Once the adhesive and the adherend are in proximity, there are also molecular interactions such as van der Waals forces involved in the bond, which contribute significantly to the <b>ultimate</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> PSAs exhibit viscoelastic (viscous and elastic) properties, both of which are used for proper bonding.|$|E

A total of 218 experimental data samples were arranged to obtain training and testing data sets. The critical predictive factors were compressive strength of concrete, concrete cover, steel type, diameter of the steel bar, bond length, and corrosion level.

40|$|Bonding {{of steel}} or fibre {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) plates by adhesive {{to the surface}} of concrete structural elements have become increasingly popular for improving their strength and stiffness. However, these plates are susceptible to debonding prematurely before reaching the designed strength. Therefore, a thorough knowledge of bond behaviour of concrete-adhesive-plate interface is a prerequisite to develop guidelines to avoid failure through the different possible modes. The paper presents thirty six (36) test results for single shear tests conducted on concrete prisms bonded with variety of FRP and metallic plates to evaluate the bond strength and the critical bond length required to sustain the maximum stress on bond for a given plate-concrete interface. The elastic modulus and ultimate tensile strength of the plates of different materials vary between 32 - 300 GPa and 196 - 2800 MPa respectively. The design guidelines developed in this study are capable of predicting the critical bond length and <b>ultimate</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of any type of plate-concrete interface with good accuracy. The predictability of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> model is validated using numerous test results taken from the published literature. (c) 200...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project is undertaken {{to assess the}} effect of washout loss on the drop in bond properties of reinforcing steel bars embedded in underwater concrete (UWC). Special emphasis was placed to evaluate bond using the same concrete mixtures that were subjected to washout. Testing was realized using the beam-end specimen method, and parameters evaluated included level of washout loss, bar diameter, and concrete cover. Test results showed that bond between steel and UWC {{is affected by the}} level of washout loss, which in turn is directly influenced by the mixture composition. Similarly to bond in concrete cast and consolidated above water, the <b>ultimate</b> UWC <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> increases for smaller bar diameters and higher confinement reflected by increased concrete covers.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} different surface treatments of six novel CAD/CAM materials on the bonding effectiveness of two luting composites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six different CAD/CAM materials were tested: four ceramics - Vita Mark II; IPS Empress CAD and IPS e. max CAD; Celtra Duo - one hybrid ceramic, Vita Enamic, and one composite CAD/CAM block, Lava Ultimate. A total of 60 blocks (10 per material) received various mechanical surface treatments: 1. 600 -grit SiC paper; 2. sandblasting with 30 -μm Al 2 O 3; 3. tribochemical silica coating (CoJet). Subsequent chemical surface treatments involved either no further treatment (control), HF acid etching (HF), silanization (S, or HF acid etching followed by silanization (HF+S). Two specimens with the same surface treatment were bonded together using two dual-curing luting composites: Clearfil Esthetic Cement (self-etching) or Panavia SA Cement (self-adhesive). After 1 week of water storage, the microtensile <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of the sectioned microspecimens was measured and the failure mode was evaluated. RESULTS: The bonding performance of the six CAD/CAM materials was significantly influenced by surface treatment (linear mixed models, p < 0. 05). The luting cement had a significant influence on <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for Celtra Duo and Lava Ultimate (linear mixed models, p < 0. 05). Mechanical surface treatment significantly influenced the <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for Celtra Duo (p = 0. 0117), IPS e. max CAD (p = 0. 0115), and Lava Ultimate (p < 0. 0001). Different chemical surface treatments resulted in the highest <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> for the six CAD/CAM materials: Vita Mark II and IPS Empress CAD: S, HF+S; Celtra Duo: HF, HF+S; IPS e. max CAD: HF+S; Vita Enamic: HF+S, S. For Lava <b>Ultimate,</b> the highest <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> were obtained with HF, S, HF+S. Failure analysis showed a relation between <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> and failure type: more mixed failures were observed with higher <b>bond</b> <b>strengths.</b> Mainly adhesive failures were noticed if no further surface treatment was done. The percentage of adhesive failures was higher for CAD/CAM materials with higher flexural strength (Celtra Duo, IPS e. max CAD, and Lava <b>Ultimate).</b> CONCLUSION: The <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of luting composites to novel CAD/CAM materials is influenced by surface treatment. For each luting composite, an adhesive cementation protocol can be specified {{in order to obtain}} the highest bond to the individual CAD/CAM materials. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigated}} bond-slip {{characteristics of}} chloride-induced corroded reinforced concrete incorporating {{different levels of}} recycled concrete aggregates (RCA). Pullout tests were adopted to evaluate the bonding and debonding behaviors of the embedded rebar experiencing different corrosion levels. Both high- and low-strength concrete were considered. Bond-slip curves were recorded to determine the influences of rebar corrosion levels and RCA replacements on the bond strength and debonding energy of the specimens. Test results indicate that increasing rebar corrosion level gradually weakens the antisliding ability of reinforced recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) except for a small level corrosion and the degradation rate of <b>ultimate</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> increases with a decrease of compressive strength at 0. 5 % rebar corrosion. The results also demonstrate that the <b>ultimate</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of reinforced RAC slightly decreases with an increase of RCA replacement. However, the relative bond strength between uncorroded rebar and RAC is little affected by RCA content, while it decreases with an increase of RCA replacement in high-strength specimens after rebar corrosion.

The specimen {{is in the form of}} a concrete rectangular column with the GFRP I-section (I-section) encased in the middle. Four specimens with different configurations were cast and tested. The main parameters involved bond length and the transverse stirrups. The specimens were divided into two groups in accordance to the bond length. The two specimens in Group A had the same bond length of 300 mm, and the transverse steel stirrups were used at one of the specimens. The bond length of the two specimens in Group B was 450 mm, and one of the specimens was also reinforced with stirrups. Push-out was used to conduct this test and all the I-sections were pushed out.

40|$|Within the Doctoral Dissertation {{the bond}} {{mechanism}} of interfaces between masonry units and medium or low mechanical properties hydraulic grouts is experimentally investigated. Based on an extended systematic study, which comprises a) microstructural {{study of the}} interfaces b) mechanical tests and c) correlation {{of the results of}} points a and b, it is proved that the bond mechanism is mechanical in nature for the materials considered. Furthermore, the results allow for the effect of properties of both substrate and grout on bond to be evaluated. The main finding of the experimental campaign is that grouts with medium and low mechanical properties are competitive in terms of <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> with stronger grouts. Based on the experimental results, local constitutive laws describing the behaviour of grout-to-masonry unit interfaces under shear are formulated. The proposed local constitutive laws are used to predict the shear stress-horizontal displacement and horizontal displacement-crack opening response of such interfaces, as well as to determine the values of the <b>ultimate</b> shear <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> and the corresponding slip values. Moreover, the grout-to-in-situ material interfaces are simulated by means of Finite Elements Analysis using a 2 D model. Two different models are applied for the description of mechanical characteristics of the interfaces. Both models are applied, after calibration, to reproduce the experimental results. In general, the experimental curves are adequately simulated by the proposed models. Finally, the abovementioned models are tuned to a simple analytical model of three-leaf masonry element with the purpose to estimate the contribution of grout interfaces to the mechanical behaviour of masonry walls. ...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion is {{the number}} one {{deterioration}} mechanism that decreases the service life of the concrete structures. Many structures in severe environments have experienced an unacceptable loss in serviceability earlier than anticipated due to corrosion. Advanced composite materials in the form of externally bonded fiber reinforcing polymer (FRP) sheets have been successfully used for rehabilitation and strengthening of infrastructure in lieu of traditional repair techniques such as steel plates bonding. FRPs are used because of their light weight, ease of application, non-corrosiveness material, and high strength. The current study comprised of testing eighteen reinforced concrete beams to investigate the confinement provided by carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets on the bond strength of corroded tension lap splices under static loading. The beams were 200 mm wide by 300 mm high by 2000 mm. Each beam was reinforced on the tension side with two steel bars (2 M 15 or 2 M 20 steel bars) spliced at mid span in the constant moment region. The nominal concrete strength was 43 MPa and the yield stress of the steel reinforcement was 400 MPa. The test variables were the concrete cover to bar diameter ratio (c/d) which varied from 1. 5 to 2. 67, the level of corrosion (0 % and 2. 5 % mass loss), and {{the presence or absence of}} transverse CFRP wrapping. The corrosion in the steel bars was induced by means of accelerated technique withan impressed current density of 150 mA/cm 2. The specimens were instrumented by strain gauges on the steel reinforcement, concrete, and CFRP sheets. Linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) was used to measure mid span deflection. The specimens were tested to failure in four point bending. The test results showed that all beams failed by bond splitting.

Curves indicating the distribution of steel compressive stresses and bond stresses in the columns and base slabs are given. Results from these tests indicate that the conventional design approach towards bond stresses in concrete bases is conservative and that the allowable bond stresses in BS CP 110 seem to be too low while the maximum stresses specified in ACI 318 - 71 and the CEB-FIP Recommendations {{seem to be more}} acceptable. In Series V pull-out tests were made on 60 concrete cube specimens subjected to biaxial normal pressure. The <b>ultimate</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> was found to increase with applied normal pressure in proportion to the square root of the normal pressure and square root of the concrete strength. A comparative finite element stress analysis was done on a typical concrete base specimen and the results were found to be in accordance with the results of the tests in Series I to IV...|$|E
40|$|Push-out {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} on 18 rectangular concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns {{with the aim of}} studying the bond behaviour between the steel tube and the concrete infill. The obtained load-slip response and the distribution of the interface bond stress along the member length and around the cross-section for various load levels, as derived from measured axial strain gradients in the steel tube, are reported. Concrete compressive strength, interface length, cross-sectional dimensions and different interface conditions were varied to assess their effect on the ultimate bond stress. The test results indicate that lubricating the steel-concrete interface always had a significant adverse effect on the interface bond strength. Among the other variables considered, concrete compressive strength and cross-section size were found to have a pronounced effect on the bond strength of non-lubricated specimens for the range of cross-section geometries considered, which is not reflected in the European structural design code for composite structures, EN 1994 - 1 - 1 (2004). Finally, based on nonlinear regression of the test data generated in the present study, supplemented by additional data obtained from the literature, an empirical equation has been proposed for predicting the average <b>ultimate</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for SHS and RHS filled with normal strength concrete...|$|E

In order to exploit more efﬁciently their tensile capacity, it is interesting to use CFRP bars as prestressing tendons. This application requires a high quality concrete matrix. The advantageous characteristics of UHPFRC, such as high strength, good ductil- ity and durability, mean that a UHPFRC structure prestressed with CFRP bars may be lighter and require less maintenance. Since the ﬂexural behaviour of prestressed concrete members reinforced with CFRP bars is highly dependent on the bond between the two materials, an experimental program was carried out in order to investigate the bond of CFRP bars embedded in UHPFRC. Two types of surface, smooth and sand-coated, were investigated. Pullout tests were performed to examine the effect of varying parameters such as embedment length, bar diameter and concrete age. The results clearly show that the bond strength of macroscopically smooth bars embedded in UHPFRC is close to that of sand-coated bars. It was also found that <b>ultimate</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> decreases with bar diameter and with embedment length. Moreover, the bond strength can be expected during early age (3 days). A post-test examination revealed that damage occurred only in the outer layers of the CFRP bars...|$|E

Here, {{lightweight and}} ordinary concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> {{is determined by}} pull-out test {{for a variety of}} specimens in various configurations. For each specimen, a bond strength-slip curve is obtained through monotonic loading. Following this process, an identical specimen is subjected to cyclic loading under similar conditions using the same test setup. These examinations reveal several insights. Lightweight concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> is greater than the ordinary concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> for plain steel bars under monotonic loading. Ordinary concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> is greater than lightweight concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> under both monotonic and cyclic loading for deformed steel bars. The loss of concrete-steel <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> is greater in plain bars than in deformed bars...|$|R
