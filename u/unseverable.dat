Bruun, , that [...] "severance" [...] is not an element of realization. In Bruun, a taxpayer-landlord repossessed a property from a tenant—property that had been subject to a 99-year lease—after the tenant failed to pay rent and taxes. The lease had allowed for the tenant to construct a new building or other improvements. The tenant had removed the existing building and had built a new one. The value of the new building as of the date of repossession was $64,245.68. The government contended that the landlord realized a gain of $51,434.25, {{the difference between the}} value of the building at the date of repossession and the landlord's basis in the old building of $12,811.43. The landlord argued that there was no realization of the property because no transaction had occurred, and that the improvement of the property that created the gain was <b>unseverable</b> from the landlord's original capital. The Court ruled against the landlord, deciding that the landlord had realized a gain upon repossession of the property, and said that [...] "severance" [...] is no longer an element of realization.|$|E

40|$|The travelogue of a post-colonial traveller: The travels of Isobelle by Elsa Joubert Die reise van Isobelle (The travels of Isobelle) {{written by}} Elsa Joubert is {{regarded}} as one of her best novels. In many respects this novel can be considered as an overview of an extensive and impressive oeuvre. This article attempts to indicate that this novel not only relates to the important tradition of travel writing in Afrikaans literature, but also comments on this tradition from a feminist and postcolonial perspective. In a certain sense this novel can also be read as a continuance (or rewriting) of Joubert's own travel journals that have still been embedded in a colonial consciousness. Once again a symbiotic relationship exists between the above-mentioned novel and several of Elsa Joubert's other travel journals. In this article the intertextual ties with Water en woestyn and Die verste reis are explored in particular. The premise of this hypothesis is that the characteristic aspect of travel literature is the <b>unseverable</b> tie between centrifugal and centripetal forces. To a great extent the structure of this extensive work, with its extraordinarily solid motif structure, already determines this...|$|E
40|$|The {{linguistic}} {{history of}} a country usually reflects its political history. Therefore, in the Maltese archipelago, scenario of various foreign dominations, one finds at least five official languages in use over the past 900 years or so. These are Latin, Sicilian, Italian, English and Maltese. It follows quite naturally, then, that Maltese literature should also have been written in different languages (Arabic, Italian, English and Maltese). This article examines the poetic production of Gorg Pisani (1909 -) and Roger Scicluna (1898 - 1942), two romantic poets from the small island of Gozo, who wrote respectively in Maltese and in English. Despite Pisani's use of a peripheral language (Maltese) and Scicluna's use of an international one (English), the essence of their Gozitan romantic poetry is virtually the same and fits in perfectly within the mainstream ofMaltese romantic poetry. However, the clearly localized features of the natural elements as portrayed by the two poets; the strong attachment of Pisani to all that recalls the innocence of early times and Scicluna' s deep-rooted respect for Catholicism and its rituals, all contribute to give these two authors' poetry a particular and distinctive imprint. The prevailing mythology in their poetry. whether Christian or pagan. is typically mediterranean, This mediterranean 'animus' is highlighted in the poets' deep-rooted attachment to their birthplace, an intense attachment verging on the morbid, which only islanders can understand. Pisani's yearning for primitive infancy and Scicluna's quest for a future without any existential doubts are the two contrasting facets inherent in the average Gozitan, auached as he is to his island culture by an <b>unseverable</b> umbilical cord which, at the same time, constitutes a severe limitation to his freedom of movement and thought. peer-reviewe...|$|E
