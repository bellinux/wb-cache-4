[...] "The decision has been the toughest I've ever made {{but it is the}} right one to make at this point in my life," [...] Lindgren said. [...] "I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry." [...] Ex-Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik Åkesson replaced Lindgren, as Åkerfeldt explained [...] "Fredrik was the only name that popped <b>up</b> <b>thinking</b> about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's plot, as {{described}} by Dave Grossman: [...] "It's a story about this young man who comes to an island {{in search of his}} life's dream. He's pursuing his career goals and he discovers love in the process and winds <b>up</b> <b>thinking</b> that was actually more important than what he was doing to begin with. You’re laughing, but there's actually something deeper going on as well." [...] When work on the plot began, Gilbert discovered that Schafer's and Grossman's writing styles were too different to form a cohesive whole: Grossman's was [...] "very kind of a dry, sarcastic humor" [...] and Schafer's was [...] "just a little more in your face". In reaction, Gilbert assigned them to different characters and story moments depending on what type of comedy was required. Grossman believed that this benefited the game's writing, as he and Schafer [...] "were all funny in slightly different ways, and it worked well together". Schafer and Grossman wrote most of the dialogue while they were programming the game; as a result, much of it was improvised. Some of the dialogue was based on the designers' personal experiences, such as Guybrush's line [...] "I had a feeling in hell there would be mushrooms", which came from Schafer's own hatred of fungi.|$|E

[...] Zach Boren said, [...] "Everyone in the whole family is an Ohio State fan now[...] [...]No one cares about Michigan at all anymore. That {{was in the past}} and we're all looking forward to being Buckeyes and staying Buckeyes {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] During spring practice, Boren impressed his coaches and teammates; however, he refused all interview requests. [...] During the summer, when asked about the impending Michigan – Ohio State game he said [...] "My attitude is there are 11 games before that game,[...] [...]I can't let myself get worked <b>up</b> <b>thinking</b> about that game. I don't want to take a chance of being unprepared for any of the first 11 games. The week that game gets here, it will be my primary focus."

500|$|Reacting to The Killing Joke and Barbara Gordon's later {{character}} development as Oracle in Batman: Gotham Knights, Ray Tate, a reviewer at Comics Bulletin, wrote [...] "here {{is absolutely no}} reason why Barbara Gordon {{should be in a}} wheelchair. Alan Moore and Brian Bolland meant The Killing Joke as an imaginary tale dealing with the iconography of Batman and the Joker... himself is a certifiable genius in biochemistry. There are countless examples of Batman employing that which is only theoretical in his fight against crime. His knowledge of stem cell technology should surpass that of the real world. There is simply no reason for Barbara Gordon to be confined to that wheelchair." [...] Regarding her representation as a character living with a disability, and her effectiveness as a hero compared to her incarnation as Batgirl, Tate asserts [...] "t's ridiculous to think somebody wakes <b>up</b> <b>thinking</b> how lucky they are to be confined to a wheelchair, and yet the attitude around DC and among the fans is that Oracle is the better character over Batgirl because of her handicap. Rubbish. Batgirl has fought more crime and done more to aid Batman as Batgirl than she has as Oracle. Batgirl has saved Batman's life on numerous occasions. Oracle has not. Barbara in this incarnation is not a bad character, but she is not better because she no longer hunts the night in cape and cowl." [...] In an article for Bitch magazine entitled [...] "The Cold Shoulder: Saving Superheroines from Comic-book Violence", Shannon Cochran noted a long history of inequality regarding the treatment of female heroes. She quotes Gail Simone, who discussed the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis: [...] "Both had their backs broken [...] Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.” ...|$|E

The camp, which lasted for four days, involved children from Bethlehem, Ramallah, East Jerusalem, Tulkarem, Jericho, and Jenin. The Israeli children involved were mostly those who came from severe poverty and violent backgrounds. Joint-organizer Osnat Youdkevitch remarked that, [...] "Our message is that of dignity for all human beings.

2500|$|The {{developmental}} feminist {{perspective is}} {{closely tied to}} the social constructionist perspective. It is specifically interested in how society's gender norms affect adolescent development, especially for girls. For example, some researchers on the topic hold the view that adolescent girls are still strongly affected by gender roles imposed on them by society and that this in turn affects their sexuality and sexual behavior. Deborah Tolman is an advocate for this viewpoint and states that societal pressures to be [...] "good" [...] cause girls {{to pay more attention to}} what they think others expect of them than looking within themselves to understand their own sexuality. Tolman states that young girls learn to objectify their own bodies and end <b>up</b> <b>thinking</b> of themselves as objects of desire. This causes them to often see their own bodies as others see it, which causes them to feel a sense of detachment from their bodies and their sexualities. Tolman calls this a process of disembodiment. This process leaves young girls unassertive about their own sexual desires and needs because they focus so much on what other people expect of them rather than on what they feel inside.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), chapter [...] Judah left his {{brothers}} {{to live near}} an Adullamite named Hirah. Judah married {{the daughter of a}} Canaanite named Shua and had three sons named Er, Onan, and Shelah. Judah arranged for Er to marry a woman named Tamar, but Er was wicked and God killed him. Judah directed Onan to perform a brother's duty and have children with Tamar in Er's name. But Onan knew that the children would not be counted as his, so he spilled his seed, and God killed him as well. Then Judah told Tamar to remain a widow in his house until Shelah could grown <b>up,</b> <b>thinking</b> that if Tamar wed Shelah, he might also die. Later, when Judah's wife died, he went with his friend Hirah to his sheep-shearers at Timnah. When Tamar learned that Judah had gone to Timnah, she took off her widow's garments and put on a veil and sat on the road to Timnah, for she saw that Shelah had grown up and Judah had not given her to be his wife. Judah took her for a harlot, offered her a young goat for her services, and gave her his signet and staff as a pledge for payment, and they cohabited and she conceived. Judah sent Hirah to deliver the young goat and collect his pledge, but he asked about and did not find her. When Hirah reported to Judah that the men of the place said that there had been no harlot there, Judah put the matter to rest {{so as not to be}} put to shame. About three months later, Judah heard that Tamar had played the harlot and become pregnant, and he ordered her to be brought forth and burned. When they seized her, she sent Judah the pledge to identify, saying that she was pregnant by the man whose things they were. Judah acknowledged them and said that she was more righteous than he, inasmuch as he had failed to give her to Shelah. When Tamar delivered, one twin – whom she would name Zerah – put out a hand and the midwife bound it with a scarlet thread, but then he drew it back and his brother – whom she would name Perez – came out.
