40|$|<b>UV</b> <b>cured</b> {{coatings}} attract {{considerable attention}} in science, technology and in industry, such as automotive, architectural and packaging. Main benefits of UV coatings compared to coatings obtained using other energy sources are their environmentally friendly nature, shorter curing time, presumably lower energy consumption, longer pot life and other [1 - 2]. Despite some challenges related to <b>UV</b> <b>cured</b> coatings that need further investigation and new solutions, the market of <b>UV</b> <b>cured</b> coatings is growing. For optimisation of a composition for <b>UV</b> <b>cured</b> coatings, {{it is of}} interest to investigate the effect of reactive diluents on the structure and properties of the coatings. To tune the performance of <b>UV</b> <b>cured</b> coatings based on polyurethane oligomers, the structure and properties of the coatings were modified by altering the amount and functionality of acrylic reactive diluents, without changing the nature of oligomers. The proposed approach of modifying the coating structure affecting the mechanical properties, rheological behaviour and adhesion of the coatings has benefits due to a possibility of maintaining {{the advantages of the}} selected chemical structure of the oligomer. The effect of a composition of two-/three-functional low-molecular weight reactive diluents on the curing kinetics, rheological behaviour, mechanical properties and adhesion of <b>UV</b> <b>cured</b> coatings applied on polymer substrates has been systematically investigated. The changes in the properties are related to alterations in the curing process and {{in the structure of the}} coatings. Traditionally, except for only a few approaches described in the literature [3 - 4], monomers are used in compositions for UV coatings mainly for improvement of the technological characteristics of the coating application, related, mainly, to their rheological behaviour. New findings demonstrate, in addition to an exponential decrease in viscosity and a proportional growth of enthalpy of the exothermic photopolymerization reaction during coating formation, alterations in other coating properties with increasing content of a reactive diluent. Changing monomer contents leads to alterations in the coating structure, a gradual increase of the glass transition temperature and changes in elasticity and other mechanical properties of the coatings. This corresponds to a gradual improvement of coating adhesion to a polymer substrate. The relation between the rheological behaviour, mechanical properties and adhesion of coatings has been demonstrated. Based on the results of the study, the desired properties of UV coatings can be modelled and controlled without changing the nature of a particularly selected oligomer, thus maintaining its benefits in a coating composition...|$|R

40|$|The Phase-II upgrade of the ATLAS {{detector}} for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) {{includes the}} replacement of the current Inner Detector with an all-silicon tracker consisting of pixel and strip detectors. The current Phase-II detector layout requires the construction of 20, 000 strip detector modules consisting of sensor, circuit boards and readout chips, which are connected mechanically using adhesives. The adhesive between readout chips and circuit board is a silver epoxy glue as was used in the current ATLAS SemiConductor Tracker (SCT). This glue has several disadvantages, which motivated the search for an alternative. This paper presents a study concerning the use of six ultra-violet (<b>UV)</b> <b>cure</b> glues and a glue pad for use in the assembly of silicon strip detector modules for the ATLAS upgrade.
