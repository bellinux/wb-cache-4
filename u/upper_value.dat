Many researchers have discussed statistical inference about the parameters in EP distribution using i. i. d random samples.

We estimated two parameters of the EP distribution by MLE using <b>upper</b> record <b>values.</b> According to simulation study, we used the Bias and MSE of the estimators for studying the efficiency of the proposed estimation method.

40|$|Abstract. The {{predominance}} of multicore processors {{has increased the}} inter-est in developing parallel Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers. As a result, more parallel SAT solvers are emerging. Even though parallel approaches are known to boost performance, parallel approaches developed for Boolean optimization are scarce. This paper proposes parallel search algorithms for Boolean optimiza-tion and introduces a new parallel solver for Boolean optimization problem in-stances. Using two threads, an unsatisfiability-based algorithm is used to search on the lower bound value of the objective function, {{while at the same}} time a linear search is performed on the <b>upper</b> bound <b>value</b> of the objective function. Searching in both directions and exchanging learned clauses between these two orthogonal approaches makes the search more efficient. This idea is further extended for a larger number of threads by dividing the search space considering different local <b>upper</b> <b>values</b> of the objective function. The parallel search on different local up-per values leads to constant updates on the lower and <b>upper</b> bound <b>values,</b> which result in reducing the search space. Moreover, different search strategies are per-formed on the <b>upper</b> bound <b>value,</b> increasing the diversification of the search. ...|$|R
40|$|We develop {{here the}} Stochastic Perron Method in the {{framework}} of two-player zero-sum differential games. We consider the formulation of the game where both players play, symmetrically, feed-back strategies (as in [CR 09] or [PZ 12]) as opposed to the Elliott-Kalton formulation prevalent in the literature. The class of feed-back strategies we use is carefully chosen so that the state equation admits strong solutions and the technicalities involved in the Stochastic Perron Method carry through in a rather simple way. More precisely, we define the game over elementary strategies, which are well motivated by intuition. Within this framework, the Stochastic Perron Method produces a viscosity sub-solution of the upper Isaacs equation dominating the <b>upper</b> <b>value</b> of the game, and a viscosity super-solution of the upper Isaacs equation lying below the <b>upper</b> <b>value</b> of the game. Using a viscosity comparison result we obtain that the <b>upper</b> <b>value</b> is the unique and continuous viscosity solution of the upper Isaacs equation. An identical statement holds for the lower value and lower Isaacs equation. A version of the Dynamic Programming Principle is obtained as a by-product. If the Isaacs condition holds, the game has a value over elementary (pure) strategies. Comment: to appear in SIAM Journal on Control and Optimizatio...|$|E

To get around the new difficulty, a subtle dynamic programming argument is developed to obtain the time continuity, which in return is used to derive the DDP for random intermediate times from the DDP with deterministic intermediate times.
