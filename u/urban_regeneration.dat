5|$|Central Salford is {{the eastern}} part of the {{district}} and comprises seven wards: Broughton, Claremont, Irwell Riverside, Kersal, Ordsall, Langworthy and Weaste & Seedley. This is the more urban half of the district and lies partly within the Manchester Inner Ring Road. Salford Quays lies within this area. Between 2005 and 2011, the Central Salford <b>Urban</b> <b>Regeneration</b> Company was responsible for <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> in this area, securing over £1 billion of private sector investment. Social housing is provided by Salix Homes in this area.|$|E

5|$|Smithfield Market, a Grade II listed-covered market building, was {{designed}} by Victorian architect Sir Horace Jones {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, and is the dominant architectural feature of the area. Some of its original market premises fell into disuse in the late 20th century and faced the prospect of demolition. The Corporation of London's public enquiry in 2012 drew widespread support for an <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> plan intent upon preserving Smithfield's historical identity.|$|E
5|$|The next {{plan for}} the Channel Tunnel Rail Link {{involved}} a tunnel reaching London from the south-east, and an underground terminus {{in the vicinity of}} King's Cross station. A late change in the plans, principally driven by the then Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine's desire for <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> in east London, led to a change of route, with the new line approaching London from the east. This opened the possibility of reusing the underused St Pancras station as the terminus, with access via the North London Line that crosses the throat of the station.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss three {{different}} case studies related to the use of 3 D visualisation for projects focussing on <b>urban</b> development, <b>regeneration,</b> and Smart City demonstrations. With each of the case studies, the problem statement, the approach adopted for 3 D visualisation, and the outcome is covered. The paper concludes by discussing what 3 D visualisation offered to each project. The paper discusses how in order to effectively use 3 D visualisation the approach needs to be adapted according to the problem statement. Depending on the project requirement, 3 D visualisation is likely to serve multiple purposes in <b>urban</b> development, <b>regeneration,</b> and Smart City demonstration projects. The paper suggests that the use of 3 D visualisation adds an extra dimension to presenting data and also provides an effective tool for analysing the data. ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> company Clydebank Re-Built {{started a}} £3.75m {{restoration}} project in 2005, and the crane {{opened to the}} public in August 2007. The structure was shot-blasted to remove old paint and rust, allowing repairs to be undertaken before repainting.

As part of this he took a role in Europe's largest <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> project, proposing a mix of redevelopment and conservation of existing buildings, using this mixed method to create a design guide for the regeneration of the Isle of Dogs. In this position he also campaigned for the Docklands Light Railway and oversaw the exterior refurbishment of St George in the East.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to analyze how {{residents}} in the Ferencváros district of Budapest, Hungary and the Södermalm district of Stockholm, Sweden experience the <b>urban</b> <b>regenerations</b> in the area, which have caused gentrification. The theory is that gentrification is an effect of regeneration, and {{may be perceived as}} positive or negative to a different degree. The areas of research are defined as having similar relative geographic positions and have both been affected by gentrification. The research questions are about emotions of change, perceived authenticity and engagement for the areas. The main method is in-depth interviews with residents and businessmen in the areas. Also concrete renewal policies and economic indicators are presented shortly. The results show that the respondents in Ferencváros are generally more positive towards the changes. The emotions of authenticity and engagement are slightly stronger in Södermalm. The conclusion of the thesis is that gentrification is at a later phase in Södermalm, than in Ferencváros. Ferencváros has also been more unevenly affected by gentrification...|$|R

40|$|Since the LUR of Piedmont (1977), which {{strengthened}} the quantitative importance of standards {{compared to what}} has been set up by national urban reform attempts, recent debates have highlighted the necessity to rethink <b>urban</b> development through <b>regeneration</b> processes of the consolidated city, including a new interpretation of qualitative standards. In this perspective, a key role is the one led by ecosystem services, whose introduction into <b>urban</b> planning <b>regeneration</b> project/process can represent an important opportunity for a paradigm shift from quantity to quality. Rethinking standards with a qualitative approach can therefore be considered as an anticipation of an overall revision of the plan. The case study of Venaria Reale, through its recent variants of PRG and the environmental compensations plan of Stura river, can be an opportunity to test this change of approach in redesigning the public city...|$|R
5|$|During {{the last}} ten years the city has {{experienced}} an economic, cultural and urban boom. The large growth in population has significantly increased the need for new accommodation, and new districts of the city were established at a quick pace. This strained Jordan's scarce water supply and exposed Amman to the dangers of quick expansion without careful municipal planning. Today, Amman is known as a modern, liberal and westernized Arab city, with major mega projects such as the Abdali <b>Urban</b> <b>Regeneration</b> Project and the Jordan Gate Towers. The city contains several high-end hotel franchises including the Four Seasons Hotel Amman, Sheraton Hotel Amman, Fairmont Amman, St. Regis Hotel Amman, Le Royal Hotel and others.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} {{increasing}} attempts to preserve {{much of what}} survives from Scotland's architectural heritage, including the great buildings and monuments, and the classically influenced houses of towns such as Edinburgh and Glasgow. There have also been attempts at preserving the surviving Glasgow tenements, {{many of which have}} been renovated, restored to their original pink and honeyed sandstone from the black fronts created by pollution and brought up to modern standards of accommodation. <b>Urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> has also been attempted in areas of post-industrial decline, such as the Merchant City in Glasgow, which was returned to housing from the 1980s, with warehouse loft conversions and more recently the waterfront in Edinburgh, resulting in a return of resident populations to major urban centres.|$|E
5|$|Abdali <b>Urban</b> <b>Regeneration</b> Project in Abdali {{district}} {{will host}} a mall, a boulevard along with several hotels, commercial and residential towers. Valued at more than US $5 billion, the Abdali project will create a new visible centre for Amman and act as the major business district for the city. The first phase contains about ten towers, five of which are under construction {{to be completed by}} 2016. Abdali is being developed as a smart city centre that enables the deliverance of state-of-the-art technologies to every home, office and outlet, while offering district energy solutions and central gas systems to guarantee a safe and friendly environment in addition to the large savings in energy cost. Across 30,000 square meters of land, a central dynamic park is the main feature of phase II which will serve as a focal theme for mainly residential, office, hotel and retail developments over 800,000 square meters.|$|E

40|$|I see Richard Rogers had a {{piece in}} the Evening Standard last night calling for a greater focus on design and {{brownfield}} as the means of solving London's housing crisis. I confess to being deeply puzzled. In 1999 the Urban Task Force (chaired by Richard Rogers) advocated precisely this solution. The report received cross-party support and underpinned Labour's approach to <b>urban</b> and <b>regeneration</b> policy. For example, Labour introduced a 60 % target for the proportion of development that should occur on brownfield land. Unlike most housing targets, this one was actually met with many Local Authorities achieving considerably higher proportions of development on existing sites...|$|R
5|$|After the Second World War, brutalist {{tower blocks}} were adopted as a {{solution}} and this period saw the building of new towns, including Glenrothes and Cumbernauld, but the social and building problems of these constructions soon became apparent. The creation of new towns and council house estates necessitated the rapid supply of new churches. From the 1980s Scottish architecture began to recover its reputation, with new buildings like that created to house the Burrell Collection in Glasgow and more recently the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. There has also been <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration,</b> involving the replacement and renovation of existing buildings and landscapes. The 1980s saw the growth of speculative house building by developers {{and the introduction of}} English brick and half-timbered vernacular styles to Scotland. As the production of state sponsored housing subsided in the 1970s there was a return to conservatism in church design, but there were some original and post-modern designs from the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Manchester {{hosted the}} 2002 Commonwealth Games which was, {{at a cost}} of £200M for the {{sporting}} facilities and a further £470M for local infrastructure, by far the biggest and most expensive sporting event held in the UK and the first to {{be an integral part of}} <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration.</b> A mix of new and existing facilities were used. New amenities included the Manchester Aquatics Centre, Bolton Arena, the National Squash Centre, and the City of Manchester Stadium. The Manchester Velodrome was built as part of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. After the Commonwealth Games the City of Manchester Stadium was converted for football use, and the adjacent warm-up track upgraded to become the Manchester Regional Arena. Other facilities continue to be used by elite athletes. Cambridge Policy Consultants estimate 4,500full-time jobs as a direct consequence, and Grattan points to other long-term benefits accruing from publicity and the improvement of the area's image.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} leisure {{facility in}} Felling is the Gateshead International Stadium. The original stadium was opened in 1955, on land reclaimed from chemical dereliction {{and at a}} cost of £30,000, by Jim Peters and contained a running and cycling track. The stadium was fitted with a synthetic running track in 1974 and was subject to major expansion in the 1980s, when football, rugby and hockey pitches were added along with an indoor sports hall and weights room. Said to have been the original driver of <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> in Gateshead, the venue has hosted various world class athletics events, including the European Cup in 1989 and 2000 and also the British Grand Prix, a Diamond League meet, between 2008–10. Two sporting clubs are currently based at the stadium. These are Gateshead Harriers, an athletic club who count the present triple jump world record holder Jonathan Edwards in their past alumni, and also Gateshead F.C. who currently play in the Conference National.|$|E

5|$|URBED (the Urban and Economic Development Group), a not-for-profit <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> consultancy, {{designed}} and developed the {{master plan for}} the scheme {{on behalf of the}} New England Consortium. This is a group of companies and interested parties which together have the overall responsibility for the scheme, including Network Rail Infrastructure Ltd, J. Sainsbury Developments Ltd and Quintain Estates and Development (QED). The land was originally owned by British Rail, but passed to Railtrack when the railway system was privatised in the mid-1990s. It was sold to the New England Consortium in 1997. An initial planning application, including a new Sainsbury's supermarket, was rejected by the council in November 1997; the rejection was subsequently upheld on appeal in September 1998. URBED were then asked to develop a new master plan for the site. This design statement was published in July 2001, and was granted planning permission by Brighton & Hove City Council at the end of 2002. Construction work on the site began on 19 July 2004.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for <b>urban</b> <b>regeneration</b> gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and an escape from the overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E
