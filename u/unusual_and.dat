5|$|Another {{factor in}} the Mellotron's sound is that the {{individual}} notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was <b>unusual,</b> <b>and</b> meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kirby refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass. According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains {{the sound of a}} chair being scraped in the background.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{are known}} to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other {{research}} indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the <b>unusual,</b> <b>and</b> become highly neophobic.|$|E

5|$|In 1129–30, Basset {{served as}} sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, and Surrey {{together}} with Aubrey de Vere II. The number of shrievalties was <b>unusual,</b> <b>and</b> is {{known from the}} Pipe Roll of 1130. According to the entries in the Pipe Roll, de Vere and Basset did not function as traditional sheriffs, farming the revenues, but were instead responsible for the entire royal revenue in those counties.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus forms {{part of an}} <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> highly {{regarded}} dish in North America, being one of several species parasitized by the lobster mushroom Hypomyces lactifluorum. Once colonized by the parasite, an orange-red crust forms {{over the surface of}} the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the parasite infiltrates its host's tissues. It is also a common source of food among red squirrels.|$|E
5|$|Legislators found {{themselves}} in an <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> uncomfortable situation. Nuclear weapons were terrifying, {{and the nature of}} nuclear energy was not widely understood. Because it was so new, there were no policies or precedents to guide legislators, and traditional party alignments were absent. The scientists who had developed the new technology had never been vocal before, but suddenly were now. The victorious conclusion of World War II gave the armed forces enormous prestige, but there still remained the long-standing American distrust of standing armies, and the tradition of civilian control of the military.|$|E

5|$|The {{hermeneutic}} {{style is}} {{a style of}} Latin in the later Roman and early Medieval periods characterised by the extensive use of <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> arcane words, especially derived from Greek. The style is first found {{in the work of}} Apuleius in the second century, and then in several late Roman writers. In the early medieval period, some leading Continental scholars were exponents, including Johannes Scotus Eriugena and Odo of Cluny.|$|E
5|$|Together {{with the}} north and south wall, the {{entrance}} of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.|$|E
5|$|Although Hurricane Marco {{never made}} landfall, {{it was a}} large storm with an <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> erratic path and as a result, caused heavy {{rainfall}} throughout Central America and the western Caribbean nations. In the Dominican Republic, three people drowned north of Santo Domingo, while 200families fled their homes during the flooding. Marco also contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica, which had already caused a total of $3million in damage to roads and left 170families without shelter. After significant damage from Hurricane Lili in the previous month, minimal effects occurred in Cuba. Large amounts of precipitation also fell across Cuba, especially on the Isle of Youth and in Pinar del Río Province. Heavy rains caused thousands to flee their homes. However, damage in the country, if any is unknown.|$|E

5|$|As in most Mario series games, {{the main}} protagonist is Mario, whose initial {{goal is to}} rescue Princess Peach (Toadstool) from Bowser. However, the story takes on an <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> very {{important}} twist. Soon {{after the start of}} his journey, the Smithy Gang invades the world. While attempting to stop the group, Mario is joined by Mallow, a cloud boy who thinks he is a tadpole; Geno, a doll possessed by a celestial spirit from the Star Road; Bowser, whose armies have deserted him out of fear of the Smithy Gang; and Princess Toadstool, who was lost in the turmoil that occurred when the Smithy Gang arrived. The Smithy Gang is led by Smithy, a robotic blacksmith from an alternate dimension with aspirations of world domination.|$|E
5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two gutters within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Doria was an <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> erratic {{hurricane}} {{that existed}} during September 1967. The fourth named storm and hurricane of the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season, Doria developed on September 8 off {{the east coast}} of Florida. It meandered until attaining tropical storm status, at which point the storm accelerated towards the northeast. On September 10, Doria intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. After moving out to sea, the storm turned westward towards the United States. A compact cyclone, Doria weakened to a tropical storm shortly before moving ashore in the Mid-Atlantic States. The storm ultimately dissipated on September 21.|$|E

5|$|Ice {{houses were}} also {{built in the}} major ice {{consuming}} cities to hold the imported ice before final sale and consumption, where they were often termed depots. In London, the early ice depots were often circular and called wells or shades; the New Cattle Market depot built in 1871 was 42 feet (13 m) wide and 72 feet (22 m) deep, able to hold 3,000 short tons (three million kg) of ice. Later ice depots at Shadwell and Kings Cross in London were larger still, and, along with incoming barges, were used for storing Norwegian ice. The city of New York was <b>unusual</b> <b>and</b> did not build ice depots near the ports, instead using the incoming barges and, on occasion, ships that were delivering the ice as floating warehouses until the ice was needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1308, Edward's {{marriage}} to Isabella of France proceeded. Edward crossed the English Channel to France in January, leaving Gaveston as his custos regni {{in charge of}} the kingdom in his absence. This arrangement was <b>unusual,</b> <b>and</b> involved unprecedented powers being delegated to Gaveston, backed by a specially engraved Great Seal. Edward probably hoped that the marriage would strengthen his position in Gascony and bring him much needed funds. The final negotiations, however, proved challenging: Edward and Philip IV did not like each other, and the French King drove a hard bargain over the size of Isabella's dower and the details of the administration of Edward's lands in France. As part of the agreement, Edward gave homage to Philip for the Duchy of Aquitaine and agreed to a commission to complete the implementation of the 1303 Treaty of Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 {{scientists}} {{preparing the}} skins of the hooded pitohui for museum collections experienced numbness and burning when handling them. It {{was reported in}} 1992 that this species and two other pitohuis contained a neurotoxin called homobatrachotoxin, a derivative of batrachotoxin, in their tissues. This made them the first documented poisonous birds, other than some reports of coturnism caused by consuming quails (although toxicity in quails is <b>unusual),</b> <b>and</b> the first bird discovered with toxins in the skin. The same toxin had previously only been found in Colombian poison dart frogs from the genus Phyllobates (family Dendrobatidae). The batrachotoxin family of compounds are the most toxic compounds by weight in nature, being 250 times more toxic than strychnine. Later research found that the hooded pitohui had other batrachotoxins in its skin, including batrachotoxinin-A cis-crotonate, batrachotoxinin-A and batrachotoxinin-A 3′-hydroxypentanoate.|$|E
