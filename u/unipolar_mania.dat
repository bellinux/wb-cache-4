40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the rate of <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> and compare its characteristics {{with those of other}} bipolar affective disorders in a psychiatric hospital in the Fiji Islands. Fifty-one patients with <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> seen between January 1999 and October 2000, had their diagnosis confirmed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry and the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th edition. Their demographic and clinical characteristics were compared with those of 31 manic-depressive patients seen during the period under review. <b>Unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> constituted 47. 2 % of the bipolar affective disorders in this sample. The frequency of episodes, duration of affective illness, mean age at onset, gender distribution, marital status, employment status and race were not significantly different for the unipolar manic and manic-depressive groups (p > 0. 05). Family history of major psychiatric morbidity was 9. 8 % for the unipolar manic patients and 22. 6 % for the manic-depressive group (p > 0. 05). Recurrent <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> may be considered a useful category based on its high rate, although its demographic and clinical characteristics do not clearly distinguish it from manic-depression...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Significant {{questions}} remain regarding both the incidence patterns of mood episodes in {{adolescents and young}} adults from the community and the conversion rate from unipolar to bipolar disorders.  We addressed these issues by examining data from a prospective longitudinal community study to (i) determine the cumulative incidence of mood episodes and disorders in the first three decades of life; (ii) determine the risk for first onset of depression among individuals with a previous history of hypomanic ⁄ manic episodes and vice versa; and (iii) determine the clinical and treatment characteristics of these subjects.  Methods: Using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview, clinically trained interviewers assessed mood episodes and mental disorders in 3, 021 community subjects (aged 14 – 24 at baseline and 21 – 34 at third follow-up). Results: The estimated cumulative incidence at age 33 was 2. 9 % for manic, 4. 0 % for hypomanic, 29. 4 % for major depressive, and 19. 0 % for minor depressive episodes; overall, 26. 0 % had unipolar major depression,  4. 0 % bipolar depression, 1. 5 % <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania,</b> and 3. 6 % unipolar hypomania (no major depression). Overall, 0. 6 % and 1. 8 % had unipolar mania or hypomania, respectively, without indication for even minor depression. A total of 3. 6 % of the initial unipolar major depression cases subsequently developed (hypo) mania, with particularly high rates in adolescent onset depression (> 17 years: 9 %). A total of 49. 6 % of the initial <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> cases subsequently developed major depression and 75. 6 % major or minor depression. While bipolar cases had more adverse clinical and course depression characteristics and higher treatment rates than unipolar depressed cases, bipolar cases did not significantly differ in mania characteristics from <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> cases. Conclusions: Unipolar and bipolar mood disorders are more frequent than previously thought in adolescence and young adulthood, a time period when both the recognition and the intervention rates by the healthcare system are rather low. 'Conversion' to bipolar disorder is limited in initial unipolar depression, but common in initial <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania.</b> The remaining <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> cases appear to be significant in terms of clinical and course characteristics and thus require more research attention to replicate these findings...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{published}} {{data and}} treatment guidelines have created {{uncertainty about the}} use of lamotrigine in affective disorders, especially in acute bipolar depression. Furthermore, unpublished data on lamotrigine in <b>mania,</b> mixed episodes, <b>unipolar</b> depression and rapid cycling are still waiting to be integrated into the literature. Therefore, we critically reviewed the position of lamotrigine in the acute and long-term treatment of affective disorders. Studies were identified by searching English language articles published in MEDLINE using the key words: lamotrigine, bipolar depression, <b>unipolar</b> depression, <b>mania,</b> mixed episode, long-term treatment, rapid-cycling. Results of unpublished trials were obtained from the GlaxoSmithKline website. Lamotrigine showed efficacy in the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder, more so in depressive than manic episodes. There was no evidence of effectiveness in the acute treatment of <b>mania,</b> mixed episodes, <b>unipolar</b> depression or rapid-cycling bipolar I disorder. Its effect in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is at most small. Based on current evidence, lamotrigine is indicated for the prophylaxis of bipolar disorder with predominantly depressive episodes. Its effectiveness in the acute treatment of bipolar depression is open to debate, and practical considerations limit its usefulness here. There are no grounds for recommending its use in manic or mixed states, in rapidly-cycling bipolar I or in unipolar depression...|$|R
40|$|Bipolar {{disorders}} {{are characterized by}} the spontaneous, recurrent alternation of episodes of mania and depression. To investigate the type of mechanism capable of accounting for the cyclical nature of the manic depressive illness, we recently proposed a minimal model for bipolar disorders {{based on the assumption}} that the propensities to mania and depression are governed by the activities of 2 putative neural circuits that inhibit each other. When mutual inhibition is sufficiently strong, the model predicts bistability: the bipolar system is then in a stable state corresponding either to <b>unipolar</b> depression or <b>mania,</b> and can display abrupt switches between these states. To account for the cyclical nature of bipolar disorders 2 simple, additional regulations allow the model to pass from bistability to oscillations. Self-sustained oscillations provide a mechanism for the spontaneous, recurrent switching between mania and depression. The model can generate oscillations with a variety of waveforms, including periodic oscillations with comparable or unequal durations of the manic and depressive episodes, or small-amplitude oscillations around one of the 2 states preceding large-amplitude periodic changes in the propensities to mania or depression, with phases during which these propensities reach intermediate levels, a situation that could correspond to mixed bipolar states. Oscillations become irregular when fluctuations of parameter values are taken into account. The model provides a theoretical framework that covers the bipolar spectrum, i. e. cycling between the 2 poles of the disease, or evolution to a stable steady state corresponding to various degrees of <b>unipolar</b> depression or <b>mania</b> or to a "normal" state in which the -propensities to mania or depression remain low, without alternation between the 2 poles of the disease. The computational approach may help the exploration of plausible mechanisms for bipolar disorders and possible dynamic bases for clinical observations on the effect of antidepressants, which can trigger the transition to mania or increase the frequency of bipolar cycling. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.

30|$|Compared {{to major}} depression, <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> is rare, and {{research}} on the disorder is consequently rather scanty.

Most clinical studies dealt with retrospective data and the transcultural findings were sometimes contradictory. Nonetheless, a considerable body of evidence (including epidemiological, clinical, treatment, cardiovascular, and genetic studies) points to the existence of mania as a separate entity (Angst and Grobler 2015). That review, which followed on from the revived interest in the subject, stressed the need for long-term prospective studies and concluded that <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> exists and that subjects with three or more manic episodes without major depressive episodes (MDE) show a good diagnostic stability.|$|E
40|$|AbstractLithium is an {{integral}} drug used {{in the management of}} acute <b>mania,</b> <b>unipolar</b> and bipolar depression and prophylaxis of bipolar disorders. It has also been shown to reduce suicidal risk and short term mortality. Few experimental studies have demonstrated the thyroid toxicity caused by lithium as well as the possible protective effect of curcumin. Twenty four male albino rats were divided into three groups; group I (control group), group II received lithium carbonate daily for 6 weeks and group III received the same dose of lithium carbonate as group II concomitantly with curcumin for 6 weeks. The specimens were prepared for histopathological, immunohistochemical and biochemical examination. Lithium-induced thyroid dysfunction evidenced by the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes represented by detached cells and vacuolated cytoplasm of some follicular cells and highly significant increase in positive immunostained of thyroglobulin and caspase- 3 respectively. Moreover, a significant decrease in serum free triiodothyonine (FT 3), free thyroxine (FT 4) concomitant with significantly increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and thyroid lipid peroxidation (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) levels. Curcumin counteracted lithium-induced oxidative stress and inflammation as assessed by restoration of the antioxidant defenses and diminishing of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improvements in the degenerative changes of the thyroid gland. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that curcumin exerts thyroprotective effects against lithium carbonate mediated by its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effect as indicated by caspase- 3. This report also confers that the use of this drug should be justified for long treatment under direct medical supervision...|$|R

Although UM does not have significant differences from bipolar mania in terms of sociodemographic variables, there are certain significant differences in clinical features. UM is reported to have more grandiosity, psychotic symptoms, and premorbid hyperthymic temperament, but less rapid cycling, suicidality, seasonality, and comorbid anxiety disorders. It seems to have a better course of illness with better social and professional adjustment. However, its response to lithium prophylaxis is found to be poor as compared to classical BD and valproate could be a better choice in this case. Conclusion. The available literature suggests that UM has certain differences from classical BD. The evidence, however, is insufficient to categorize it as separate diagnostic entity.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} some recent {{developments}} in the official diagnostic definitions (DSM- 5) and in the research domain. The spectrum concept of mood disorders consists {{of the components of}} depression and mania, alone or in combination, on a continuum. Its international operational classification changes regularly, being based on symptoms, their duration and consequences. Causation is as yet unknown. DSM- 5 excludes <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> and mania with mild depression as separate diagnoses (they come under bipolar I and bipolar II disorders) and introduces a new hierarchy of manic symptoms, placing energy/activity above mood (elated, irritable). This is shown to be problematic on the basis of recent data. The validity of the duration criteria for mania (1 week), hypomania (4 days) and depression (2 weeks) is also seriously questioned. Shorter episodes are clinically very relevant. The definition of mania/hypomania is a persistent problem, contributing to frequent un- derdiagnosis of bipolar disorder in depressed patients. Other contributory factors include that patients often do not feel ill or seek treatment for the consequences of their high mood, and that hypomania can be hidden by substance use disorders (SUD). Hidden hypomanic syndromes are important because associated with treatment resistance, high comorbidity with anxiety/panic and SUD, psychotic and cognitive symptoms, dementia and higher mortality. Anxiety, too, is doubtless a mood disorder but there is still no concept which integrates anxiety with bipolar disorder and depression. Classification involves the definition of artificial subgroups and is necessary for treatment and communication but clinicians, when in doubt, ( [...] .) ...|$|E
40|$|Twelve {{unipolar}} manics {{satisfying the}} inclusion criteria of having had three episodes of mania without a depressive episode were compared against bipolar manics on clinical psychopathology, demographic variables and {{family history of}} psychiatric morbidity. We Found no {{differences between the two}} groups on any of the variables studied and concluded that <b>unipolar</b> <b>mania</b> is clinically homogenous with bipolar manic depressive illness. Of late, there are reports of patients who seem to suffer only from recurrent manic episodes (Winokur et al 1969, Abrams and Taylor 1974, Abrams et al 1979). However, according to Perris (1982) this type is rare, having occured only in seventeen cases (1. 1 %) in a total of 1539 patients. Venkoba Rao et al (1982) noted that three (2. 7 %) out of 108 lithium clinic patients had recurrent manic episodes. Similar observations have been recorded by other investigators in India (Tandon et al 1981, Kuruvilla et al 1983). Abrams and Taylor (1974) in their study of fifty manic probands observed that fourteen patients (28 %) never suffered a depressive episode. In their study, unipolars typically had a later age of onset than bipolar manics. Nurnberger et al (1979) reported that thirty eight (15. 7 %) out of 241 lithium clinic patients never had an attack of depression. The unipolar manics had a significantly lower incidence of rapid cycling and suicidal attempts. Unipolar manics were no different from the bipolar group as regards the risk of illness among first degree relatives and responses to Lithium. Abrams et al (1979) replicated their earlier study which was methodologically more refined. Patients were classified as unipolar manics if they had 2 episodes of mania without any depressive episode. They reported an excess of males among the unipolar manics and also increased morbid risk of unipolar depression in their relatives. It is apparent from the above review that a small group of patients exist who have recurrent mania without having any depressive episode. In the present study we examined the phenomenologic, demographic and family history of psychiatric morbidity for a group of unipolar as against bipolar manics...|$|E
