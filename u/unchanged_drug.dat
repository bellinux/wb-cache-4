Concentrations of the <b>unchanged</b> <b>drugs</b> in serum, measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography, were similar after oral and intravenous administration, with mean peaks of 9. 0 and 9. 4 micrograms/ml for metronidazole and 7. 5 and 10. 1 micrograms/ml for tinidazole. Concentrations of tinidazole {{were significantly higher than}} those of metronidazole from 4 h onwards after intravenous infusion, and from 3 h onwards after administration by mouth. After rectal administrations, a significant difference was seen only at 48 h. After vaginal dosing, however, concentrations of metronidazole were significantly higher than those of tinidazole between 1. 5 and 12 h. Bioavailability of either drug, calculated according to the formula (area under the curve for oral administration) /(area under the curve for infusion), was practically complete after oral administration and was poorer after rectal and especially vaginal administration. Whenever the parameters were calculable, the elimination half-life of tinidazole (range of means, 14. 0 to 14. 7 h) was significantly longer and total clearance (40. 3 to 47. 6 ml/min) was lower than the corresponding values of metronidazole (7. 9 to 8. 8 h and 71. 8 to 80. 1 ml/min, respectively) ...|$|R

40|$|Methotrexate {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used in cancer {{chemotherapy}} for variety neoplasms. It exerts its cytotoxic effect by competitively inhibiting dihydrofolat reductase, it interferes with several critical biosynthetic pathways as synthesis of DNA, RNA and proteins. MTX has been used clinically in various dose schedules. In high doses is used in the treatment of a number of pediatric and adult malignancies including acute leukemias, non Hodgkin lymphoma, osteosarcoma, head and neck carcinomas, choriocarcinoma, breast carcinoma. It is also used in low doses, for treatment of non malignant diseases such as psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and for suppression of graft-versus-host disease after transplantation. Methotrexate is the only antineoplastic for which routine pharmacokinetic monitoring is currently recommended. It has been demonstrated correlation between concentrations of MTX in plasma and clinical outcome or therapeutic effect and also ship between serum concentrations and risk of toxicity has been described. For these reasons, familiarity with the pharmacokinetic properties of MTX, especially value of clearance, is essential for clinicians involved in the care of patients receiving MTX. Renal excretion of <b>unchanged</b> <b>drugs</b> is the major route of MTX elimination. Tubular secretion and reabsorption and glomerular filtration all play a part in renal MTX elimination. The renal clearance of MTX probably depends on serum concentrations. The target of this thesis is to find an appropriate model for study of renal excretion HDMTX in vivo. We also estimated a perfusion of isolated rat kidney and liver are suitable as the models of elimination MTX in vitro. In mini pigs represents MTX renal clearance the major part of MTX plasma clearance. MTX is excreted in minipigs by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. GF correlated with pH of urine and MTX renal clearance correlated with GF. In this animal are the same mechanisms of renal excretion MTX as in man.

25|$|Celecoxib was {{the first}} {{specific}} inhibitor of COX-2 approved to treat patients with rheumatism and osteoarthritis. A study showed that the absorption rate, when given orally, is moderate, and peak plasma concentration occurs after about 2–4 hours. However, the extent of absorption is not well known. Celecoxib has the affinity to bind extensively to plasma proteins, especially to plasma albumin. It has an apparent volume of distribution (VD) of 455 +/- 166 L in humans and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) increases proportionally to increased oral doses, between 100 and 800mg. Celecoxib is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 isoenzyme to carboxylic acid and also by non-CYP-dependent glucuronidation to glucuronide metabolites. The metabolites are excreted in urine and feces, with {{a small proportion of}} <b>unchanged</b> <b>drug</b> (2%) in the urine. Its elimination half-life is about 11 hours (6–12 hours) in healthy individuals, but racial differences in drug disposition and pharmacokinetic changes in the elderly have been reported. Patients with chronic renal insufficiency appear to have 43% lower plasma concentration compared to healthy individuals, with a 47% increase in apparent clearance, and it can be expected that patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment have increased steady-state AUC.|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Obesity can {{modify the}} {{pharmacokinetics}} of lipophilic drugs. As beta-adrenoceptor blockers (BB) are often prescribed for obese patients suffering from hypertension or coronary heart disease, this study compares the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers in obese and control subjects. METHODS: Nine obese (157 +/- 24 % of ideal body weight (IBW) mean +/- s. d.) and nine non-obese healthy volunteers (98 +/- 10 % IBW), aged 32 +/- 9 years, {{were included in}} the study. Subjects were randomly given a single i. v. infusion of one of the following racemic beta-adrenoceptor blockers, whose doses (expressed as base per kg of IBW) were: propranolol (0. 108 mg), labetalol (0. 99 mg) and nebivolol (0. 073 mg). The plasma concentrations of <b>unchanged</b> <b>drugs</b> were measured by h. p. l. c. The ionisation constants and lipophilicity parameters of beta-adrenoceptor blockers were assessed. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetic data for the three drugs were qualitatively similar. There was a trend towards a greater total distribution volume (Vss) in obese patients than in controls. However, Vss expressed per kg body weight was slightly smaller in obese patients. The relationship between Vss and lipophilicity of five beta-adrenoceptor was studied by combining the current results with those previously obtained with a moderately lipophilic drug (bisoprolol) and a hydrophilic one (sotalol). The Vss of the five drugs was positively and well-correlated (r 2 = 0. 90; P < 0. 01) with their distribution coefficient at pH 7. 4 (log D 7. 4), but not with their partition coefficients. The linear regression coefficients for lean and obese subjects were very similar. CONCLUSIONS: Lipophilic beta-adrenoceptor blockers seem to diffuse less into adipose than into lean tissues. All electrical forms of the drugs (i. e. cations, neutral forms, or zwitterions) present at physiological pH contribute to their tissue distribution, in both obese and lean subjects. Their tissue distribution in obese patients could be restricted by the sum of hydrophobic forces and hydrogen bonds they elicit with macromolecules in lean tissues...|$|R
50|$|Drugs {{have been}} used for centuries. The use of drugs began to rise again in the 1980s among youth when they began to {{experiment}} with drugs like tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana.

25|$|Lumiracoxib {{is unique}} amongst the coxibs {{in being a}} weak acid. It was {{developed}} {{for the treatment of}} osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and acute pain. The acidic nature of lumiracoxib allows it to penetrate well into areas of inflammation. It has shown to be rapidly and well absorbed, with peak plasma concentration occurring in about 1–3 hours. A study showed that when a subject was given 400nbsp&mg dose, the amount of <b>unchanged</b> <b>drug</b> in the plasma 2.5 hours postdose suggest a modest first pass effect. The terminal half-life in plasma ranged from 5.4 to 8.6 hours (mean =6.5 hours). The half-life in synovial fluid is considerably longer than in plasma, and the concentration in synovial fluid 24 hours after administration would be expected to result in a substantial COX-2 inhibition. This fact can explain why some users may suffice with once-daily dosage despite a short plasma half-life. The major plasma metabolites are 5-carboxy, 4’-hydroxy, and 4’-hydroxy-5-carboxy derivatives. Lumiracoxib is extensively metabolized before it is excreted, and the excretion routes are in the urine or feces. Peak plasma concentrations exceed those necessary to maximally inhibit COX-2, and that is consistent with a longer pharmacodynamic half-life. In vitro lumiracoxib has demonstrated a greater COX-2 selectivity {{than any of the other}} coxibs.|$|E

Gastric cancer usually possesses a higher level of PKC activity than normal tissue. We evaluated inhibition of PKC activity in apoptosis induction of gastric cancer cells and the expression profile of apoptosis-related genes. Gastric cancer cells (AGS) were incubated with two highly specific PKC inhibitors (RO- 31 - 8220 and chelerythrine). Cell viability and cell cycle were determined by methyl- tetrazolium (MTT) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Apoptosis was characterized by acridine orange staining, DNA gel electrophoresis, and flow cytometry. The expression of p 53, p 21 (waf/cip 1), c-myc, bcl- 2, and bax was determined by western blot. The results showed that both PKC inhibitors hindered cell growth, arrested cells at G 0 /G 1 phase and induced apoptosis. The protein level of p 53, p 21 (waf/cip 1), c-myc, and bax was elevated while bcl- 2 kept <b>unchanged</b> following <b>drug</b> exposure.

Methods: We {{located in the}} VNS registry 269 patients treated for 1 year with no changes in AEDs. Seizure rates were calculated at 3 and 12 months. We analyzed: (1) 3 months versus 12 months seizure rates; (2) effects of changing duty cycles between 3 and 12 months; (3) effects of output current; (4) seizure rate changes associated with patient characteristics. Results: Seizure rates improved between 3 months (median=− 45 %) and 12 months (median=− 58 %) (P< 0. 0001). There were no differences between patients who stayed on standard or rapid cycling, or changed from standard to rapid. Stimulation parameters did not affect seizure rates. VNS responsiveness was associated with older age (P= 0. 016), longer duration epilepsy (P= 0. 033), and syndromes other than Lennox–Gastaut (P= 0. 003). Conclusions: This was an analysis of treatment outcomes, not a prospective clinical trial.

From the age of 4 weeks half the animals in each group were treated with a diuretic drug.

The objective {{of the current study}} was to further elucidate the metabolic pathways of lenvatinib in humans and to compare these results to the metabolism in rats and monkeys. To this end, we used plasma, urine and feces collected in a human mass balance study after a single 24  mg (100  μCi) oral dose of 14 C-lenvatinib. Metabolites of 14 C-lenvatinib were identified using liquid chromatography (high resolution) mass spectrometry with off-line radioactivity detection.

In humans, unchanged lenvatinib accounted for 97  % of the radioactivity in plasma, and comprised 0. 38 and 2. 5  % of the administered dose excreted in urine and feces, respectively. The primary biotransformation pathways of lenvatinib were hydrolysis, oxidation and hydroxylation, N-oxidation, dealkylation and glucuronidation. Various combinations of these conversions with modifications, including hydrolysis, gluthathione/cysteine conjugation, intramolecular rearrangement and dimerization, were observed. Some metabolites seem to be unique to the investigated species (human, rat, monkey).

40|$|Most {{methods used}} for the {{extraction}} of quaternary amines in biological fluids {{have been based on}} ion-pair extraction techniques. In this study, a sensitive and selective chromatographic procedure is described to measure the concentration of pyridostigmine, neostigmine and their major metabolites in the plasma and urine. The methods involve a preliminary selective ion-pair extraction of the <b>unchanged</b> <b>drugs</b> and their metabolites into dichloromethane and dichloromethane-acetone mixture respectively. Quantitation is possible down to 3 ng/ml for parent drugs and 50 ng/ml for the metabolites. The present work also described a modified procedure to measure neostigmine and pyridostigmine in plasma simultaneously, using a specially synthesized pyridostigmine analogue as a common internal marker. The plasma concentration of pyridostigmine was measured after three different doses of the quaternary amine (36. 2 Ng/kg, 72. 4 pg/kg and 144. 8) tg/kg) were given intravenously to twenty five surgical patients during anaesthesia. The relation between the plasma concentration of pyridostigmine and time was invariably expressed as a bi-exponential equation, and the data was interpreted in terms of a two compartment model. The slow disposition halflife of the drug was progressively prolonged as the dose of the drug was raised from 36. 2 Ng/kg to 144. 8 jig/kg. A similar increase in the half-life was observed in cross-over studies. The clearance of the quaternary amine was enhanced at intermediate dose (72. 4) xg/kg) but significantly reduced after high dose (144. 8 pg/kg). It was suggested that these results may partially account for the observed differences in the duration of action of neostigmine and pyridostigmine in man. The dose of pyridostigmine used to reverse non-depolarizing neuromuscular block is 4 - 5 times greater than neostigmine. After intramuscular administration of neostigmine to five myasthenic patients, the plasma concentration of the drug declined monoexponentially from 21 ± 2 no/ml to 9 t 1 ng/ml between 30 and 120 minutes and data was interpreted in terms of a one-compartment model. Estimates of the plasma half-life varied from 56. 9 - 100. 1 minutes. The oral administration of pyridostigmine alone and of both neostigmine and pyridostigmine in two different groups of myasthenic patients, were also studied. There was a direct linear relation between area, under the plasma concentration - time curve and total daily dose of pyridostigmine in the first group of patients (r = 0. 95), but no such observation was noticed in either all patients (two groups; r= 0. 15) or in the second group who were treated with both drugs (r =- 0. 08). It was suggested {{that there might be a}} drug-drug interaction between pyridostigmine and neostigmine during oral absorption. The relation between plasma levels of pyridostigmine to clinical evaluation of muscle power was examined in nine myasthenic patients during treatment with pyridostigmine in doses of 60 to 1080 mg per day. Five of the nine subjects demonstrated a trend towards a positive correlation and in two of them was this significant at pt 0. 05. In addition, the presence or absence of a possible correlation between muscle power and plasma concentration was not related to the duration of disease, additional prednisolone therapy or thymectomy...|$|R
