5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at the Ivanja Reka {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In such conditions, motorway users {{are advised to}} use the Rugvica and Ivanić Grad exits ahead of the Ivanja Reka interchange to avoid the queues. As of October 2010, the westbound transit traffic approaching the Ivanja Reka interchange must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to {{be integrated into the}} tolled motorway network as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>solution</b> for congestion at the Ivanja Reka toll plaza. That will require reconstruction of the Ivanić Grad interchange east of the Ivanja Reka toll plaza.|$|E
5|$|Summertime {{and holiday}} queues at Lučko {{mainline}} toll plaza can be considerable, a problem exacerbated during the usual weekend-to-weekend tourist stays at Croatia's coastal resorts. In 2009, {{in an effort}} to address the problem, the Lučko mainline toll plaza was expanded to 15lanes, and a single additional 10-lane toll plaza was built for fast cashless toll collection in Demerje. The Demerje toll plaza is available via a motorway fork accessible to the A1 northbound traffic only. Vehicles using the Demerje toll plaza default to the original motorway route immediately past the Lučko mainline toll plaza, between the plaza and the Lučko interchange. The faster cashless system has raised the nominal capacity of the road from 2,325 to 11,150 vehicles per hour. As of September 2010 northbound traffic leaving the A1 must exit the tolled motorway network, since the existing Zagreb bypass is not tolled, and then re-enter another tolled motorway. There are plans for the outer Zagreb bypass to be integrated into the tolled motorway network, as the <b>ultimate</b> <b>solution</b> for congestion at the Lučko toll plaza. That will require construction of a Horvati interchange south of the Lučko toll plaza.|$|E

25|$|Strangely, {{the account}} of the {{substitution}} in the Temple is well substantiated, even to the names of the substitutes. The curious imbroglio deceived royalists and republicans alike. Lady Atkyns was trying by every possible means to get the dauphin out of his prison when he was apparently already in safe hands, if not outside the Temple walls. A child was in fact delivered to her agents, but he was a deaf mute. That there was fraud, and a complicated fraud, in the guardians of the dauphin may be taken as proved by a succession of writers from 1850 onwards, and more recently by Frédéric Barbey, who wisely attempts no <b>ultimate</b> <b>solution.</b> When the partisans of Richemont or Naundorff come to the post-Temple careers of their heroes, they become in most cases so uncritical as to be unconvincing.|$|E
25|$|The guiding {{spirit in}} this anti-Prussian policy, which characterised Bavarian statesmanship {{up to the}} war of 1866, was Baron Karl Ludwig von der Pfordten (1811–1880), who became {{minister}} for foreign affairs on 19 April 1849. His idea for the <b>ultimate</b> <b>solution</b> {{of the question of}} {{the balance of power in}} Germany was the so-called Trias, i.e. a league of the Rhenish states as a counterpoise to the preponderance of Austria and Prussia. In internal affairs his ministry was characterised by a reactionary policy less severe than elsewhere in Germany, which led none-the-less from 1854 onward to a struggle with the parliament, which ended in the dismissal of Pfordten's ministry on 27 March 1859. He was succeeded by Karl Freiherr von Schrenk von Notzing (1806–1884), an official of Liberal tendencies who had been Bavarian representative in the diet of the Confederation. Important reforms were now introduced, including the separation of the judicial and executive powers and the drawing up of a new criminal code. In foreign affairs Schrenk, like his predecessor, aimed at safeguarding the independence of Bavaria, and supported the idea of superseding the actual constitution of the Confederation by a supreme directory, in which Bavaria, as leader of the purely German states, would hold the balance between Prussia and Austria. Bavaria accordingly opposed the Prussian proposals for the reorganisation of the Confederation, and one of the last acts of King Maximilian was to take a conspicuous part in the assembly of princes summoned to Frankfurt in 1863 by the emperor Francis Joseph.|$|E
