25|$|The metanephros is the definite, permanent, but yet {{immature}} kidney. It {{arises from}} two directions. On one hand, the precursor of the ureter buds from the Wolffian duct, {{while on the}} other hand, the precursor of the renal tubules develop from the metanephrogenic blastema. The <b>ureteric</b> bud subsequently grows into the latter mass, forming {{the parts of the}} nephron. Other changes include e.g. the translocation of the <b>ureteric</b> opening directly into the cloaca.|$|E
25|$|The three openings, two <b>ureteric</b> orifices, and the {{internal}} urethral orifice mark the triangular area called the trigone of the bladder. These openings have mucosal flaps {{in front of them}} that act as valves in preventing the backflow of urine into the ureters, known as vesicoureteral reflux. Between the two <b>ureteric</b> openings is a raised area of tissue called the interureteric crest. This makes the upper boundary of the trigone. The trigone is a smooth-muscle area that forms the floor of the bladder above the urethra. It is an area of smooth tissue for the easy flow of urine into and from this part of the bladder - in contrast to the irregular surface formed by the rugae.|$|E
25|$|The renal corpuscles and renal tubules, in contrast, are {{developed}} from the metanephrogenic blastema instead of from the <b>ureteric</b> bud. The metanephrogenic blastema is moulded over the growing end of the latter, and becomes {{a part of the}} metanephros in this way. The renal tubules of the metanephros, unlike those of the pronephros and mesonephros, do not open into the Wolffian duct. Instead, the tubules rapidly elongate to form the parts of the nephron: the proximal tubules, the loops of Henle and the distal convoluted tubules. These last join and establish communications with the collecting duct system derived from the ultimate ramifications of the <b>ureteric</b> bud. In the other end, the renal tubules give rise to Bowman's capsules and glomeruli.|$|E
25|$|The {{rudiments of}} the {{permanent}} kidneys make their appearance {{about the end of}} the first or the beginning of the second month. Each kidney originates as a <b>ureteric</b> bud from the caudal end of the Wolffian duct, which, in turn, originates from intermediate mesoderm. The <b>ureteric</b> bud starts close to where the Wolffian duct opens into the cloaca, and grows dorsalward and rostralward along the posterior abdominal wall, where its blind extremity expands and subsequently divides into several buds, which form the rudiments of the renal pelvis and renal calyces; by continued growth and subdivision it gives rise to the collecting duct system of the kidney. The other, more superficial, portion of the diverticulum, on the other hand, becomes the ureter.|$|E
25|$|Infrequent adverse {{reactions}} in patients taking opioids for pain relief include: dose-related respiratory depression (especially with more potent opioids), confusion, hallucinations, delirium, urticaria, hypothermia, bradycardia/tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, headache, urinary retention, <b>ureteric</b> or biliary spasm, muscle rigidity, myoclonus (with high doses), and flushing (due to histamine release, except fentanyl and remifentanil).|$|E
25|$|In healthy {{individuals}} the ureters {{enter the}} urinary bladder obliquely and run submucosally for some distance. This, {{in addition to}} the ureter's muscular attachments, helps secure and support them posteriorly. Together these features produce a valvelike effect that occludes the <b>ureteric</b> opening during storage and voiding of urine. In people with VUR, failure of this mechanism occurs, with resultant backward (retrograde) flow of urine.|$|E
2500|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} can {{be treated}} with palliative surgery (colostomy, ileostomy, or internal bypass) or medicine, but surgery {{has been shown to}} increase survival time. Palliative surgery may result in short bowel syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, or re-obstruction; or may not be possible due to the extent of obstruction. Other treatments of complications can include total parenteral nutrition, a low-residue diet, palliative gastrostomy, and adequate pain control. Bowel obstruction can also be treated with octreotide when palliative surgery is not an option. Cancer can also block the ureters, which can be relieved by a nephrostomy or a <b>ureteric</b> stent. Ascites can be relieved by repeated paracentesis or placement of a drain to increase comfort. Pleural effusions can [...] be treated in a similar manner, with repeated thoracentesis, pleurodesis, or placement of a drain.|$|E
2500|$|The {{failure of}} the metanephros to develop in cases of BRA and some cases {{involving}} unilateral renal agenesis (URA) is due primarily to the {{failure of the}} mesonephric duct to produce a <b>ureteric</b> bud capable of inducing the metanephric mesenchyme. The failed induction will thereby cause the subsequent degeneration of the metanephros by apoptosis and other mechanisms. The mesonephric duct(s) of the agenic kidney(s) will also degenerate and fail to connect with the bladder. Therefore, the means by which the fetus produces urine and transports it to the bladder for excretion into the amniotic sac has been severely compromised (in the cases of URA), or completely eliminated (in the cases of BRA). The decreased volume of amniotic fluid causes the growing fetus to become compressed by the mother's uterus. This compression can cause many physical deformities of the fetus, most common of which is Potter facies. [...] Lower extremity anomalies are frequent in these cases, which often presents with clubbed feet and/or bowing of the legs. [...] Sirenomelia, or [...] "Mermaid syndrome" [...] (which occurs approximately in 1:45,000 births) can also present. In fact, nearly all reported cases of sirenomelia also be present with BRA.|$|E
50|$|A {{functional}} obstruction at {{the lower}} end of the ureter leads to progressive dilatation and a tendency to infection. The <b>ureteric</b> orifice appears normal and a <b>ureteric</b> catheter passes easily.|$|E
5000|$|One {{example of}} this, the most well {{described}} {{of the developmental}} METs, is kidney ontogenesis. The mammalian kidney is primarily formed by two early structures: the <b>ureteric</b> bud and the nephrogenic mesenchyme, which form the collecting duct and nephrons respectively (see kidney development for more details). During kidney ontogenesis, a reciprocal induction of the <b>ureteric</b> bud epithelium and nephrogenic mesenchyme occurs. As the <b>ureteric</b> bud grows out of the Wolffian duct, the nephrogenic mesenchyme induces the <b>ureteric</b> bud to branch. Concurrently, the <b>ureteric</b> bud induces the nephrogenic mesenchyme to condense around the bud and undergo MET to form the renal epithelium, which ultimately forms the nephron. [...] Growth factors, integrins, cell adhesion molecules, and protooncogenes, such as c-ret, c-ros, and c-met, mediate the reciprocal induction in metanephrons and consequent MET.|$|E

50|$|The aim of {{treatment}} {{is to reduce}} renal scarring. Those children with grade II or worse should receive low dose prophylactic antibiotics (Nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim, cotrimoxazole, cefalexin in those with CRF). Hypertension should be managed with ACE inhibitor or ARBs. Other treatment modalities include surgery (endoscopic injection of collagen behind the intra-vesical ureter, <b>ureteric</b> re-implantation or lengthening of the submucosal <b>ureteric</b> tunnel) which has its protagonists.|$|E
50|$|Osr1 is the {{earliest}} marker of the intermediate mesoderm, which will form the gonads and kidneys. This expression {{is not essential}} {{for the formation of}} intermediate mesoderm but for the differentiation towards renal and gonadal structures.Osr1 acts upstream of and causes expression of the transcription factors Lhx1, Pax2 and Wt1 which are involved in early urogenital development. In normal kidney development, activation of the Pax2-Eya1-Hox11 complex and subsequent activation of Six2 and Gdnf expression allows for branching of the <b>ureteric</b> bud and maintenance of the nephron-forming cap mesenchyme. Six2 maintains the self-renewing state of the cap mesenchyme. and Gdnf, via the Gdnf-Ret signalling pathway, is required for attraction and branching of the growing <b>ureteric</b> bud.Within the developing kidney, Osr1 expressing cells will become mesangial cells, pericytes, <b>ureteric</b> smooth muscle and the kidney capsule. The cell types that Osr1 expressing cells will differentiate into are determined by the timing of loss of expression - cells that will become part of the vasculature or <b>ureteric</b> epithelium lose expression of Osr1 early (E8.5), and those that become nephrons lose expression later (E11.5).All three stages of kidney formation are affected in mice lacking Osr1 expression and are similar to mice with reduced Wt1 and Pax2 expression - the Wollfian duct is abnormal, there are fewer mesonephric tubules and the kidney-forming metanephros and gonads are missing. In embryonic day 10.5, embryos lacking Osr1 expression fail to grow a <b>ureteric</b> bud that migrates into the uncompacted metanephric mesenchyme. The lack of inductive signals from the <b>ureteric</b> bud combined with a downstream reduction in Pax2 expression results in apoptosis and agenesis of the kidney.|$|E

50|$|The {{system of}} tissue {{induction}} between the <b>ureteric</b> bud and the metanephric blastema is a reciprocal control system. GDNF, gonadal derived neurotrophic factor, {{is produced by}} the metanephric blastema and is essential in binding to the Ret receptor on the <b>ureteric</b> bud, which bifurcates and coalesces as a result to form the renal pelvis, major and minor calyces and collecting ducts. Mutations in the EYA1 gene, which is a GDNF transcription factor, lead to the renal abnormalities of BOR syndrome (branchio-oto-renal syndrome).|$|E

50|$|During {{the fifth}} week of gestation, the mesonephric duct {{develops}} an outpouching, the <b>ureteric</b> bud, near its {{attachment to the}} cloaca. This bud, also called the metanephrogenic diverticulum, grows posteriorly and towards {{the head of the}} embryo. The elongated stalk of the <b>ureteric</b> bud, called the metanephric duct, later forms the ureter. As the cranial end of the bud extends into the intermediate mesoderm, it undergoes a series of branchings to form the collecting duct system of the kidney. It also forms the major and minor calyces and the renal pelvis.|$|E
50|$|The metanephrogenic {{blastema}} or metanephric blastema (or metanephric mesenchyme, or metanephric mesoderm) {{is one of}} the two embryological {{structures that}} give rise to the kidney, the other being the <b>ureteric</b> bud.|$|E
50|$|The {{portion of}} {{undifferentiated}} intermediate mesoderm {{in contact with}} the tips of the branching <b>ureteric</b> bud is known as the metanephrogenic blastema. Signals released from the <b>ureteric</b> bud induce the differentiation of the metanephrogenic blastema into the renal tubules. As the renal tubules grow, they come into contact and join with connecting tubules of the collecting duct system, forming a continuous passage for flow from the renal tubule to the collecting duct. Simultaneously, precursors of vascular endothelial cells begin to take their position at the tips of the renal tubules. These cells differentiate into the cells of the definitive glomerulus.|$|E
50|$|Ureteral {{development}} {{begins in}} the human fetus around the 4th week of embryonic development. A <b>ureteric</b> bud, arising from the mesonephric (or Wolffian) duct, {{gives rise to the}} ureter, as well as other parts of the collective system. In the case of a duplicated ureter, the <b>ureteric</b> bud either splits or arises twice. In most cases, the kidney is divided into two parts, an upper and lower lobe, with some overlap due to intermingling of collecting tubules. However, in some cases the division is so complete as to give rise to two separate parts, each with its own renal pelvis and ureter.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{obstruction}} {{of the upper}} urinary tract is usually treated by the insertion of a nephrostomy tube. Chronic upper urinary tract obstruction is treated by the insertion of a <b>ureteric</b> stent or a pyeloplasty.|$|E
