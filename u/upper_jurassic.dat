25|$|<b>Upper</b> <b>Jurassic</b> Towards {{the end of}} the Jurassic {{period the}} land again sank beneath the sea.

25|$|The Northern Range {{consists}} {{mainly of}} <b>Upper</b> <b>Jurassic</b> and Cretaceous metamorphic rocks. The Northern Lowlands (East-West Corridor and Caroni Plains) consist of younger shallow marine clastic sediments.

25|$|In contrast, later palaeontinids {{like the}} <b>Upper</b> <b>Jurassic</b> Eocicada and Early Cretaceous Ilerdocossus had {{triangular}} forewings with the flexion line {{closer to the}} base. They had smaller and narrower hindwings that did not overlap with the forewing. These indicate that they were highly versatile fliers, able to fly {{with a wide range}} of speeds and agility like modern wasps and sphinx moths. They also possessed changes to the leading edge of their forewings, suggesting an overall gain in lift.|$|E
25|$|Hybodont teeth fossils {{are found}} in depositional environments ranging from marine to fluvial (river deposits). When they first evolved they {{inhabited}} both marine and freshwater systems. While hybodonts lived in freshwater throughout their existence, an example of hybodonts moving into more restricted conditions comes from Middle Jurassic samples found in lagoonal and other enclosed depositional settings. Teeth from seven hybodont genera were described from the freshwater Khorat Group of Thailand which is <b>Upper</b> <b>Jurassic</b> – Aptian (Lower Cretaceous) in age.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico slope {{includes a}} stratigraphic section more than 10km (6mi) thick {{and has been}} profoundly influenced by salt movement. Mesozoic source rocks from <b>Upper</b> <b>Jurassic</b> to Upper Cretaceous generate oil {{in most of the}} Gulf slope fields (Sassen et al., 1993a and b). Migration conduits supply fresh hydrocarbon materials through a vertical scale of 6–8km (4–5mi) toward the surface. The surface expressions of hydrocarbon migration are referred to as seeps. Geological evidence demonstrates that hydrocarbon and brine seepage persists in spatially discrete areas for thousands of years.|$|E

25|$|Tykoski {{and colleagues}} {{performed}} a cladistic phylogenetic analysis {{with their new}} taxon, {{and found that it}} grouped with Goniopholis, Sunosuchus, and, most closely, with Eutretauranosuchus in a weakly supported clade, Goniopholididae. They noted that the skull of Calsoyasuchus is very similar to some goniopholid skulls from the younger, <b>Upper</b> <b>Jurassic</b> Morrison Formation. Calsoyasuchus pushes back the earliest occurrence of goniopholids from the Late Jurassic into the Early Jurassic, and not only helps to bridge a temporal gap between groups of crocodyliforms, but also a morphological gap. It also implies that some groups of crocodyliforms have long undiscovered histories.|$|E
