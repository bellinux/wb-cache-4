5|$|In Virginia, the Marcellus ore {{occasionally}} contained zinc, {{which produced}} a characteristic green flame in the furnace {{as it was}} consumed, but deposited a hard mass of impure zinc oxide known as cadmia, which built up over time {{near the top of}} the flue, and had to be removed periodically to keep it <b>unobstructed.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} the same flight deck design as the 767, the 757 {{has a more}} rounded nose section than previous narrow-body aircraft. The resulting space has <b>unobstructed</b> panel visibility and room for an observer seat. Similar pilot viewing angles as the 767 result from a downward sloped cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows.|$|E
5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining <b>unobstructed</b> closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|Compared to {{standard}} telescopic sights, a reflector sight {{can be held}} at any distance from the eye (does not require a designed eye relief), and at almost any angle, without distorting {{the image of the}} target or reticle. They are often used with both eyes open (the brain will tend to automatically superimpose the illuminated reticle image coming from the dominant eye onto the other eye's <b>unobstructed</b> view), giving the shooter normal depth perception and full field of view. Since Reflector sights are not dependent on eye relief, they can theoretically be placed in any mechanically-convenient mounting position on a weapon.|$|E
5|$|Huger, {{worried about}} clashing with Union forces while marching towards Malvern Hill, had {{also failed to}} manage his {{division}} effectively. He deployed two of his brigades, commanded by Brig. Gens. Lewis Armistead and Ambrose Wright, to perform a flanking maneuver around any Federals they found, to avoid the Union threat. Longstreet eventually notified Huger {{that he would be}} <b>unobstructed</b> by Federal forces if he marched to Malvern Hill. Huger, however, remained in place until someone from Lee's headquarters came to guide them to the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, <b>unobstructed</b> by columns or walls. This design {{was accomplished by}} using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing much of the structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Dyson swarm, the {{constructs}} {{making it up}} are not in orbit around the star, but would be statites—satellites suspended by use of enormous light sails using radiation pressure to counteract the star's pull of gravity. Such constructs {{would not be in}} danger of collision or of eclipsing one another; they would be totally stationary with regard to the star, and independent of one another. Because the ratio of radiation pressure to the force of gravity from a star is constant regardless of the distance (provided the statite has an <b>unobstructed</b> line-of-sight to the surface of its star), such statites could also vary their distance from their central star.|$|E
5|$|On 25 March, the Belgo-Congolese {{battalion}} and the {{two companies}} of the 2/6 KAR occupied Gambela. Exhausted by their journey from the Congo and suffering from dysentery {{and a lack of}} artillery, the 1,000 Belgians and Congolese could undertake no further offensive action. Instead they made moves to contain the Italian forces around Saïo from the west, while British troops under General Alan Cunningham conducted operations in Somalia and eastern Ethiopia. The Arbegnoch also threatened the Italian positions. In April, Italian forces burned the elephant grass along the Saïo Plateau to ensure an <b>unobstructed</b> field of fire. That same month the troops of the 2/6th KAR were withdrawn to the Dabus River to link up with the rest of their unit to contain the Italian garrison in Mendi.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open {{at the same time}} one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly <b>unobstructed</b> view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.|$|E
5|$|Tropic Thunder held {{an early}} {{screening}} at the 2008 San Diego Comic-Con, {{two weeks before}} it officially premiered on August 11, 2008, at the Mann Village Theatre in Westwood, California and two days before its wide release. Members of several disability groups picketed before the premiere, protesting at the portrayal of mental retardation shown in the film. The groups revealed {{that it was the}} first time that they had ever protested together at an event. As a result of the protest, the normally <b>unobstructed</b> views of the red carpet leading to the premiere were blocked off by 10-foot (3-m)-high fences and there was an increase in the number of security personnel present. No protests were held at the United Kingdom's September premiere.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators {{would now be}} able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely <b>unobstructed</b> view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} breeds {{during winter}} in colonies that may include other large waterbirds {{such as the}} spot-billed pelican. The nest is a large platform of twigs placed {{at the end of}} a near-horizontal branch of a tall tree. Nests are rarely placed in forks and an <b>unobstructed</b> top canopy allows the birds to fly easily from and to the nests. In the Nagaon nesting colony in Assam, tall Alstonia scholaris and Anthocephalus cadamba were favourite nest trees. The beginning of the breeding season is marked by several birds congregating and trying to occupy a tree. While crowding at these sites, male birds mark out their nesting territories, chasing away others and frequently pointing their bill upwards while clattering them. They may also arch their body and hold their wings half open and drooped. When a female perches nearby, the male plucks fresh twigs and places it before her. The male may also grasp the tarsus of the female with the bill or hold his bill close to her in a preening gesture. A female that has paired holds the bill and head to the breast of the male and the male locks her by holding his bill over her neck. Other displays include simultaneous bill raising and lowering by a pair. The clutch, usually of three or four white eggs, is laid at intervals of one or two days and incubation begins after the first egg is laid. Both parents incubate and the eggs hatch at intervals of one or two days, each taking about 35 days from the date of laying. Adults at the nest have their legs covered with their droppings and this behaviour termed as urohidrosis is believed to aid in cooling during hot weather. Adults may also spread out their wings and shade the chicks. The chicks are fed at the nest for about five months. The chicks double in size in a week and can stand and walk on the nest platform when they are a month old. At five weeks, the juveniles leap frequently and can defend themselves. The parent birds leave the young along for longer periods at nest at this stage. The young birds leave the nest and fly around the colony when about four months but continue to be fed occasionally by the parents.|$|E

25|$|The {{stadium and}} the seating {{arrangement}} {{have been designed}} {{in such a way}} that an <b>unobstructed</b> view is assured from each location.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the one of 1939, the G59 cable car survived for seven years. In 1966, the pillars were removed to once again allow an <b>unobstructed</b> view to the Alps.|$|E
25|$|Masqueray's open design allows {{visitors}} <b>unobstructed</b> {{views of}} the altar and pulpit. Masqueray died in 1917, having completed only a few designs for the interior, which has been filled by other designers in the subsequent decades.|$|E
25|$|The current stadium design {{offers an}} <b>unobstructed</b> {{view of the}} pitch from {{all areas of the}} ground. The Milburn stand is the {{location}} of the directors box and press boxes, and the main TV camera point for televised games.|$|E
25|$|The Basilica's pews {{are made}} of rare African mahogany, and provide seating for more than 1,200 individuals. The shrine's floor and aisle are {{gradually}} sloped to ensure that visitors have an <b>unobstructed</b> view of the Basilica's main altar.|$|E
25|$|Virgen de la Paz Hermitage: {{home of the}} Virgen de la Paz hermit nuns {{that sits}} on a cliff that {{overlooking}} the mangroves and marine sanctuary in Tangnan and offers an <b>unobstructed</b> view {{of the sea and}} the blue mountains of Cebu.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{positive}} airway pressure (APAP) {{is a form}} of CPAP {{that automatically}} tunes the amount of pressure delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an <b>unobstructed</b> airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient's breathing.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{significance}} of the Voortrekker Monument and the Union Buildings in the national consciousness, a law in Pretoria limits the height of any building between the Voortrekker Monument and the Union Buildings such that the view between them remains <b>unobstructed.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{utility of}} this type of {{structure}} in buildings is that a large amount of the exterior envelope remains <b>unobstructed</b> and can be used for windows and door openings. This is preferable to a braced-frame system, which would leave some areas obstructed by the diagonal braces.|$|E
25|$|In {{many of the}} group's {{three-dimensional}} works, {{vertical and}} horizontal lines are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and <b>unobstructed</b> by other elements. This feature {{can be found in}} the Rietveld Schröder House and the Red and Blue Chair.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{also has}} other {{facilities}} including 9 tennis hard courts, 4 indoor badminton courts and an Olympic sized swimming pool. A unique {{feature of the}} stadium is the cantilever roof which {{eliminates the need for}} any supports thus providing the spectators with an <b>unobstructed</b> view of the match from any place within the stand.|$|E
25|$|Wider, American-style {{ambulances}} {{might also}} be able to straddle speed cushions. However, in Europe and Australia, where vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter are used most frequently as ambulances, there is no advantage. In these jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are sometimes placed between lanes to allow ambulances to pass <b>unobstructed</b> while driving over the centre line during an emergency.|$|E
25|$|The {{appropriate}} surgical {{management of}} an alar lobule defect {{depends upon the}} dimensions (length, width, depth) of the wound. Anatomically, the nasal skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semi-rigid aesthetic subunit that forms the graceful curve of the alar rim, and provides <b>unobstructed</b> airflow through the nostrils, the anterior nares.|$|E
25|$|When {{cruise ships}} are not moored at the OPT, {{restricted}} spaces {{along the entire}} waterfront promenade, is opened for public access, providing an uninterrupted walk along the water's edge from Circular Quay to Campbell's Cove. Toward the north elevation of the structure, the 1988 additions also provided new public observation decks with <b>unobstructed</b> panoramic views over Circular Quay and Sydney Harbour.|$|E
25|$|All 3½-inch disks have a {{rectangular}} {{hole in one}} corner which, if obstructed, write-enabled the disk. A sliding detented piece can be moved to block or reveal {{the part of the}} rectangular hole that is sensed by the drive. The HD 1.44MB disks have a second, <b>unobstructed</b> hole in the opposite corner which identifies them as being of that capacity.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the sinking}} showed {{the number of}} {{lifeboats}} insufficient, Titanic was in compliance with maritime safety regulations of the time (albeit the Titanic disaster proved the regulations outdated for such large passenger ships). The Inquiry also revealed White Star Line wanted fewer boats on the decks, to provide <b>unobstructed</b> views for passengers and give the ship more aesthetics from an exterior view.|$|E
25|$|The garage was modernised in 1960, {{and again}} in 1991 when a new roof was fitted and various stores and welfare areas were moved to provide a larger, <b>unobstructed</b> parking area, which had {{previously}} been long and narrow. Merton was also responsible {{for the maintenance of}} vehicles for route 200 in 1988/9 after the withdrawal of the Cityrama sightseeing company, whilst the route was operated from Sutton garage.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} design {{approaches}} for the bow, stern, and deck of kayaks. Some kayaks have upturned bows, which {{are meant to}} provide better performance when paddling into waves, as well as better wave-shedding ability. Other kayaks achieve this through increased buoyancy in the bow. Kayaks with <b>unobstructed</b> stern decks may ease certain types of self-rescue. Waterproof bulkheads in modern kayaks provide flotation {{in the event of}} capsize.|$|E
25|$|Spectators {{will be able}} to {{experience}} <b>unobstructed</b> views from both the lower and upper seating bowls, which are supported by a single concourse. The concourse provides full access around the stadium with easy access to concession and toilet facilities. The fan experience will be enhanced by modern sound and video elements throughout the stadium. Fully integrated broadcast facilities will allow viewers and listeners to feel part of the atmosphere.|$|E
25|$|Scuba divers {{are often}} taught never {{to hold their}} breath underwater, as in some {{circumstances}} this can result in lung overpressure injury. In reality, {{this is only a}} risk during ascent, as that is the only time that a fixed amount of air will expand in the lungs, and even then, only if the airways are closed. A relaxed and <b>unobstructed</b> airway will allow expanding air to flow out freely.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} nasal valve {{comprises the}} area bounded by the upper lateral-cartilage, the septum, the nasal floor, and the anterior {{head of the}} inferior turbinate. In the narrow (leptorrhine) nose, this is the narrowest portion of the nasal airway. Generally, this area requires an angle greater than 15 degrees for <b>unobstructed</b> breathing; for the correction of such narrowness, {{the width of the}} nasal valve can be increased with spreader grafts and flaring sutures.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the term}} peripteros or peripteral designates a temple {{surrounded}} by ptera (colonnades) {{on all four}} sides, each usually formed by a single row of columns. This produces an <b>unobstructed</b> surrounding portico, the peristasis, on all four sides of the temple. A Hellenistic and Roman form of this shape is the pseudoperipteros, where the side columns of the peristasis are indicated only by engaged columns or pilasters directly attached to the external cella walls.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} Pinckney's Treaty, Spain and the United States signed the Treaty of San Lorenzo on October 27, 1795, setting the {{boundary}} between American territory and Spanish West and East Florida at the 31st parallel. Furthermore, Spain agreed to allow the U.S.A. <b>unobstructed</b> use of the Mississippi River and to dismantle Fort San Fernando de las Barrancas at Chickasaw Bluffs. Both parties agreed to cease stirring up the Indian tribes against each other.|$|E
