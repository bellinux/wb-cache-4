5|$|At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Miura soon {{finds himself}} <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> {{penetrate}} Ip's impeccable defense and is overwhelmed by his relentless and direct blows. <b>Unable</b> <b>to</b> defend himself, Ip effortlessly uses {{him like a}} wooden dummy, inflicting a severe beating on him.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo {{began the}} final quarter with the ball in a 2nd-and-11 {{situation}} and were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> convert the first down. UConn received Buffalo's punt and were also <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> move the ball, going three-and-out and punting back to the Bulls. On their next possession Buffalo {{managed to get a}} first down off of a Drew Willy pass to tight end Jesse Rack, but were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> move the ball further than UConn's 49-yard line and punted again.|$|E
5|$|Despite Allied concerns, Tirpitz posed only {{a limited}} danger to Allied shipping. From late 1943 the {{battleship}} was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> put to sea for crew training due {{to the threat of}} Allied attack and fuel shortages. These shortages also meant the Germans were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> move the battleship between anchorages to make her more difficult to locate and attack.|$|E

5|$|A radical {{strategy}} for avoiding predators which may otherwise kill {{a large majority}} of the emerging young of a population is to emerge very rarely, at irregular intervals. This strategy is seen in dramatic form in the periodical cicadas, which emerge at intervals of 13 or 17 years. Predators with a life-cycle of one or a few years are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> reproduce rapidly enough in response to such an emergence, so predator satiation is a likely evolutionary explanation for the cicadas' unusual life-cycle, though not the only one. Predators may still feast on the emerging cicadas, but are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> consume more than a fraction of the brief surfeit of prey.|$|E

5|$|After the British had withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> see Sword from his command bunker, {{so even though}} he was able to get two of his guns back in action, he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E
5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> proceed.|$|E

After two years of inactivity, the volleyball selection was reformed, and was composed mostly of youth players. During the era, another Maribor-based women's volleyball team, ŽŠD Maribor, competed in the Yugoslav volleyball system, but had no major success, playing in the top national division for only one season before being relegated.|$|R

Cheenu continues his futile attempts to gain her attention, and the train eventually leaves with Viji not recognising him. Cheenu, who was injured while chasing her car {{and trying to get}} her attention, is left alone, heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, Gilbert and Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera {{on the theme of}} burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Władysław {{gave the}} Russians the border town of Serpeysk and nearby territories, hoping {{to persuade the}} Tsar to join in an anti-Swedish alliance.

The Russians, <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing.|$|E
