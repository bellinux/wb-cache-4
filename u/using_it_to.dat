5|$|Guepinia helvelloides is an edible, but bland, fungus. Older {{specimens}} {{are usually}} tough and indigestible.

5|$|Aalborg had a synagogue, {{built in}} 1854; and the Jewish rabbi Salomon Mielziner served it for 35 years. Services {{were no longer}} offered after Mielziner died, and in 1924 the synagogue was donated to the city government, which began <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> store the city {{archives}} (Stadsarkivet). It was burned down by the Schalburg Corps in April 1945 {{towards the end of}} World War II, destroying its centuries-old Torahs. Anti-semitism continues to exist in Denmark, and in 1999, an unlicensed Nazi radio station began operating from a neo-Nazi stronghold in Fynen, Nørresundby, within Aalborg municipality. The activity has been widely denounced with organized opposition in Aalborg and the rest of Denmark, and in February 1999, 12 anti-fascists were arrested for possession of explosives at their base in Fynen.|$|E

In early 2011 the band took a portable recording studio on an elaborate round world writing trip.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, Soundwave assembles a newer, more {{powerful}} chassis for Megatron, <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> resurrect him. Megatron then challenges Starscream and his loyalists for {{leadership of the}} Decepticons, kills his soldiers, defeats him and frees the Combaticons. He then leads a full-scale assault on the Autobot stronghold {{in the ruins of}} Iacon, where the massive Decepticon Trypticon's remains are kept. Megatron and his soldiers invade the facility and he takes Trypticon's power core, the heart of a transformer. He informs Trypticon that he is not being rescued as he , but he congratulates him for destroying Iacon City and thousands more Autobots. Trypticon is then transformed into the Nemesis, the Decepticon flagship.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Shengzong died in 1031, {{leaving behind}} {{instructions}} that named his son Yelü Zongzhen as heir. Yelü Zongzhen, known historically {{by the name}} Emperor Xingzong of Liao, became the Emperor of the Liao dynasty {{at the age of}} fifteen, and his reign immediately became plagued with courtly infighting. Emperor Xingzong's mother was a low-ranking consort, Nuou Jin, but he was raised by Emperor Shengzong's wife, Empress Ji Dian. Nuou Jin quickly moved to marginalize Ji Dian and her supporters, fabricating a coup and <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> justify exiling Ji Dian and executing most of her supporters in several months of purges. Nuou Jin eventually sent assassins to kill Ji Dian; however, Ji Dian instead committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> lure his opponent {{to the net}} and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E

5|$|Hal Rogers {{was also}} {{considered}} a suspect {{because he had}} posted bail for his brother, knowing he had abused Michelle. He later {{said that he had}} promised the family he would post bail and would not renege on his promise. Investigators from Florida and Ohio also discovered that Hal Rogers had withdrawn US$7,000 from his bank {{at the time of the}} disappearance, which he was able to account for. He had planned on <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> look for his wife and daughters before he was notified of their deaths. Investigations proved conclusively that he had never left Ohio during that period. The rape of Michelle Rogers, and gossip by local people, was one of the reasons for the Florida trip, so she and her sister and mother could distance themselves from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he can contact Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a retinal scanner. Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels as {{dangerous}} as possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any way to control the resulting creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> deactivate the radio jammer. Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel. Seeing this take place on a security monitor, Hansen races to the lab to give Anna the antidote.|$|E

The scheme began with a trial on a single tram – number 3054 – connected to the FreeBeeMcr broadband network {{with the intention of}} rolling it out across the whole Metrolink network by Spring 2015.

5|$|In May 1890, Maria—who {{retained}} societal {{influence as}} {{the widow of}} a nobleman—persuaded the authorities to allow Lenin to take his exams externally at the University of St Petersburg, where he obtained {{the equivalent of a}} first-class degree with honours. The graduation celebrations were marred when his sister Olga died of typhoid. Lenin remained in Samara for several years, working first as a legal assistant for a regional court and then for a local lawyer. He devoted much time to radical politics, remaining active in Skylarenko's group and formulating ideas about how Marxism applied to Russia. Inspired by Plekhanov's work, Lenin collected data on Russian society, <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> support a Marxist interpretation of societal development and counter the claims of the Narodniks. He wrote a paper on peasant economics; it was rejected by the liberal journal Russian Thought.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{forces had}} landed on Bougainville in early 1942, {{capturing}} {{it from the}} small force of Australians garrisoning the island.

These bases also helped protect Rabaul, the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea; throughout 1943, Allied planners determined that Bougainville was vital for neutralising the Japanese base around Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence {{followed}} Swann to the University of Chicago, {{and then}} to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where Lawrence completed his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in physics in 1925 as a Sloane Fellow, writing his doctoral thesis on the photoelectric effect in potassium vapor. He was elected a member of Sigma Xi, and, on Swann's recommendation, received a National Research Council fellowship. Instead of <b>using</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> travel to Europe, as was customary at the time, he remained at Yale University with Swann as a researcher.|$|E
