In 1918 Rendall had stood as {{a supporter of the}} Coalition government of David Lloyd George. He was not opposed by the Conservatives, though he did defeat a National Party candidate, and had presumably been in receipt of the Coalition Coupon. However, by 1920 he had fallen out with the Coalition, writing to his local Liberal Association to explain that he was dissatisfied by what he described as the government’s tremendous and <b>unjustified</b> <b>commitment</b> of British money and lives in Mesopotamia {{at the same time as}} their inability to end waste and extravagance at home. He went and sat on the opposition benches.|$|E
40|$|Este artículo pretende iluminar el significado del nombre divino 'ehyé 'aser 'ehyé (Seré el que seré; Ex 3, 14), para ejemplarizar en qué sentido el libro del Éxodo (y tal vez el grueso del Antiguo Testamento) afirma algunas verdades con pretensión de absoluto. Para el lector de nuestros tiempos, Seré el que seré resulta problemático, no solo por su formulación enigmática, cuyo sentido no entiende a cabalidad; sino también porque culturalmente pierden valor, cada vez con mayor fuerza, las proposiciones que se postulan como absolutas. La interpretación existencial del nombre de Dios, que se propone, resuelve el enigma: Seré el que seré designa el compromiso divino injustificado de su presencia a favor de su pueblo. El sentido absoluto de esta afirmación {{coincide}} con el de otras importantes afirmaciones teológicas del libro del Éxodo: no pretenden anular la esfera histórica de la existencia, particularmente la libertad humana y su contingencia, sino al contrario muestran su valor y le aportan su fundamento de origen, sentido y dirección. The {{author of}} thiis article intends to {{provide insight into}} the meaning of the divine ñame 'ehyé 'áser 'ehyé (I will be whom will be; Ex 3, 14), in order to exemplify in what sense the book of Exodus (and, perhaps, the greater part of the Oíd Testament) affirms certain truths with the intention of absoluteness. For the reader of our own times, I will be whom I will be turns out to be problematic, not only for its enigmatic formation, whose meaning is not fully captured, but also because, culturally, the propositions formulated as absolutes lose in an ever greater degree their valué. The existential interpretation of the ñame of God, which the author proposes, resolves the enigma: I will be whom will be designates the <b>unjustified</b> divine <b>commitment</b> of His presence in favor of His people. The absolute sense of this affirmation coincides with that of other important theological affirmations of the book of Exodus: they do not try to annul the historie sphere of existence, particularly human freedom and its contingeney, but rather to the contrary, they show their valué and contribute to them their foundational origins, meaning and orientation...|$|R
