40|$|The {{relationships}} between 4 bacterial and 3 viral antibody titers and morbidity (undifferentiated fever (UF)) and mortality were investigated in recently weaned beef calves. Blood samples from 100 animals that required treatment for UF (Cases) and 100 healthy control animals (Controls) were obtained: upon {{arrival at the}} feedlot (Arrival), {{at the time of}} selection as a Case or Control (Selection), and at approximately 33 d of the feeding period (Convalescent). Seroconversion to Pasteurella haemolytica antileukotoxin was associated with an increased risk of <b>UF</b> (<b>OR</b> = 2. 83); however, seroconversion to bovine herpesvirus- 1 G-IV glycoprotein was associated with a decreased risk of <b>UF</b> (<b>OR</b> = 0. 43). Higher Arrival bovine viral diarrhea virus antibody titer was associated with a decreased risk of <b>UF</b> (<b>OR</b> = 0. 83). Increases in Mycoplasma alkalescens antibody titer after Arrival were associated with an increased risk of <b>UF</b> (<b>OR</b> = 1. 10). Higher Arrival Haemophilus somnus antibody titer and increases in Haemophilus somnus antibody titer after Arrival were both associated with a decreased risk of <b>UF</b> (<b>OR</b> = 0. 76 and OR = 0. 78). The odds of overall mortality (OR = 5. 09) and hemophilosis mortality (OR = 11. 31) in Cases were significantly (P < 0. 05) higher than in the Controls. Higher Arrival bovine herpesvirus- 1 antibody titer was associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR = 1. 30). Protective immunity to Pasteurella haemolytica antileukotoxin, Haemophilus somnus, bovine herpesvirus- 1 G-IV glycoprotein, bovine viral diarrhea virus, and Mycoplasma spp. may be necessary to reduce the occurrence of UF. Animals with UF are at an increased risk of overall and hemophilosis mortality...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the lowest effective dosage of {{low molecular weight}} (LMW) heparin for hemodialysis in comparison to unfractionated (UF) heparin. Initial hemodialysis sessions were undertaken in 10 uremic patients with UF heparin of the dose habitually required for each patient. Four-hour hemodialysis sessions were then undertaken with LMW heparin (nadropsrin) in a single bolus (200 anti-Xa unit Institut Choay/kg [aXaU IC/kg], 175 aXaU IC/kg, 150 aXaU IC/kg, or 125 aXaU IC/kg; two sessions for each dosage). Anti-Xa levels and {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (APTT) were monitored hourly during dialysis. Fiber bundle volume of dialyzer was measured before and after dialysis. Urea clearance was determined at the onset and completion of dialysis. There were no episodes of excessive bleeding, clotting of dialyzers, or clots in air traps with <b>UF</b> heparin <b>or</b> LMW heparin. A 35 % increase in APTT above baseline was observed in all dialysis sessions 1 hour after LMW heparin bolus, but the APTT decreased rapidly thereafter. The anti-Xa levels exceeded 0. 5 U/mL for all sessions using LMW heparin irrespective of the dosage. No significant reduction of urea clearance was found in dialysis with either <b>UF</b> <b>or</b> LMW heparin. No reduction of fiber bundle volume of dialyzer was observed in dialysis with either <b>UF</b> <b>or</b> LMW heparin, although a small reduction (3 %) was observed in dialysis with LMW heparin at 125 aXaU IC/kg. We concluded that the use of LMW heparin for hemodialysis is safe and effective as compared with UF heparin. The lowest effective dosage can be reduced to 125 aXaU IC/kg in high-risk patients to reduce hemorrhagic complications. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Data from a longitudinal study on adverse drug events diagnosed at the ED (ANCESTRAL-ED) in older people were analyzed in order to select cases of AF, syncope, <b>or</b> <b>UF.</b> A total of 724 patients (median age: 81. 0 [65 – 105] years, 66. 3 % female) were consecutively admitted to the ED (403 AF, 210 syncope, and 111 UF). The number of psychotropic drugs was the only significant difference in patients with AF versus those with UF (odds ratio [OR] 1. 44; 95 % confidence interval 1. 17 – 1. 77). When comparing AF with syncope, female gender, musculoskeletal diseases, dementia, and systolic blood pressure > 110 mmHg emerged as significantly associated with AF (OR 0. 40 [0. 27 – 0. 58], 0. 40 [0. 24 – 0. 68], 0. 35 [0. 14 – 0. 82], and 0. 31 [0. 20 – 0. 49], respectively), while valvulopathy and the number of antihypertensive drugs were significantly related to syncope (OR 2. 51 [1. 07 – 5. 90] and 1. 24 [1. 07 – 1. 44], respectively). Upon comparison of UF and syncope, the number of central nervous system drugs, female gender, musculoskeletal diseases, and SBP > 110 mmHg were associated with <b>UF</b> (<b>OR</b> 0. 65 [0. 50 – 0. 84], 0. 52 [0. 30 – 0. 89], 0. 40 [0. 20 – 0. 77], and 0. 26 [0. 13 – 0. 55]), respectively.

40|$|A {{positive}} {{association between}} renin-angiotensin system, especially AT 1 receptor, and oxidative {{stress in the}} pathogenesis of hypertension and cardiovascular/renal diseases has been suggested. However, the role of oxidative stress, especially superoxide radicals in renal sodium handling in response to AT 1 and AT 2 receptors, is not known. Therefore, {{the present study was}} designed to investigate the role of NAD(P) H oxidase (NOX), a major superoxide radical producing enzyme, in AT 1 and AT 2 receptor function on natriuresis/diuresis in Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats under anesthesia were intravenously infused with NOX inhibitor apocynin (3. 5 μg·kg− 1 ·min− 1), the AT 1 receptor antagonist candesartan (100 μg/kg; bolus), and the AT 2 receptor agonist CGP- 42112 A (1 μg·kg− 1 ·min− 1) alone and in combinations. Candesartan alone significantly increased urinary flow (UF; μl/ 30 min) by 53 and urinary Na excretion (UNaV; μmol/min) by 0. 4 over basal. Preinfusion of apocynin had no effect on the net increase in <b>UF</b> <b>or</b> UNaV in response to candesartan. On the other hand, apocynin preinfusion caused profound increases in CGP- 42112 A-induced UF by 72, UNaV by 1. 14, and fractional excretion of Na by 7. 8. Apocynin and CGP- 42112 A alone did not cause significant increase in <b>UF</b> <b>or</b> UNaV over the basal. CGP- 42112 A infusion in the presence of apocynin increased urinary nitrite/nitrates and cGMP over basal. The infusion of candesartan, apocynin, and CGP- 42112 A alone or in combinations had no effect on the blood pressure or the glomerular filtration rate, suggesting tubular effects on natriuresis/diuresis.
