40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the impact of low {{temperature}} and high CO 2 levels on flavonols, proanthocyanidins, and anthocyanins, synthesized via branched pathways from common precursors, in strawberries (Fragaria vesca L.). Flavonoids were identified with Q-TOF equipment and quantified by HPLC-quadrupole. Proanthocyanins B 1 and B 3 accumulated in CO 2 -treated strawberries, whereas in <b>untreated</b> (<b>air)</b> fruit, flavonoid production was redirected toward anthocyanin accumulation with a sharp decrease in catechin and procyanidin B 3 levels. Moreover, in CO 2 -treated fruit, mainly in those with 20 % CO 2, anthocyanin accumulation did not decline. Due to its antifungal activity, catechin induction in CO 2 -treated strawberries could explain the capacity of high CO 2 treatments to reduce fungal decay. Ascorbic acid content increased in 40 % CO 2 -treated fruits, whereas in those treated with 20 % CO 2 an increase in flavonol content was observed. Despite these differences, similar antioxidant capacities were found in untreated and CO 2 -treated Mara de Bois strawberries. © 2012 American Chemical Society. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of osmotically dehydrated apple and banana was examined under uniaxial compression and relaxation tests of cylindrical specimens. Compression and relaxation tests were performed, following air drying of osmotically pre-treated samples, at various moisture contents ranging from 0. 1 to 1. 5 kg/kg dry basis. The maximum stress {{and the corresponding}} strain were correlated to the moisture content using simple mathematical equations. It was shown that both parameters increase as water was removed and their values are {{significantly higher than the}} corresponding values for <b>untreated</b> <b>air</b> dried samples. The effect of moisture content on compressive behavior of osmotically dried materials was introduced through its effect on the four model parameters: the maximum stress (sigma(max)), the maximum strain (epsilon(max)), the elastic parameter (E) and the viscoelastic exponent (p). The stress relaxation data of osmotically treated samples were modeled using a two-term Maxwell model. It was shown that osmotic pre-treatment increased the remaining force and it decreased the relaxation time of dehydrated samples. The osmotic dehydration and therefore the sugar gain tend to increase the viscous nature of fruits and decrease their elasticity for both materials, causing plasticity of the structure...|$|E

40|$|Indoor {{air quality}} Air {{pressurisation}} When outdoor air {{is the main}} source of pollutants indoors, mechanical air ventilation can be viewed as having two fronts of action in controlling indoor air quality. The first is its capacity to remove indoor air pollutants by dilution, and the second is its capability to prevent, through its pressurisation effect, the pollutant source (i. e. <b>untreated</b> outdoor <b>air)</b> from infiltrating, through the building envelope, to the occupied space. This paper discusses the impact of combined dilution and pressurisation potentials of ventilation air on indoor contaminant concentration when outdoor air is {{the main source of}} pollutants. Utilising an airflow model in conjunction with a one-compartment indoor air quality model, contaminant concentration behaviour within a single zone enclosure is predicted at various enclosure air leakage, system characteristics and pressurisation levels. Results from this study are indicative of the appreci-able impact of the pressurisation effect of ventilation air which needs to be considered for a better assessment of ventilation air effectiveness and further enhancement of indoor air quality control...|$|R

40|$|Pig {{and poultry}} houses are {{responsible}} for a large emission of ammonia. Ammonia emission can be reduced by scrubbers systems such as acid scrubbers and biotrickling filters. Currently, air treatment systems are dimensioned on basis of the maximum ventilation capacity of an animal house, which means the scrubber is underloaded {{for most of the}} time. Therefore it is suggested to decrease the volume of a scrubber and construct a bypass system that bypasses part of the <b>untreated</b> <b>air</b> to the atmosphere if at times the total air flow is higher than the design air flow of the scrubber. Experimental data and a year-round model for the ammonia emission and air flow of an animal house are presented. Assuming that the ammonia removal efficiency of a scrubber is not affected, calculations show that a bypass system, in which the air treatment capacity is reduced by 70 - 80 % for growing-finishing pigs and 80 - 85 % for broilers, still meets Dutch emission standards. Exploitation costs will probably decrease by 40 - 70 %. As the use of a bypass system increases the average air load and ammonia load of a scrubber; additional measurements are necessary to find out to if and to what extent the ammonia removal efficiency is affected...|$|E
40|$|Abstract] The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the removal of odour and ammonia from outlet air using vertical biofilters in two units with growing-finishing pigs in the winter. Woodchips were used as media in the wall of the biofilters. The air from the pig units was humidified by a high-pressure water system before it reached the biofilters. A total of 56 odour and ammonia measurements were taken at an average outdoor temperature of 5. 4 C. The biofilters significantly reduced the odour concentration (OUE/m 3) in the outlet air (P< 0. 001). The measured odour removal efficiency averaged 60 %. In contrast, the biofilters did not reduce the ammonia concentration (ppm) significantly in the outlet air. The hedonic tone of the odour of the air was determined before and after the biofilter. The <b>untreated</b> <b>air</b> was recorded as more unpleasant than the air that had passed through the biofilters. In conclusion, the biofilters were capable of reducing the odour concentration in the outlet air from units with growing-finishing pigs in the winter.

This paper reports the method development and optimisation of an acute in vitro MTT cytotoxicity assay using human 3 D reconstructed airway tissues and an aerosol exposure system. The EpiAirway™ tissue {{is a highly}} differentiated in vitro human airway culture derived from primary human tracheal/bronchial epithelial cells grown at the air–liquid interface, which can be exposed to aerosols generated by the VITROCELL® smoking robot. Method development was supported by understanding the compatibility of these tissues within the VITROCELL® system, in terms of airflow (L/min), vacuum rate (mL/min) and exposure time. Dosimetry tools (QCM) were used to measure deposited mass, to confirm the provision of e-cigarette aerosol to the tissues. EpiAirway™ tissues were exposed to cigarette smoke and aerosol generated from two commercial e-cigarettes for up to 6 h.

40|$|Adequate {{perception}} of nasal airflow (i. e., nasal patency) {{is an important}} consideration for patients with nasal sinus diseases. The {{perception of}} a lack of nasal patency becomes the primary symptom that drives these patients to seek medical treatment. However, clinical assessment of nasal patency remains a challenge because we lack objective measurements that correlate well with what patients perceive. The current study examined factors that may influence perceived patency, including air temperature, humidity, mucosal cooling, nasal resistance, and trigeminal sensitivity. Forty-four healthy subjects rated nasal patency while sampling air from three facial exposure boxes that were ventilated with <b>untreated</b> room <b>air,</b> cold air, and dry air, respectively. In all conditions, air temperature and relative humidity inside each box were recorded with sensors connected to a computer. Nasal resistance and minimum airway cross-sectional area (MCA) were measured using rhinomanometry and acoustic rhinometry, respectively. General trigeminal sensitivity was assessed through lateralization thresholds to butanol. No significant correlation was found between perceived patency and nasal resistance or MCA. In contrast, air temperature, humidity, and butanol threshold combined significantly contributed to the ratings of patency, with mucosal cooling (heat loss) being the most heavily weighted predictor. Air humidity significantly influences perceived patency, suggesting that mucosal cooling rather than air temperature alone provides the trigeminal sensation that results in perception of patency. The dynamic cooling between the airstream and the mucosal wall may be quantified experimentall...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} context of {{more and more}} energy {{efficient}} buildings, performant HVAC systems are required. The solution based on radiant cooling ceiling systems has proven successful in terms of high energy efficiency and good levels of thermal comfort. Nevertheless, {{there is an important}} issue concerning the cooling ceilings: the risk of condensation. As a result, the aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the thermal comfort and condensation risk for buildings with ventilation systems and cooling ceilings. The approach is based on CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) technique, introducing special methodologies in order to deal with convection and diffusion phenomena for water vapor, required for comprehensive thermal comfort analyzes and condensation mechanisms. The numerical model is applied in the case of a small office, taking into account a radiant cooling ceiling over the entire ceiling surface and two configurations of ventilation systems: mixing ventilation and displacement ventilation. Several simulations have been completed for different conditions concerning the air flow rates of the ventilation systems and temperatures of the cooling ceiling. It has been concluded that mixing ventilation has superior behavior, both in terms of thermal comfort and condensation risk, when warm and moist air is supplied in the room. On the other hand, the results show that when <b>untreated</b> <b>air</b> is supplied by the ventilation system (no matter its configuration, mixing or displacement), thermal comfort in the office cannot be properly assured only by radiant cooling ceiling systems...|$|E
40|$|Contact {{with water}} can promote magma fragmentation. Obsidian chips and glass spheres {{typically}} crack when quenched. Vesicular pyroclasts {{are made of}} glass, so thermal quenching by water may damage them. If water enters eruption columns, or if pyroclastic density currents interact with water, hot pumice can be quenched. We performed a set of experiments on air fall pumice from Medicine Lake, California. We made quenched samples by heating natural clasts to 600 °C, quenching them in water at 21 °C, drying them at 105 °C, and then cooling them to room temperature. We compare these samples with <b>untreated</b> <b>air</b> fall pumice from the same deposit, hereafter referred to as regular pumice. We tested whether quenched pumice would 1) shatter more easily in collisions and 2) abrade faster. We also tested whether individual clasts lose mass upon quenching, and whether they increase in effective wet density, two measurements which may help characterize the magnitude of clast damage during quenching. We also compare pre-quenching and post-quenching textures using X-ray microtomography (μXRT) images. Results from collision experiments show no clear difference between quenched pumice and regular pumice. Quenched pumice abraded faster than regular pumice. On average 0. 3 % of mass may have been lost during quenching. Effective wet density increased 1. 5 % on average, as measured after 5 minutes of immersion in water. Overall, we find modest differences between quenched pumice and regular pumice in experiments and measurements. The experimental results imply that quenching may damage small parts of a clast but tends not to cause cracks that propagate easily through the clast. Post-quenching μXRT imaging shows no obvious change in clast texture. This is {{in stark contrast to}} non-vesicular glass that develops large cracks on quenching. We present four factors that explain why pumice is resistant to damage from thermal quenching: thin glass films experience lower transient thermal stresses, many internal surfaces are initially vapor cooled, vesicles can arrest cracks, and cracks from thermal quenching may not occur in the locations most susceptible to fracture in later collisions...|$|E

The latest advancement in small scale power generation components like reciprocating engines, microturbines and fuel cells combined with waste heat technologies such as absorption chillers, desiccant dehumidifiers and thermal storage has made CHP systems for commercial buildings more promising and attractive.

Application of 0. 01 and 0. 1 vol. % DTPMP to cores was made on a weekly or monthly basis for one year under controlled laboratory-based freeze-thaw and wet-dry conditions over a temperature range of - 15 degrees to 58 degrees C to mimic extremes in Iowa roadway conditions. The same concentrations of phosphonate were also applied to cores left outside (roof of Science I at Iowa State University) {{over the same period}} of time. Nineteen applications of 0. 1 vol. % DTPMP with added deicing salt solution (about 23 weight % NACL) were made to US 20 during the winters of 2003 and 2004. In <b>untreated</b> samples, <b>air</b> voids, pores, and occasional cracks are lined with acicular ettringite crystals (up to 50 micrometers in length) whereas air voids, pores, and cracks in concrete from the westbound lane of US 20 are devoid of ettringite up to a depth of about 0. 5 mm {{from the surface of the}} concrete. Ettringite is also absent in zones up to 6 mm from the surface of concrete slabs placed on the roof of Science I and cores subject to laboratory-based freeze-thaw experiments. In these zones, the relatively high concentration of DTPMP caused it to behave as a chelator. Stunted ettringite crystals 5 to 25 micrometers in length, occasionally coated with porlandite, form on the margins of these zones indicating that in these areas DTPMP behaved as an inhibitor due to a reduction in the concentration of phosphonate. Analyses of mixes of ettringite and DTPMP using electrospray mass spectrometry suggests that the stunting of ettringite growth is caused by the adsorption of a Ca 2 + ion and a water molecule to deprotonated DTPMP on the surface of the { 0001 } face of ettringite. It is anticipated that by using a DTPMP concentration of between 0. 001 and 0. 01 vol. % for the extended life of a highway (i. e. > 20 years), deterioration caused by the expansive growth of ettringite will be markedly reduced...|$|R
40|$|Jacket plum [Pappea capensis (Eckl. &Zeyh) ] {{belongs to}} the Sapindaceae or Litchi family. It is well adapted to {{different}} climatic conditions. It {{has been used for}} medicinal purposes for both animals and human beings. Due to the richness of seeds in oil, it has great potential to be selected for production of biodiesel in South Africa. Suitable vegetative propagation methods for Pappea capensis trees have not yet been investigated and sexual propagation does not produce true-to-type plants, which take many years to bear fruits. Therefore, research was carried out to identify alternative methods for vegetative propagation of Pappea capensis which could be used for rapid multiplication. Several vegetative propagation experiments were carried out with stem cuttings and air layers. Stem cuttings were collected from two mature Pappea capensis trees grown at the Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria in the spring and autumn seasons. The cuttings were placed for rooting on the mist bed for rooting with and without Seradix® No. 2 [active ingredient, indolebutyric acid (IBA) ] treatment. Other experiments followed in which the branches were girdled before making stem cutting to improve the level of any carbohydrates or available carbohydrates. Trials to investigate the rooting potential of Pappea capensis coppices, using different stem lengths, were also conducted. Rooting of Pappea capensis stem cuttings was unsuccessful. Air layers were made on the same trees where cuttings were collected. The trials were conducted in the spring and autumn seasons from 2006, 2007 and 2008. Some air layers were treated with Seradix® No. 2 and others were not treated with the auxin. High rooting percentages (100 % in spring, 60 % in autumn) were achieved with <b>untreated</b> <b>air</b> layers of Tree No. 1 and Tree No. 2 (80 % in spring, 40 % in autumn). Regardless of season, IBA and tree treatments, rooting was successful when the air layering method was used. Due to inconsistency in rooting from both vegetative methods, total phenolic compounds were extracted. The Folin-Ciaocalteau reagents method was used to extract phenolic compounds and the results were detected with Elisa reader instrument. The stem cuttings and air layers were further analysed for carbohydrates (starch and soluble sugars) with ó-toluidine reagent and ethanol and read with Spectrophotometer and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Higher levels of total phenol compounds were observed from callused (27. 13 mg/g) and non rooted untreated (26. 41 mg/g) stem cuttings from Tree No. 2, compared to IBA treated stem cuttings (19. 90 mg/g) of callused and non rooted IBA treated stem cuttings (20. 25 mg/g) of Tree No. 2. High total phenols (34. 55 mg/g) in <b>untreated</b> <b>air</b> layers were also found in callused air layers of Tree No. 2 and lower amounts (22. 85 mg/g) in treated air layers of the same tree. No soluble sugars were detected in stem cuttings or air layers with HPLC. Regarding starch, higher amounts were observed in stem cuttings of Tree No. 1 (18. 45 mg/g) of the control and Tree No. 2 (19. 82 mg/g) of IBA treated cuttings. Most of the air layers made on Tree No. 1 had higher percentages of starch, {{with the exception of the}} callused (7. 41 mg/g) air layers of the control. Tree No. 2 air layers had very low amounts of starch when compared with those of Tree No. 1. The variation in rooting potential of stem cuttings and air layers led to the consideration of tree gender as a factor influencing success rates, where inflorescences were collected from the two Pappea capensis trees for two years (2007 and 2008). The microscopic investigations showed that Pappea capensis trees (Tree No. 1 and Tree No. 2) were monoecious, however, Tree No. 2 switched from monoecious to male by producing only male flowers. Based on the results of the above investigations, air layering in the spring season can be used as a (alternative) vegetative propagation method for Pappea capensis tree, but on specifically monoecious tree to obtain higher rooting percentage. However, these are preliminary trials which require further investigation. Dissertation (MSc(Agric)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011. Plant Production and Soil Scienceunrestricte...|$|E

Using a system combining passive heating (greenhouse effect) and active cooling (fans) to control daytime temperature, we compared vines heated to a nominal maximum of 40 °C for three consecutive days and <b>untreated</b> controls. Maximum <b>air</b> temperature in heated treatments was 7. 3 °C (2006 – 07) and 6. 5 °C (2007 – 08) above ambient. Heat episodes were aligned with the beginning of a weekly irrigation cycle and applied in one of four phenological windows, namely post-fruit set, pre-veraison, veraison and pre-harvest. Heating systems did not affect relative humidity, hence vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was increased in the heated treatments and tracked the daily cycle of temperature. Heat did not affect the dynamics of berry growth and sugar accumulation, except for a 16 % reduction in berry size and sugar content in vines heated shortly after fruit set in 2006 – 07. Vines upregulated stomatal conductance and gas exchange in response to heat. Stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration at a common VPD were consistently higher in heated vines than in controls. We suggest that stomatal behaviour previously described as part of Shiraz anisohydric syndrome may be adaptive in terms of heat tolerance at the expense of short-term transpiration efficiency.

40|$|RATIONALE : Transmission {{is driving}} the global {{tuberculosis}} epidemic, especially in congregate settings. Worldwide, natural ventilation {{is the most common}} means of air disinfection, but it is inherently unreliable and of limited use in cold climates. Upper room germicidal ultraviolet (UV) air disinfection with air mixing {{has been shown to be}} highly effective, but improved evidence-based dosing guidelines are needed. OBJECTIVES : To test the efficacy of upper room germicidal air disinfection with air mixing to reduce tuberculosis transmission under real hospital conditions, and to define the application parameters responsible as a basis for proposed new dosing guidelines. METHODS : Over an exposure period of 7 months, 90 guinea pigs breathed only <b>untreated</b> exhaust ward <b>air,</b> and another 90 guinea pigs breathed only air from the same six-bed tuberculosis ward on alternate days when upper room germicidal air disinfection was turned on throughout the ward. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : The tuberculin skin test conversion rates (. 6 mm) of the two chambers were compared. The hazard ratio for guinea pigs in the control chamber converting their skin test to positive was 4. 9 (95 % confidence interval, 2. 8 – 8. 6), with an efficacy of approximately 80 %. CONCLUSIONS : Upper room germicidal UV air disinfection with air mixing was highly effective in reducing tuberculosis transmission under hospital conditions. These data support using either a total fixture output (rather than electrical or UV lamp wattage) of 15 – 20 mW/m 3 total room volume, or an average whole-room UV irradiance (fluence rate) of 5 – 7 mW/cm 2, calculated by a lighting computer-assisted design program modified for UV use.

40|$|Poultry {{housings}} with litter are a {{major contributor}} to fine dust emissions (PM 10 /PM 2. 5) in the Netherlands. Poultry producers are in need of dust mitigation options that are cost effective. Such an option could be provided by adequately designed water scrubbers. Catchment of dust particles by water droplets and deposition of dust particles on the surface of wetted packing material will lead to removal of dust from ventilation air. The aim of this research was to test water scrubbers under real poultry farm conditions. Prototypes of two water scrubber concepts were tested: prototype A was based on treating outlet air in a cross flow scrubbing setup. Synthetic packing material is continuously drained with a specified large volume of water, that is recirculated from a storage basin below. Prototype B was based on spraying of water by high pressure nozzles in an open treatment chamber, through which the ventilated air was led. A drip catcher was constructed at the outlet of this chamber to prevent loss of water. For prototype A an indicative measurement scheme was carried out on a poultry farm with non-productive raising pullets on cages. Four measurements based on 24 h sampling periods were carried out during which dust removal was measured by a gravimetrical method. Mean removal percentages for PM 2. 5 and PM 10 amounted 9 and 62 % respectively. The observed removal percentage for PM 10 was in accordance with an earlier theoretical assessment study. It is concluded that this prototype {{can be used as a}} basis to develop of this water scrubber for use in poultry production. Prototype B was tested on a broiler farm. First measurements based on gravimetrical methods showed negative removal results. To avoid biasing effects of high humidity on the results, subsequent gravimetrical measurements in the outlet air of the scrubber were carried out after heating and drying the outlet air to lower humidity levels. Accompanying particle counter measurement in particle size classes from 1 to 25 micrometer were carried out in both <b>untreated</b> and treated <b>air.</b> PM 10 removal performance was negative, and particle numbers especially increased in the smaller size classes. Inspection of outlet dust samples by electron microscopy indicated that formation of salt aerosols might provide an explanation for this increase. It is concluded in general that humidity effects on dust measurement methods and potential salt crystal formation may complicate dust removal performance of scrubbers and should be more deeply investigated...|$|R

Despite the minimally invasive procedure, valve placement is associated with risks, {{the most common of}} which is pneumothorax. This study was designed to identify predictors of pneumothorax following endoscopic valve implantation. Methods: Preinterventional clinical measures (vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1  second, residual volume, total lung capacity, 6 -minute walk test), qualitative computed tomography (CT) parameters (fissure integrity, blebs/bulla, subpleural nodules, pleural adhesions, partial atelectasis, fibrotic bands, emphysema type) and quantitative CT parameters (volume and low attenuation volume of the target lobe and the ipsilateral <b>untreated</b> lobe, target <b>air</b> trapping, ipsilateral lobe volume/hemithorax volume, collapsibility of the target lobe and the ipsilateral untreated lobe) were retrospectively evaluated in patients who underwent endoscopic valve placement (n= 129). Regression analysis was performed to compare those who developed pneumothorax following valve therapy (n= 46) with those who developed target lobe volume reduction without pneumothorax (n= 83). Finding: Low attenuation volume% of ipsilateral untreated lobe (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 08, P= 0. 001), ipsilateral untreated lobe volume/hemithorax volume (OR = 0. 93, P= 0. 017), emphysema type (OR = 0. 26, P= 0. 018), pleural adhesions (OR = 0. 33, P= 0. 012) and residual volume (OR = 1. 58, P= 0. 012) were found to be significant predictors of pneumothorax. Fissure integrity (OR = 1. 16, P= 0. 075) and 6 -minute walk test (OR = 1. 05, P= 0. 077) were also indicative of pneumothorax. The model including the aforementioned parameters predicted whether a patient would experience a pneumothorax 84 % of the time (area under the curve = 0. 84). Interpretation: Clinical and CT parameters provide a promising tool to effectively identify patients at high risk of pneumothorax following endoscopic valve therapy.
