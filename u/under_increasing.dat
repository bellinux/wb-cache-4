5|$|After the Gdańsk Agreement, the Polish {{government}} was <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> {{pressure from the}} Soviet Union to take action and strengthen its position. Stanisław Kania was viewed by Moscow as too independent, and on October 18, 1981, the Party Central Committee {{put him in the}} minority. Kania lost his post as First Secretary, and was replaced by Prime Minister (and Minister of Defence) Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who adopted a strong-arm policy.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{cannabis}} {{and other}} drugs came <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> scrutiny after {{the formation of the}} Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN) in 1930, headed by Harry J. Anslinger as part of the government's broader push to outlaw all recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{had come}} <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> {{pressure}} by 1958. His army's military failures, coupled with his press censorship {{and the police}} and army's use of torture and extrajudicial executions, were increasingly criticized both domestically and abroad. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry, leading him to buy arms from the United Kingdom. The opposition used this opportunity to call a general strike, accompanied by armed attacks from the MR-26-7. Beginning on 9 April, it received strong support {{in central and eastern}} Cuba, but little elsewhere.|$|E

By 1958, Batista was <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> pressure, a result of his military failures coupled with increasing domestic and foreign criticism surrounding his administration's press censorship, torture, and extrajudicial executions. Influenced by anti-Batista sentiment among their citizens, the U.S. government ceased supplying him with weaponry.

5|$|Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael {{and demand}} that he perform a series of {{operations}} to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA). Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his own activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him. Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lester start planning their most daring feat ever: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve.|$|E
5|$|In late 1929, {{the party}} was {{weakened}} by an internal split. <b>Under</b> <b>increasing</b> French pressure, the VNQDD leadership switched tack, replacing a strategy of isolated clandestine attacks against individuals {{with a plan to}} expel the French in a single blow with a large-scale popular uprising. After stockpiling home-made weapons, the VNQDD launched the Yên Bái mutiny on February 10, 1930 with the aim of sparking a widespread revolt. VNQDD forces combined with disaffected Vietnamese troops, who mutinied against the French colonial army. The mutiny was quickly put down, with heavy French retribution. Học and other leading figures were captured and executed and the VNQDD never regained its political strength in the country.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1933 Amir was {{recalled}} to Langkat, {{where the}} Sultan informed him of two conditions {{which he had}} to fulfil to continue his studies: be a diligent student and abandon the independence movement. Despite the Sultan's disapproval, Amir became more heavily involved in the nationalist movement, bringing him <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> Dutch scrutiny. He continued to publish in Poedjangga Baroe, including a series of five articles on Eastern literatures from June to December 1934 and a translation of the Bhagavad Gita from 1933 to 1935. His legal studies, however, were delayed, and by 1937 he had still not graduated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} tenth century, the East Anglian Danes came <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> {{pressure}} from Edward the Elder, king of Wessex. In 902 Edward's cousin Æthelwold ætheling, {{who had been}} driven into exile after an unsuccessful bid for the throne, arrived in Essex after a stay in Northumbria. He was apparently accepted as king by {{some or all of}} the Danes in England and in 903 he induced the East Anglian Danes to wage war on Edward. This ended in disaster, with the death of Æthelwold and of Eohric of East Anglia in a battle in the Fens.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises {{are very}} {{sensitive}} to anthropogenic disturbances, and are keystone species, which can indicate the overall health of the marine environment. Populations of harbor porpoises in the North and Baltic Seas are <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> pressure from anthropogenic causes such as offshore construction, ship traffic, fishing, and military exercises. Increasing pollution is a serious problem for marine mammals. Heavy metals and plastic waste are not biodegradable, and sometimes cetaceans consume these hazardous materials, mistaking them for food items. As a result, the animals are more susceptible to diseases and have fewer offspring. Harbour porpoises from the English Channel were found to have accumulated heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} {{training}} ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts. Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.|$|E

By the 25th, 45 days after the beginning of the operation, the remainder of the South Vietnamese force that had survived had left Laos behind.

5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss by Germany with Austria, Yugoslavia {{shared a}} border with the Third Reich and came <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> pro-Axis {{political}} pressure as her neighbours fell {{into line with}} the Axis powers. In April 1939, Yugoslavia gained a second frontier with the Kingdom of Italy when that country invaded Albania. Between September and November 1940, Hungary joined the Tripartite Pact, Italy invaded Greece, and Romania also joined the Pact. From that time, Yugoslavia was almost surrounded by Axis powers or their client states, and her neutral stance toward the war was under tremendous pressure. On 14 February 1941, Adolf Hitler invited the Yugoslav Prime Minister Dragiša Cvetković and his foreign minister Aleksandar Cincar-Marković to Berchtesgaden and requested that Yugoslavia also join the Pact. Two weeks later, Bulgaria joined the Pact. The next day, German troops entered Bulgaria from Romania, closing the ring around Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Barley's {{relationship}} with Morley was short-lived. By 1600, Morley {{had turned to}} East as his assignee, authorising him to print under his name for three years. Two years later, Morley died, and his music patent fell into abeyance. Unable {{to rely on the}} protections and privileges of Morley's monopoly, Barley most likely came <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> pressure from the Stationers' Company. His financial circumstances also deteriorated after he was the target of a successful lawsuit by a cook named George Goodale, who was seeking payment of a debt of 80 pounds. As a result of the suit, many of Barley's goods were seized, including various books and reams of paper. Barley greatly reduced his output from 1601 to 1605, publishing only six works.|$|E
5|$|Breaking out {{of their}} newly {{established}} bridgehead west of the Canal at {{the northern end of}} the Great Bitter Lake, the IDF launched an offensive from Deversoir toward Ismailia. A combined force of Egyptian paratroopers and commandos fought a delaying battle, falling back upon defensive positions further north <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> pressure from IDF infantry and armor. By October 22, they were occupying a last line of defense, including positions along the Ismailia canal. Though outnumbered, they repulsed a final Israeli effort to capture the city; a United Nations ceasefire was then imposed, bringing the battle to an end. The Egyptians registered a tactical and strategic victory in the defense of Ismailia, stopping an encirclement of their large forces on the east bank of the Suez Canal and ensuring their supply lines remained open.|$|E

5|$|On August 9, fifteen Texas Rangers {{with their}} Indian scouts, located Victorio's main supply camp on Sierra Diablo. The Rangers joined Carpenter {{in the attack}} while Nolan guarded Sulfur Springs. Carpenter's attack {{scattered}} the Indian guards while the troopers secured 25 head of cattle, provisions and several pack animals. Victorio <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> pressure, short of food and more importantly water, began to head south in two main groups. By August 11, Carpenter was on the trail in pursuit but, with horses tired and thirsty from the campaign, the chase was slow. Carpenter divided his command, with Nolan with his company and Texas Rangers on one route, while he took {{the rest of the}} command on another route. On August 13, Nolan reached the Rio Grande where Indian scouts reported that Victorio had crossed the border into Mexico the evening before. Carpenter arrived later and ordered the cavalrymen to rest near the river.|$|E
5|$|Rainier's main {{priorities}} {{remained the}} protection of trade, but his command came <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> interference from London, in particular the Secretary of State for War Henry Dundas. Dundas was insistent throughout 1799 and 1800 that the priority for Rainier should be the invasion and capture of Java, thus eliminating the Dutch East Indies entirely. Contradictory orders came from Lord Mornington, who was instructing Rainier to plan an invasion of Île de France, while Rainier himself wished to resurrect the abandoned operation against Manila. So confused was the command structure that in September 1800 Rainier threatened to resign, but in October 1800 a renewed threat from Egypt redirected the focus of his squadron to the Red Sea and {{only a handful of}} minor operations against Dutch posts on Java were carried out by a small force under Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball, capturing a few merchant ships but losing more than 200 men to disease in the process. At the Cape of Good Hope, a gale on 5 December 1799 caused severe damage to shipping in Table Bay: among the wrecks were HMS Sceptre with 290 crew, the Danish ship of the line Oldenburg and several large American merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Rising electoral {{success was}} {{accompanied}} by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in the ASP between the incumbent Alejo Véliz and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases. The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos – IPSP). The movement's bases defected en masse to the IPSP, leaving the ASP to crumble and Véliz to join the centre-right New Republican Force (Nueva Fuerza Republicana – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the cocalero cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another cocalero march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came <b>under</b> <b>increasing</b> criticism from the government, who repeatedly {{accused him of being}} involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.|$|E
