Adverse effects of medication are common among older people, but this age group is <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>trials.</b> Finnish statutory health care and prescription registers, together with personal identification numbers (PINs) and a tax-supported public health plan covering all citizens provide excellent opportunities for epidemiological research. We used routinely collected data from the Finnish health care system to establish the MEDication use among persons with Alzheimer’s disease (MEDALZ- 2005) cohort. This cohort study will be used to assess medication use and its effects on health status and hospitalization among persons with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The cohort includes all community-dwelling persons who had a clinically verified diagnosis of AD, resided in Finland, and were alive on December 31, 2005 and a matched comparison person for each affected individual. Data on purchased prescription medicines (1995 – 2009), inpatient hospital admissions (1972 – 2009), outpatient visits (1995 – 2009), details on diagnosed cancers (1972 – 2009), and mortality (until October 2010) are available for the whole cohort.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundAfrican Americans (AAs) {{are disproportionately}} {{affected}} by acute heart failure (AHF) {{compared with other}} racial/ethnic groups. Disparities in AHF risk factors among AAs are attributed to higher rates of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, lower socioeconomic status, higher dietary caloric and salt intake, and biologic/genetic differences. However, AAs are frequently <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> AHF <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> and race-related differences <b>in</b> risks and <b>clinical</b> outcomes are not well understood. ObjectiveThe aim of this work was to review published data on AHF in the AA population, including management strategies that may differ based on race and common barriers to optimal care. MethodsPublications were identified in Pubmed (through June 10, 2013) {{with the use of}} the search strategy terms (acute heart failure) AND (black OR African American OR racial). ResultsRacial disparities in the quality of AHF care are relatively uncommon; however, racial differences in pathophysiology have resulted in differing pharmacologic recommendations (eg, isosorbide dinitrate plus hydralazine is indicated only in AAs). Various socioeconomic factors influence disease progression, treatment compliance, and hospitalization/rehospitalization rates. ConclusionsFurther research would enhance understanding of pathophysiologic heart failure differences between racial groups.

40|$|As {{survival}} {{of patients with}} chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) increases {{and the number of}} patients who live long rises, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) becomes a relevant endpoint. Few studies investigated this, mainly as a secondary endpoint <b>in</b> randomized <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> where patients with early stage CLL/SLL, and elderly/frail patients were underrepresented. The aim of our study was to assess HRQoL in a population-based setting, including these previously underrepresented patients. Out of 175 patients diagnosed with CLL/SLL between 2004 and 2011, 136 (78 %) returned the HRQoL questionnaire. The outcomes were compared to an age- and sex-matched norm population. Detailed data on stage and treatment were extracted from a population-based hematological registry (PHAROS). Patients ever treated for CLL/SLL reported significantly poorer HRQoL than the norm population (p < 0. 01 with large clinically important differences. Interestingly, no differences were observed between the norm population and patients under active surveillance. In contrast to our hypothesis, patients treated with chlorambucil reported the lowest HRQoL scores. Drastic, long-lasting negative effects of starting treatment on HRQoL cannot be excluded, whereas active surveillance does not seem to provoke worrying, anxiety, or depressive symptoms. Further elaborate research into the impact of starting therapy on HRQoL is needed, especially in patients that are <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> most <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> and thoroughly consider its results during revision of treatment guidelines...|$|R
40|$|Background-—Dispensing {{data from}} Medicare Part D {{standalone}} prescription drug plans are now available, but characteristics of enrollees with heart failure {{have not been}} well described. Methods and Results-—We identified 81 874 patients with prevalent heart failure as of January 1, 2010, in a nationally representative 5 % sample of Medicare beneficiaries. We classified patients according to enrollment in a Medicare Part D plan as of January 1, 2010. Demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, and prescriptions were compared by enrollment status. A total of 49 252 (60. 2 %) were enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan as of January 1. Enrollees were more often women, black, and of lower socioeconomic status. Enrollees with heart failure more often filled prescriptions for loop diuretics than angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, b-blockers, or aldosterone antagonists. During the first 4 months of 2010, 5444 (12. 3 %) reached the coverage gap, and 566 (1. 3 %) required catastrophic coverage beyond the gap. Conclusions-—Medicare beneficiaries with heart failure differ significantly according to enrollment in Part D prescription drug plans and represent a population <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> efficacy <b>trials.</b> Many face the coverage gap, and few select Medicare Part D plans that provide coverage during the gap.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{determine}} whether the participation of older adults and women <b>in</b> published <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> has increased during recent years. DESIGN: Systematic review to identify <b>clinical</b> <b>trials</b> of acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) published from May 2007 to May 2009. Trials were excluded if they enrolled fewer than 50 participants, were substudies of previously published trials, or initiated treatment more than 3 weeks after the acute cardiac event. SETTING: A search of MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight thousand sixteen participants of 80 trials. MEASUREMENTS: Information on the age of trial participants, percentage of participants who were female, and whether there were specific exclusions based on age were abstracted from all included trials. RESULTS: Twenty-three trials (29. 7 %) had explicit exclusion criteria based on age. Only 13. 8 % of study participants were aged 75 and older, and 27. 7 % were women. These percentages are below the representation of all U. S. adults experiencing an ACS in recent years who were aged 75 and older (41. 9 %) or female (41. 5 %).

The recruitment and retention strategies used in GRACE are described in this article. METHODS: Recruitment and retention strategies targeting women included selecting study sites that focused on women, involving community consultants, site-specific enrollment plans, access to other ARV drugs, study branding, site and patient toolkits, targeted public relations, site grants for patient support, and subsidized child care and transportation. RESULTS: The recruitment strategies were successful; 287 (67 %) women were enrolled, primarily women of color (black, n= 191 [67 %], Hispanic, n= 60 [21 %]). Despite the focus on retention, a greater proportion of women (32. 8 %) discontinued compared with men (23. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: The successes of GRACE in enrolling a representative population of women were rooted in pretrial preparation, engagement of community advisors, enrollment quotas, choice of study sites and site support.

LUMINOUS™ is an ongoing 5 -year study that is designed to evaluate the long-term safety, effectiveness, treatment patterns, and health-related quality of life associated with ranibizumab (RBZ) 0. 5 mg treatment across all approved indications in 30, 000 patients from routine clinical practice. We present the 1 -year data from the French patients included in LUMINOUS™. Methods : Overall, 17, 545 adult patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) were enrolled before March 2014; of these 9125 adult nAMD patients with a potential for 1 -year follow-up were enrolled before March 2013. We analyzed the baseline characteristics of nAMD patients that were enrolled in France before March 2014 and the 1 -year data from the French cohort. Results : Baseline characteristics of the French and the global nAMD cohorts are shown in Table 1. Both the French and the global cohorts had similar mean baseline visual acuity (VA; Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] letter score; French/global nAMD cohorts: VA, 58. 6 / 54. 3). A higher proportion of patients in the French cohort had pigment epithelium detachment (PED) than those in the global cohort (68. 0 % versus 42. 4 %). In the global cohort, the 1 -year data showed that on average treatment-naïve patients gained VA from baseline whilst those previously treated with RBZ either gained or maintained VA, with a relatively low number of injections and visits (Table 2). The 1 -year data for the French cohort are expected in February 2016. Conclusions : The French nAMD patients enrolled in the LUMINOUS™ study were slightly older and had similar baseline VA, a higher proportion had PED, and a similar proportion had non-ocular comorbidities at baseline compared with the global nAMD cohort. The 1 -year follow-up data from the French cohort will provide an invaluable source of information from a diverse group of patients currently <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> randomized <b>clinical</b> <b>trials...</b>|$|R

40|$|Natural {{products}} offer many {{possibilities for}} the treatment of disease. More than 70 % of the Earth’s surface is ocean, and recent exploration and access has allowed for new additions to this catalog of natural treasures. The Central Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia serves as a newly accessible location, which provides the opportunity to bioprospect marine sponges with the purpose of identifying novel antiviral scaffolds. Antivirals are <b>underrepresented</b> <b>in</b> present day <b>clinical</b> <b>trials,</b> {{as well as in the}} academic screens of marine natural product libraries. Here a high-throughput pipeline was initiated by prefacing the antiviral screen with an Image-based High-Content Screening (HCS) technique in order to identify candidates with antiviral potential. Prospective candidates were tested in a biochemical or cell-based assay for the ability to inhibit the NS 3 protease of the West Nile Virus (WNV NS protease) as well as replication and reverse transcription of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV- 1). The analytical chemistry techniques of High-Performance Liquid Chromatograpy (HPLC), Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS), and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) where used in order to identify the compounds responsible for the characteristic antiviral activity of the selected sponge fractions. We have identified a 3 -alkyl pyridinium from Amphimedon chloros as the causative agent of the observed WNV NS 3 protease inhibition in vitro. Additionally, we identified debromohymenialdisine, hymenialdisine, and oroidin from Stylissa carteri as prospective scaffolds capable of HIV- 1 inhibition...|$|R
