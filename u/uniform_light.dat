25|$|During the 1980s Oslo Sporveier {{experimented with}} their livery. Some {{received}} a darker blue, either entirely {{or with a}} cream-colored upper section. Consultants had concluded that Oslo Sporveier should introduce a uniform red color with dark blue detailing on all modes of transport: buses, metro trains and trams. This went without protests on the other two modes, but when the trams were pained red it was met with a storm of protests and a unison public demanded that they retain their light blue color. This resulted in a new <b>uniform</b> <b>light</b> blue color scheme which was introduced on the SM83 units. Most of the SM53 retained their original colors.|$|E
25|$|Most species reach only 30–35mm {{in length}} (max45mm). Coloration varies {{considerably}} {{within and between}} species but common patterns are pale cream, with or without darker flecks (never stripes), and a more <b>uniform</b> <b>light</b> gray or brown to black-brown. Mucus is usually colourless but in some species includes a white deposit when the slug has been disturbed. No keel continues from the tail along the back. The mantle is large (up to half the body length), containing a shell plate internally. The pneumostome lies in the posterior half of the mantle. Generally external appearance does not reliably distinguish one species from certain others, so species identification requires dissection to reveal the genitalia, unless the local species diversity {{is known to be}} low.|$|E

These challenges cause over-illuminations in the environment that result in a waste of energy and discomfort to the occupants.

Due to its failure in achieving <b>uniform</b> <b>lighting</b> when the cross-illumination effects are maximized, a new decentralized method called the illumination balancing algorithm (IBA) is developed that takes the local light levels into account when adjusting the light voltages.
