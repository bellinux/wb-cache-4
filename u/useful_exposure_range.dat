5000|$|A more {{technical}} approach recognises that a photographic film (or sensor) has a physically limited <b>useful</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>range,</b> sometimes called its dynamic range. If, for {{any part of}} the photograph, the actual exposure is outside this range, the film cannot record it accurately. In a very simple model, for example, out-of-range values would be recorded as [...] "black" [...] (underexposed) or [...] "white" [...] (overexposed) rather than the precisely graduated shades of colour and tone required to describe [...] "detail". Therefore, the purpose of exposure adjustment (and/or lighting adjustment) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film, so that 'significant' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film's <b>useful</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>range.</b> This ensures that no 'significant' information is lost during capture.|$|E
50|$|In a {{scene with}} strong or harsh lighting, the ratio between {{highlight}} and shadow luminance values {{may well be}} larger than the ratio between the film's maximum and minimum useful exposure values. In this case, adjusting the camera's exposure settings (which only applies changes to the whole image, not selectively to parts of the image) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights; it cannot bring both into the <b>useful</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> at the same time. Methods for dealing with this situation include: using some kind of fill lighting to gently increase the illumination in shadow areas; using a graduated ND filter or gobo {{to reduce the amount}} of light coming from the highlight areas; or varying the exposure between multiple, otherwise identical, photographs (exposure bracketing) and then combining them afterwards in some kind of HDRI process.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the <b>useful</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> limits of three intraoral image receptors of different technology {{when exposed to}} different X-ray beam spectra, dose and dose rate levels. Study Design: A dental X-ray unit offering {{a wide range of}} tube potential, tube current and exposure time settings was used to expose a dental quality control phantom. The receptors that were used to capture the radiographic images of the phantom were: the Kodak Insight, the Kodak RVG- 6000 and the Duerr Vistascan system. The images that were produced over a wide range of exposure factor settings were evaluated in terms of diagnostic quality by three experienced radiologists. Results: The number of images with acceptable diagnostic quality was in total 1257; 310 with Insight, 331 with RVG 6000 and 616 with Vistascan. At 60 kV, diagnosable images were produced with doses ranging from 0. 44 - 1. 56 mGy for the Insight film 0. 44 - 2. 82 mGy for the RVG 6000 and 0. 22 - 4. 93 mGy for the Vistascan system. At 70 kV, the respective ranges were 0. 39 - 1. 28 mGy for the Insight film 0. 31 - 2. 55 mGy for the RVG 6000 and 0. 30 - 3. 46 mGy for the Vistascan system. Conclusions: The Vistascan exhibited the widest <b>useful</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> and required the least exposure to produce a diagnosable image at almost all tube potential settings. The RVG 6000 exhibited a slightly wider <b>useful</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> than the Insight film, with almost the same dose requirements especially in higher Kv settings...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to gain {{information concerning the}} mechanism by which a high contrast emulsion is developed to a significantly increased exposure latitude, without loss of toe speed. Developer properties were altered through variations in pH, bromide ion concentration, developing agent concentration, and the Phenidone */hydroquinone ratio. The {{results indicate that the}} bromide ion concentration is the predominant factor reducing both the exposure latitude and the toe speed. The experimental evidence suggests that the bromide reduces the rate of development throughout the <b>exposure</b> <b>range.</b> The other facts investigated produced primarily changes in development rate without affecting the latitude at a given contrast, until the rate and exposure are sufficient so that exhaustion of available silver occurs. The ability to increase the <b>useful</b> <b>exposure</b> scale without loss of toe speed depends upon maintaining a relatively constant rate of development over the desired <b>exposure</b> <b>range,</b> and having no soluble bromide present. *Ilford trademark...|$|R

The 1966 ANSI log <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> formula assumes that papers which have the same log <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> but differ in maximum density will print the same negative successfully. It has been shown with 27 Judges that when the 1966 ANSI log expo sure range formula is used the maximum density has an effect on the effective log <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> such that papers which have the same log <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> but differ in maximum density will not print the same negative successfully.

40|$|Purpose: To {{comparatively}} {{evaluate the}} per-formance of three intraoral image receptors of different technology {{when exposed to}} different X-ray beam spectra, dose and dose rate levels using a stepwedge phantom. Materials and methods: The intraoral radiographic receptors evaluated were: the Kodak Insight F speed class film, the Kodak RVG 6000, and the Duerr Vis-tascan Combi PSP system. A dental quality control phantom made of Plexiglas, containing an aluminium stepwedge with 12 steps and 7 holes drilled in each step was radiographed using a dental X-ray unit offering {{a wide range of}} tube potential, tube current and exposure time settings. The visibility of the holes in the images produced with each one of the three receptors was assessed by three independent observers. For each image the total image quality score (TS) was derived from the summation of the number of visible holes in each step. The numbers of perceptible holes in each experimental condition (TSs) were statistically analyzed through use of analysis of variance. Intraobserver and interobserver agree-ment was also measured. Results: Vistascan ex-hibited the most extended <b>useful</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>range,</b> followed by RVG 6000 and Insight. RVG 6000 exhibited the largest TS values in all tube potential settings except 70 kV where the Vistascan performed better. Insight performed better than Vistascan only at 60 and 63 kV. Vistascan performed better at 66 and 70 kV, Insight at 60 and 66 kV, whereas RVG performed equally well at all tube potential settings, except than at 52 and 70 kV. For the Insight the largest TS values were obtained with the smallest ESAK values whereas with the Vistascan the largest TS were obtained with ESAK values that where the largest observed. Conclusions: The performance of all receptors tested was greatly dependent on the exposure parameters and mainly on the kV settings. Overall, the RVG 6000 offered the best image quality at doses somewhere in between those required by the Insight and the Vistascan...|$|E

We examined associations for six primary traffic pollutants with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in 2003 – 2010 at small-area level using linear and piecewise linear Poisson regression models. In linear models most pollutants showed negative or null association with all-cause, cardiovascular or respiratory mortality.

OBJECTIVES: The main {{purpose of this study was}} to characterize relationships between levels of albumin adducts of these electrophiles in blood and the corresponding benzene exposures in benzeneexposed and control workers, after adjusting for important covariates. Because second blood samples were obtained from a subset of exposed workers, we also desired to estimate within-person and between-person variance components for the three adducts. METHODS: We measured albumin adducts and benzene exposures in 250 benzene-exposed workers (<b>exposure</b> <b>range,</b> 0. 26 – 54. 5 ppm) and 140 control workers (<b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> < 0. 01 – 0. 53 ppm) from Tianjin, China. Separate multiple linear regression models were fitted to the logged adduct levels for workers exposed to benzene < 1 ppm and ≥ 1 ppm. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate within-person and between-person variance components of adduct levels. RESULTS: We observed nonlinear (hockey-stick shaped) exposure–adduct relationships in log-scale, with inflection points between about 0. 5 and 5 ppm. These inflection points represent air concentration...|$|R

Methods: We conducted an internet survey {{of a national}} sample of 1031 youth, ages 13 – 20, who had consumed alcohol in the past 30 days. We ascertained all of the alcohol brands respondents con-sumed in the past 30 days, as well as which of 20 popular television shows they had viewed during that time period. Using a negative binomial regression model, we examined the relationship be-tween aggregated brand-specific exposure to alcohol advertising on the 20 television shows [ad stock, measured in gross rating points (GRPs) ] and youth brand-consumption prevalence, while controlling for the average price and overall market share of each brand. Results: Brands with advertising exposure on the 20 television shows had a consumption preva-lence about four times higher than brands not advertising on those shows. Brand-level advertising elasticity of demand varied by exposure level, with higher elasticity in the lower <b>exposure</b> <b>range.</b> The estimated advertising elasticity of 0. 63 in the lower <b>exposure</b> <b>range</b> indicates that for each 1 % in-crease in advertising exposure, a brand’s youth consumption prevalence increases by 0. 63 %...|$|R

To address this question, a database of sets of exposure-bracketed images was created. The image sets include <b>exposures</b> <b>ranging</b> from very underexposed to slightly overexposed. The color of the scene illumination was determined by taking an extra image of the scene containing 4 Gretag Macbeth mini Colorcheckers placed at an angle to one another.
