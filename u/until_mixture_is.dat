50|$|Mix {{turmeric}} {{powder and}} water in a small a small sauce pan and mix well. Turn the heat to low medium and stir constantly <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> a thick paste. This does not take long so don’t {{walk away from the}} pan. Once it is a paste add pepper and oil.|$|R
50|$|Batch gas {{blending}} {{requires the}} appropriate {{amounts of the}} constituent gases to be measured and mixed together <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> homogenous. The amounts {{are based on the}} mole (or molar) fractions, but measured either by volume or by mass. Volume measurement may be done indirectly by partial pressure, as the gases are often sequentially decanted into the same container for mixing, and therefore occupy the same volume. Weight measurement is generally used as a proxy for mass measurement as acceleration can usually be considered constant.|$|R
50|$|The {{chlorine}} in the perchlorate anion is {{a closed}} shell atom and is well {{protected by the}} four oxygens. Hence, perchlorate reacts sluggishly. Most perchlorate compounds, especially salts of electropositive metals such as sodium perchlorate or potassium perchlorate do not oxidize organic compounds <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> heated. This property is useful in many applications, such as flares, where ignition is required to initiate a reaction. Ammonium perchlorate is however different, being unstable even at room temperature. The PEPCON disaster destroyed a production plant for ammonium perchlorate.|$|R

50|$|On a {{high heat}} a pot is placed and then boiling water is added. Slowly, handfuls of wholemeal wheat are added and then are mixed quickly {{with a large}} wooden spoon so that clumps do not form. The process <b>is</b> {{repeated}} <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> very thick. Traditionally the cook lowers the pot to the floor where they wrap their flip-flops around the hot pot and start vigorously mixing the dough. Finally, using bare oiled hands the hot, steaming dough is shaped by the cook and usually placed in a wide, wooden bowl.|$|R
5000|$|Andalusian gachas, gachas andaluzas, are {{traditionally}} made of wheat flour. The {{traditional way of}} cooking them consists in frying garlic slices in olive oil until they are golden. Then the flour is added by sprinkling it over the hot oil {{with one hand and}} mixing well with the spoon <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> slightly roasted. Water is added then, pouring it very slowly, while stirring the mixture all the while without interrupting the bubbling. Salt and water are added to taste and desired consistency, the gachas being ready when they [...] "smell cooked".|$|R
50|$|Boba {{ice cream}} bars consist {{of ice cream}} and boba. A mixture of whole milk, heavy {{whipping}} cream, sugar, vanilla, and any additional flavors are mixed in a bowl <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> homogeneous.

5000|$|... "San Stè" [...] is a {{traditional}} cheese made in this town. This cheese {{is a far cry}} from the mass-produced confections found in the grocery store. It is produced by a small collection of families, and made in the identical fashion for centuries. [...] The cheese itself is produced from unpasteurized bovine whole milk principally from the Bruno-alpina or Cabannina cattle races, coagulated with veal rennet, either in paste or powder form, at about 35 C, mixing for 35 minutes, breaking apart large curds <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> curdled to the size of rice.

5000|$|Eggs are sieved, and whisked {{with water}} <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>are</b> {{completely}} blended in a cream-like consistency. Sometimes, kelp and/or anchovy broth {{is used in}} place of water for a richer flavor. Optional ingredients include mushrooms, peas, onions, Korean zucchini, carrots, and other vegetables for their own twist on the dish. The dish is then seasoned with saeu-jeot (salted shrimp), myeongnan-jeot (salted pollock roe), or salt, and optionally ground black pepper. Before served, it is topped with chopped scallions or crown daisy greens, gochutgaru (chili flakes) or sil-gochu (shredded dry red chili), and toasted sesame seeds.|$|R
50|$|One {{recipe for}} kue gapit from the Indonesian {{magazine}} Femina calls for wheat and rice flour, chicken eggs, coconut water, salt, sugar, and cinnamon. The egg is first beaten, then the cinnamon and sugar is mixed in. Once {{it has been}} absorbed by the mixture, the flour and salt is added, and this concoction is mixed further. After adding the coconut water, a tablespoon of the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> added to iron molds and grilled between them until cooked. This <b>is</b> repeated <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> used up. The resulting kue are then stored for later consumption. Generally, however, tapioca is used rather than this mix of flours. The kue can be eaten on its own, or as a side dish.|$|R
30|$|For {{the neat}} PC mix, the {{required}} amounts of resin and hardener were mixed together for 2 – 3  min using a low speed mixer, after which silica filling powder {{followed by the}} required coarse aggregate was added. Mixing continued for 2 – 3  min <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>was</b> uniform. For the three other mixes, MWCNTs {{were added to the}} required amount of the resin, and the mix was stirred for 2  h at 110  °C using magnetic stirring. This relatively high mixing temperature was used to reduce the resin viscosity and improve the dispersion of MWCNTs. The mix was then sonicated for 2 additional hours at 65  °C. During the sonication, sound waves are generated from the transducer and radiate through the liquid causing high and low pressures releasing high amount of energy and improving the dispersion of MWCNTs. The epoxy-MWCNTs nanocomposite was left to reach room temperature and then mixed with the hardener for 2 – 3  min. The required aggregates were added and mixing continued for 3 additional minutes <b>until</b> the PC <b>mixture</b> <b>was</b> uniform. All PC specimens were cured in air at 22  °C and 50  % relative humidity for 7  days as recommended by ACI Committee 548 (2009).|$|R
50|$|To {{make the}} dish, the kithul jaggery and thin coconut milk is mixed and boiled {{in a large}} pan <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> reduced to half the {{original}} amount. The rice flour, thick coconut milk {{and the rest of}} the ingredients are then added. It is necessary to continuously stir the mixture while simmering, to prevent it from burning and sticking to the pan. The oil that floats to the surface of the <b>mixture</b> must also <b>be</b> repeatedly removed. Once the mixture becomes thick, it is poured into a tray, pressed, and left to cool. This labour-intensive process can take up to nine hours. The firm kalu dodol is cut into pieces before serving.|$|R
50|$|Alaskan Indian {{ice cream}} is a dessert made of dried fish (esp. pike, sheefish or inconnu, {{whitefish}} or cisco, freshwater whitefishes) or dried moose or caribou meat and fat and berries (esp. cowberry, bilberry, cranberry, bearberry, crowberry, high-bush salmonberry, low-bush salmonberry, raspberry, prickly rose) or mild sweeteners such as roots of Indian potato or wild carrot mixed and whipped with a whisk or formerly hand made by Alaskan Athabaskans. Most common recipe for Indian ice cream consisted of dried and pulverized tenderloin of moose or caribou that was blended with moose fat in a birch bark container <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>was</b> light and fluffy.|$|R
50|$|Bubble and squeak is a {{traditional}} English dish made with the shallow-fried leftover vegetables from a roast dinner. The main ingredients are potato and cabbage, but carrots, peas, Brussels sprouts, or any other leftover vegetables can be added. The chopped vegetables (and cold chopped meat if used) are fried in a pan together with mashed potatoes or crushed roast potatoes <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> well-cooked and brown on the sides. The dish is so named because the cabbage makes bubbling and squeaking sounds during the cooking process. It is often served with cold meat from the Sunday roast, and pickles or brown sauce, or as an accompaniment to a full English breakfast.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{application}} of geopolymer as a coating was not widely explored by other researchers {{and therefore the}} study of kaolin based geopolymer coating applied on different types of clay substrate (unsintered and sintered) was carried out. The geopolymer coating paste were initially prepared by mixed the kaolin with alkaline activator (NaOH and Na 2 SiO 3) <b>until</b> homogeneous <b>mixture</b> <b>was</b> obtained. After that, the geopolymer paste then applied {{on the surface of}} clay substrates and left to cure at 80 oC for 24 hours and sintered at 800 oC respectively for 2 hours. Flexural, compression test and SEM for morphology analysis are studied. Based on the results obtained, it shows that kaolin based geopolymer coating can contribute in improving the substrate strength, while curing and sintering temperature applied to the geopolymer coating on different substrate can influence the interaction between substrate and geopolymer paste to diffuse according to SEM image proved...|$|R
5000|$|Carburetor icing {{occurs when}} there is humid air, and the {{temperature}} drop in the venturi causes the water vapor to freeze. The venturi effect can drop the ambient air temperature by 30-40 degrees F, therefore carburetor icing often occurs when the outside air temperature is in the 60-70 degree F range. Unfortunately, the warm air temperature often causes pilots to overlook the possibility of carb icing. The ice will form on the surfaces of the carburetor throat, further restricting it. This may increase the Venturi effect initially, but eventually restricts airflow, perhaps even causing a complete blockage of air to the carburetor. The engine begins to run more rich as ice formation increases. Without intervention (carb heat or leaning) this can only continue <b>until</b> the <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> outside of the [...] "chemically correct" [...] range for combustion. Icing may also cause jamming of the mechanical parts of the carburetor, such as the throttle, typically a butterfly valve.|$|R

40|$|A {{composite}} droplet made of two miscible fluids in {{a narrow}} tube generally moves under the action of capillarity <b>until</b> complete <b>mixture</b> <b>is</b> attained. This physical situation is analysed here on a combined theoretical and numerical analysis. The mathematical framework consists of the two-phase flow phase-field equation set, an advection-diffusion chemical concentration equation, and closure relationships relating the surface tensions to the chemical concentration. The numerical framework is composed of the COMSOL Laminar two-phase flow phase-field method coupled with an advection-diffusion chemical concentration equation. Through transient studies, we show that the penetrating length of the bidroplet system into the capillary tube is linear at early-time regime and exponential at late-time regime. Through parametric studies, we show {{that the rate of}} penetration of the bidroplet system into the capillary tube is proportional to a time-dependent exponential function. We also show that this speed obeys the Poiseuille law at the early-time regime. A series of position, speed-versus-property graphs are included to support the analysis. Finally, the overall results are contrasted with available experimental data, grouped together to settle a general mathematical description of the phenomenon, and explained and concluded on this basis...|$|R
