5|$|The Interim Committee {{held its}} first meeting on 9 May 1945. Stimson began by {{outlining}} its broad terms of reference, which included advising the President on wartime controls {{and the release of}} information, and making recommendations on post-war controls and policies related to nuclear energy, including legislation. The Interim Committee was not specifically charged with making recommendations on the military <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> but the composition of the committee and the close relationship between the wartime <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and post-war policies regarding them inevitably led to the Interim Committee's involvement.|$|E
5|$|World War II was {{the deadliest}} {{conflict}} in human history, marked by 50 million to 85 million fatalities, {{most of which}} were civilians in the Soviet Union and China. It included massacres, the deliberate genocide of the Holocaust, strategic bombing, starvation, disease and the first <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in history.|$|E
5|$|Collins {{discussed}} the possible <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in Korea with MacArthur in December, and later {{asked him for}} a list of targets in the Soviet Union in case it entered the war. MacArthur testified before the Congress in 1951 that he had never recommended the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> He did at one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|The September 1944 Hyde Park Agreement {{extended}} both {{commercial and}} military cooperation into the post-war period. The Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons {{would not be}} used against another country without mutual consent. On 4 July 1945, Wilson agreed that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as {{outlined}} in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of whom were civilians) and remain the only <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in the history of warfare.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1954, the North Atlantic Council {{approved}} MC 48, a key {{document in}} the evolution of NATO nuclear thought. MC 48 emphasized that NATO would have to use atomic weapons from the outset of a war with the Soviet Union whether or not the Soviets chose to use them first. This gave SACEUR the same prerogatives for automatic <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> as existed for the commander-in-chief of the US Strategic Air Command.|$|E

5|$|The French author Jules Roy {{suggests}} that Admiral Radford discussed with the French {{the possibility of}} using nuclear weapons in support of the French garrison. Moreover, John Foster Dulles reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Điện Biên Phủ, and a similar source claims that the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden was aware of the possibility of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in that region.|$|E
5|$|While Radford {{remained}} Eisenhower's {{principal adviser}} for the budget, they differed {{on matters of}} foreign policy. Radford advocated the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and a firm military and diplomatic stance against China. Early in his tenure, he suggested to Eisenhower a preventive war against China or the Soviet Union while the U.S. possessed a nuclear advantage and before it became entangled in conflicts in the Far East. Eisenhower immediately dismissed this idea.|$|E
5|$|Wilson {{announced}} that the British government concurred with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> against Japan, which would be officially recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee. As the release of information to third parties was also controlled by the Quebec Agreement, discussion then turned to what scientific details would be revealed in the press announcement of the bombing. The meeting also considered what Truman could reveal to Joseph Stalin, {{the leader of the}} Soviet Union, at the upcoming Potsdam Conference.|$|E

50|$|Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, {{conspiracy}} theories began that claimed a W41 nuclear bomb {{would be used}} to seal the oil well, despite the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> in the role having been officially rejected.|$|R
5|$|Allied forces {{then began}} {{preparing}} for the invasion of mainland Japan, Operation Downfall. I Corps was assigned as one of four Corps {{under the command of}} the Sixth Army, with a strength of 14 divisions. I Corps was to lead the assault on Miyazaki, in southern Kyūshū, with the 25th, 33rd, and 41st Infantry Divisions. Opposing them would be the Japanese 57th Army, with the 154th, 156th, and 212th Japanese Infantry Divisions. Before the assault could be launched, Japan surrendered, following the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|As {{commander}} of U.S. {{forces in the}} Philippines and Formosa, Radford accompanied President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower on his three-day trip to Korea in December 1952. Eisenhower was looking for an exit strategy for the stalemated and unpopular war, and Radford suggested threatening China with attacks on its Manchurian bases and the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> This view was shared by Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and UNC Commander General Mark W. Clark, but had not been acted on when the armistice came in July 1953, {{at a time when}} the Chinese were struggling with domestic unrest. Still, Radford's frankness during the trip and his knowledge of Asia made a good impression on Eisenhower, who nominated Radford to be his Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.|$|E
5|$|When General of the Army Douglas MacArthur took overall {{command of}} Pacific Forces, IX Corps {{was moved to}} Leyte in the Philippine Islands and was {{assigned}} to the Sixth United States Army in July 1945. In Leyte, the corps was tasked with the planning of Operation Downfall, the invasion of mainland Japan, specifically the island of Kyushu. It was also tasked with planning occupation once Japan surrendered. IX Corps was assigned as one of four Corps under the command of the Sixth Army, with a strength of 14 divisions. With the 77th Infantry Division, the 81st Infantry Division and 98th Infantry Division, a force of 79,000 men, IX Corps would serve as the Sixth Army's reserve force during the initial invasion. Before the assault could be launched, Japan surrendered in August 1945, following the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
50|$|On September 7, 1990, President Fernando Collor symbolically sealed an {{underground}} pit that was supposedly <b>used</b> for testing <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Chagan was {{a shot in}} the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy or Project 7, the Soviet {{equivalent}} of the US Operation Plowshare to investigate peaceful <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b> It was a subsurface detonation. It was fired on January 15, 1965. The site was a dry bed of the Chagan River {{at the edge of the}} Semipalatinsk Test Site, and was chosen such that the lip of the crater would dam the river during its high spring flow. The resultant crater had a diameter of 408 meters and was 100 meters deep. A major lake (10,000 m3) soon formed behind the 20-35 m high upraised lip, known as Chagan Lake or Balapan Lake.|$|R
50|$|Lady Parmoor {{acted as}} {{president}} of the World YWCA between 1924 and 1928, and helped to establish the Fellowship of Reconciliation. She was {{a founding member of the}} Women's International League for Peace and Freedom and became president of the organisation's British branch in 1950. Lady Parmoor actively served as vice-president of the National Peace Council and argued in favour of admitting China to the United Nations and negotiating an end to the Korean War. In 1948, Lady Parmoor wrote a pamphlet titled The Challenge of the Atomic Bomb, which was published by the Friends Peace Committee. At the age of 70, the Dowager Baroness Parmoor undertook a study <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> fission in order to speak out against the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{subcommittee}} of the S-1 Executive Committee, chaired by James B. Conant, and consisting of himself, Arthur Compton and Harold Urey, was appointed {{to look into the}} issue, and it similarly assessed the danger as low, but still sufficient to warrant taking some precautions. A program was initiated by the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago and the Victoreen Instrument Company in Cleveland to develop radiation detection devices suitable for use in the field. Some 48 portable detection meters were built in 1943, half of which were capable of detecting 0 to 10 roentgens per day, while the other half could detect from 0 to 100 roentgens per day. Instruments sets were stored at Manhattan District offices in Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., and the area engineer and some other officers were instructed in their use. A special team of scientists was created at the Metallurgical Laboratory who could respond to any reports of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> or radioactive poisons.|$|E
5|$|After the 96th Infantry Division secured Conical Hill, the 7th Infantry Division {{returned}} to the line. It pushed into positions on the southern Ozato Mura hills, where Japanese resistance was heaviest. It {{was placed on the}} extreme left flank of the Tenth Army, taking the Ghinen peninsula, Sashiki, and Hanagusuku, fending off a series of Japanese counterattacks. Despite heavy Japanese resistance and prolonged bad weather, the division continued its advance until 21 June 1945, when the battle ended, having seen 82 days of combat. The island and surrendering troops were secured by the next day. During the Battle of Okinawa, the soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division killed between 25,000 and 28,000 Japanese soldiers and took 4,584 prisoners. Balanced against this, the 7th Division suffered 2,340 killed and 6,872 wounded for a total of 9,212 battle casualties during 208 days of combat. The division was slated to participate in Operation Downfall as a part of XXIV Corps under the First United States Army, but these plans were scrapped after the Japanese surrendered following the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear weapons in Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> in Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E
50|$|Currently North Korean {{strategy}} is to construct as many underground facilities as possible for military use {{in the event of}} a US attack. The depth of underground facilities reaches 80 to 100 metres making them difficult to destroy even with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ukraine voluntarily gave {{up these}} {{and all other}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> during the early 1990s. This {{was the first time}} in history that a country voluntarily gave up the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> {{strategic}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons,</b> although the Republic of South Africa was dismantling its small tactical <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> program at about the same time.|$|R

5|$|When {{cooperation}} resumed {{after the}} Quebec agreement, the Americans' progress and expenditures amazed the British. The United States had already {{spent more than}} $1 billion ($ today), while in 1943, the United Kingdom had spent about £0.5 million. Chadwick thus pressed for British involvement in the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent and abandon any hopes of a British project during the war. With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honored. The British Mission that arrived in the United States in December 1943 included Niels Bohr, Otto Frisch, Klaus Fuchs, Rudolf Peierls, and Ernest Titterton. More scientists arrived in early 1944. While those assigned to gaseous diffusion left {{by the fall of}} 1944, the 35 working with Lawrence at Berkeley were assigned to existing laboratory groups and stayed {{until the end of the}} war. The 19 sent to Los Alamos also joined existing groups, primarily related to implosion and bomb assembly, but not the plutonium-related ones. Part of the Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. In June 1945, Wilson agreed that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.|$|E
25|$|Many anti-nuclear weapons groups {{cite the}} 1996 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice, Legality of the Threat or <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Weapons,</b> {{in which it}} found that 'the threat or <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> would {{generally}} be contrary {{to the rules of}} international law applicable in armed conflict'.|$|E
