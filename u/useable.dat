500|$|The {{film was}} shot {{primarily}} in the anamorphic format on 35mm film, with key sequences filmed on 65mm, and aerial sequences in VistaVision. Nolan did not shoot any footage with IMAX cameras as he had with The Dark Knight. [...] "We didn't feel {{that we were going}} to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly". In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using Showscan and Super Dimension 70 as potential large format high frame rate camera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format. Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics 35mm camera at speeds of up to 1000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed digital camera, but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. [...] "Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one <b>useable</b> piece and it didn't end up in the film. Out of the six times we shot with the Photo-Sonics camera and 35mm running through it, every single shot was in the movie." [...] Nolan also chose not to shoot any of the film in 3D as he prefers shooting on film using prime lenses, which is not possible with 3D cameras. Nolan has also criticized the dim image that 3D projection produces, and disputes that traditional film does not allow realistic depth perception, saying [...] "I think it's a misnomer to call it 3D versus 2D. The whole point of cinematic imagery is it's three dimensional... You know 95% of our depth cues come from occlusion, resolution, color and so forth, so the idea of calling a 2D movie a '2D movie' is a little misleading." [...] Nolan did test converting Inception into 3D in post-production but decided that, while it was possible, he lacked the time to complete the conversion to a standard he was happy with. In February 2011 Jonathan Liebesman suggested that Warner Bros were attempting a 3D conversion for Blu-ray release.|$|E

The treatment used rectilinear, precast concrete windows with large glass panels as the north façade of the North Building, and the east, west, and south façades of the East and West buildings. [...] The design team felt this preserved their goal of having large areas of glass face Independence Avenue. The North Building was also smaller than originally proposed. [...] Now just four stories high, it was pierced in the middle near both ends by columns designed to contain the mechanical equipment — making the structure look much more like a bridge or arch. Also gone were the identical high-rise structures extending down 10th Street. [...] The East Building now was an eight-story-high, block-like mass with an interior courtyard which presented a blank, windowless façade to Independence Avenue. [...] The West Building was now just two stories high, and contained a large auditorium as well as above-ground dining facilities. The proposed structure had [...] of gross space and [...] of <b>useable</b> space.|$|E

60|$|So much as {{that about}} a minor matter. The more {{important}} one is that, as you will both be glad to know, I have (in spite of a most damnable interruption of several weeks, this autumn, a detested compulsion to attend, for the time, to something else) got on so straight with the Book that three quarters of it are practically written, and four or five weeks more will see me, I calculate, {{at the end of}} the matter.... All the material I received from you has been of course highly useful--indispensable; yet, none the less, all of it put together was not material for a Biography pure and simple. The subject itself didn't lend itself to that, in the strict sense of the word: and I had to make out, for myself, what my material did lend itself to. I have, I think, made out successfully and happily; if I haven't, at any rate, it has not been for want of a great expenditure of zeal, pains, taste (though I say it who shouldn't!) and talent! But the Book will, without doubt, be an agreeable and, in a literary sense, really artistic and honourable one. I shall not have made you all so patiently, amiably, admirably wait so long for nothing.... I have looked at the picture, as it were, given me by all your material, as a picture--the image or evocation, charming, heterogeneous, and a little ghostly, of a great cluster of people, a society practically extinct, with Mr. and Mrs. Story, naturally, all along, the centre, the pretext, so to speak, and the point d'appui. This course was the only one open to me--it was imposed with absolute logic. The Book was not makeable at all unless I used the letters of other people, and the letters of other people were <b>useable</b> with effect only so far as I could more or less evoke and present the other people....|$|E

50|$|Energy- The {{physical}} but non-material inputs of production. We {{can place}} {{different forms of}} energy onto a scale of utility depending on how useful it is for creating a product.

In the process, however, electricity is converted to heat, a less useful form of energy). Like matter, energy can neither be created nor destroyed, and thus there is also an upper limit to the total amount <b>useable</b> energy.|$|E
