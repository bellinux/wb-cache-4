40|$|A desired {{speech signal}} in {{hands-free}} communication systems is often degraded by background noise and interferers. Data-dependent spatial filters for desired speech extraction {{depend on the}} power spectral density (PSD) matrices of the desired and the <b>undesired</b> <b>signals,</b> which are commonly estimated recursively using a signal model-based speech presence probability (SPP). The SPP and the PSD matrix estimates are only accurate, if the statistics of the <b>undesired</b> <b>signals</b> vary more slowly compared to the desired signal. In practical situations with competing talkers, this assumption is violated. To estimate the PSD matrices of highly non-stationary signals, we propose a minimum Bayes risk detector based on {{a model for the}} narrowband direction-of-arrival estimates.

50|$|There is {{an entire}} {{industry}} based on regulatory compliance: manufacturers shipping a product {{to a foreign}} country must comply with each country's limitations on leakage of interfering signals.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to also get a bad picture if the signal strength of the TV transmitter is too high. An attenuator inserted in the antenna lead-in wire may be used if the television receiver displays signs of overload in the RF front end. Strong out-of-band signals may also affect television reception and may require band-pass filters to reduce {{the level of the}} <b>undesired</b> <b>signal</b> at the receiver.|$|E
50|$|Because {{it costs}} money {{to filter out}} noise, {{there is always a}} balance struck between {{regulatory}} compliance and perfect filtering in these devices. Microwave ovens or devices with microprocessors may leak within allowable limits but may generate an <b>undesired</b> <b>signal</b> that interferes with something {{in the way of a}} licensed communications device. It also generally means that users who intentionally radiate signals (TV stations and cell phone companies) can order the device turned off if it interferes with their licensed operations.|$|E
50|$|As a consequence, {{the signal}} {{at one of}} the {{received}} single-polarization terminals actually contains a dominant quantity of the desired signal (meant to be transmitted onto one polarization) and a minor amount of <b>undesired</b> <b>signal</b> (meant to be transported by the other polarization), which represents an interference over the former. As a consequence, each received signal must be cleared of the interference level in order to reach the required signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SNIR) needed by the receiving stages, which may be of the order of more than 30 dB for high-level M-QAM schemes. Such operation is carried out by a cross-polarization-interference cancellation (XPIC), typically implemented as a baseband digital stage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{electromagnetic}} wave is intercepted by a tuned receiving antenna; this structure captures {{some of the}} energy of the wave and returns it to the form of oscillating electrical currents.

50|$|The {{design of}} such systems, however, is a {{complicated}} task. There are two main challenges in realizingmixed-signal ICs. The first challenging task, specific to RFICs, is to fabricate good on-chip passive elementssuch as high-Q inductors. The second challenging task, applicable to any mixed-signal IC and the subjectof this chapter, is to minimize noise coupling between {{various parts of the}} system to avoid any malfunctioningof the system. In other words, for successful system-on-chip integration of mixed-signal systems, thenoise coupling caused by nonideal isolation must be minimized so that sensitive analog circuits and noisy digital circuits can effectively coexist, and the system operates correctly. To elaborate, note that in mixed-signalcircuits, both sensitive analog circuits and high-swing high-frequency noise injector digital circuits may bepresent on the same chip, leading to <b>undesired</b> <b>signal</b> coupling between these two types of circuit via the conductive substrate. The reduced distance between these circuits, which is the result of constant technology scaling (see Moore's law and the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors),exacerbates the coupling. The problem is severe, since signals of different nature and strength interfere,thus affecting the overall performance, which demands higher clock rates and greater analogprecisions.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this article}} authors present an {{application}} of spatial processing methods for GPS spoofing detection and mitigation. In {{the first part of}} this article, a spoofing detection method, based on phase delay measurements, is proposed. Accuracy and precision of phase delay estimation is assessed for various qualities of received signal. Spoofing detection thresholds are determined. Efficiency of this method is evaluated in terms of probability of false alarm and probability of detection when 4 to 8 GPS signals are received. It is shown that the probability of spoofing detection is greater than 99 percent if carrier-to-noise ratio is at least 46 dBHz. The second part of the article presents a GPS spoofing mitigation method which uses spatial filtering (null-steering) for excision of <b>undesired</b> <b>signals.</b> Performance of this method is analyzed in various conditions. Attenuation of <b>undesired</b> <b>signals</b> is estimated to be at least 60 dB when their signal-to- noise ratio is high. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the spatial filtering influence on the availability of true signals is provided. Eventually, a concept of practical anti-spoofing system implementation is proposed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{multi-user}} detector that detects signals having different symbol rates, {{within a reasonable}} level of computational complexity. The proposed multi-user detector successively cancels <b>undesired</b> <b>signals</b> for each user in a received signal. In the proposed method, the <b>undesired</b> <b>signals</b> are band-limited using a band-pass filter for a desired signal, and the desired signal is detected from the band-limited signal. A replica of the desired signal is generated based on soft-output from a channel decoder and subtracted from the received signal in order to remove its influence on the signal detection of other users. Then, another user is detected by using the residual signal obtained by subtracting the replica signal. A performance comparison of the proposed method to a multi-user detector based on the maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) is presented based on the computer simulations. The computer simulation {{results show that the}} proposed method can separate the signals effectively, and that its BER performance for a narrow-band signal approaches that of the MLSE-based multi-user detector when the symbol rate ratio of the wide-band signal to the narrow-band signal becomes large...|$|R

30|$|Superposed {{multicarrier}} transmission {{scheme is}} known to improve frequency utilization efficiency when several wireless systems share the same spectrum. To suppress the effect of interference, forward error correction (FEC) metric masking is proposed. In this technique, the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) that corresponds to the superposed band is set to zero, because received bits that correspond to the superposed band are unreliable. However, to apply FEC metric masking, the information about superposed band must be known at the receiver beforehand. Furthermore, the received bits contain channel estimation errors, which are the cause of performance degradation. In this paper, we propose an iterative estimation technique for <b>undesired</b> <b>signal</b> power (noise, interference, and channel estimation error) for superposed multicarrier transmission. We use the estimated power of the <b>undesired</b> <b>signal</b> to calculate the LLR that takes the channel estimation error into account, since including this extra information about the channel improves the bit error rate (BER). The proposed scheme estimates the power of <b>undesired</b> <b>signal</b> on each subcarrier, and thus, the information about superposed band is not required. Simulation {{results show that the}} accuracy of estimating <b>undesired</b> <b>signal</b> becomes more reliable as the number of estimations increases, so that BER becomes better as a result of iterative estimation.|$|E

40|$|Hands-free {{capture of}} speech often {{requires}} extraction of sources {{from a certain}} spot of interest (SOI), while reducing interferers and background noise. Although state-of-the-art spatial filters are fully data-dependent and computed using the power spectral density (PSD) matrices of the desired and the <b>undesired</b> <b>signals,</b> the existing solutions to extract sources from a SOI are only partially data-dependent. Estimating the time-varying PSD matrices from the data is a challenging problem, especially in dynamic and quickly time-varying acoustic scenes. Hence, the spot signal statistics are often pre-computed based on a near-field propagation model, resulting in suboptimal filters. In this work, we propose a fully data-dependent spatial filtering framework for extraction of speech signals that originate from a SOI. To achieve position-based spatial selectivity, distributed arrays are used, which offer larger spatial diversity compared to arrays of closely spaced microphones. The PSD matrices of the desired and the <b>undesired</b> <b>signals</b> are updated at each time-frequency bin by using a minimum Bayes risk detector {{that is based on}} a probabilistic model of narrowband position estimates. The proposed framework is applicable in challenging multitalk situations, without requiring any prior information, except the geometry, location, and orientation of the arrays...|$|R
