6000|$|... "I believe you," [...] {{answered}} his brother. [...] "They came <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> their wheels {{and walked through}} the woods to do it. The question is, who are they?" ...|$|E

6000|$|There was a {{wry smile}} on Ormond's face when he spoke again: [...] "It's {{certainly}} a perilous position, and a somewhat unusual one. You and I--of all men--to be hung <b>up</b> <b>here</b> together <b>on</b> the brink of eternity.

I will admit that I have found {{most of the time}} <b>up</b> <b>here</b> wearisome. <b>On</b> the other hand, I am beginning to understand that I have been, and still am, very ignorant. There is so much in the world that one can only learn by experience." ...|$|R

60|$|Dunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, {{drowning}} their grief. A pause by the wayside. Tiptop {{position for}} a pub. Expect we'll pull <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> {{the way back to}} drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.|$|E
6000|$|Flora didn't protest; asking herself {{whether he}} {{imagined}} {{that he himself}} understood her so much better. Anthony dismissing his family out of his thoughts went on: [...] "Yes. Everything is yours. I have kept nothing back. As to {{the piece of paper}} we have just got from that miserable quill-driver if it wasn't for the law, I wouldn't mind if you tore it <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> now, <b>on</b> this spot. But don't you do it. Unless you should some day feel that--" ...|$|R

5000|$|... "The Black Sheep Boy is a fantastical {{character}} that crops <b>up</b> <b>here</b> and there <b>on</b> the album.

6000|$|... "I will {{introduce}} you, now, to Colonel Palmer. It {{is important that}} he should know you, for possibly you may be sent <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> some mission or other--for which, having the favour of Nana, you would be specially fitted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A very just remark," [...] added Cap, [...] "for that is {{the time}} of life when we all learn the catechism, and other moral improvements. The Sergeant's {{observation}} shows that he understands human nature, and I agree with him perfectly; it is a damnable thing for a youngster, <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> this bit of fresh water, to talk French. If it were down on the Atlantic, now, where a seafaring man has occasion sometimes to converse with a pilot, or a linguister, in that language, I should not think so much of it,--though we always look with suspicion, even there, at a shipmate who knows too much of the tongue; but <b>up</b> <b>here,</b> <b>on</b> Ontario, I hold it to be a most suspicious circumstance." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{went down}} the river to fetch him. The guvnor didn't {{want to give him}} a special at this time of night, but he just handed him a note, and we made things hum <b>up</b> <b>here.</b> He was <b>on</b> his way in half an hour. We have had to upset the whole of the night traffic to let him through without a stop." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'So am I,' {{continued}} the other; 'and {{it is the}} delight of my heart to tramp on people's corns. I will have nobody positive but myself; not one. I have crossed the whims, in my time, of kings and generals and great artists. And what would you say,' he went on, 'if I had come <b>up</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> purpose to cross yours?' ...|$|E

5000|$|Former Brisbane Broncos and Queensland State of Origin player Justin Hodges had {{endorsed}} the Northern Pride in a Cairns Post article before the match, stating, [...] "They {{may be a}} Cowboys feeder team but everyone knows they are a Cairns team and a Queensland team. They are a strong side and are a classy side that is coached very well. They have been the benchmark of the Queensland competition for years so I know they’ll go well. There is only them and the Broncos under-20 from <b>up</b> <b>here</b> playing <b>on</b> grand final day. So I reckon everyone in Queensland will be cheering them on." ...|$|R
