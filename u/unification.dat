5|$|Crucially, {{both the}} Wartburg rally in 1817 and the Hambach Festival in 1832 had lacked any {{clear-cut}} program of <b>unification.</b> At Hambach, {{the positions of}} the many speakers illustrated their disparate agendas. Held together only by the idea of <b>unification,</b> their notions of how to achieve this did not include specific plans but instead rested on the nebulous idea that the Volk (the people), if properly educated, would bring about <b>unification</b> on their own. Grand speeches, flags, exuberant students, and picnic lunches did not translate into a new political, bureaucratic, or administrative apparatus. While many spoke about the need for a constitution, no such document appeared from the discussions. In 1848, nationalists sought to remedy that problem.|$|E

40|$|The PhD {{outlines}} criteria {{under which}} a psychiatric classification merits belief and, {{as a case}} study, establishes that autism merits belief. Three chapters respond to anti-realist arguments, three chapters establish conditions under which psychiatric classifications merit belief. Chapter one addresses the pessimistic meta-induction. I historically analyse autism to show there has been sufficient historical continuity to avoid the pessimistic meta induction. Chapter two considers arguments from underdetermination. I consider the strongest candidate for an alternative to autism, classificatory changes which occurred between 1980 and 1985. I argue this does not constitute underdetermination because those changes were methodologically and evidentially flawed. Chapter three considers theory-ladenness. I consider the two strongest candidates for background theories which might have a negative epistemic effect (cognitive psychology and psychoanalysis). I show these have little influence on what symptoms are formulated or how symptoms are grouped together. Chapter four argues against psychiatric classifications as natural kinds and against notions that inductive knowledge of psychiatric classifications requires robust causes. I outline psychiatric classifications as scientific laws. They are high level idealised models which guide construction of lower level, more specific, models. This opens alternative routes to belief for psychiatric classification lacking robust causes. Chapter five shows that psychiatric classifications can set relevant populations for deriving statistically significant symptoms. The same behaviour can count as statistically significant for one psychiatric classification but not another. I argue this process strengthens psychiatric classifications inductively, thus contributing to belief. Chapter six bases belief on theoretical virtues. <b>Unifications</b> and causation are the two main theoretical virtues. Autism strongly exhibits <b>unifications,</b> stringently covering {{a wide range of}} otherwise unrelated symptoms. Additionally, emphasising causation may reduce <b>unifications</b> and thus reduce belief. Attributing <b>unifications</b> is reliable because autism is accessible without employing extremely complicated experimental processes and relies upon secure background theories...|$|R

Dahlmann himself died before <b>unification,</b> but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French revolutions, by casting these revolutions as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of <b>unification.</b>|$|E

5|$|For many, the Vatican's actions {{encapsulated}} {{all that}} {{was wrong with the}} Papal States and exposed pontifical rule as an anachronism.

The traditional Italian historiography of <b>unification</b> does not give much prominence to the Mortara case, which by the late 20th century was remembered mostly by Jewish scholars, but a 1997 study by the American historian David Kertzer has marked the start of a wider re-examination.|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} a new method for {{parallel}} logic programming, based on compilation of Tarnlund's inference system Reform, {{can be applied}} to the logic programming language Prolog.

INTRODUCTION Previous attempts at developing parallel Prolog systems have focused on exploiting AND-parallelism, or OR-parallelism, or both. In this work we parallelize Prolog by exploiting parallelism in its fundamental control structure: recursion. Our basic idea is that parallelization takes place across recursion levels: the recursion levels of a program, including the head <b>unifications</b> at each level, are computed in parallel.

The sophisticated operational semantics under dds -in computing head normal forms for total functions applications- makes necessary to develop a good debugging model which reflects the computational behaviour of programs, showing the different lazy <b>unifications</b> for demanded positions and the set of possible rules to apply depending on former lazy <b>unifications.</b> We present a debugging model based on Byrd's box model but incorporating new kind of boxes corresponding to the different steps followed by dds in computing goals. Moreover, the presented debugging model is also appropriate for other existing strategies for lazy narrowing, such as the naive strategy. 1 Introduction The amalgamation of lazy functions and higher order programming in a logic programming language raises special problem [...] ...|$|R
