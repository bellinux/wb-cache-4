25|$|In July 2012 Ofcom {{consulted}} on {{a scheme}} proposed by Royal Mail to alter its delivery obligations to allow larger postal items {{to be left}} with neighbours rather than returning them to a Royal Mail office to await collection. The scheme was presented as offering consumers greater choice for receiving mail when not at home, that is if Royal Mail deliver items as per their stated contractual obligations and was said to follow Royal Mail research from a 'delivery to neighbour' trial across six areas of the UK that showed widespread consumer satisfaction. In a statement dated 27 September 2012, Ofcom announced it would approve the scheme after noting that more goods were being purchased over the internet and that Royal Mail's competitors were permitted to leave undelivered items with neighbours. People who {{do not wish to}} have parcels left with neighbours, or to receive those of others, can opt out by displaying a free opt-out sticker near their letterbox. Royal Mail remains liable for <b>undeliverable</b> items until they are received by the addressee or returned to sender.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Wright, {{writing in}} The Guardian, commended the script of [...] "La Couchette", calling it [...] "a delight, with one line {{delivered}} by Jack Whitehall quite {{possibly the most}} gloriously tasteless you'll hear on television all year". Ferguson offered a similar view, saying that Whitehall delivered [...] "seriously <b>undeliverable</b> lines with entirely believable gusto". Tate said that though he found the revelation {{at the end of}} the episode fairly predictable, the [...] "writing and performances were so engaging that it hardly mattered". The episode was, for him, [...] "inventive" [...] and [...] "deliciously wicked". Similarly, though Billen considered the setting fairly unoriginal and the characters stereotypical, he said that the writers [...] "scored a laugh every few seconds and then a home run with a savage resolution". Patrick Mulkern, writing for Radio Times, described [...] "La Couchette" [...] as [...] "hilarious" [...] and [...] "sharply observed". He commended the cast, saying that Pemberton and Shearsmith [...] "give a mini-masterclass" [...] in their performances. Jones called the episode [...] "toilet humour with a twist", saying that [...] "It was Jorg's grunting and squatting that produced the episode's impressively grotesque climax, but it was Whitehall as Hugo who followed up with the instantly quotable line: 'We're going to need a bigger box!'" [...] Billen commended the cast, and Christine Brandel, writing for entertainment website PopMatters, described Gunning as one of the stand-out guest stars of the second series.|$|E

2500|$|During World War I, the paper's {{consistent}} antimilitarist stand {{brought it}} {{into conflict with}} the administration of President Woodrow Wilson and his Postmaster General Albert Burleson. The Leaders second class mailing privileges were withdrawn in October 1917 and the publication was banned from the United States mails, eliminating about 14,000 subscribers with one blow. In August 1918 the publication was deprived {{of the right to}} receive first class mail, with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication summarily returned to sender with the envelope stamped [...] "Mail to This Address <b>Undeliverable</b> Under Espionage Act." [...] The paper was twice raided by the U.S. Department of Justice and subscriber records were seized.|$|E
2500|$|The Leader, as an anti-war publication, {{drew the}} ire of the Wilson {{administration}} and its Postmaster General, Albert S. Burleson and in October 1917 had its Second Class mailing privileges revoked. In August 1918 the publication was deprived {{of the right to}} receive First Class mail, with all letters from subscribers and readers sent to the publication summarily returned to sender with the envelope stamped [...] "Mail to This Address <b>Undeliverable</b> Under Espionage Act." [...] Despite the attack, loyal Milwaukee readers and advertisers rallied around the paper with monetary donations and the publication survived the attack. Through it all, Work wrote extensively on anti-militarist themes including, according to his own testimony, four of the five editorials for which Victor Berger was indicted by a grand jury in Chicago in December 1918.|$|E
60|$|Chief {{among these}} motives was the {{overwhelming}} {{idea of the}} great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the <b>undeliverable,</b> nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things {{would not have been}} inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.|$|E
60|$|But {{with all}} this the people have made their way, {{because they have been}} intelligent, industrious, and in earnest. And as the people have made their way, so has the post-office. The number of its offices, the mileage it covers, its {{extraordinary}} cheapness, the rapidity with which it has been developed, are all proofs of great things done; and {{it is by no means}} standing still even in these evil days of war. Improvements are even now on foot, copied in a great measure from ourselves. Hitherto the American office has not taken upon itself the task of returning to their writers undelivered and <b>undeliverable</b> letters. This it is now going to do. It is, as I have said, shaking off from itself that terrible incubus, the franking privilege. And the expediency of introducing a money-order office into the States, connected with the post-office as it is with us, is even now under consideration. Such an accommodation is much needed in the country; but I doubt whether the present moment, looking at the fiscal state of the country, is well adapted for establishing it.|$|E
50|$|Canada Post sends mail {{which is}} not {{deliverable}} to the <b>Undeliverable</b> Mail Office (NUMO) at Mississauga, Ontario or North Sydney, Nova Scotia. Domestic mail which is still <b>undeliverable</b> after passing through NUMO is then destroyed, while incoming international <b>undeliverable</b> mail is returned to the country of origin.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, <b>undeliverable</b> mail is {{processed}} in the National Returns Centre in Belfast which holds 20 million <b>undeliverable</b> items, or {{in a smaller}} office in Portsmouth.|$|E
50|$|A {{dead letter}} office (DLO) is a {{facility}} within a postal system where <b>undeliverable</b> mail is dealt with. Mail {{is considered to}} be <b>undeliverable</b> when the address is invalid so it cannot be delivered to addressee, and there is no return address so it cannot be returned to the sender.|$|E
5000|$|... "Sending a {{large number}} of <b>undeliverable</b> {{messages}} (messages that bounce back)." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mail servers {{can handle}} <b>undeliverable</b> {{messages}} in four fundamentally different ways: ...|$|E
5000|$|Unfavorable fetal {{position}} or presentation (e.g., transverse lies) <b>undeliverable</b> without conversion before delivery.|$|E
5000|$|Free {{forwarding}} if recipient {{has filed}} change-of-address form, or return if the item is <b>undeliverable.</b>|$|E
50|$|At a DLO, mail {{is usually}} opened {{to try to}} find an address to forward to. If an address is found, the {{envelope}} is usually sealed using tape or postal seals, or enclosed in plastic bags and delivered. If the letter or parcel is still <b>undeliverable,</b> valuable items are then auctioned off while the correspondence is usually destroyed. Despite this practice, in the past some <b>undeliverable</b> envelopes were acquired by philatelists.|$|E
50|$|Dead letter offices go by {{different}} names in different countries. Other names include returned letter office or <b>undeliverable</b> mail office.|$|E
50|$|Dead letter mail or <b>undeliverable</b> mail is {{mail that}} cannot be {{delivered}} to the addressee or returned to the sender. This is usually {{due to lack of}} compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and return address, or the inability to forward the mail when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing <b>undeliverable</b> mail.|$|E
50|$|<b>Undeliverable</b> {{mail that}} could not be readily returned, {{including}} mail without a return address, is treated as dead mail at a Mail Recovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia or Saint Paul, Minnesota.|$|E
5000|$|In The Simpsons episode [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday", Springfield Elementary School visits {{their local}} Post Office and are {{treated to a}} piece of <b>undeliverable</b> mail from the dead letter office as a souvenir.|$|E
50|$|Maximum {{tolerable}} {{period of}} disruption (MTPOD) is {{the maximum amount}} of time that an enterprise's key products or services can be unavailable or <b>undeliverable</b> after an event that causes disruption to operations, before its stakeholders perceive unacceptable consequences.|$|E
50|$|Because a {{misspelling}} usually {{results in}} an <b>undeliverable</b> address, commonly misspelled words are corrected. These are typically city names and street names. Due to {{the large number of}} possible misspellings, not all of them can be accurately detected and corrected.|$|E
50|$|Boxbe {{appears not}} to be {{functioning}} since 10 Dec 2012. Emails to Boxbe support and to Randy Stewart (VP of Product) are returned as <b>undeliverable,</b> and the filtering service lets every Email through. Whether this is temporary or terminal is unknown.|$|E
50|$|A caging list, in {{the direct}} mail industry, {{is a list}} or {{database}} of addresses that is updated after a mailing program is completed, with notations on responses and corrections for addresses whose mail has been returned as <b>undeliverable</b> or has been forwarded.|$|E
5000|$|Variable {{envelope}} return path (VERP) is {{a technique}} used by some electronic mailing list software to enable automatic detection and removal of <b>undeliverable</b> e-mail addresses. It works by using a different return path (also called [...] "envelope sender") for each recipient of a message.|$|E
50|$|In Malta, <b>undeliverable</b> mail was sorted in the General Post Office in Valletta. The {{facility}} was initially known as Returned Letter Branch, but later {{on it was}} {{also referred to as}} Returned Letter Office or Dead Letter Office. Various postal markings were used at the facility from 1889 onwards.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Dianis sued to {{stop the}} Republican National Committee from {{engaging}} in potential voter suppression tactics in Ohio. These tactics included the RNC’s mass mailings to registered voters, designed so that unreturned or <b>undeliverable</b> mail {{could be used to}} challenge those voters’ names remaining on the registration rolls.|$|E
50|$|Usually, a {{political}} party will send out non-forwardable, first-class mail to voters or particular voters they want to target (often {{assumed to be a}} demographic that belongs to the opposing party). It will compile a list of voters for whom mail has been returned as <b>undeliverable.</b> The list is called a caging list. In some cases, such mail can be returned at a rate of 1 in every 15 letters sent out, as shown in Ohio in 2008 when the Board of Elections had 600,000 letters of voter confirmation returned as <b>undeliverable.</b> The party uses caging lists created by themselves or by the Board of Elections to challenge the registration status of voters and potentially purge them from the voting rolls under state laws that allow voters whose registrations are suspect to be challenged.|$|E
5000|$|Tracing <b>undeliverable</b> mailIt {{is a sad}} {{fact that}} during war {{battlefield}} casualties invariably produce large quantities of <b>undeliverable</b> mail. In the field, such mail that comes to hand in the units was checked against unit records and disposed of appropriately. [...] Unit mail {{which could not be}} delivered for whatever reason was returned to the Army Post Office (APO) or Field Post Office (FPO), and sent back to postal detachments located at the formation's 2nd Echelon. These detachments checked the mail against the Field Records. Mail that could not be dealt with was returned to the Return Letter Branch (RLB) at HPC RE for further searching and consultation with the Records Office of the appropriate arm. If that proved unsuccessful the letter was eventually returned to the sender.|$|E
5000|$|Return Address (party sending mail): A {{return address}} tells the USPS where the sender wants the mail {{returned}} {{if it is}} <b>undeliverable.</b> Usage of a return address is required for some postal services (including Priority Mail, Express Mail, Periodicals in envelopes or wrappers, Insured Mail, Registered Mail, and parcel services).|$|E
50|$|The term corner card {{means the}} wording, {{sometimes}} with a pictorial feature, {{in the upper}} left hand corner of a postal stationery envelope or an envelope designed to have regular adhesive stamps affixed to it. It is there {{for the purpose of}} stating the sender's return address to facilitate the return of <b>undeliverable</b> mail.|$|E
5000|$|A Nixie {{is a name}} {{given by}} the United States Postal Service {{to a piece of}} mail which is <b>undeliverable</b> as addressed. It is derived from [...] "nix", English slang for the German nichts ("nothing"), and [...] "-ie", an item or a thing. ("Nix" [...] used in English c. 1780-1790, [...] "Nixie" [...] c. 1880-1885.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The Hanbali school {{defined it}} as [...] "that whose {{consequences}} are unknown" [...] or [...] "that which is <b>undeliverable,</b> whether it exists or not." [...] Ibn Hazm of the Zahiri school of jurisprudence wrote [...] "Gharar {{is where the}} buyer {{does not know what}} he bought, or the seller does not know what he sold." ...|$|E
50|$|The Republican National Committee {{also sent}} letters to {{minority}} areas in Cleveland, Ohio. When 35,000 letters were returned as <b>undeliverable,</b> the party employed poll watchers {{to challenge the}} voters' right to vote. Civil liberties groups challenged the RNC {{in a case that}} went to the Supreme Court, but the RNC was not stopped from challenging the voters.|$|E
