We {{consider}} the interpretations of notions of access control (permissions, interdictions, obligations, and <b>user</b> <b>rights)</b> as run-time properties {{of information systems}} specified as event systems with fairness. We give proof rules for verifying that an access control policy is enforced in a system, and consider preservation of access control by refinement of event systems. In particular, refinement of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> is non-trivial; we propose to combine low-level <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> and system obligations to implement high-level <b>user</b> <b>rights.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{a process}} of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> management implemented at Šiauliai region state tax inspection, and describes difficulties and problems of the said process if it’s not computer-integrated. To solve such problems, the proper way of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> management process should be selected according to process requirements and software and hardware resources owned by an institution. After comparative analysis of today’s market products, a decision of creating new system has been made. The system has been developed, realized, tested, {{the quality of the}} system has been estimated and possibilities of its further improvement have been discussed. <b>User</b> <b>rights</b> management information system enables to keep record of institution’s software, <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> management documentation, and <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> provided by appropriate software. It helps to share information accumulated by the system more efficiently and ensures better functioning of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> management process, while formation, keeping and record of necessary documentation is much easier...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{the extension of}} fair event system specifications by concepts of access control (prohibitions, <b>user</b> <b>rights,</b> and obligations). We give proof rules for verifying that an access control policy is correctly implemented in a system, and consider preservation of access control by refinement of event systems. Prohibitions and obligations are expressed as properties of traces and are preserved by standard refinement notions of event systems. Preservation of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> is not guaranteed by construction; we propose to combine implementation-level <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> and obligations to implement high-level <b>user</b> <b>rights...</b>|$|R

5000|$|It is {{important}} to recognize that there are both private and public 'rights' associated with the water, but that ownership of the water under common law is likened to claiming to [...] "own" [...] sunlight. Water must be legally appropriated before it is 'owned', and regulations on appropriation are typically controlled by government agencies and case laws. Who has domain over water is typically based on who owns the underlying soils, but Local, State and Federal regulations often limit the amount and type of uses to which water can be used in order to protect downstream <b>users</b> <b>rights.</b> At some point, before the water reaches the ocean it amasses sufficient size that the underlying lands become owned by the Nation or State in which they are situated.

40|$|Individual {{transferable}} quota (ITQ) institutions {{should be}} designed to minimize two types of transaction costs. First, to minimize the costs of transferring ITQ rights among rights-holders and <b>users,</b> <b>rights</b> should be separated into three components: a permanent entitlement share, an annual catch allocation, and a license to fish. Second, ITQ rights can reduce the transactions costs for development of self-governance by owners both by specifying a non-unanimous voting rule (preferably one-share/one-vote) and also by delineating clear standards for devolution of responsibility from government. These same two principles for reduction of transactions costs can be applied, with slight variation, to individual transferable input systems.

40|$|This paper takes a {{different}} perspective on the market versus government debate. This debate is often too general, too political and not fruitful. Starting from the assumption that many actors make decisions about changes in land use and that those decisions have to be coordinated in some ways, three models of coordination (market, hierarchy and network) are identified. These models, which in practice are often mixed, represent different ways of coordinating decisions about changing the content of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> and/or changing the ownership of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> in order to change land use. Which model is 'best' cannot be determined in general, but has to be evaluated by comparing the performance of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> regimes...|$|R

40|$|SummaryWe {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between tenure and forest income in 271 villages throughout the tropics. We find that state-owned forests generate more forest income than private and community-owned forests both per household and per hectare. We explore whether forest income varies according {{to the extent of}} rule enforcement, and congruence (i. e., overlap of <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> between owners and users). We find negative associations between enforcement and smallholder forest income for state-owned and community forests, and positive associations for privately owned forests. Where <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> are limited to formal owners we find negative associations for state-owned forests. Overlapping <b>user</b> <b>rights</b> are positively associated with forest income for community forests. Our findings suggest that policy reforms emphasizing enforcement and reducing overlapping claims to forest resources should consider possible negative implications for smallholder forest income...|$|R

40|$|Mega-hydraulic {{projects}} tend {{to produce}} severe {{social and environmental}} impacts, with burdens and benefits unevenly distributed among different social groups, regions, and scales. This triggers socioenvironmental conflicts, since "territory" has incommensurable functions and values for the diverse parties. This article examines the dominant human-nature interactions that underlie recent hydropower developments and the reconfiguration of the hydrosocial network in Colombia's Sogamoso basin. We use the Echelon of Rights Analysis (ERA) to examine conflicts over hydrosocial patterning, involving struggles over resources, norms, authority, and discourses. The Sogamoso mega-project highlights how modernist policies discursively frame clean energy, sustainable development, and public utility, while breaking up existing socioecological relationships and aligning water <b>users,</b> <b>rights,</b> and uses in new hydro-political network hierarchies. In Sogamoso, hydropower development discourse ends up declaring local subsistence activities illegal while denying existing rights frameworks. Therefore, crucial questions about water rights, legitimacy, and justice remain unasked and unanswered within political arenas...|$|E
