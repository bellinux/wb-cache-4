I asked for clarification– after all, Run DMC and LL Cool J are {{considered}} old-school, but technically, they invented the new school. The response: 'I don't know, some Tribe Called Quest or something.' After gently picking my jaw from off the floor, I turned back to my crates and wondered to myself, 'If Tribe is old-school, what does that make Kurtis Blow? In utero?'"—Oliver Wang, [...] "Book report", San Francisco Bay Guardian, April 6, 2003.|$|E
500|$|An African hip hop and hip hop song, {{the track}} {{was written by}} the two musicians while {{production}} was handled by disc jockey CedSolo. The recording lyrically finds Sarkodie discussing that he's the [...] "new guy" [...] in the music industry. [...] "New Guy" [...] displays Sarkodie and Ace Hood alternate verses atop several synth chords and military drum-like sounds, which drew comparisons to {{the works of the}} track's producer, CedSolo. Sarkodie sings during the track's refrain: [...] "Ace, let me take you to Africa / My people, they'll love you". He also believes that his music is for the Ghanaian people and has the motivation to become a leader in the industry: [...] "So I grind Sunday to Monday / Because there's no role models, there's no true leaders left / So it's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make sure the world know that I'm that new guy / I'm that inspiration".|$|E
500|$|Burnley is {{the primary}} {{songwriter}} in the band. Music industry attorney and author Martin Frascogna writes that [...] "it's unmistakably clear that Burnley started the group, is the creative force behind the group and essentially dictates the group's decisions." [...] Bands such as Nirvana, Live, Bush, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Beatles have been cited as influences. Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute, it was [...] "always left <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> put all the pieces together and make it so that it's even anything at all." [...] However, Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his [...] "writing partner" [...] during Dear Agony, and that {{he looked forward to}} writing with him in the future. After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup, Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn, writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks. Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future, and that [...] "It just so happens that when they came on board for this album, I was already 95 percent done", adding, [...] "I'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together." ...|$|E

5000|$|The British novelist Martin Booth {{wrote in}} his 2004 autobiographical Gweilo: Memories of a Hong Kong Childhood: [...] "the bellow of a cow in the Kennedy Town {{abattoir}} might lift <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> - <b>to</b> be abruptly cut short".|$|R

500|$|Drums on [...] "Satan's Bed" [...] were {{performed}} by Abbruzzese's drum tech Jimmy Shoaf. On {{the day it}} was recorded, Abbruzzese was in the hospital having his tonsils removed. Vedder and Gossard asked for Shoaf's help to get a drum machine working, and after setting it up, the pair asked Shoaf to perform the same beat on the drums. He is credited on the lyric sheet as [...] "Jimmy". Months after finishing the initial recording sessions for Vitalogy, Abbruzzese was fired in August 1994 due to personality conflicts with the band members. Gossard said, [...] "It was the nature of how the politics worked in our band: It was <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say, 'Hey, we tried, it's not working; time to move on.' On a superficial level, it was a political struggle: For whatever reason his ability to communicate with Ed and Jeff was very stifled. I certainly don't think it was all Dave Abbruzzese's fault that it was stifled." [...] Jack Irons, the original drummer for the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Abbruzzese's successor, plays drums on [...] "Hey Foxymophandlemama, That's Me". Gossard said, [...] "Jack entered the band right at the end of making Vitalogy. Jack's a breath of fresh air, a family man. Everybody had a strong sense of friendship with him immediately. He was just there to play drums and help out." ...|$|E

"We {{were playing}} a Shield game in Queensland and I threw my arm out {{on the day before}} the match," [...] he recalls. “I lost a lot of power, and a lot of things I could do before I wasn’t able to do. So I {{probably}} changed my technique after that to get more side-on, but I probably got more back-on. I was coming in to bowl but I was facing the wrong way. I thought I was doing the right thing by changing things, but it didn’t work... Nowadays I would’ve had a shoulder operation... I got told I could have one, but it was really <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> organise.” ...|$|E
5000|$|In a July 2010 interview, Glass Harp bassist Daniel Pecchio {{commented on}} the ongoing Hendrix rumors saying [...] "It's a true urban legend. I still have people coming <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> {{claiming}} <b>to</b> have a Dick Cavett Show tape where Hendrix says that. We never pushed that rumor, you know, but it didn't hurt us." ...|$|R

I went into the church, and I crossed myself before the altar and said a prayer or two. As I did so who should come out of the vestry but the father himself. He waited until I had done and then came <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and <b>to</b> my {{surprise}} said in good Irish: ...|$|R
2500|$|To be honest, I wasn't {{very smart}} about things. At that stage I was still {{averaging}} 40 after nine Tests {{or so and}} with the Packer players away, {{most of the other}} guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I thought it was <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> compete with the Packer boys. When the Packer catchcry was [...] "Lillee getting wickets and Hookesy clearing pickets" [...] I felt that anyone who was coming to watch me play needed to be entertained. I probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I should have been more circumspect. In a lot of cases I was happy to get out for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys.|$|E
2500|$|Underwood and {{her husband}} made a video for the [...] "Do It for Daron" [...] {{campaign}} urging young people to stop bullying. In July 2012, she publicly endorsed same-sex marriage. She told the British newspaper The Independent, [...] "As a married person myself, I don't know what it's like to be told I can't marry somebody I love and want to marry," [...] she said. [...] "I can't imagine how that must feel. I definitely think we should all {{have the right to}} love, and love publicly, the people that we want to love." [...] Underwood went on to say, [...] "Our church is gay-friendly. Above all, God wanted us to love others. It's not about setting rules, or [...] 'everyone has to be like me'. No. We're all different. That's what makes us special. We have to love each other and get on with each other. It's not <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> judge anybody." ...|$|E
2500|$|From a New York Times {{interview}} in 1942: [...] "When the war started... {{felt that it}} was <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do something, and the only thing I know is show business. I went around during the last war and I saw that the boys needed something besides chow and drills. I knew the same was true today, so I told the people in Washington that I would go anywhere and do an act for the Army." [...] Shortly after the war began, he wrote a letter to Steven Early, press secretary to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, volunteering [...] "to head a committee for the entertainment of soldiers and said that he [...] "would work without pay... would gladly assist in the organization to be set up for this purpose". A few weeks later, he received his first tour schedule from the newly formed United Services Organization (USO), [...] "the group his letter to Early had helped create".|$|E

6000|$|Something, however, {{was soon}} said that put all else {{out of his}} sisters' minds. The Captain turned to them with his merry smile, saying, [...] "Pray what would Miss Susie and Miss Bessie say <b>to</b> coming <b>up</b> <b>to</b> London with <b>me</b> <b>to</b> see Mamma?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, the Lakers played the New Orleans Hornets, a team they beat four times in the regular season. The Lakers lost 109–100 in their opener in the playoffs to the Hornets, who were led by Chris Paul and his 33 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds. The Lakers had not lost a playoff opener at home in 15 years. Bryant had 34 points on 13-for-26 shooting, while Gasol had eight points on two-of-nine shooting, six rebounds, zero {{offensive}} rebounds and poor defense on pick-and-roll plays. [...] "It's <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> get myself going, be more aggressive, get myself into rhythm", Gasol said. [...] "He's not naturally aggressive", Bryant said. Bynum and Barnes played after injuries at the end of the regular season, while Blake remained out with the chicken pox. The Lakers won Game 2, 87–78, led by Bynum's 17points and 11rebounds. [...] Odom scored 16points, and Artest added 15. [...] Bryant had only 11points, but insisted to Jackson that he guard Paul, who finished with 20points and nineassists. Gasol had eight points and five rebounds, and shot just four-for-19 from the field in the first two games. Blake returned in Game 2 and did not score but had five assists and three rebounds. Bryant scored 30points, Gasol added 17points and 10rebounds, and the Lakers won Game 3 in New Orleans, 100–86. Bryant again helped to defend Paul, who had 22points, eight assists, and five turnovers. The Lakers lost 93–88 in Game 4 as Paul had 27points, 15assists and 13rebounds and the smaller Hornets outrebounded the Lakers 39–32 and held a 20–4 advantage second-chance points. Bryant was scoreless in the first half, shooting 0–7, and he finished with 17points on 5–18 shooting. Bryant sprained his left ankle with 1:32 remaining in the game, and used crutches to leave the arena. Bryant, after refusing to get an MRI exam and X-rays, played in Game 5 and had two spectacular dunks in a 106–90 victory. The larger Laker front line helped the team regain control in rebounds with a 42–25 advantage over the Hornets, resulting in a 22–2 disparity in second-chance points. Bynum had 18 points and 10 rebounds. The Lakers won the series 4–2 with a 98–80 win in Game 6. Bryant scored 22 of his 24 points in the first three quarters, and Bynum had 18points and 12rebounds. The Lakers again outrebounded New Orleans, 43–30, and held the advantage in second-chance points, 21–4. Paul had 10 points, 11 assists and eight rebounds. Hornets head coach Monty Williams said, [...] "Kobe's Kobe, but I thought Bynum decided the series. He was that good." ...|$|E

6000|$|So {{the girl}} {{passed through the}} gates, bearing a white flag to show {{she was on a}} mission of peace, and came to Glinda's tent.

If this is done I will not molest her farther." ...|$|R
5000|$|About the structure—cited as {{the best}} of 1965 by the American Institute of Architects (AIA)—Bartos offered: [...] "The scrolls are not visual as a Rembrandt is visual.

60|$|We talked {{these matters}} over {{during the week}} we were on board the sloop; {{and by the time}} we came in sight of the {{steeples}} of Albany, my men's minds were made <b>up</b> <b>to</b> follow <b>me</b> <b>to</b> the Nest. These steeples were then two in number, viz.: that of the English church, that stood near the margin of the town, against the hill; and that of the Dutch church, which occupied an humbler site, on the low land, and could scarcely be seen rising above the pointed roofs of the adjacent houses; though these last, themselves were neither particularly high nor particularly imposing.|$|R

Broadrick recalls the breakdown as a [...] "real Brian Wilson moment" [...] and said that he [...] "felt paralyzed by the stress, which had been building for several months, and I literally couldn't get out of bed.
