5000|$|T. s. duponti: Luzon. Dark {{green with}} yellow collar. Yellowish <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b> Iris red.|$|R
5000|$|L. l. salvadorii: Northwest {{coast of}} Papua New Guinea. Like erythrothorax but with blue-black <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} {{yellow-billed hornbill}} flies powerfully. It alternates short gliding periods with heavy wing beats. The southern yellow-billed hornbill lacks the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> which enhances {{the flow of}} air when it flies.|$|R
50|$|The Santa Marta antpitta is 18 cm {{long and}} is brown above with eye ring. Its underparts are white {{streaked}} brown, except for bright buff throat, brownish flanks and cinnamon buff <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|L. l. lory: West Papuan {{islands and}} Bird's Head Peninsula. Blue of nape, mantle, and belly merge to cover most {{of body and}} are purple-blue. Red <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b> Juvenile resembles erythrothorax or cyanuchen.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight is}} slow, with the neck retracted. This is {{characteristic}} of herons and bitterns, and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, and spoonbills, which extend their necks. The white <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are striking in flight.|$|R
50|$|The bald parrot is a medium-small, overall green parrot with a bald, brownish-orange head. As {{several other}} members of the genus Pyrilia, it has red <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> that barely are visible when perched, but highly {{conspicuous}} in flight.|$|R
40|$|Here we analyse {{aeroelastic}} {{devices in}} {{the wings of a}} steppe eagle Aquila nipalensis during manoeuvres. Chaotic deflections of the upperwing coverts observed using video cameras carried by the bird (50 frames s(- 1)) indicate trailing-edge separation but attached flow near the leading edge during flapping and gust response, and completely stalled flows upon landing. The <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> deflect automatically along the leading edge at high angle of attack. We use high-speed digital video (500 frames s(- 1)) to analyse these deflections in greater detail during perching sequences indoors and outdoors. Outdoor perching sequences usually follow a stereotyped three-phase sequence comprising a glide, pitch-up manoeuvre and deep stall. During deep stall, the spread-eagled bird has aerodynamics reminiscent of a cross-parachute. Deployment of the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> is closely phased with wing sweeping during the pitch-up manoeuvre, and is accompanied by alula protraction. Surprisingly, active alula protraction is preceded by passive peeling from its tip. Indoor flights follow a stereotyped flapping perching sequence, with deployment of the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> closely phased with alula protraction {{and the end of the}} downstroke. We propose that the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> operate as an automatic high-lift device, analogous to a Kruger flap. We suggest that the alula operates as a strake, promoting formation of a leading-edge vortex on the swept hand-wing when the arm-wing is completely stalled, and hypothesise that its active protraction is stimulated by its initial passive deflection. These aeroelastic devices appear to be used for flow control to enhance unsteady manoeuvres, and may also provide sensory feedback...|$|R
50|$|This is {{a medium}} size parrot (31 cm), {{primarily}} green {{except for a}} light blue rear crown and nape, pale blue lower back and rump, scalloped shoulders with orange-brown on black coverts, and blackish underwings with green <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sri Lankan {{and south}} Indian {{population}} is smaller and has unstreaked buff <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b> A 2008 study {{based on the}} geographic isolation and differences in call suggest that this {{be treated as a}} full species, Nisaetus kelaarti, Legge's hawk-eagle.|$|R
5000|$|L. l. erythrothorax: The whole south {{coast of}} New Guinea east of Bird's Head Peninsula, and the SE north coast. Blue nape almost forms collar, blue comes halfway up belly. Yellow on wings. Blue mantle in two bands. Red <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Eleonora's falcon is {{an elegant}} bird of prey, 36 - 42 cm long with an 87 - 104 cm wingspan. It is {{shaped like a}} large Eurasian hobby or a small slender {{peregrine}} falcon, with its long pointed wings, long tail and slim body. There are two colour morphs: The adult dark morph is all sooty brown, with black <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b> The light morph {{is more like a}} juvenile Eurasian hobby, but has buff underparts, and also shows the contrast between the black <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> and paler base to the flight feathers. Young birds are also like a large juvenile hobby, but the pale underparts contrast with darker wingtips and wing coverts. The call is a typical falcon kek-kek-kek.|$|R
50|$|Its highly {{iridescent}} plumage is striking, being largely bluish-purple {{below and}} on the crown, greenish-blue on the back, green on the upperwing coverts, and rufous on the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b> In poor light it may appear all black, except for the strongly contrasting white outer rectrices.|$|R
50|$|This {{species was}} almost indistinguishable from its relative, Leach's storm petrel. In the field, {{they could not}} be told apart except by their annual rhythm. In the hand, the Guadalupe storm petrel could be {{distinguished}} by slightly larger size and the paler <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Females {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to identify as they share a pattern common to many falcons, but are distinctive in having an orange eye-ring, a red cere and reddish orange feet. Juveniles can be confused only with those of the red-footed falcon, but lack the buffy <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The red-fronted parrotlet (Touit costaricensis) is {{a parrot}} in Central America in Costa Rica and Panama. It is 15 cm, green {{with a short}} tail, red forehead, lores, and under eye, red {{shoulders}} and leading edge of underwing, and the remaining <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> yellow. Edges of tail also yellowish.|$|R
50|$|Boissonneaua {{is a small}} genus of {{hummingbirds}} in the Trochilidae family. They {{are found}} in humid Andean forests from western Venezuela to southern Peru. They have a straight black bill, contrasting outer rectrices, and a distinctive habit of quickly lifting both wings up shortly after landing, thereby revealing their rufous <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is a {{large and}} {{distinctive}} thrush. The male has black from the chin to the breast with a greyish black tail. The upperparts are grey and the underparts are whitish with orange-red <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts.</b> Females and immatures are similar but the black on the throat and breast is replaced with dusky streaking.|$|R
50|$|Adult white-lined tanagers are 18.5 cm {{long and}} weigh 33 g. They are long-tailed {{and with a}} mostly black stout pointed bill. The adult male is glossy black, apart from white <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> and a small white patch on the upperwing. These white areas are {{conspicuous}} in flight but otherwise rarely visible. Females and immatures are entirely rufous in plumage, somewhat paler below.|$|R
50|$|In {{colouring}} {{it resembles}} a female northern wheatear {{but it is}} larger at 15 - 16.5 cm in length, more upright and more tawny in colour, and has more black on its tail. The term isabelline refers to the parchment-like colouration. The axillaries and <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are white, whereas in the commoner bird they are mottled with grey. The sexes are similar.|$|R
50|$|The 15-17 cm long {{banded martin}} has earth-brown upper parts, {{except for a}} white stripe above the eye. Its underparts are white, as are the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts,</b> {{and it has a}} dark brown breast band, and {{sometimes}} a thin dark line across the vent. Sexes are similar, but the young have a paler breast band and golden tips to the upper part feathers.|$|R
5000|$|The adult Cassin's hawk-eagle has {{dark brown}} upperparts, with white spots and a brown tail with three black bars {{and a broad}} black subterminal band. The tarsi are white with black streaks, and the underparts are white with black blotches {{along the sides of}} the lower breast.

Body and <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are dark chestnut brown with black streaks and spots. The throat exhibits a buffish-white hue. The <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are greyish white and spotted black. The head of the females is stronger chestnut coloured. The underparts are more spotted and the tail is brown with black bars. Both sexes exhibits a slate grey bill with a black tip. The cere is yellow. The legs are either yellow or bright orange (rufous morph). The juveniles are similar coloured as the females.|$|R
50|$|The African hawk-eagle is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} eagle at about 55-65 cm in length. The upper parts are blackish. Its underparts are white heavily streaked with black. The underwing flight feathers are white with a black trailing edge. The <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are mostly black with white spots. Sexes are similar, but young birds are brown above and rufous coloration replaces the black underparts of the adult.|$|R
50|$|The sexes appear fairly similar, but {{the adult}} male can be {{distinguished}} from the female by its slimmer body and narrower wings. The breast band of the male is also weaker {{than that of the}} female, or is non-existent, and the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> of the male are more uniformly pale. It is straightforward to determine the sex in a breeding pair, but harder with individual birds.|$|R
50|$|This large vulture is of a creamy-buff colour, with {{contrasting}} dark flight- and tail-feathers. The {{adult is}} paler than the juvenile, and its <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> can appear almost white at a distance. The {{head and neck}} are near-naked. The eyes are yellowish and the bill is black bill. Juveniles and immatures are generally darker and more streaked, with brown to orange eyes and red neck.|$|R
50|$|White-shouldered tanagers are 14 cm {{long and}} weigh 14 g. They are long-tailed {{and with a}} mostly black stout pointed bill. The adult male is glossy black, apart from white <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> and a {{conspicuous}} white shoulder patch. The shoulder patch is the most obvious difference from the similar but larger white-lined tanager, in which the smaller white area is rarely visible except in flight.|$|R
50|$|C. a. foetens, {{named by}} Martin Lichtenstein in 1817, {{is known as}} the Andean black vulture. It is {{approximately}} the same size as C. a. atratus. The markings on the undersides of the primaries are smaller than those of the other subspecies, and the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are darker. It is found in the Andes range, from northern Ecuador through Peru, northern Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and the lowlands of Chile.|$|R

The female has a grey-brown head. The male has a black mantle, red upper mandible, and blue head and rump.|$|R
50|$|The adult South African jackal buzzard is strikingly plumaged. It {{is almost}} black above with a rufous tail. The primary flight {{feathers}} are blackish and the secondaries off-white, both barred with black. Below the chin {{and around the}} throat is mainly chestnut, {{and the rest of}} the underparts and the <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are rich rufous. The flight feathers from below are white, tipped with black to form a dark trailing edge to the wing.|$|R
50|$|It is 30-36 cm in length, {{with the}} female larger than the male. Adult has {{prominent}} black wing tips. The male is grey above, white below and has red eyes. Female has rufous on breast and <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts,</b> and yellow eyes. Juvenile has grey face, brown upperparts and yellow eyes. The top underparts are streaked, while the thighs are barred. The black wing tips are not as prominent and underwings streaked (except for coverts).|$|R
50|$|The gold-capped conure {{grows to}} about 13 to 14 {{inches in length}} and weighs about 150 grams. Their bodies are mainly green with blackish bills, gray feet and brown irises. The forehead, the areas around the eyes and <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are usually red. The breast {{feathers}} are a red and green mix. Their tail feathers are olive green with a bluish tip. The primary feathers, wing coverts, and under-wing coverts are blue.|$|R
50|$|The pearl-breasted swallow is 13-14 cm long. It has glossy blue upperparts and grey-white underparts. The upper wings, underwing flight {{feathers}} and forked tail are blackish-blue. The <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> are a darker shade of grey-white. The lack of {{white in the}} tail is a distinction from similar Hirundo species. The outer feathers are slightly longer in the male than the female. Juveniles are duller and browner than the adult, with shorter outer tail feathers.|$|R
50|$|The trumpeter {{hornbill}} (Bycanistes bucinator) is a medium-sized hornbill, with length between 58 and 65 cm, {{characterized by a}} large grey casque on the bill, smaller in females. The eyes are brown or red, with pink surrounding skin. Body mass is between 0.45 and 1 kg. It is similar to silvery-cheeked hornbill. Distinguishing features include an all-black back, white belly and white <b>underwing</b> <b>coverts</b> (in flight, wings present white tips), and red facial skin.|$|R
