25|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the {{availability}} and quality of data on homelessness has improved considerably, due, in part, to initiatives by the United States government. Since 2007, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development has issued an Annual Homeless Assessment Report, which revealed {{the number of individuals}} and families that were homeless, both sheltered and <b>unsheltered.</b> In 2009, There were about 643,000 sheltered and <b>unsheltered</b> homeless persons nationwide. About two-thirds of those stayed in emergency shelters or used transitional housing programs, with the remaining living on the street in abandoned buildings or other areas not meant for human habitation. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009. Around 44% of homeless people were employed.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} accurate, comprehensive, and current data on {{homelessness}} in the United States is reported annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) in the Annual Homeless Assessment Report to Congress (AHAR), released in June of {{every year since}} 2007. The AHAR report relies on data from two sources: single-night, point-in-time counts of both sheltered and <b>unsheltered</b> homeless populations reported on the Continuum of Care applications to HUD; and counts of the sheltered homeless population over a full year provided by a sample of communities based on data in their Management Information Systems (HMIS).|$|E
25|$|United States: According to HUD's July 2010 5th Homeless Assessment Report to Congress, in {{a single}} night in January 2010, single point {{analysis}} reported to HUD showed there were 649,917 people experiencing homelessness. This number has increased from January 2009's 643,067. The <b>unsheltered</b> count increased by 2.8 percent while the sheltered count remained the same. Also, HUD reported the number of chronically homeless people (persons with severe disabilities and long homeless histories) decreased one percent between 2009 and 2010, from 110,917 to 109,812. Since 2007 this number has decreased by eleven percent. This is mostly due {{to the expansion of}} permanent supportive housing programs.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 {{more than}} 66 {{percent of all}} {{sheltered}} homeless people were located in principal cities, with 32 percent located in suburban or rural jurisdictions. About 40 percent of people entering an emergency shelter or transitional housing program during 2008 came from another homeless situation (sheltered or <b>unsheltered),</b> 40 percent came from a housed situation (in their own or someone else's home), and the remaining 20 percent were split between institutional settings or other situations such as hotels or motels. Most people had relatively short lengths of stay in emergency shelters: 60 percent stayed less than a month, and a 33 percent stayed a week or less.|$|E

500|$|At {{least two}} {{sequences}} of basaltic andesite lava flows are deposited south of Tricouni Peak. One of these sequences, known as Tricouni Southwest, creates a cliff {{on the eastern}} side of a north-south trending channel with a depth of [...] adjacent to the High Falls Creek mouth. The eastern flank of the lava flow, outside the High Falls Creek channel, has a more constant structure. Several fine-scale columnar joints and the overall structure of the lava flow suggest that its western portion, {{along the length of the}} channel, ponded against glacial ice. Near its southern unit, lava oozed into cracks in the glacial ice. This has been identified by the existence of spire-like cooling formations, although many of these edifices have been destroyed by erosional processes. Other features that indicate the lava ponded against glacial ice include its unusually thick structure and its steep cliffs. Therefore, the Tricouni Southwest lava flow was erupted about 10,000years ago when the regional Fraser Glaciation was retreating. The explanation for the western portion displaying ice-contact features while the eastern portion does not is likely because its western flank lies in a north-south trending channel, which would have been able to maintain smaller amounts of solar heat than its <b>unsheltered</b> eastern flank. As a result, the western portion of the lava flow records glaciation during a period when the eastern slopes were free from glacial ice.|$|E
2500|$|The terms <b>unsheltered</b> and unhoused {{refer to}} that segment of a {{homeless}} community {{who do not have}} ordinary lawful access to buildings in which to sleep; the latter term is defined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as describing persons occupying [...] "place not designed for ... sleeping accommodation for human beings". [...] Such persons frequently prefer the term houseless to the term homeless. Recent homeless enumeration survey documentation utilizes the term <b>unsheltered</b> homeless. The common colloquial term street people does not fully encompass all <b>unsheltered</b> people, in that many such persons do not spend their time in urban street environments. Many shun such locales, because homeless people in urban environments may face the risk of being robbed or beaten up. Some people convert unoccupied or abandoned buildings ("squatting"), or inhabit mountainous areas or, more often, lowland meadows, creek banks and beaches. Many jurisdictions have developed programs to provide short-term emergency shelter during particularly cold spells, often in churches or other institutional properties. These are referred to as warming centers, and are credited by their advocates as lifesaving.|$|E
2500|$|HUD {{requires}} jurisdictions which {{participate in}} Continuum of Care grant programs to count their homeless every two years.

Thus teams of counters, often numbering in the hundreds in logistically complex volunteer efforts, seek out the <b>unsheltered</b> in various nooks and crannies.Renamed from [...] "Common Ground" [...] (previous ref): [...] These counts include people sleeping in official shelters and people sleeping in parks, alleys and other outdoor locations.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, breeders {{have begun}} {{importing}} expensive foreign racehorse breeds like Arabians and Thoroughbreds {{with the goal}} of breeding them to native stock to produce faster horses, but these relatively fragile breeds are unable to survive on the steppe like Mongolian horses can; if left <b>unsheltered,</b> such horses inevitably freeze to death or starve. [...] So, breeders have focused on created crossbreeds between foreign horses and native Mongolian stock. [...] The ultimate goal is to produce a race horse that has one-quarter foreign blood and three-quarters Mongolian blood; this proportion is believed to create a horse hardy enough to survive in Mongolia and combine the Mongolian horse's stamina and endurance with foreign speed to produce a new breed with the best qualities of both.|$|E

2500|$|Community {{attitude}} towards homeless shelters varies widely, but {{one study found}} that older people, men, homeowners and all people making larger incomes were often adverse to the concept of homeless shelters in general. [...] Calgary neighborhoods recognize the need for shelters, but many don't want to situate a shelter near their own homes. A similar response came from residents in Oahu. In communities such as Portland, Oregon, where the weather can be quite harsh, there is an extensive network of supporters. These operate an informal restaurant, the [...] "Sisters of the Road" [...] cafe, which supports both homeless shelter clientele and also some <b>unsheltered</b> persons. At {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, jurisdictions such as Santa Barbara, California, feature ongoing disputes in an often highly adversarial mode. Disputes have even reached such schemes as re-arranging benches on city sidewalks to discourage panhandlers. In another 2011 incident, an eight unit supportive housing project which had been approved was called back onto city council agenda the following week in order to allow approximately 35 public comments pro and con, despite the fact that the measure had just been approved.|$|E

Both are {{classified}} as dry-summer subtropical (Csb) on the Köppen climate classification, with certain key exceptions. High pressures east of the Cascade Range create something of a venturi effect, leading to cold east winds down the Columbia River Gorge. <b>Unsheltered</b> by the Willamette Valley, Vancouver has historically seen colder temperatures, including [...] "silver thaw" [...] storms where freezing rain cakes limbs and power lines. Such storms can paralyze Vancouver. This occasionally freezes the river, and in 1916 cut electric power {{in the city for}} almost two weeks. Rainfall occurs frequently throughout the fall, winter, and spring, but ceases around the middle of June, with dry and warm weather lasting through September. Average annual precipitation is [...] Heavy snowfalls are infrequent and snow often falls and doesn't stick, with major snowstorms only occurring every 2–4 years. Close proximity to the river was also a concern for flooding, before dams constricted the river, destroying features such as Celilo Falls. Periodic floods have been a nuisance, with two of the most destructive in June 1894 and May, 1948. The 1948 Memorial Day flood almost topped the Interstate Bridge's support piers and completely destroyed nearby Vanport, Oregon. Other unusual storms include the Columbus Day windstorm of 1962 and an April 5, 1972 tornado which rated F3 on the Fujita scale, striking a local school. A F1 tornado struck on January 10, 2008 just after noon causing moderate damage along a [...] path from Vancouver Lake to the unincorporated Hazel Dell area.|$|E
