5|$|Although {{the metric}} system {{has changed and}} {{developed}} since its inception, its basic concepts have hardly changed. Designed for transnational use, it consisted of a basic set of <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> now known as base units. Derived units were built up from the base units using logical rather than empirical relationships while multiples and submultiples of both base and derived units were decimal-based and identified by a standard set of prefixes.|$|E
5|$|In 1921 the Metre Convention was {{extended}} to cover all units of measure, not just length and mass and in 1933 the 8th CGPM resolved {{to work with other}} international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes. Since 1954 the CIPM committee that oversees the definition of <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> the Consultative Committee for Units, has representatives from many international organisations including the ISR, IEC and ISO under the chairmanship of the CIPM.|$|E
5|$|The International System of Units (abbreviated as SI, {{from the}} French Système {{international}} (d'unités)) is the modern {{form of the}} metric system, and is {{the most widely used}} system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> built on seven base units and a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units. The system also specifies lowercase names for 22 derived units.|$|E

5|$|Architecture {{during the}} Song period reached new heights of sophistication. Authors such as Yu Hao and Shen Kuo wrote books {{outlining}} {{the field of}} architectural layouts, craftsmanship, and structural engineering in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively. Shen Kuo preserved the written dialogues of Yu Hao when describing technical issues such as slanting struts built into pagoda towers for diagonal wind bracing. Shen Kuo also preserved Yu's specified dimensions and <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> for various building types. The architect Li Jie (1065–1110), who published the Yingzao Fashi ('Treatise on Architectural Methods') in 1103, greatly expanded upon the works of Yu Hao and compiled the standard building codes used by the central government agencies and by craftsmen throughout the empire. He addressed the standard methods of construction, design, and applications of moats and fortifications, stonework, greater woodwork, lesser woodwork, wood-carving, turning and drilling, sawing, bamboo work, tiling, wall building, painting and decoration, brickwork, glazed tile making, and provided proportions for mortar formulas in masonry. In his book, Li provided detailed and vivid illustrations of architectural components and cross-sections of buildings. These illustrations displayed various applications of corbel brackets, cantilever arms, mortise and tenon work of tie beams and cross beams, and diagrams showing the various building types of halls in graded sizes. He also outlined the standard <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and standard dimensional measurements of all building components described and illustrated in his book.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Buddhism during {{the sixth century}} was a catalyst for large-scale temple building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese Tang and Sui Dynasties led to {{the foundation of the}} first permanent capital in Nara. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of Chang'an as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The {{introduction of}} the tea ceremony emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy.|$|E
5|$|Until 1875, the French {{government}} {{owned the}} prototype metre and kilogram, {{but in that}} year the Convention of the metre was signed, {{and control of the}} standards relating to mass and length passed to a trio of inter-governmental organisations, the senior of which was the General Conference on Weights and Measures (in French the Conférence générale des poids et mesures or CGPM). During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the CGPM cooperated with a number of other organisations, and by 1960 it had responsibility for defining temporal, electrical, thermal, molecular and luminar measurements, while other international organisations continued their roles in how these <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> were used.|$|E

Cortana can forecast results in various other sports such as the NBA, the NFL, the Super Bowl, the ICC Cricket World Cup and various European football leagues.

5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{regulated}} {{commerce and}} the economy by creating official markets (tsena) and standardizing market scales (fandanjana) and other <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> including length and volume. King Andrianampoinimerina established the first marketplace in Antananarivo on the grounds today occupied by the Analakely market's tile-roofed pavilions, constructed in the 1930s. Andrianampoinimerina decreed Friday (Zoma) as market day, when merchants would come to Analakely to erect stalls shaded with traditional white parasols. This sea of parasols extended throughout the valley, forming {{what has been called}} the largest open air marketplace in the world. Traffic congestion and safety hazards caused by the ever-growing Zoma market prompted government officials to split up and relocate the Friday merchants to several other districts in 1997. Prosperity for the masses in Imerina increased throughout Andrianampoinimerina's reign, leading to growth in population density.|$|E

While the Chancellor drafted the state budget, the Minister of Finance was responsible for funding it. He {{was in charge of}} storing the poll taxes, which were gathered in coin cash, and land tax, which was gathered as a proportion of farmers' annual crop yields.

5|$|The {{official}} {{introduction of}} the metric system in September 1799 was unpopular in large sections of French society. Napoleon's rule greatly aided adoption of the new standard not only across France but also across the French sphere of influence. Napoleon took a retrograde step in 1812 when he passed legislation to introduce the mesures usuelles (traditional <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement)</b> for retail trade—a system of measure that resembled the pre-revolutionary units but {{were based on the}} kilogram and the metre; for example the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g instead of 489.5 g—the value of the livre du roi (the king's pound). Other units of measure were rounded in a similar manner prior to the definitive {{introduction of the}} metric system across parts of Europe {{in the middle of the}} 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Ranked {{below the}} Three Councillors of State were the Nine Ministers (Jiu qing 九卿), who each headed a {{specialized}} ministry.

The Minister of the Household (Guang lu xun 光祿勳) {{was in charge of the}} emperor's security within the palace grounds, external imperial parks and wherever the emperor made an outing by chariot. The Minister of the Guards (Weiwei 衛尉) was responsible for securing and patrolling the walls, towers, and gates of the imperial palaces. The Minister Coachman (Taipu 太僕) was responsible for the maintenance of imperial stables, horses, carriages and coach-houses for the emperor and his palace attendants, as well as the supply of horses for the armed forces. The Minister of Justice (Tingwei 廷尉) was the chief official in charge of upholding, administering, and interpreting the law. The Minister Herald (Da honglu 大鴻臚) was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests at the imperial court, such as nobles and foreign ambassadors. The Minister of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng 宗正) oversaw the imperial court's interactions with the empire's nobility and extended imperial family, such as granting fiefs and titles. The Minister of Finance (Da sinong 大司農) was the treasurer for the official bureaucracy and the armed forces who handled tax revenues and set standards for <b>units</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The Minister Steward (Shaofu 少府) served the emperor exclusively, providing him with entertainment and amusements, proper food and clothing, medicine and physical care, valuables and equipment.|$|E
