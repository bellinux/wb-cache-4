40|$|M. Comm. A South African Gold Mining Company {{is faced}} with {{unplanned}} work absenteeism among <b>underground</b> <b>workers</b> that negatively affects productivity and safety. The primary objective {{of the study is}} to uncover causes of unplanned absenteeism among the <b>underground</b> <b>workers.</b> In addition, recommendations that could help reduce absenteeism level shave also been cited. To achieve the objectives, fifteen questions were used to facilitate face-to-face interviews and focus group discussions with participants. Absenteeism records at the Company were also studied. The literature review and finding of the study highlight the existence of multiple causes of absenteeism among <b>underground</b> <b>workers.</b> The recommendations are that the Company needs to consider implementing inclusive interventions to address the causes identified. The research was conducted using a qualitative research method based on semi structured interviews, focus group discussions and academic literature. Participants included <b>Underground</b> <b>Workers,</b> Shift Overseers, Union Representatives and internal Medical Personnel. Content analysis was applied as the data-analysis method with verbatim quotations cited to enhance finding of the study. Causes of absenteeism among <b>underground</b> <b>workers</b> include psychological factors, illness, job characteristics, and wage-levels, workers’ positions in the hierarchy, age and gender, alcohol, as well as violence. The researcher has identified causes of absenteeism at the company. Illness and the workers’ attitudes were found to be among the leading causes that will need to be prioritised in addressing the problem...|$|R

5000|$|At the time, opinion within British {{intelligence}} was divided. One group tended {{to believe the}} AK accounts and reports, while another was highly sceptical and {{argued that it was}} impossible to launch a rocket of the size reported by the AK using any known fuel.Then in early March 1944, British Intelligence Headquarters received a report of a Polish <b>Underground</b> <b>worker</b> (code name [...] "Makary") who had crawled up to the Blizna railway line and saw on a flatcar heavily guarded by SS troops [...] "an object which, though covered by a tarpaulin, bore every resemblance to a monstrous torpedo." [...] The Polish intelligence also informed the British about usage of liquid oxygen in a radio report from June 12, 1944. Some experts within both British and Polish intelligence communities quickly realized that learning the nature of the fuel utilized by the rockets was crucial, and hence, the need to obtain a working example.|$|E

50|$|As {{an actress}} Wang became {{well known as}} a leftist and {{communist}} advocate. She was {{a strong supporter of}} the Communist Party and operated as an <b>underground</b> <b>worker</b> for the Party while living in Shanghai before the communist revolution and establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. Her support and work for the communist cause was rewarded in 1951 when the August First Film Studio appointed her as a film director. Despite having no previous directorial experience, her appointment was widely supported and she became a successful mainstream socialist filmmaker. It was not unusual in the years following the revolution to appoint novice film directors, partly because there were few professional directors working at that time, and partly because the new Communist government significantly financed the film industry. The film industry was seen as an art form that could reach the masses and could be used to effectively spread the party’s political message. Accordingly, Wang’s work fit into the mainstream socialist cinema and had an explicit pro-communist message. Her work was not particularly associated with women’s film. Although some of her films featured leading women, the narrative focused on class struggle and the communist revolution. When gender struggles were depicted, it was often to reinforce communism as a solution. Her work was financially supported by the state, which provided her with significant access to filmic resources, allowing her to learn the techniques of filmmaking through practice and experiment with film form. She became a respected and influential director.|$|E
5000|$|Because of his {{patriotic}} views Javakhishvili {{was arrested}} and exiled several times even during the era of Imperial Russia. After the crash of The First Georgian Democratic Republic and annexing of the country by the Russian Bolshevik Regime, the writer always was under special surveillance because of his views and former membership of National-Democratic Party. At 1924 had been suspected in participation into patriotic rebellion he was imprisoned and after series of interrogations and tortures proscribed to death. He survived {{only because of the}} [...] "kind mood" [...] of Sergo Orjonikidze who was personally asked by Javakhishvili's close friends cryticist Pavle Ingorokva and famous physician Nikoloz Kipshidze.Although relations between writer and governing regime were always tense, in 1930, Javakhishvili clashed with Malakia Toroshelidze, president of the Union of Writers and People's Commissar for Education, suspected to be Trotskist, after the latter's ban on the classics of Georgian literature. Upon Lavrenty Beria's coming to power, the ban was revoked, and Javakhishvili for a short time gained favor. His Arsena of Marabda was republished, and both dramatized and filmed. However, {{he was not able to}} escape bitter criticism from the Bolsheviks even after he published, in 1936, the moderate A Woman's Burden (ქალის ტვირთი), an attempt at a Socialist realist novel. That was a story of a revolutionary but bourgeoisie woman, Ketevan, whose lover, a Bolshevik <b>underground</b> <b>worker</b> Zurab, persuades her to marry a Tsarist gendarme officer, Avsharov, whom she is to kill. The Soviet ideologist Vladimir Ermilov condemned the novel, claiming that it illustrated Bolsheviks as pure terrorists and made gendarmes too chivalrous. Soon, Beria resented Javakhishvili's refusal to seek his advice over the representation of Bolshevik activities in pre-revolutionary Georgia. Furthermore, Javakhishvili was suspected of warning the writer Grigol Robakidze of impending arrest and assisting him in defecting to Germany back in 1930. The matters went to a head when, in 1936, he was accused of praising the French author André Gide whose Retour de l'URSS and the book's praise of Georgian writers reclassified both Gide and Javakhishvili into enemies. On 22 July 1937, when the poet Paolo Iashvili shot himself in the Union of Writers building, and the Union's session went on to pass a resolution denouncing the poet's move as an anti-Soviet provocation, Javakhishvili was the sole person present to praise the poet's courage. Four days later, on 26 July, the presidium of the Union voted: [...] "Mikheil Javakhishvili, as an enemy of the people, a spy and diversant, is to be expelled from the Union of Writers and physically annihilated." [...] His friends and colleagues, including those already in prison, were forced to incriminate Javakhishvili as a counter-revolutionary terrorist. Only the critic Geronti Kikodze left the Union's session in protest rather than give his consent to the resolution. The novelist was arrested on 14 August 1937 and tortured in the presence of Beria until he signed a [...] "confession". He was shot on 30 September 1937. His property was confiscated, and his archives destroyed, his brother shot, and his widow sent into exile. Javakhisvhili remained censored until the late 1950s when he was rehabilitated and republished.Some episodes from his biography like those from Dimitri Shevardnadze were further used by Tengiz Abuladze in his film Repentance (მონანიება).|$|E
