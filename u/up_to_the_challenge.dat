5|$|With Adrian Peterson still {{recovering}} from breaking his collar bone against Iowa State and Allen Patrick on the sidelines in an ankle brace after suffering a late-game sprain the week before, {{many aspects of the}} offense were in doubt coming into this game. Paul Thompson responded by putting up a career-high 309yards passing, completing 24 of 31attempts. True-freshman running back Chris Brown also stepped <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> and ran for 84yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter; {{this was the first time}} in 16games that a Sooner back did not run for over 100yards.|$|E

With no seniors on the roster, 2003 {{was supposed to be}} a rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed it became clear that Taurasi was <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of carrying a group of young players to the championship. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game loss to Villanova.|$|E

25|$|This {{decrease}} {{in the amount of}} money would act to reduce the inflationary pressure. Supplementing the use of gold in this period was the British pound.

25|$|Going {{into the}} 15th and final round Marshall was {{in first place}} with 12 points, but he was only one point ahead of Janowski, who in turn was only one point ahead of Lasker. Marshall played black against Fox who was up a pawn after 20 moves. However, Fox quickly blundered a rook and Marshall won. Meanwhile, Janowski and Lasker were playing against each other for second place. Janowski, with a one-point lead, only needed a draw with the white pieces to clinch the second prize. Janowski {{launched}} a very spirited attack against Lasker's king, which was stuck {{in the center of}} the board. Lasker was <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> though, and built a defense that turned back Janowski's attack and eventually won the game.|$|E
25|$|Reports {{from the}} armored {{divisions}} that received them {{prior to the}} end of hostilities were generally positive. Crews liked the improved off-road performance and reliability, but were most appreciative of the 75mm main gun, which was a vast improvement over the 37mm. The M24 was not <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of fighting German tanks, but the bigger gun at least gave its crews a much better chance to fight back when it was required. The M24's light armor made it vulnerable to virtually all German tanks, anti-tank guns, and hand-held anti-tank weapons. The contribution of the M24 to winning the war in Europe was insignificant, as too few arrived too late to replace the worn-out M5s of the armored divisions.|$|E

25|$|Walker's 20-yard {{touchdown}} {{catch and}} Pat Leahy's 30-yard field goal gave New York a 10–0 lead before Los Angeles stormed back, taking a 14–10 lead on Allen's 3-yard touchdown run and a 57-yard scoring reception by Malcolm Barnwell. Late {{in the fourth}} quarter, New York drove 67 yards in six plays, including Richard Todd's 45-yard completion to Walker on the Raiders 1-yard line, where Dierking took {{the ball into the}} end zone to give the Jets a 17–14 lead. Their defense seemed to put the game away when Mehl intercepted a pass from Plunkett with slightly over two minutes left on the Raiders ensuing drive. However, Los Angeles defensive end Lyle Alzado forced a fumble from McNeil that linebacker Ted Hendricks recovered to give his team one last chance to drive for a tying score. The Jets defense proved <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge,</b> and Mehl intercepted another Plunkett pass that enabled New York to run {{out the rest of the}} clock.|$|E
25|$|Brown’s {{performance}} and subsequent reputation were mixed. Major General Charles H. Corlett, then commanding the XIX Corps, thought Brown needed a medical leave {{because he was}} sick and “rundown.” One of Brown’s battalion commanders thought Brown was not <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of commanding large units in combat and described him as “frantic.” Bradley, now a lieutenant general, commanding the U.S. 12th Army Group, and General Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the European Theater of Operations (ETO), believed Brown was personally brave, but not an inspirational leader, and that his soldiers underperformed as a result. Unlike several other division commanders who were relieved and later received second opportunities to command, such as Major Generals Terry Allen and Orlando Ward, in Brown's case Eisenhower recommended to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he not be given another command. Marshall concurred. Brown was replaced by Brigadier General James Edward Wharton, who {{was killed by a}} sniper while visiting the front-line soon after he took command. He, in turn, was replaced by Brigadier General Norman Cota, formerly the ADC of the 29th Infantry Division.|$|E

500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} were {{produced}} by Rainmaker Digital Effects. Gero wrote the scene involving the minute long sequence where the Horizon weapon fires from the Apollo to the Asuran homeworld. He {{made contact with}} Mark Savela {{to see if it}} could be done; Savela was <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge.</b> The sequence was costly, since the visual effects team had to make a 3D world that would last a minute long to ensure that the sequence followed Gero's script. The sequences where Atlantis takes off {{from the bottom of the}} ocean were stock footage from [...] "Rising", with the shield and beam added on. Another reason to keep the scenes was because the writers liked the scene to be reused. Another visual effect was used to switch Keller's flag patch from Canadian to American, since the decision to have Keller an American character was made after filming.|$|E

500|$|Webb felt a {{responsibility}} to reinvent Spider-Man. One departure from the preceding trilogy was to have Spider-Man build artificial web-shooters, as the character does in the comics. In February 2011, with {{the launch of the}} official website, the title and first official image of Garfield as Spider-Man depicting both his costume and web-shooters for the first time were revealed. Writer Geoff Boucher of the Los Angeles Times was skeptical of the change, feeling that it was too hard to believe that a financially strapped young man could conceive a wrist-worn device that can instantly produce a strand of synthetic webbing and [...] noted [...] "the suit lives <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of being different from the Sam Raimi films but not too different from the classic suit that stands {{as one of the great}} comic-book costumes ever." [...] Matt Goldberg of Collider admitted that he was not crazy about the costume, explaining that the bug-yellow eyes felt weird to him and the mesh-pattern felt too busy. He explained that the design of the gloves caused flashbacks to the Spider-Man 2099 costume which he did not like, although he felt that the web-shooters looked fine. Webb explained that he felt that [...] "the web-shooters were able to dramatize Peter's intellect". Webb paid attention to the question of [...] "How would a kid make it?" [...] and then took some license with it. About the new costume, Webb explained that he and the crew [...] "wanted a design that would make the body longer and more lithe, more of an acrobat, someone incredibly agile and the legs of the spider [...] were something we used to emphasize that." [...] He revealed that the film used varying suits for different lighting conditions. They made the webbing on the costume a little darker. Webb stated that [...] "With the costume and the web-shooters we wanted to emphasize that these are things that Peter Parker made". Webb also looked at the Mark Bagley art in Ultimate Spider-Man for the hero's body.|$|E
