5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an <b>undercarriage</b> {{malfunction}} warning meant that the flight was flown with the <b>undercarriage</b> down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the port side main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E

40|$|The {{point of}} the bachelor’s thesis is to recapitulate pieces of {{knowledge}} about types of crawler <b>undercarriages</b> to the weight of 10 tons, make survey of application various types of <b>undercarriages</b> for concrete types of machines, to give and confront properties of <b>undercarriages</b> and tracks {{in the light of}} weight of machine and operating specifications...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{technological}} and operational indicators on {{the efficiency of}} using operational time during goods transportation by automobile trailers is analytically studied. The failure cause of automobile trailers <b>undercarriages</b> is analysed.

5|$|A second I-215 {{was built}} to an order from OKB-1 as the I-215D (dooblyor, second prototype), to {{evaluate}} the bicycle or tandem landing gear configuration. It used wider-diameter paired wheels in a tandem arrangement that retracted into the fuselage, along with small outrigger wheels under the engine nacelles which retracted into fairings. The main <b>undercarriage</b> of the I-215D also incorporated a kneeling feature which could increase the incidence of the aircraft by 3° to assist take-off. Trials with this <b>undercarriage</b> arrangement were successful and {{paved the way for}} its use in other Soviet aircraft, including Dr. Brunolf Baade's Aircraft 150, then under development.|$|E

5|$|In September 1938, Handley Page H.P.45 G-AAXD Horatius of Imperial Airways {{suffered}} damage to its port <b>undercarriage</b> and lower port wing in a forced landing at Lympne. The aircraft was repaired {{and returned to}} service.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the <b>undercarriage.</b> The <b>undercarriage</b> could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E
5|$|The F-111C was {{the export}} version for Australia, {{combining}} the F-111A design with the longer F-111B wings and the strengthened FB-111A <b>undercarriage.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to building aircraft, other wartime work included {{the manufacture of}} both Dowty and Messier <b>undercarriages,</b> automatic pilot units, searchlights and radar equipment.|$|R
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for <b>undercarriage</b> raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency <b>undercarriage</b> lowering.|$|E
5|$|Tu-142: A {{lengthened}} Tu-95 {{with much}} defensive armament removed, and instead incorporating ASW systems. Twelve aircraft initially had 12-wheel main <b>undercarriage</b> bogies. Six later aircraft had four-wheel bogies. Built by Kuibyshev Aviation Plant.|$|E

50|$|The tables below {{show how}} {{various types of}} wheeled units are {{arranged}} to form the <b>undercarriages</b> of some popular aircraft from manufacturers Antonov, Airbus, and Boeing.|$|R
5|$|A {{feature of}} the wing, which contributed greatly to its success, was an {{innovative}} spar boom design, made up of five square tubes that fitted into each other. As the wing thinned out along its span the tubes were progressively cut away {{in a similar fashion}} to a leaf spring; two of these booms were linked together by an alloy web, creating a lightweight and very strong main spar. The <b>undercarriage</b> legs were attached to pivot points built into the inner, rear section of the main spar and retracted outwards and slightly backwards into wells in the non-load-carrying wing structure. The resultant narrow <b>undercarriage</b> track was considered to be an acceptable compromise as this reduced the bending loads on the main-spar during landing.|$|E
5|$|Olde Idlewild {{contained}} a Caterpillar ride until 2013. Built in 1947, Idlewild's model {{was one of}} three similar rides still in operation in North America, one of two featuring a working canopy that covers the riders, and the only one that still utilized an <b>undercarriage</b> fan. The ride was removed to be refurbished and returned in the future.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 1921, a Handley Page O/400 {{suffered}} {{engine failure}} shortly after passing Lympne {{on a flight}} from Paris to Croydon, resulting {{in the loss of}} a propeller. The aircraft made a forced landing at Lympne, damaging the <b>undercarriage</b> in the process.|$|E

50|$|The SNCASO S.O.7050, S.O.7055, S.O.7056 and S.O.7060 Deauville were {{single-engine}} light French civil {{utility aircraft}} of the 1940s. Only two airframes were built but were modified with different <b>undercarriages,</b> engines and seating.|$|R
5|$|On 17 January 1931, Breguet 280T F-AIVU of Air Union crashed whilst {{attempting}} {{to land at}} Lympne. The aircraft caught the boundary fence and crashed onto the airfield, damaging the forward fuselage and <b>undercarriage.</b> Of the eight people on board, one of the crew was injured.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January Scottish Parliament {{began an}} inquiry {{led by the}} Infrastructure and Capital Investment Committee (ICI) to {{determine}} the circumstances {{that led to the}} discovery of a cracked truss in the bridge's <b>undercarriage.</b> Evidence was heard from; Forth Estuary Transport Authority (Feta), Transport minister Derek Mackay, engineers and officials from Amey along with a number of other experts and key personnel.|$|E
5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127. In July 1957, a modification made to the design was the incorporation of a bifurcated tailpipe, similar to the Hawker Sea Hawk, which was equipped with rotatable nozzles for the hot exhaust, similar those already used for the cold exhaust. The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel <b>undercarriage</b> could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led <b>undercarriage.</b> The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between the conflicting demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E

50|$|The {{constructional}} {{heart of}} an Ausbesserungswerk {{is usually a}} large, multi-track, main workshop building (the Richthalle), which enables several railway vehicles {{to be worked on}} simultaneously at a number of work stations. These stations are equipped with lifting gear {{in order to be able}} to jack vehicles up and separate the wagon bodies from their <b>undercarriages.</b> Adjoining the main workshop are mechanical and electrical workshops for the refurbishment and repair of individual components such as <b>undercarriages,</b> brake equipment and motors. The external livery of railway vehicles is carried out in a paint shed, separate from the main workshop.|$|R
