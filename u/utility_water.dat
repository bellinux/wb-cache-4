40|$|D. Ing. Measuring the {{efficiency}} of <b>water</b> <b>utilities</b> {{has been a constant}} challenge to various stakeholders in the water sector. There are several factors that influence {{the efficiency}} of utilities. The following study examines the different factors and establishes a model to quantify {{the efficiency of}} <b>water</b> <b>utilities</b> using limited number of variables. It utilises Fuzzy Logic to develop the measurement model. The developed method {{can also be used to}} configure a new <b>water</b> <b>utility</b> for efficiency. In addition, the research highlights some possible imperfections in the water policies that can result in an inherent inefficiency of a <b>water</b> <b>utility.</b> The developed model can assist in setting ceiling levels for <b>utility's</b> <b>water</b> assets and labour, to ensure efficiency. The model is generic and can be applied to any country or community, and can be used to configure <b>water</b> <b>utilities</b> for the poor. The Model utilised "Matlab Fuzzy Tool Box student version 2009 a" software as a tool to develop the Fuzzy Inference Engine for Utility Efficiency. The study is a contribution to the domain of knowledge of water engineering science...|$|R
