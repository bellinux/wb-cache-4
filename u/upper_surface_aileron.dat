50|$|The Nibio II was a high-wing {{monoplane}} {{with its}} wing braced {{by a single}} faired strut on each side, joining the lower fuselage to the outer end of the central panel at about one third span. This central panel was rectangular in plan and was without dihedral. The outer panels were straight tapered to blunt tips, the wing becoming thinner and thus acquiring dihedral though retaining a horizontal <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>Ailerons</b> occupied the whole trailing edges of these outer panels; there were no inboard flaps or air brakes.|$|R
50|$|The Gabbiano was a {{high wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane built from wood {{and covered with a}} mixture of plywood and fabric. Its wing had a single spar, torsion box structure and was constructed in three sections. The central part, about 40% of the span, was rectangular in plan and was without dihedral. The outer panels were straight tapered to blunt tips, the wing becoming thinner and thus acquiring dihedral though retaining a horizontal <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>Ailerons</b> occupied the whole trailing edges of these outer panels; there were no inboard flaps or air brakes. At 16:1 its aspect ratio was {{similar to that of the}} Konsul.|$|R
50|$|The Falco was {{designed}} as a glider with performance better than that of a trainer though not at a soaring competition level. It was a high-wing monoplane, with its single spar wing braced on each side by a pair of faired struts arranged in a V, joining the lower fuselage to the outer end of the central panel at about one-third span. This central panel was rectangular in plan and without dihedral. The outer panels were straight-tapered to blunt tips, the wing becoming thinner and thus acquiring dihedral though retaining a horizontal <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b> <b>Ailerons</b> occupied the whole trailing edges of these outer panels; there were no inboard flaps or air brakes.|$|R
40|$|A new wing-tip concept with {{morphing}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> and interchangeable {{conventional and}} morphing ailerons was designed, manufactured, bench and wind tunnel tested. The {{development of this}} wing tip {{was done in the}} frame of an international CRIAQ project, and the purpose was to demonstrate the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> morphing and <b>aileron</b> morphing capabilities in improving the wing tip aerodynamic performances. During numerical optimization with ‘in-house’ genetic algorithm software, and during wind tunnel experimental tests, it was demonstrated that the air flow laminar state was extended and drag coefficient reduction were obtained...|$|R
50|$|A {{difficulty}} with a thin, high aspect ratio wooden wing {{is that a}} very strong and therefore heavy spar is needed, {{with the result that}} the Spillo had the highest wing loading of any glider of its time. It used a single double box spar with thick laminated wood flanges and three vertical plywood webs. There were poplar ribs; the wing, including the ailerons was skinned with plywood, carefully smoothed and filled to follow accurately the NACA non-laminar flow airfoil. <b>Upper</b> <b>surface</b> hinged <b>ailerons</b> reached the wing tip and occupied about 36% of the span, though they were later slightly extended. In plan the wings were straight tapered, with a tip to root chord ratio of 0.30, ending with small, streamlined bodies known as salmons. Initially there were no flaps, but quarter span long gapless spoilers extended below the wing at mid-chord.|$|R
50|$|It was wooden {{framed and}} mostly covered with plywood, though {{parts of the}} wing and all the rear control {{surfaces}} were fabric covered. Its one piece high wing was built around a single spar, well set back from the leading edge and with closely spaced (210 mm) ribs to preserve the laminar flow profile of the ply covered forward part. This covering included the plain, <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> hinged <b>ailerons</b> and a torsion resisting D-box around the leading edge from the spar. There was 2° of dihedral. In plan the wing was straight tapered with a taper ratio of 0.416 and 1° of sweep at the quarter chord line. Most Nymphs had very small endplates at their wing tips, though one was built with traditional blunt tips. Metal, Schempp-Hirth type spoilers, opening {{above and below the}} wing, were mounted just behind the spar at about one third span.|$|R
25|$|Initial trials {{revealed}} {{a lack of}} longitudinal control, and the single-acting ailerons caused problems when taxying downwind, so the two prototype were fitted with lengths of bungee cord attached to control horns on the <b>upper</b> <b>aileron</b> <b>surface</b> to return the aileron to the neutral position. This only produced a marginal improvement, so ailerons were then added to the lower wings, these being fitted to all the aircraft built apart from the two prototypes. These were linked by cables to the upper ailerons, and the bungee cord to return the ailerons was rigged between {{the top of the}} rear interplane struts and the lower ailerons.|$|R
5000|$|Engineer Leslie George Frise (1897-1979) of the Bristol Aeroplane Company [...] {{developed}} an aileron shape that is pivoted at about its 25 to 30% chord line and near its bottom surface http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1943/1943%20-%202340.html, {{in order to}} decrease stick forces as aircraft became faster during the 1930s. When the aileron is deflected up (to make its wing go down), {{the leading edge of}} the aileron starts to protrude below the undersurface of the wing, into the airflow beneath the wing. The moment of the leading edge in the airflow helps to move up the trailing edge, which decreases the stick force. The down-moving aileron also adds energy to the boundary layer. The edge of the aileron directs air flow from the under-side of the wing to the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of the <b>aileron,</b> thus creating a lifting force, which adds to the lift of the wing. This reduces the needed deflection angle of the aileron. Both the Canadian Fleet Model 2 biplane of 1930, and the later, popular American Piper J-3 Cub monoplane light aircraft of 1938 possessed Frise ailerons as designed, and helped introduce them to a wide audience.|$|R
5000|$|Current {{research}} {{seeks to}} coordinate the functions of aircraft flight control <b>surfaces</b> (<b>ailerons,</b> elevators, elevons, flaps, and flaperons) so as to reduce weight, cost, drag, inertia, and thereby achieve improved control response), reduced complexity, and reduced radar visibility for stealth purposes. Beneficiaries of such research might include drones (UAVs) and the latest fighter aircraft.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} on the tension crack {{occurring in the}} <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> of rock slopes, barodynamics experiment using models representing rock slope was performed, and tensile strain on <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> was measured. Results obtained by this experiment were examined by elasto-plastic analysis using FEM. By both barodynamics experiment and theoretical analysis following conclusions were obtained:(1) In case of vertical slope, horizontal strain near <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> is always tensile strain, and its magnitude increases as slope height increases. (2) In case θ≦ 80 ℃, horizontal strain near the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> is compressive strain when slope height is small. As slope height increases, compression failure near the toe of slope causes increase in compressive strain near the <b>upper</b> <b>surface.</b> When slope failure occurs the horizontal strain near the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> suddenly turns into tensile strain.

30|$|In the circle/Hopf {{bursting}} {{as illustrated}} in Fig.  67 of [15], there are depolarized plateaus on the <b>upper</b> <b>surface</b> alternating with episodes of hyperpolarized silence on the lower surface.

5000|$|The {{critical}} {{angle of attack}} is the angle of attack which produces maximum lift coefficient. This is also called the [...] "stall angle of attack".
