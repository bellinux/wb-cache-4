Charles VIII had died and the new king, Louis XII was crowned by the new archbishop at Rheims Cathedral on 17 December 1498. To consolidate his position, Louis divorced his wife, Jeanne, and married the widow, Queen Anne, of the late King, who had been his nephew. Jan unwisely advised the Queen against the marriage and preached against divorce (interestingly enough, except in cases of adultery). Early the following year, he, along with the other Doctors in the University went on strike in protest against what they saw as <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference</b> in their affairs by the King. He was prominent in setting out their case. He also helped one of the more forceful opponents of the divorce escape. The King got his divorce and set about punishing his opponents. Standonck was lucky to get only two years exile. He handed over direction of the College to Noël Béda and John Mair and set off to Cambrai in his native Flanders, where he was welcomed by the Bishop.|$|E

The thesis focuses on protection provided by the Act Nr. 89 / 2012 Sb., Civil Code, and the European Convention on Human Rights. Initial chapters of the general part of the thesis deal with brief introduction to the historical background of personality rights in the Czech legal environment, {{as well as with the}} definition of personality and personality rights as such, together with a demonstrative list of values protected by the general right of personality. The subsequent chapter provides an overview of Czech and international sources of law concerning personality protection.

6000|$|The great {{importance}} of leaving this priceless element {{in a community}} as free, as keen, and as active as possible, is overlooked by the thinkers who uphold coercion against liberty, as a saving social principle. Every act of coercion directed against an opinion or a way of living is in so far calculated to lessen the quantity of conscience in the society where such acts are practised. Of course, where ways of living interfere with the lawful rights of others, where they are not strictly self-regarding in all their details, {{it is necessary to}} force the dissidents, however strong may be their conscientious sentiment. The evil of attenuating that sentiment is smaller than the evil of allowing one set of persons to realise their own notions of happiness, at the expense of {{all the rest of the}} world. But where these notions can be realised without <b>unlawful</b> <b>interference</b> of that kind, then the forcible hindrance of such realisation is a direct weakening of the force and amount of conscience on which the community may count. There is one memorable historic case to illustrate this. Lewis XIV., in revoking the Edict of Nantes, and the author of the still more cruel law of 1724, not only violently drove out multitudes of the most scrupulous part of the French nation; they virtually offered the most tremendous bribes to those of less stern resolution, to feign conversion to the orthodox faith. This was to treat conscience as a thing of mean value. It was to scatter to the wind with both hands the moral resources of the community. And who can fail to see the strength which would have been given to France in her hour of storm, a hundred years after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, if her protestant sons, fortified by the training in the habits of individual responsibility which protestantism involves, had only been there to aid? ...|$|E

40|$|The {{offshore}} {{petroleum industry}} is {{of critical importance}} to the global economy. Offshore petroleum installations are considered elements of critical national infrastructure in many nation-States and their security may have significant implications for national security and economic wellbeing. Violence at sea is a very common occurrence today and major petroleum producing and consuming States {{are concerned about the}} protection of offshore petroleum installations from attacks and <b>unlawful</b> <b>interferences,</b> especially acts of terrorism. In recent years, the international community has taken a number of regulatory measures to enhance the security of the maritime transport and offshore petroleum sectors. The thesis examines the types of security threats to offshore petroleum installations, the types of attacks that have been carried out against offshore installations, and factors that make offshore installations attractive targets including their vulnerabilities and potential impacts that can result from deliberate attacks on these vital facilities. This thesis also analyses the international legal framework for maritime and offshore petroleum security with the aim of determining whether the international legal framework adequately addresses the protection and security of offshore petroleum installations. Specifically, it analyses {{the law of the sea}} framework established under the umbrella of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 as well as other international legal instruments and regulatory measures pertaining to the security of offshore installations. The original contribution made by this thesis includes the compilation of a comprehensive chronology of attacks on and interferences with offshore petroleum installations, the analysis of various security threats faced by offshore petroleum installations, examination of factors that make offshore petroleum installations attractive targets, and a detailed analysis of the international regulatory framework. The thesis concludes that there are gaps and limitations in the current international regulatory framework for the protection and security of offshore petroleum installations. It argues that there is a scope for improvement in the international legal framework and that further regulatory changes are necessary at the international level in order to enhance security of offshore petroleum installations. The thesis also provides several specific suggestions that would improve the international legal framework for the protection and security of offshore petroleum installations...|$|R

The ECtHR, however, has gradually broadened its scope so {{that the right to}} privacy encroaches upon other provisions embodied in the Convention, includes rights and freedoms explicitly left out of the ECHR by the drafters of the Convention and functions as the main pillar on which the Court has built its practice of opening up the Convention for new rights and freedoms. Consequently, Article 8 ECHR has been transformed from a classic privacy right to a personality right, providing protection to the personal development of individuals. Apart from its theoretical significance, this shift might prove indispensable in the age of Big Data, as personality rights protect a different type of interest, which is far more easy to substantiate in the new technological paradigm than those associated with the right to privacy...|$|R
40|$|Human ICT implants, such as RFID implants, {{cochlear}} implants, cardiac pacemakers, Deep Brain Stimulation, bionic limbs {{connected to}} the nervous system, and networked cognitive prostheses, are becoming increasingly complex. With ever-growing data processing functionalities in these implants, privacy and security become vital concerns. Electronic attacks on human ICT implants can cause significant harm, both to implant subjects and to their environment. This paper explores the vulnerabilities which human implants pose to crime victimisation {{in light of recent}} technological developments, and analyses how the law can deal with emerging challenges of what may well become the next generation of cybercrime: attacks targeted at technology implanted in the human body. After a state-of-the-art description of relevant types of human implants and a discussion how these implants challenge existing perceptions of the human body, we describe how various modes of attacks, such as sniffing, hacking, data interference, and denial of service, can be committed against implants. Subsequently, we analyse how these attacks can be assessed under current substantive and procedural criminal law, drawing on examples from UK and Dutch law. The possibilities and limitations of cybercrime provisions (eg, <b>unlawful</b> access, system <b>interference)</b> and bodily integrity provisions (eg, battery, assault, causing bodily harm) to deal with human-implant attacks are analysed. Based on this assessment, the paper concludes that attacks on human implants are not only a new generation in the evolution of cybercrime, but also raise fundamental questions on how criminal law conceives of attacks. Traditional distinctions between physical and non-physical modes of attack, between human bodies and things, between exterior and interior of the body need to be re-interpreted in light of developments in human implants. As the human body and technology become increasingly intertwined, cybercrime legislation and body-integrity crime legislation will also become intertwined, posing a new puzzle that legislators and practitioners will sooner or later have to solve...|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the session of 1920, Speaker Thaddeus C. Sweet and the Republican majority suspended Solomon and the other four Socialist members (viz. Louis Waldman, Samuel Orr, August Claessens and Sam DeWitt) for alleged disloyalty due to membership in the Socialist Party of America. A lengthy trial before the Judiciary Committee of the Assembly began in the middle of January. Socialist Party leaders Morris Hillquit and Seymour Stedman were in charge of the defense. During the course of the proceedings, testimony was taken from two New York City policemen who had attempted to stop a crowd of about 2,000 from disrupting a streetcar line in conjunction with a strike in the summer of 1919. According to the published testimony of the officers, on August 6, the two had come across a noisy crowd which had stopped several streetcars by piling debris on the tracks. A near riot erupted when the two plainclothesmen jumped into the fray, one swinging a club and the other punching and kicking. The crowd, for their part, threw rocks and debris at the officers. Assemblyman Solomon, the legislative representative of the district in which the disruption was taking place, was said to have forced his way {{to the front of the}} crowd, shouting [...] "Pull the scabs off the cars!" [...] Both officers recognized Solomon and one admonished him for encouraging <b>unlawful</b> behavior and <b>interference.</b> Solomon is said to have moved back into the crowd at this point. Shortly thereafter, reserves arrived and the crowd dispersed and the tracks were cleared. Such testimony proved damning to the cause of the Socialists. On April 1, the five assemblymen were expelled from the House. All five were re-elected at a special election on September 16, and appeared to take their seats at {{the beginning}} of the special session on September 20. The next day, DeWitt and Orr were permitted to take their seats, but Claessens, Solomon and Waldman were expelled again.

The right of employees to strike for any cause or for no cause is sustained by the common law everywhere in the United States. Likewise an employer has a right to discharge any or all of his employees when they have no contract with him, and he may refuse to employ any person or class of persons for any reason or for no reason. Agreements among strikers to take peaceable means to induce others to remain away from the works of an employer until he yields {{to the demands of the}} strikers are not held to be conspiracies under the common law, and the carrying out of such a purpose by peaceable persuasion and without violence, intimidation or threats, is not <b>unlawful.</b> However, any <b>interference</b> with the constitutional rights of another to employ whom he chooses or to labour when, where or on what terms he pleases, is illegal. The boycott has been held to be an illegal conspiracy in restraint of trade. The statutory enactments of the various states concerning labour disturbances are in part re-enactments of the rules of common law and in part more or less departures from or additions to the established principles. The list of such statutory enactments is a large one, and includes laws relating to blacklisting, boycotting, conspiracy against working-men, interference with employment, intimidation, picketing and strikes of railway employees; laws requiring statements of causes of discharge of employees and notice of strikes in advertisements for labour; laws prohibiting deception in the employment of labour and the hiring of armed guards by employers; and laws declaring that certain labour agreements do not constitute conspiracy.
