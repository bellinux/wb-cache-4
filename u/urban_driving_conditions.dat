The {{components of the}} vehicle; including internal combustion engine, driving machine, generator machine, batteries and transmission, and also vehicle’s load model and control logic is modeled in Matlab/SIMULINK and the simulation is run in some <b>urban</b> and highway <b>driving</b> cycles. The results are discussed in respect to energy efficiency and potentials of the series parallel vehicle benefits due to probable <b>driving</b> <b>conditions.</b> I...|$|R
