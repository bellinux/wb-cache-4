50|$|<b>Unit</b> <b>Hydrograph</b> Method. This method {{involves}} {{building a}} graph {{in which the}} discharge generated by a rainstorm of a given size is plotted over time, usually hours or days. It is called the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> method because it addresses only the runoff produced by a particular rainstorm in a specified period of time- the time taken for a river to rise, peak, and fall {{in response to a}} storm. Once rainfall-runoff relationship is established, then subsequent rainfall data can be used to forecast streamflow for selected storms, called standard storms. A standard rainstorm is a high intensity storm of some known magnitude and frequency. One method of <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> analysis involves expressing the hour by hour or day by day increase in streamflow as a percentage of total runoff. Plotted on a graph, these data from the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> for that storm, which represents the runoff added to the prestorm baseflow. To forecast the flows in a large drainage basin using the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> method would be difficult because in a large basin geographic conditions may vary significantly from one part of the basin to another. This is especially so with the distribution of rainfall because an individual rainstorm rarely covers the basin evenly. As a result, the basin does not respond as a unit to a given storm, making it difficult to construct a reliable hydrograph.|$|E

30|$|We use six {{probability}} distribution functions for deriving <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> for the above datasets: two-parameter gamma, two-parameter Gumbel, two-parameter log-normal, two-parameter normal, three-parameter Pearson distribution, and two-parameter Weibull. The {{probability distribution}} parameters are determined using the nonlinear least squares optimization method by programming in Mathematica and {{by applying the}} genetic algorithm. The results are also compared with those obtained using the traditional linear least squares method.|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{based on}} the visual {{comparison}} at the calibration stage using the nonlinear optimization method, {{it was observed that}} the log-normal distribution estimates the time to peak and peak flow properly for all storms. This distribution along with the gamma, Pearson, and Weibull predicts the rising and recession limbs of the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> more or less perfectly. Moreover, the log-normal distribution was recognized as the most successful model {{based on the}} average value of the objective function.|$|R
50|$|A UH is {{specific}} {{to a particular}} watershed, and specific to a particular length of time corresponding to {{the duration of the}} effective rainfall. That is, the UH is specified as being the 1-hour, 6-hour, or 24-hour UH, or any other length of time up to the time of concentration of direct runoff at the watershed outlet. Thus, for a given watershed, there can be many <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs,</b> each one corresponding to a different duration of effective rainfall.|$|R

5000|$|The {{catchment}} {{of a river}} above {{a certain}} location {{is determined by the}} surface area of all land which drains toward the river from above that point. The river's discharge at that location depends on the rainfall on the catchment or drainage area and the inflow or outflow of groundwater to or from the area, stream modifications such as dams and irrigation diversions, as well as evaporation and evapotranspiration from the area's land and plant surfaces. In storm hydrology, an important consideration is the stream's discharge hydrograph, a record of how the discharge varies over time after a precipitation event. The stream rises to a peak flow after each precipitation event, then falls in a slow recession. Because the peak flow also corresponds to the maximum water level reached during the event, it is of interest in flood studies. Analysis of the relationship between precipitation intensity and duration and the response of the stream discharge are aided by the concept of the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph,</b> which represents the response of stream discharge over time to the application of a hypothetical [...] "unit" [...] amount and duration of rainfall (e.g., half an inch over one hour). The amount of precipitation correlates to the volume of water (depending on the area of the catchment) that subsequently flows out of the river. Using the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> method, actual historical rainfalls can be modeled mathematically to confirm characteristics of historical floods, and hypothetical [...] "design storms" [...] can be created for comparison to observed stream responses.|$|E
50|$|A key {{component}} of a hydrological transport model is the surface runoff element, which allows assessment of sediment, fertilizer, pesticide and other chemical contaminants. Building {{on the work of}} Horton, the <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> theory was developed by Dooge in 1959. It required the presence of the National Environmental Policy Act and kindred other national legislation to provide the impetus to integrate water chemistry to hydrology model protocols. In the early 1970s the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began sponsoring a series of water quality models in response to the Clean Water Act. An example of these efforts was developed at the Southeast Water Laboratory, one of the first attempts to calibrate a surface runoff model with field data for a variety of chemical contaminants.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the process}} of {{separating}} “baseflow” from “direct runoff” is an inexact science. [...] In part this is because these two concepts are not, themselves, entirely distinct and unrelated. [...] Return flow from groundwater increases along with overland flow from saturated or impermeable areas during and after a storm event; [...] moreover, a particular water molecule can easily move through both pathways {{en route to the}} watershed outlet. [...] Therefore, separation of a purely “baseflow component” in a hydrograph is a somewhat arbitrary exercise. [...] Nevertheless, various graphical and empirical techniques have been developed to perform these hydrograph separations. [...] The separation of base flow from direct runoff can be an important first step in developing rainfall-runoff models for a watershed of interest—for example, in developing and applying <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> as described below.|$|R
40|$|Most hydrologic models use point {{rainfall}} data. Point {{data do not}} account for spatial characteristics of a storm.

Rainfall and flow gage data from the aridlands Walnut Gulch Watershed and regional data were used. A model was developed to estimate transmission losses (TL) using hydrograph routing (temporally-varying data), then a procedure was developed to use radar rainfall data (spatially-varying data) to develop <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs</b> (UH). Exponentially shaped UHs resulted from TLs. UHs developed from radar data agreed closely with Thiessen-averaged UHs developed from rain gage data, indicating that radar UHs better represented the overall watershed processes than a UH based on a single rain gage. Therefore, accurate UHs can be developed from radar data...|$|R

50|$|Magnitude and {{frequency}} method. For large basins, where <b>unit</b> <b>hydrograph</b> {{might not be}} useful and reliable, the magnitude {{and frequency}} method {{is used to calculate}} the probability of recurrence of large flows based on records of past years’ flows. In United States, these records are maintained by the Hydrological Division of the U.S. Geological Survey for most rivers and large streams. For a basin with an area of 5000 square miles or more, the river system is typically gauged at five to ten places. The data from each gauging station apply to the part of the basin upstream that location. Given several decades of peak annual discharges for a river, limited projections can be made to estimate the size of some large flow that has not been experienced during the period of record. The technique involves projecting the curve (graph line) formed when peak annual discharges are plotted against their respective recurrence intervals. However, in most cases the curve bends strongly, making it difficult to plot a projection accurately. This problem can be overcome by plotting the discharge and/or recurrence interval data on logarithmic graph paper. Once the plot is straightened, a line can be ruled drawn through the points. A projection can then be made by extending the line beyond the points and then reading the appropriate discharge for the recurrence interval in question.|$|E

Over 90 rainfall-runoff events are tested, with extremes ranging from 12. 5 mm to 71 5 mm for rainfall depth, 0. 4 mm to 50 mm for runoff volume, and 0. 031 ems to 73. 5 ems for peak discharge. Topologic Instantaneous <b>Unit</b> <b>Hydrographs</b> (TIUH's) are estimated from topologic and link-length parameters, and a scaling parameter. The topologic information is parameterized {{as the number of}} first-order links (magnitude) and the link-length distribution is parameterized by the mean. Both can be measured in the field or from topographic mapping and aerial photography. The scaling parameter is the "effective" kinematic celerity, which is a single-valued estimate of the kinematic celerity of the flow through the channel network {{for the duration of the}} event. The TIUH's lead to <b>unit</b> <b>hydrographs,</b> which are convolved with temporally distributed rainfall excess patterns computed using both the 0 index and the curve number, to give composite watershed hydrographs. Effective kinematic celerities are varied until the composite hydrographs match the observed hydrographs in terms of peak discharge and hydrograph efficiency. Results indicate that the TIUH approximately reproduces observed hydrographs, with calibrated effective kinematic celerities that fall within a reasonable range of magnitudes. Agreement between simulated and observed hydrographs is improved by introducing a lag to account for overland travel times to the channel network. The magnitude of the calibrated effective kinematic celerity is significantly related to watershed characteristics, including area, length, and slope. Regression equations are developed and the resulting predicted celerities are combined with map measured topologic and link-length parameters to give simulated hydrographs that approximately match the observed. Magnitude and link-length combine into a single parameter that is consistent across map scales and has the potential to be a watershed descriptor.
