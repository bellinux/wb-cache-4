5|$|According to Procopius, the Slavs {{believed}} in one god, {{the creator of}} lightning and master of the entire <b>universe,</b> <b>to</b> whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest god was called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names. Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and bought off with offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and practices were later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E

5|$|The game {{takes place}} after Raiden, Earthrealm's god of thunder, and Superman, Metropolis' defender, repel invasions from both their worlds. An attack by both Raiden and Superman {{simultaneously}} in their separate universes causes {{the merging of}} the Mortal Kombat and DC villains, Shao Kahn and Darkseid, resulting {{in the creation of}} Dark Kahn, whose mere existence causes the two <b>universes</b> <b>to</b> begin merging; if allowed to continue, it would result in the destruction of both.

40|$|Parallel <b>universes</b> <b>to</b> {{improve the}} {{diagnosis}} of cardiac arrhythmias (extended abstract) Elisa Fromont, Ren¶e Quiniou, Marie-Odile Cordier We are interested in using parallel <b>universes</b> <b>to</b> learn interpretable models that can be subsequently used to automatically diagnose cardiac arrhythmias. In our study, parallel universes are heterogeneous sources such as electrocardiograms, blood pressure measurements, phonocardio-grams etc. that give relevant information about the cardiac state of a patient. To learn interpretable rules, we use an inductive logic program-ming (ILP) method on a symbolic version of our data. Aggregating the symbolic data coming from all the sources before learning, increases both the number of possible relations that can be learned and {{the richness of the}} language. We propose a two-step strategy to deal with these dimen-sionality problems when using ILP. First, rules are learned independentl...|$|R

Harley Quinn has the Joker sent back to the prime universe after realizing that he does not care about her, Green Lantern hands over his counterpart and Sinestro to the Guardians of the <b>Universe</b> <b>to</b> stand trial, and Wonder Woman dethrones her counterpart. The dictator Superman is placed in a prison emitting red sun radiation that renders him powerless, and his prime counterpart admits that if he were placed in the same position, he might have done the same thing. The alternate Batman tells Superman that he hopes that Superman never has to learn what he could be capable of if he turns evil, and warns him that if something ever happens to him, causing him to go down the path of his counterpart, he will come after him. As they walk away, the alternate Superman's eyes glow red, indicating he still has some degree of his powers.|$|E
5|$|Astronomical {{observations}} of the cosmological expansion rate allow {{the total amount of}} matter in the <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part. About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly. There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise. Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Chris Boucher's five Star Cops scripts {{have been}} semi-professionally {{published}} {{in two volumes}} by Judith Proctor.

The second volume Little Green Men and Other Stories included the four remaining Boucher scripts. There are some changes from the broadcast episodes – neither the characters of Alexander Krivenko nor Anna Shoun appear in these books. Krivenko {{is replaced by a}} Chinese character, Jiang Li Ho, as an attempt to update the Star Cops <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> reflect the ending of the Cold War in 1989. Shoun is replaced by an Irish character, Dana Cogill – Boucher didn't own the rights to use the Shoun character who had been created by John Collee.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s and the 1980s, various {{observations}} {{showed that}} there is not sufficient visible matter in the <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal baryonic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, galaxy cluster velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, gravitational lensing studies, and X-ray measurements of galaxy clusters.|$|E
5|$|In the finale, {{the main}} {{characters}} spend the longest {{amount of time in}} the parallel <b>universe</b> <b>to</b> date. The writers sought to emphasize {{the differences between the two}} worlds: Anna Torv created a unique personality and physical demeanor for her character's doppelgänger, Fauxlivia; DC Comics designed special covers based upon some of their classic editions to display in the Other Side. These and other popular culture differences were noted and appreciated by critics, persuading the writers to add more in the third season. The episodes mark the first appearance of recurring character Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), as well as the return of actors Leonard Nimoy and Kirk Acevedo as William Bell and Agent Charlie Francis, respectively.|$|E
