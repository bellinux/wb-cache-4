No general hospitals may refuse a patient treatment for intoxication or alcoholism, and all individual and group health insurance plans which are regulated by the state of New Jersey are required to offer both inpatient and outpatient treatment for alcoholism. Under federal law, all group health insurances plans for private companies with more than 50 employees must offer insurance coverage for alcoholism that is equal to their insurance coverage for other medical conditions.|$|E
5|$|Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) warns the FBI and BATF that Ephesian and {{his wives}} will be {{released}} in a day <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> track down Sidney and the Temple's reported weapons cache. The agents question Ephesian, who states {{that there is no}} member of the temple named Sidney. When they interview Melissa, she suddenly begins to talk like Sidney, claiming that Harry Truman is president. Scully believes Melissa is exhibiting multiple personality disorder, but Mulder thinks she is recalling a past life. The agents take her back to the temple, where she takes on the personality of a woman from the Civil War period and says that the weapons were hidden in another secret bunker in the field. She also states that Mulder, in a past life, was a Confederate soldier in the field with her, her beloved, and she watched him die.|$|E

Goth looks down on Nocturna and the humans, because a human subjected him to scientific experimentation, and believes Zotz is the true master. Eventually Goth's arrogance and underestimation of Shade leads to his downfall, as Shade drugs him and electrocutes him. Goth, however, is still alive to fight another day.|$|R

Emotions such as fear and anxiety <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> are controlled <b>can</b> overwhelm even the most highly trained professional. Training designed to support and strengthen professionals against skill degradation through stress now often involves simulation where highly dangerous situations such as combat and critical medical emergencies can be safely replicated.

Útgarða-Loki comments that this would be a feat indeed, and calls for a being by the name of Logi to come from the benches. A trencher is fetched, placed on the floor of the hall, and filled with meat. Loki and Logi sit down on opposing sides. The two eat as quickly as they can and meet at the midpoint of the trencher. Loki consumed all of the meat off of the bones on his side, yet Logi had not only consumed his meat, but also the bones and the trencher itself. It was evident to all that Loki had lost. In turn, Þjálfi races against a figure by the name of Hugi three times and thrice loses.|$|E

500|$|In his {{majority}} opinion, Justice Samuel Alito {{held that}} the exclusion of Ayala's counsel during the Batson hearings was harmless error. Justice Alito emphasized that under federal law, prisoners are not entitled to habeas relief <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> demonstrate [...] "actual prejudice". Additionally, Justice Alito noted that under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, federal courts should be [...] "highly deferential" [...] to state courts [...] "when a prisoner's 'claim' has been 'adjudicated on the merits' in state court". Applying these standards to {{the facts of this}} case, Justice Alito ruled that Ayala did not suffer any actual prejudice and that the California Supreme Court's opinion [...] "represented an entirely reasonable application of controlling precedent". Consequently, Justice Alito {{held that the}} Ninth Circuit's ruling should be reversed and that the case should be remanded for reconsideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision.|$|E

2500|$|Domesticated yaks {{have been}} kept for {{thousands}} of years, primarily for their milk, fibre and meat, and as beasts of burden.

Yak's milk is often processed to a cheese called chhurpi in Tibetan and Nepali languages, and byaslag in Mongolia.

2500|$|Medicaid {{provided}} the largest portion of federal {{money spent on}} health care for people living with HIV/AIDS until the implementation of Medicare Part D when the prescription drug costs for those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid shifted to Medicare. [...] Unless low income people who are HIV positive meet some other eligibility category, they {{are not eligible for}} Medicaid assistance <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> qualify under the [...] "disabled" [...] category to receive Medicaid assistance — as, for example, if they progress to AIDS (T-cell count drops below 200). The Medicaid eligibility policy contrasts with the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) guidelines which recommend therapy for all patients with T-cell counts of 350 or less, or in certain patients commencing at an even higher T-cell count. [...] Due to the high costs associated with HIV medications, many patients are not able to begin antiretroviral treatment without Medicaid help. [...] More than half of people living with AIDS in the US are estimated to receive Medicaid payments. Two other programs that provide financial assistance to people living with HIV/AIDS are the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and the Supplemental Security Income.|$|E

Cruz's [...] "incendiary outburst" [...] was [...] "unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the Senate", according to Reuters. In the same speech, Cruz assailed the [...] "Republican majority in both houses of Congresses" [...] for what Cruz termed an insufficiently conservative record. Cruz's speech, and especially his accusation against McConnell, was condemned by various senior Republican senators, with John McCain saying that the speech was [...] "outside the realm of Senate behavior" [...] and [...] "a very wrong thing to do". Orrin Hatch expressed a similar opinion: [...] "I don't condone the use of that kind of language against another senator <b>unless</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> show definitive proof that there was a lie ...

[...] Cruz had alleged that McConnell scheduled a vote on the Ex-Im Bank as part of a deal to persuade Democrats like Maria Cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill, whereas McConnell denied there was any [...] "deal", and that denial is what Cruz termed a [...] "lie"; Hatch says McConnell did pledge to help Cantwell get a vote on the Ex-Im Bank.|$|E
