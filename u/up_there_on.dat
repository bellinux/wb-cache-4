5|$|It {{was more}} {{difficult}} to take Koroni. General Sébastiani showed <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> October 7 with a party from his brigade. The fort commander’s response was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. Sébastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain, a sergeant and three sappers. The other French soldiers felt insulted and their general had great difficulty in preventing them from opening fire and taking the stronghold by force. The Amphitrite, the Breslaw and the Wellesley came to {{the assistance of the}} ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannons and guns, along with numerous victuals and munitions.|$|E

25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over.

As of 2009, a re-write of the script was being done with screenwriter Mulroney while Warner Brothers were working with a studio to create some early conceptual design/look development. Sage commented: [...] "It is very exciting to know that others are putting their creative input into my work—quite amazing really.

500|$|Rivette {{worked with}} scriptwriters Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent using an {{automatic}} writing approach that involved writing the script day by day; {{the actors and}} filmmakers {{did not know the}} direction of the story in advance of each day's filming. Eurimages provided €420,000 of funding in July 2002, and the film was shot that autumn and winter. Rivette immediately thought of Béart, who starred in La Belle Noiseuse, to play the carnal Marie. Béart has said that [...] "Of all the films I've made, this was the one which most disturbed people very close to me. They said: 'It's almost as though the Emmanuelle we know was <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> the screen.'." [...] Béart's image in the media at the time was characterised by the near hysteria seen when she appeared naked on the cover of Elle in May 2003 after filming ended.|$|E

500|$|... "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] is a bass solo by Burton, {{accompanied}} on drums by Ulrich. A {{staple of}} Burton's live performances since {{his high school}} days in the band Agents of Misfortune, the instrumental track featured Burton's distinctive [...] "lead-bass" [...] style of playing, incorporating heavy distortion, use of wah-wah pedal and tapping. Bubacz introduces the track as [...] "Bass solo, take one", informing listeners that the song was recorded in one take. [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth" [...] was the bass solo that Burton was playing when Hetfield and Ulrich first saw him at a gig. Hetfield stated: [...] "We heard this wild solo going on and thought, 'I don't see any guitar player up there.' We were both counting the strings and I finally turned to Lars and said, 'Dude, that's a bass!' Cliff was <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> stage with his band Trauma with a wah-wah pedal and his huge mop of red hair. He didn't care whether people were there. He was {{looking down at his}} bass, playing." [...] "Whiplash" [...] was the album's first single, issued on August 8, 1983. It features a swift rhythm line of straight 16th notes played at about 200 beats per minute. Hetfield and Burton performed with palm muted technique and precise metronomic control. The lyrics celebrate crowd energy and headbanging. Rock journalist Mick Wall wrote that [...] "Whiplash" [...] signified the birth of thrash metal, stating: [...] "If one wishes to identify the very moment thrash metal arrived spitting and snarling into the world, 'Whiplash' is indisputably it." ...|$|E
500|$|Gilbert Adair, {{writing in}} a review for Full Metal Jacket, commented that [...] "Kubrick's {{approach}} to language has always been of a reductive and uncompromisingly deterministic nature. He appears to view it as the exclusive product of environmental conditioning, only very marginally influenced by concepts of subjectivity and interiority, by all whims, shades and modulations of personal expression". Johnson notes that although Kubrick was a [...] "visual filmmaker", he also loved words and was like a writer in his approach, very sensitive to the story itself, which he found unique. Before shooting began, Kubrick tried to have the script as complete as possible, but still allowed himself enough space to make changes during the filming, finding it [...] "more profitable to avoid locking up any ideas about staging or camera or even dialogue prior to rehearsals" [...] as he put it. Kubrick told Robert Emmett Ginna: [...] "I {{think you have to}} view the entire problem of putting the story you want to tell <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> that light square. It begins with the selection of the property; it continues through the creation of the story, the sets, the costumes, the photography and the acting. And when the picture is shot, it's only partially finished. I think the cutting is just a continuation of directing a movie. I think the use of music effects, opticals and finally main titles are all part of telling the story. And I think the fragmentation of these jobs, by different people, is a very bad thing". Kubrick also said: [...] "I think that the best plot is no apparent plot. I like a slow start, the start that gets under the audience's skin and involves them so that they can appreciate grace notes and soft tones and don't have to be pounded over the head with plot points and suspense tools." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E

2500|$|During this period, Tidwell {{would often}} return home from New York to Virginia Beach, to be [...] "rejuvenated" [...] and {{teach at the}} studio with his mother.

Travis had come in second place during the {{previous}} season, and was heavily featured in the touring show.

We then devised this system and it had an absolutely firm principle: it had a great spine down the middle where everybody walked. That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one. I thought it worked very well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because of its {{commanding}} {{view of the}} harbor, {{the roof}} of the warehouse has long been the site of various operations. [...] Starting in the early 1920s, the Marine Exchange operated on its roof, providing lookout reports on ships entering and leaving the port. [...] In 1925, the Radio Corporation of America located its harbor receiving station {{to the top of the}} massive warehouse. [...] A new four-room lookout station for use by the Marine Exchange was built in 1928 atop the warehouse. [...] The new station had a large circular window giving telescopes a commanding view of the harbor and ocean, and also included a neon red beacon which shed a red glow over the building at night. [...] In 1939, the Los Angeles Times described the Exchange as [...] "a world all its own <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>on</b> Warehouse No. 1." [...] In eight-hour shifts, three men manned the Exchange, climbing seven flights of stairs to reach the lookout station. [...] The Times described the station as follows: [...] "In one room with big windows commanding every approach from the sea, there is a large telescope on wheels. [...] It can be pointed in any direction with the touch of a finger. [...] At a little desk looking out over the channel and the harbor sits one of the three men who are on duty as lookouts ..." [...] During World War II, as blackout rules were applied along the coast, the Marine Exchange ceased operations but resumed its lookout operations atop the warehouse in late 1945. [...] In 1964, a new 26 x [...] perch was built atop the warehouse for use by the Marine Exchange. The roof was also the site of a weather observation and signal facility for many years.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered and I would never ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. <b>Up</b> <b>there,</b> <b>on</b> the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
