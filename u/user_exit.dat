40|$|Hirschman {{contrasts}} {{exit and}} voice as 'recuperation' mechanisms for making organisations responsive to users. However, {{the emergence of}} health-care quasi-markets and of network governance structures since Hirschman necessitate revising his theory, for they complicate the relationships between governance structures and recuperation mechanisms. Using {{a case study of}} nine primary care trusts (PCTs), this paper analyses the recuperation mechanisms, governance structures and relations between them in primary care in England. User voice can be exercised through dedicated networks besides hierarchies. As well as the 'user exit' described by Hirschman, two new 'exit' mechanisms now exist in quasi-markets. Commissioner exit occurs when a third-party payer stops using a given provider. Professional proxy exit occurs when a general practitioner (GP) fund-holder (or analogous budget-holder) behaves similarly. Neither exit mechanism requires the existence of mechanisms for <b>user</b> <b>exit</b> from healthcare purchasers, provided strong voice mechanisms exist instead to make commissioners responsive to users' demands. Establishing such voice mechanisms is not straightforward, however, as the experience of English PCTs illustrates. Exit Voice Governance Primary care England Quasi-market UK...|$|E
40|$|Client {{satisfaction}} surveys {{in developing countries}} are increasingly being promoted {{as a means of}} understanding healthcare service quality and the demand for these services. However, concerns have been raised about the reliability of responses in such surveys: for example, 'courtesy bias' may lead clients, especially if interviewed upon exiting clinics, to provide misleadingly favorable responses. This study investigates this and other issues using unusual data from Madagascar in which identical questions about satisfaction with local health care centers were asked in <b>user</b> <b>exit</b> surveys and in a population-based household survey, the latter being less contaminated by courtesy bias as well as changes in provider behavior in response to being observed. The findings suggest that reported satisfaction in exit surveys is biased strongly upward for subjective questions regarding (for example) treatment by staff and consultation quality, but not for relatively objective questions about facility condition and supplies. The surveys do provide useful information on the determinants of consumer satisfaction with various dimensions of provider quality. Still, to obtain reliable estimates of consumer perceptions of health service quality, household-based sampling is strongly preferred.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: South Africa has {{among the}} highest {{reported}} rates of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) globally. Primary prevention targeting women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies could substantially {{reduce the incidence of}} FAS. We evaluated the effectiveness of a short training intervention to improve service providers' screening, identification, and management of women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies. METHOD: Training to screen and counsel women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies was offered to 86 service providers (95 % of whom were female) in two municipalities in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Effectiveness was evaluated through a before-after study of service providers' knowledge and confidence levels and a comparison of service providers' practices (assessed indirectly via service <b>user</b> <b>exit</b> interviews) at intervention and control clinics. RESULTS: The proportion of service providers indicating that alcohol use during pregnancy is harmful to the fetus increased after training (23 % vs. 67 %; p <. 001). After training, providers expressed significantly more confidence for four skills indicators related to the identification and management of women at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. Female clients at intervention clinics were more likely than those at the control clinics to receive alcohol advice (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 13, 95 % CI [1. 27, 3. 53]), counseling (OR = 1. 3, 95 % CI [1. 05, 1. 56]), and an offer of family planning (OR = 1. 1, 95 % CI [1. 06, 2. 10]) after the training. Time × Group interaction variable analysis in multiple logistic regression modeling confirmed these effects as related to training. CONCLUSIONS: A short training course based on brief motivational interviewing principles appears to be effective in building service provider capacity to better prevent and manage women at risk for alcohol-exposed pregnancies.
