25|$|Urban {{growth in}} São Paulo has {{followed}} three patterns {{since the beginning}} of the 20th century, according to urban historians: since the late 19th Century and until the 1940s, São Paulo was a condensed city in which different social groups lived in a small <b>urban</b> <b>zone</b> separated by type of housing; from the 1940s to the 1980s, São Paulo followed a model of center-periphery social segregation, in which the upper and middle-classes occupied central and modern areas while the poor moved towards precarious, self-built housing in the periphery; and from the 1980s onward, new transformations have brought the social classes closer together in spatial terms, but separated by walls and security technologies that seek to isolate the richer classes in the name of security.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{has recently}} adopted smart growth principles to guide its future development. The official {{plan calls for}} densification and infill of existing urban land, rather than acquiring more rural land. A near-doubling of Embrun's population will be accomplished in the next 10–15 years with only two new neighbourhoods (both in land already designated as urban land use zones) being built. The {{rest of the population}} growth will be done by building housing units in the open spaces between existing neighbourhoods, and by eventually replacing single-family homes on some busier streets with apartments and condos. Through this plan, Embrun's population will increase from its current population of around 6,000 people to upwards of 10,000 people in 2021, with only a small amount of land to the west being added to the <b>urban</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

500|$|Historically, the Fonteyn Kill's {{water has}} been noted for its cleanness. In 1924, the stream's [...] "purity" [...] was noted while an 1867 book {{describes}} the kill's waters as [...] "". More recently, the stream has been cited as suffering from urban stream syndrome. Surfaces surrounding the Fonteyn Kill are highly impervious; the stream drains an <b>urban</b> <b>zone</b> {{of the city of}} Poughkeepsie, New York, of which over 60% is impervious. The exact size of the kill's watershed is not known; an area at least as large as the known watershed is presumed to contribute to the stream's flow in the form of storm drainage. In spite of this, the stream itself is bordered by a combination of residential lots and forested swaths ranging from [...] in width.

500|$|In 1934, {{a temple}} {{was built in}} Sector Libertad of Guadalajara's <b>urban</b> <b>zone</b> and members were {{encouraged}} to buy homes {{in the same neighborhood}} thereby establishing a community.

The Church used the latter name to identify itself. In 1939, it moved to a new meeting place at 12 de Octubre street in San Antonio in southeast Guadalajara, forming its second small community which was populated mainly by its members. This community was an attempt to escape the hostile environment, not to create an egalitarian society.|$|E
500|$|The Fonteyn Kill is [...] long. Historian Helen Wilkinson Reynolds {{reported}} in 1924 that the stream is fed by a spring in Arlington, New York. More recently, the exact {{source of the}} kill has been reported as unknown. Historical records indicate a variety of courses once followed by the stream. A 2010 study observed that the Fonteyn Kill flows from a culvert beneath Park Avenue in an eastward direction through an <b>urban</b> <b>zone</b> before turning southward and feeding into the artificial Vassar Lake. It then flows southeastward beneath Raymond Avenue through the campus of Vassar College, beneath the college's Bridge for Laboratory Sciences, and into the Casperkill just below Sunset Lake at a location once dubbed [...] "The Meeting of the Waters". The Fonteyn Kill is the only perennial tributary of the Casperkill, itself {{a tributary of the}} Hudson River. In 1924, the Fonteyn Kill was noted as having several small tributaries, primarily [...] "small meadow-runs, largely surface-water".|$|E
