He led his first strike, against the same company, in 1957 at the age of 22, leading 500 workers off the job. Subsequently, White became fully immersed in the Canadian labour movement as a union organizer and then by 1959 president of Local 636 of the United Auto Workers (U.A.W.), a union based in the United States, that at the time had a large membership in Canadian industry (particularly in automobile manufacturing). In 1960 White was appointed as international representative of the U.A.W. and assigned to organizing duties within Canada. 1972 saw White named as administrative assistant to the director of the National Office of the U.A.W. White succeeded Dennis McDermott as Canadian Director of the UAW in 1978.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cases of}} Hattie Williams and Viola Watson {{highlighted}} {{the difficulties of}} labor organizing on Duke’s campus. Initially, unionization efforts {{had little effect on}} working conditions because of a historically unwelcoming environment for labor unions, and the resulting lack of recognition by the University’s entire population. At first, employees attained only minor improvements in pay, and a new grievance procedure easily manipulated by management and administrators. In the case of Hattie Williams and Viola Watson, members involved with Local 77 and African-American housekeepers who had worked for at least four years, were fired without warning in the winter of 1966. Both workers received no complaints about the quality of their work. However, both previously involved themselves in the Local 77 movement; Williams was a <b>Union</b> <b>Steward</b> and Watson had picketed for higher wages with the union. [...] They used the grievance procedure to reclaim their positions in the University. However, only Hattie Williams was returned to her job while Watson was denied permission to her previous position.|$|E

5000|$|While at Briggs, Mr. Bates became {{involved}} in the organized labor movement, he worked passionately for the organized labor cause at Briggs. By 1937, the UAW-CIO had organized and signed a collective bargaining agreement with the Briggs Manufacturing Company. Through that effort Leon Bates {{became one of the most}} outspoken <b>union</b> <b>stewards</b> of UAW Local #212. In 1937 Briggs was the fourth largest employer of Negroes in the Detroit area with more than 1,300 or approximately 10% of its total payroll. The UAW-CIO was keenly aware of this fact; so their leadership made the decision to include the Negro workers in the organizing efforts. This decision ran contrary to the social, economic, and business norms of the day as the vast majority of labor unions were segregated at that time and simply would not accept Negro membership. The UAW-CIO was so concerned about the issue of Negro participation that the UAW-International Office sent out a letter encouraging each local to elect at least one Negro delegate to its 1937 convention. Leon Bates was one of two Negro delegates elected to represent Local #212 at the 1937 UAW convention. Even though the UAW had organized Briggs, not all of its employees were union members; in 1937 Local #212 renewed its efforts organise the remaining employees. Placing special emphasis on the Negro employees Local #212 formed a [...] "Negro organizing committee" [...] composed of the Negro <b>union</b> <b>stewards.</b> Each of them was tasked with recruitment in department and assigned areas without a steward. At the time Chief Steward Leon Bates, had 81 men men assigned to his department on his shift, all but two were members of Local #212.|$|R

This study was the first to {{explicitly}} examine the relation between perceived union support and union instrumentality. Surveys were completed by 273 union members and 29 <b>union</b> <b>stewards.</b> A comparison of 2 models, 1 based on organizational support theory and 1 based on union participation theories, found that the model based on organizational support theory, in which union instrumentality was an antecedent to perceived union support and led to union loyalty and subsequently union participation, best fit the data. The model based on union participation theories, in which perceived union support was an antecedent of union instrumentality and led to union loyalty and subsequently union participation, was not supported. Union instrumentality was related to union commitment, but the relation was completely mediated by perceived union support...|$|R

40|$|Excerpt] Methodological {{problems}} {{in studies of}} union commitment were identified and illustrated with data from 4, 641 members and 479 stewards in 297 local teachers’ unions. Using a 20 -item union commitment scale, results confirmed the existence of 3 substantive factors and 1 method factor {{at the individual level}} of analysis: loyalty to the union, responsibility to the union, willingness to work for the union, and a factor of negatively worded items. Tests of measurement invariance showed that the scale captured commitment for rank-and-file members but not for <b>union</b> <b>stewards.</b> The authors also found partial measurement invariance between long-time and newer members and full measurement invariance between men and women. Finally, the authors found that violation of the statistical assumption of independence reduced model fit when individual commitment scores were analyzed without attention to the hierarchical nature of the data...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 64 - 66) This study, {{inspired by}} the apparent lack of attention given to training lay worker-agents in alcoholism intervention, outlines an investigation based upon a broad educational training approach for <b>union</b> <b>stewards</b> {{in the field of}} alcoholism prevention. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate changes that could be made in existing attitudes and levels of knowledge toward alcoholism in 130 <b>union</b> <b>stewards</b> and to provide a lay agent of health education to carry out primary, secondary and tertiary levels of prevention. Within each stratification of the problem, sex, age, type, work and type of industry in which employed, groups were chosen by random selection and assigned to one of four study groups. Questionnaires were devised which asked the steward what he knew about the identifiable signs and behavioral manifestations of alcoholism, and what he did when he knew of an alcoholic or other problem employee. The semantic differential scale was used to measure attitudes toward six types of problem employees. Behavior was measured by ten alternative action scales listing twelve action dimensions; six most likely and six least likely. The data were transferred from the evaluation tools to computer cards, and a program that performed frequency counts was used. A chi-square test was calculated to investigate the relationship between changes in action and attitude. A multiple regression analysis was applied to the data to determine the type of profile most likely to change during this study's case-seminar training program. Of the changes associated with the training program, the following six general statements apply. (1) Changes in attitudes and action from the training were statistically small. (2) In contrast, changes in attitudes and action from administration of the questionnaire alone were statistically pronounced. (3) The combination of testing and training procedures produced more changes than training alone. (4) There was a significant relationship between attitudes toward an alcoholic employee and attitudes toward other kinds of problem employees. (5) Negative evaluations by the stewards were directly correlated to more confrontation and referral behavior patterns. (6) Using the training approach of the problem employee, in general, yielded more favorable changes than the traditional training emphasis on the alcoholic alone...|$|R
