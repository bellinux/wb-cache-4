30|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{estimating}} the quality and the reverberation level of distorted reverberant signals, using the microphone signals alone. Using a directional microphone array, we utilize the directivity pattern of the array elements to segregate the reverberation contribution from the direct signal. We measure the ratio between the energies of the <b>unidirectional</b> <b>sensors</b> and derive an objective signal-based measure for the reverberation quantity. Additionally, we expand this method and derive a reliable blind DRR estimator. Our proposed approach attains a reliable measure with high correlation to various reverberation parameters and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for quality estimation.|$|R

Based on a statistical model, we have developed a model for reverberated speech in directional microphones. Supported by this, we measured the power ratio between two opposite <b>unidirectional</b> <b>sensors</b> and segregated the diffuse field influence from the direct signal. This directional-power-ratio measure was shown to properly estimate the ratio between the direct speech and the reverberation amount, yielding a well-founded signal-based quality measure and a blind DRR estimator. It was compared to various state-of-the-art quality measurement algorithms and DRR measures, and provided reliable results which are highly correlated to the system-based DRR measure. Finally, we tested its performance with some real speech input and managed to show that it {{can be used as a}} reliable and robust speech quality measure.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} efficiency in software development for controlling robots, tools facilitating the implementation of distributed control applications are required. This thesis proposes {{a solution to this}} problem with a framework called CoRoBA (Controlling Robot with CORBA). CoRoBA is made up of component based execution units. It comes with a 3 D simulation application and utility programs for distributing and managing the live and run cycle of multi-process applications. The implementation of the framework is based on several Design Patterns that make the design flexible, elegant and ultimately reusable. The execution unit in CoRoBA is a component. Components are independent execution units that have separated interfaces for the configuration and the actual functionality they provide. According to the classical control theory, components are divided in three categories, Sensors, Processors and Actuators. They form a chain along which information is transferred and like in classic control schemes, the data flow is <b>unidirectional.</b> <b>Sensors</b> read data from external devices and transmit them to other components.

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of patients presenting to a specialist rhinology practice with chronic sinusitis. METHODS: Forty patients with chronic sinusitis underwent ambulatory 24 hour pH testing. The {{mean age of the}} patients was 56. 3 years (25 Female, 15 Male). The studies were performed using a specially developed bifurcated 4 channel pH probe, incorporating 2 circumferential sensors positioned at the naso- and hypo-pharynx, and 2 <b>unidirectional</b> <b>sensors</b> positioned at the proximal and distal esophagus. RESULTS: The circumferential band sensors yielded a stable recording largely free of artefact allowing meaningful recordings to be obtained from thirty-seven patients. Twelve patients (32. 4 %) were diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux. A total of 809 reflux episodes were recorded. Of these, 596 (73. 7 %) reached the distal esophagus, with 187 (23. 1 %) and 24 (3. 0 %) reaching the proximal esophagus and hypopharynx respectively. Only 2 episodes (0. 2 %) were recorded in the nasopharynx. This occurred in 2 of 37 patients (5 %). CONCLUSIONS: Acid reflux into the nasopharynx is a rare event in patients with chronic sinusitis even though a significant proportion (32. 4 %) have abnormal 24 hour pH studies. It is likely that alternative mechanisms other than direct acid contact are involved in the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{recorded}} MEG {{responses from}} 17 participants viewing random-dot patterns simulating global optic flow components (expansion, contraction, rotation, deformation, and translation) and a random motion control condition. Theta-band (3 – 7 Hz), MEG signal power was greater for expansion {{than the other}} optic flow components in a region concentrated along the calcarine sulcus, indicating an ecologically valid, foveo-fugal bias for <b>unidirectional</b> motion <b>sensors</b> in V 1. When {{the responses to the}} optic flow components were combined, a decrease in MEG beta-band (17 – 23 Hz) power was found in regions extending beyond the calcarine sulcus to the posterior parietal lobe (inferior to IPS), indicating the importance of structured motion in this region. However, only one cortical area, within or near the V 5 /hMT+ complex, responded to all three spiral-space components (expansion, contraction, and rotation) and showed no selectivity for global translation or deformation: we term this area hMSTs. This is the first demonstration of an exclusive region for spiral space in the human brain and suggests a functional role better suited to preliminary analysis of ego-motion than surface pose, which would involve deformation. We also observed that the rotation condition activated the cerebellum, suggesting its involvement in visually mediated control of postural adjustment...|$|R

Significant sensor errors are present in both the high relative humidity and low airspeed ranges. Also, the margin for error is small relative to the desired drying measure for mushroom growth. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the suitability of a low-cost prototype anemometer for use in a mushroom growth environment. A calibrated thermal anemometer was used as a performance reference for the prototype airspeed sensor. Case studies were carried out on two prototype airspeed sensors to determine suitability for use in this drying measure application.

We introduce second-order consensus protocols that {{take into account}} motions of the information states and their derivatives, extending first-order protocols from the literature. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which consensus can be reached {{in the context of}} unidirectional information exchange topologies. This work takes into account the general case where information flow may be <b>unidirectional</b> due to <b>sensors</b> with limited fields of view or vehicles with directed, power-constrained communication links. Unlike the first-order case, we show that having a (directed) spanning tree is a necessary rather than a sufficient condition for consensus seeking with second-order dynamics. This work focuses on a formal analysis of information exchange topologies that permit second-order consensus. Given its importance to the stability of the coordinated system, an analysis of the consensus term control gains is also presented, specifically the strength of the information states relative to their derivatives. As an illustrative example, consensus protocols are applied to coordinate the movements of multiple mobile robots. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical and {{experimental}} evidences have shown how changes in myocardial performance are mirrored in changes of first heart sound acceleration amplitude, {{which is generally}} 10 to 100 times more powerful with endecavitary than with chest wall recordings. Aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate the clinical feasibility and tolerability of intracavitary sampling of first heart sound via an implantable tip mounted accelerometer in man. We developed an <b>unidirectional</b> acceleration <b>sensor</b> (Sorin Biomedica) located inside the stimulating tip of a standard unipolar pacing lead: it has a frequency response up to 1 KHz and a sensitivity of 5 mV/G (G= 9. 8 m/sec 2). The lead was connected to an external signal amplifier with a frequency range of 0. 05 – 1, 000 Hz and to a peak to peak detector synchronised with the endocardial R-wave scanning the isovolumetric contraction phase. Following standard electrophysiologic studies, sensor equipped leads were temporarily inserted in the right ventricle of 15 patients (61 ± 7 years), with normal regional and global ventricular function, to record peak endocardial acceleration (PEA) of first heart sound frequencies at rest, during AAI pacing, VVI pacing and during dobutamine infusion (up to 20 mcg/kg/min). PEA at baseline was 1. 2 ± 0. 6 G (heart rate= 68 ± 13 b. p. m. 1 and increased to 1. 5 ± 0. 9 (p=ns vs baselinel during AAI pacing (heart rate= 140 b. p. m.) and to 1. 4 ± 0. 7 (p=ns vs baseline) during VVI pacing (heart rate= 140 b. p. m.). Dobutamine infusion increased PEA to 5. 4 ± 2. 1 (p< 0. 001 vs baseline). with a heart rate= 120 ± 11 b. p. m. In conclusion, high quality first heart sound recording can be consistently and safely obtained with an implantable device. Pharmacologic inotropic stimulation, but not isolated chronotropic stimulation, increase the strength of the signal, in keeping with the experimental studies suggesting that PEA is an index of myocardial contractility.

40|$|Artificial defects {{embedded}} in periodic structures are important foundation for creating localized states with vast range of applications in condensed matter physics, photonics and acoustics. In photonics, localized states are extensively used to confine and manipulate photons. Up to now, all the proposed localized states are reciprocal and restricted by time reversal symmetry. Consequently, localization is bidirectional and photons at the allowed passband in the otherwise forbidden stop band are confined {{irrespective of the}} direction of incident beam. In this report, by embedding a single defect in a one-dimensional spatiotemporally modulated photonic lattice, we demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to have localization of photon only in one direction. In a spatiotemporally modulated photonics lattice, a time dependent potential generates an effective magnetic biasing, which breaks the reciprocity. Moreover, in such moving lattices the dispersion relation obtains a shift depending on the direction of effective magnetic biasing. A static defect synthesized in a temporally modulated lattice will generate a spatial localization of light in the bandgap. However, due to the shift of the bandgap the localization occurs in different frequencies depending on the direction of incident field. We envisage that this phenomenon might has impact not only in photonics but also other areas of physics and engineering such as condensed matter and acoustics, opens the doors for designing new types of devices such as non-reciprocal traps, <b>sensors,</b> <b>unidirectional</b> tunable filters, and might result in unconventional transports such as unidirectional lasing. Despite its applications, our proposal, namely a defect sate in a driven system, can be considered as a pedagogical example of Floquet problem with analytical solution...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{acoustic}} wave sensors {{have been a}} focus of active research for many years. Its ability to respond for surface perturbation is a basic principle for its sensing capability. Sensitivity to surface perturbation changes with every inter-digital transducer (IDT) design parameters, substrate selection, metallization choice and technique, delay line length and working environment. In this thesis, surface {{acoustic wave}} (SAW) sensors are designed and characterized to improve sensitivity and reduce loss. To quantify the improvements with a specific design configuration, the sensors are employed to measure temperature. Four SAW sensors design configurations, namely bi-directional, split electrode, single phase unidirectional transducer (SPUDT) and metal grating on delay line (shear transvers wave sensors) are designed and then fabricated in Nanotechnology Research and Education Center (NREC) facility using traditional MEMS fabrication processes Additionally, sensors are then coated with guiding layer SU 8 - 2035 of 40 m using spin coating and SiO 2 of 6 m using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. Sensors are later diced and tested for every 5 oC increment using network analyzer for temperature ranging from 30 oC– 0. 5 oC to 80 oC– 0. 5 oC. Data acquired from network analyzer is analyzed using plot of logarithmic magnitude, phase and frequency shift. Furthermore, to investigate the effect of metallization technique on the sensor performance, sensors are also fabricated on substrates that were metallized at a commercial MEMS foundry. All in-house and outside sputtered sensor configurations are compared to investigate quality of sputtered metal on wafer. One with better quality sputtered metal is chosen for further study.

40|$|Short range {{wireless}} {{data communication}} networks {{that are used}} for sport and health care are sometimes called Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) and they are located more or less on a person. Sole Integrated Gait Sensor (SIGS) is a research project in WBAN, where wireless pressure sensors are placed like soles in the shoes of persons with different kinds of deceases. The sensors can measure {{the pressure of the}} foot relative to the shoe i. e. the load of the two legs is measured. This information can be useful e. g. to not over or under load a leg after joint replacement or as a bio feedback system to help e. g. post stroke patients to avoid falling. The SIGS uses the ANT Protocol and radio specification. ANT uses the 2. 4 GHz ISM band and TDMA is used to share a single frequency. The scheduling of time slots is adaptive isochronous co-existence i. e. the scheduling is not static and each transmitter sends periodically but checks for interference with other traffic on the radio channel. In this <b>unidirectional</b> system sole <b>sensors</b> are masters (transmitters) and the WBAN server is the slave in ANT sense. The message rate is chosen as 8 Hz which is suitable for low power consumption. Hence in the SIGS system, it is necessary to synchronize {{the left and the right}} foot sensors because of low message rate. In our thesis, we found a method and developed a prototype to receive the time synchronized data in WBAN server from ANT wireless sensor nodes in SIGS system. For this thesis work, a hardware prototype design was developed. The USB and USART communication protocols were also implemented in the hardware prototype. The suitable method for time synchronization was implemented on the hardware prototype. The implemented method receives the sensor data, checks for the correct stream of data; add timestamp to the sensor data and transmit the data to the Linux WBAN server. The time slots allocation in the ANT protocol was found. Alternative solution for the time synchronization in ANT protocol was also provided.

40|$|Rapidly varying forces, such {{as those}} {{associated}} with impact, rapid crack propagation, and fault rupture, are sources of stress waves which propagate through a solid body. This dissertation investigates how properties of a stress wave source can be identified or constrained using measurements recorded at an array of sensor sites located far from the source. This methodology is often called the method of acoustic emission and is useful for structural health monitoring and the noninvasive study of material behavior such as friction and fracture. In this dissertation, laboratory measurements of 1 - 300 mm wavelength stress waves are obtained by means of piezoelectric sensors which detect high frequency (10 kHz- 3 MHz) motions of a specimen's surface, picometers to nanometers in amplitude. Then, stress wave source characterization techniques are used to study ball impact, drying shrinkage cracking in concrete, and the micromechanics of stick-slip friction of Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and rock/rock interfaces. 	In order to quantitatively relate recorded signals obtained {{with an array of}} sensors to a particular stress wave source, wave propagation effects and sensor distortions must be accounted for. This is achieved by modeling the physics of wave propagation and transduction as linear transfer functions. Wave propagation effects are precisely modeled by an elastodynamic Green's function, sensor distortion is characterized by an instrument response function, and the stress wave source is represented with a force moment tensor. These transfer function models are verified though calibration experiments which employ two different mechanical calibration sources: ball impact and glass capillary fracture. The suitability of the ball impact source model, based on Hertzian contact theory, is experimentally validated for small (~ 1 mm) balls impacting massive plates composed of four different materials: aluminum, steel, glass, and PMMA. 	Using this transfer function approach and the two mechanical calibration sources, four types of piezoelectric sensors were calibrated: three commercially available sensors and the Glaser-type conical piezoelectric sensor, which was developed in the Glaser laboratory. The distorting effects of each sensor are modeled using autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models, and because vital phase information is robustly incorporated into these models, they are useful for simulating or removing sensor-induced distortions, so that a displacement time history can be retrieved from recorded signals. The Glaser-type sensor was found to be very well modeled as a <b>unidirectional</b> displacement <b>sensor</b> which detects stress wave disturbances down to about 1 picometer in amplitude. 	Finally, the merits of a fully calibrated experimental system are demonstrated in a study of stress wave sources arising from sliding friction, and the relationship between those sources and earthquakes. A laboratory friction apparatus was built for this work which allows the micro-mechanisms of friction to be studied with stress wave analysis. Using an array of 14 Glaser-type sensors, and precise models of wave propagation effects and the sensor distortions, the physical origins of the stress wave sources are explored. Force-time functions and focal mechanisms are determined for discrete events found amid the "noise" of friction. These localized events are interpreted to be the rupture of micrometer-sized contacts, known as asperities. By comparing stress wave sources from stick-slip experiments on plastic/plastic and rock/rock interfaces, systematic differences were found. The rock interface produces very rapid (< 1 microsecond) implosive forces indicative of brittle asperity failure and fault gouge formation, while rupture on the plastic interface releases only shear force and produces a source more similar to earthquakes commonly recorded in the field. The difference between the mechanisms is attributed to the vast differences in the hardness and melting temperatures of the two materials, which affect the distribution of asperities as well as their failure behavior. With proper scaling, the strong link between material properties and laboratory earthquakes will aid in our understanding of fault mechanics and the generation of earthquakes and seismic tremor...|$|R
40|$|Real time {{monitoring}} of the mechanical integrity and stresses on key aerospace composite structures like aircraft wings, walls of pressure vessels and fuel tanks or any other structurally extended components and panels as in space telescopes {{is very important to}} NASA. Future military and commercial aircraft as well as NASA space systems such as Space Based Radar and International Space Station will incorporate a monitoring system to sense any degradation to the structure. In the extreme flight conditions of an aerospace vehicle it might be desirable to measure the strain every ten centimeters and thus fully map out the strain field of a composite component. A series of missions and vehicle health management requirements call for these measurements. At the moment thousands of people support a few vehicle launches per year. This number can be significantly reduced by implementing intelligent vehicles with integral nervous systems (smart structures). This would require maintenance to be performed only as needed. Military and commercial aircrafts have an equally compelling case. Annual maintenance costs are currently reaching astronomical heights. Monitoring techniques are therefore required that allow for maintenance to be performed only when needed. This would allow improved safety by insuring that necessary tasks are performed while reducing costs by eliminating procedures that are costly and not needed. The advantages fiber optical sensors have over conventional electro-mechanical systems like strain gauges have been widely extolled in the research literature. These advantages include their small size, low weight, immunity to electrical resistance, corrosion resistance, compatibility with composite materials and process conditions, and multiplexing capabilities. One fiber optic device which is suitable for distributed sensing is the fiber Bragg grating (FBG). This is a periodic perturbation in the refractive index of the fiber core. When a broadband light is coupled into the optical fiber sensor, a reflection peak will be obtained centered around a wavelength called Bragg-wavelength. The Bragg-wavelength depends on the refractive index and the period of the grating, which both change due to mechanical and thermal strain applied to the sensor. The shift in the Bragg-wavelength is directly proportional to the strain. Researchers at NASA MSFC are currently developing techniques for using FBGs for monitoring the integrity of advanced structural materials expected to become the mainstay of the current and future generation space structures. Since carbon-epoxy composites are the materials of choice for the current space structures, the initial study is concentrated on this type of composite. The goals of this activity are to use embedded FBG sensors for measuring strain and temperature of composite structures, and to investigate the effects of various parameters such as composite fiber orientation with respect to the optical <b>sensor,</b> <b>unidirectional</b> fiber composite, fabrication process etc., on the optical performance of the sensor. This paper describes an experiment to demonstrate the use of an embedded FBG for measuring strain in a composite material.

40|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), {{cardiovascular}} diseases (CVDs) {{are the leading}} causes of death worldwide, with one third of deaths attributed to CVDs in 2012. Pulmonary oedema and pleural effusion are the most apparent symptoms of many diseases categorized under CVDs such as heart failure and lung cancer, at which fluid (mainly with high water content) is accumulated in or around the lungs. Therefore, constant monitoring of fluid levels inside the lungs {{is one of the}} most efficient ways of early detection of CVDs. Chest X-Rays and computational tomography (CT) -scans are the most widely used devices for fluid detection; however, they suffer from lack of sensitivity and ionizing radiation, respectively, that makes them unsuitable for long term monitoring purposes. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most reliable device that can be utilized for fluid accumulation detection. However, considering the fact that more than 75 % of the CVDs occur in countries with low or middle income, it is not widely available. Moreover, due to their bulky structures, the abovementioned devices lack the capability of being used in mobile emergency units such as ambulances or clinics at rural areas. To that end, this thesis is dedicated to design and fabrication of a low cost, portable and non-invasive device that can be used as an initial decision making tool for medical staff to pursue further investigations to define the exact cause of the oedema. First chapter of the thesis is allocated to introduction of the {{cardiovascular diseases}} and their effects on the dielectric properties of the tissues inside the lungs. A complete literature review on various alternative methods for replacing the conventional devices is performed. The obtained results by these systems and their advantages as well as their limitations are discussed. Microwave imaging technique is then presented in chapter two as a robust method which can both provide information about the presence and location of the accumulated fluid. This is specifically of great importance for cases where biopsy is required to remove or take sample of the accumulated fluid for saving the life of the patient. Chapter two is also allocated to the introduction of microwave-based medical diagnostic and monitoring systems for different applications such as breast cancer detection and brain imaging. A prospect of the possible realizable systems is investigated and existing scanning approaches are discussed. The main contributions of the thesis that are the design of several complete platforms, design of novel and <b>unidirectional</b> microwave <b>sensors</b> (antennas), promotion of novel scanning and detection methods are clarified in these chapters. In chapter three, firstly the optimum operating frequency for torso imaging is defined. By applying a circuit model that models different layers of torso as circuit elements, it is shown that a wide operating bandwidth at lower ultra-high frequency (UHF) band provides a reasonable compensation between the resolution of the obtained images and signal penetration inside the body. It is explained that due to the limited allowed microwave power for safety considerations unidirectional antennas are required. Then, it is explained that due to the large wavelengths at lower UHF band the sizes of the prospective antennas are expected to be large. To that end, novel miniaturization techniques are proposed to reduce the sizes of the conventional antennas in chapters three and four. These antennas are categorized under three dimensional (3 -D) and planar structure. A folding technique is introduced and used in the proposed 3 -D structures and it is shown that by using this technique both size and directivity/back radiation suppression is improved. 3 -D slot-antenna and cubic monopole-fed antennas are also proposed that wide operating bandwidth is achieved using slot impedance transformer, and multiple resonance-merging techniques, respectively. Regarding the planar structures that are presented in chapter four, it is shown that by combining the loop-dipole modes, both wide-operating bandwidth and directivity enhancement is achievable. Capacitive-loading of a loop antenna is the other proposed technique in which a loop antenna is partially and/or non-uniformly loaded with capacitors in the forms of simple slots and mu-negative (MNG) metamaterial-unitcells that help miniaturizing the size of the antenna by lowering its first resonance frequency. In chapters five and six, several platforms using single and multiple antennas with linear and circular configurations are presented and the utilized imaging technique for data processing is explained. The platforms are presented in a systematic progressive manner in which each system is covering the limitations of its previous prototype. Two final clinical platforms in the shape of clinical bed and doughnut-shaped chamber are proposed and the obtained test results on artificial phantom, animal lungs and human tests are presented. Based on the obtained results on healthy human beings it is shown that the scattered-field from torso of people with different body sizes vary in a reasonably limited range that is a welcoming result for building a global-database to define a threshold for healthy range. Chapter seven concludes the discussions made throughout the thesis and explains future works that can be carried out to further improve the reported systems...|$|R
