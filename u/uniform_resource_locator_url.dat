5|$|A Uniform Resource Name (URN) may be {{compared}} to a person's name, while a <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (<b>URL)</b> may {{be compared}} to their street address. In other words, a URN identifies an item and a URL provides a method for finding it.|$|E
5|$|Such {{identification}} enables {{interaction with}} {{representations of the}} resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols. Schemes specifying a concrete syntax and associated protocols define each URI. The {{most common form of}} URI is the <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (<b>URL),</b> frequently referred to informally as a web address. More rarely seen in usage is the Uniform Resource Name (URN), which was designed to complement URLs by providing a mechanism for the identification of resources in particular namespaces.|$|E
25|$|A DOI name {{differs from}} {{commonly}} used Internet pointers to material, {{such as the}} <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (<b>URL),</b> in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the Uniform Resource Identifier (Uniform Resource Name) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.|$|E

50|$|Layer-7 {{switches}} may {{distribute the}} load based on <b>uniform</b> <b>resource</b> <b>locators</b> (<b>URLs),</b> or by using some installation-specific technique to recognize application-level transactions. A layer-7 switch may include a web cache {{and participate in}} a content delivery network (CDN).|$|R
5000|$|Port {{numbers are}} {{sometimes}} seen in web or other <b>uniform</b> <b>resource</b> <b>locators</b> (<b>URLs).</b> By default, HTTP uses port 80 and HTTPS uses port 443, but a URL like [...] specifies that the web browser connects instead to port 8080 of the HTTP server.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the sense}} of domain names, used in <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locators</b> (<b>URLs),</b> a fully {{qualified}} domain name is explicitly suffixed with a dot, to eliminate the step of resolving, {{and to ensure that}} no additional suffix is added: [...] for instance.

50|$|A Uniform Resource Name (URN) may be {{compared}} to a person's name, while a <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (<b>URL)</b> may {{be compared}} to their street address. In other words, a URN identifies an item and a URL provides a method for finding it.|$|E
30|$|<b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> Names (URNs) {{are used}} {{extensively}} to provide unique machine-readable identifiers for different entities represented in 52  N SOS-based data appliances deployed {{on behalf of}} Pilot partners. URNs were chosen instead of <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locators</b> (<b>URLs)</b> to simplify data provider requirements by removing {{the need to provide}} resolvable endpoints on data appliances.|$|R
50|$|<b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> Names (URNs) are {{a subset}} of <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> Identifiers (URIs) used for {{abstract}} identifiers, such as a person's name or their telephone number. For URNs to be meaningful, they must be mapped to a concrete resource of some sort. <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locators</b> (<b>URLs)</b> are often used to describe such resources, such as a computer hostname, or a local file.|$|R
40|$|<b>Uniform</b> <b>{{resource}}</b> <b>locators</b> (<b>URLs),</b> which {{mark the}} address of a resource on the World Wide Web, are often human-readable and can hint at the category of the resource. This paper explores the use of URLs for web page categorization via a two-phase pipeline of word segmentation/expansion and classification. We quantify its performance against document-based methods, which require the retrieval of the source document...|$|R
5000|$|In this example, the <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (<b>URL)</b> is {{represented}} by [...] "rId2". The actual URL is in the accompanying relationships file, located by the corresponding [...] "rId2" [...] item. Linked images, templates, and other items are referenced in the same way.|$|E
50|$|Network naming can be {{hierarchical}} in nature, {{such as the}} Internet's Domain Name System. Indeed, the Internet employs several {{universally applicable}} naming methods: uniform resource name (URN), <b>uniform</b> <b>resource</b> <b>locator</b> (<b>URL),</b> and uniform resource identifier (URI). For the technically inclined, the following article is worth perusing: http://www.w3.org/TR/uri-clarification/.|$|E
50|$|<b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (<b>URL)</b> filtering: URL strings are scanned {{for target}} {{keywords}} {{regardless of the}} domain name specified in the URL. This affects the HTTP protocol. Typical circumvention methods are to use escaped characters in the URL, or to use encrypted protocols such as VPN and TLS/SSL.|$|E
50|$|Emtage was a {{founding}} member of the Internet Society and went on to create and chair several working groups at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the standard-setting body for the Internet. Working with other pioneers such as Tim Berners-Lee, Marc Andreessen, Mark McCahill (creator of Gopher) and Jon Postel, Emtage co-chaired the <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> Identifier working group which created the standard for <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locators</b> (<b>URLs).</b>|$|R

McCahill led the {{development}} of the Gopher protocol, the effective predecessor of the World Wide Web, was involved in creating and codifying the standard for <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locators</b> (<b>URLs)</b> and led {{the development}} of POPmail, one of the first e-mail clients which had a foundational influence on later e-mail clients and the popularization of graphical user interfaces in Internet technologies more broadly.|$|R
40|$|The NASA Technical Report Server (NTRS), a World Wide Web (WWW) report {{distribution}} service, {{has been}} modified to allow parallel database queries, significantly decreasing user access time {{by an average}} factor of 2. 3, access from clients behind firewalls and/or proxies which truncate excessively long <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locators</b> (<b>URL's),</b> access to non-Wide Area Information Server (WAIS) databases, and compatibility with the Z 39 - 50. 3 protocol...|$|R
50|$|On the World Wide Web, a {{query string}} {{is the part}} of a <b>uniform</b> <b>resource</b> <b>locator</b> (<b>URL)</b> {{containing}} data that does not fit conveniently into a hierarchical path structure. The query string commonly includes fields added to a base URL by a Web browser or other client application, for example as part of an HTML form.|$|E
50|$|A DOI name {{differs from}} {{commonly}} used Internet pointers to material, {{such as the}} <b>Uniform</b> <b>Resource</b> <b>Locator</b> (<b>URL),</b> in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time.

50|$|A website, {{or simply}} site, is a {{collection}} of related web pages, including multimedia content, typically identified with a common domain name, and published on at least one web server. A website may be accessible via a public Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as the Internet, or a private local area network (LAN), by referencing a <b>uniform</b> <b>resource</b> <b>locator</b> (<b>URL)</b> that identifies the site.|$|E
50|$|POPmail - Mark P.

30|$|Another {{important}} point {{today is that}} not only hosts are identified and located based on IP addresses, but also that information is, since <b>uniform</b> <b>resource</b> <b>locators</b> (<b>URL)</b> have domain names, which in essence lead to IP addresses. The reason is that current Internet design defined a dual functionality for IP addresses: to identify hosts, nodes interfaces or content servers, and to locate them into the network. The original Internet design does not support mobile hosts.|$|R
