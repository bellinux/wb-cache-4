Groves approved this location on 3 May 1943. Surveying began on the power plant site on 31 May 1943, and J. A. Jones started construction work the following day. Because the bedrock was [...] below the surface, the power plant was supported on 40 concrete-filled caissons. Installation of the first boiler commenced in October 1943. [...] Construction work was complete by late September. To prevent sabotage, the power plant was connected to the gaseous diffusion plant by an <b>underground</b> <b>conduit.</b> Despite this, there was one act of sabotage, in which a nail was driven through the electric cable. The culprit was never found, but was considered more likely to be a disgruntled employee than an Axis spy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} mode based {{approach}} {{for developing a}} parametric model to characterize RF propagation in conduits. The model considers a conduit as a lossy waveguide and defines the total received power as the sum of powers excited in propagating modes. The model’s parameters are estimated from both the physical properties of the conduit material and an empirical data set. <b>Underground</b> <b>conduits</b> have significant value as wireless communication channels for condition based monitoring within the conduit. An enabler for this wireless sensor network application is based on characterizing the expected coverage range of wireless transceivers operating in the 2. 4 GHz ISM band. Previous studies on modeling RF propagation in <b>underground</b> <b>conduits</b> have focused on conduits with diameters larger than 1. 05 m. This motivated our measurement campaign to collect empirical data from <b>underground</b> <b>conduits</b> with varying diameters from 0. 30 m to 1. 37 m. The empirical data is used to predict the mode coupled powers which are model parameters that are analytically intractable. We observe that the proposed model provides a good estimate of received power in terms of contribution from dominant propagating modes. 1...|$|R
