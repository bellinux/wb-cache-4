5|$|The {{illness of}} Augustus in 23BC brought {{the problem of}} {{succession}} {{to the forefront of}} political issues and the public. To ensure stability, he needed to designate an heir to his <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> in Roman society and government. This was to be achieved in small, undramatic, and incremental ways that did not stir senatorial fears of monarchy. If someone was to succeed Augustus' unofficial position of power, he would have to earn it through his own publicly proven merits.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> of the Christians and Jews of {{the empire}} became {{increasingly}} apparent. The Jews had earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of their faith. They had been exempted from Decius's persecution and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government. Because their faith was new and unfamiliar and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians had no such excuse. Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the grand}} opening, the theatre {{served as a}} venue for {{vaudeville}} and film, and following the decline of vaudeville as a movie palace until the 1970s. With the economic recession, the advent of television, and movie complex development in the suburbs, crowds dwindled and the theatre struggled to stay open. It was forced to close its doors in 1978 along with the nearby Orpheum theatre. A variety of re-use possibilities were proposed for the theatre including a Chinese restaurant, a triplex movie theater, an office building, or a shopping center. The city of Seattle was unable to protect the theatre as a designated landmark because of its <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> {{on the site of}} the original territorial university grounds owned by the state of Washington.|$|E
40|$|We {{study how}} {{employee}} sickness absence affects worker-firm matching. We {{build on the}} idea that firms are sensitive to absence in jobs with few substitutes (<b>unique</b> <b>positions).</b> Consistent with this, we show that unique employees are less absent conditional on individual characteristics, establishment fixed effects and detailed occupational information. Half of this association is explained by sorting of low-absence workers into <b>unique</b> <b>positions</b> but sorting is less pronounced under imperfect information. Finally, job separations respond more to realized sickness absence in <b>unique</b> <b>positions.</b> The findings suggest that the cost of production disruptions is an important aspect of firms' hiring choices...|$|R

5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds a <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> in English {{literature}} as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy}} to give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1905, President Roosevelt further {{consolidated}} {{power in}} Panama by appointing Magoon Minister to Panama, to replace John Barrett. This put Magoon in the <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> of being both a governor of a U.S. territory and a diplomat {{to the country}} of which that territory was an enclave. During the tenure of Governor Davis, there had been friction between him and Minister Barrett. This double appointment would ensure that the two roles could not work at cross-purposes. Magoon would draw two salaries in the arrangement, an issue which would come up later to haunt him. With influential posts in both Panama proper and the Canal Zone, Magoon was an exceptionally powerful man on the Isthmus.|$|E
5|$|Spacetimes are the arenas {{in which}} all {{physical}} events take place—an event is a point in spacetime specified by its time and place. The basic elements of spacetime are events. In any given spacetime, an event is a <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> at a unique time. Because events are spacetime points, in classical relativistic physics, the location of an elementary (point-like) particle {{at a particular time}} can be written as (x, y, z, t). A spacetime is the union of all events {{in the same way that}} a line is the union of all of its points, formally organized into a manifold.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Selbie, then General Manager, {{thought that}} some professionalism was needed and {{suggested}} a company be formed {{to take over}} from the Surplus Lands Committee to develop estates near the railway. World War I delayed these plans and it was 1919, with expectation of a housing boom, before Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited (MRCE) was formed. Concerned that Parliament might reconsider the <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> the Met held, the railway company sought legal advice, which was that although the Met had authority to hold land, it had none to develop it. An independent company was created, although {{all but one of}} its directors were also directors of the Met. MRCE developed estates at Kingsbury Garden Village near Neasden, Wembley Park, Cecil Park and Grange Estate at Pinner, and the Cedars Estate at Rickmansworth, and created places such as Harrow Garden Village.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the team}} {{believed}} {{that they would be}} unable to use the Wolfenstein name due to trademark issues, and came up with multiple possible titles, only to discover that the original developer, Muse Software, had gone out of business several years earlier and let the trademark lapse, leaving them the option to use the name Wolfenstein 3D. The game concept met with immediate approval from Scott Miller of Apogee, who considered id Software his star developer, and he paid id a US$100,000 advance on the project. Mark Rein, who had been brought on a few months prior as id's probationary president, also sold the idea of doing a retail Wolfenstein project to FormGen, which had published id's December 1991 Commander Keen in Aliens Ate My Babysitter, overcoming the publisher's concerns over Wolfensteins proposed content. This put id in the <b>unique</b> <b>position</b> of selling simultaneously to the shareware and retail markets.|$|E

[...] Yes, the computer database is an instrument, available to anyone nowadays.

50|$|A metric defines how a {{distance}} {{can be measured}} between two nearby points in space, {{in terms of the}} coordinate system.
