The camps I attended were not al-Qaeda. I did not hear about such an organisation <b>until</b> <b>my</b> arrival in Guantanamo Bay.|$|E

Do I think games such as these could have dire psychological consequences, particularly for young people? As always, I remain agnostic on the matter. Who knows, really?

According to Lucy O'Brien of The Quietus, the lyrics portray Azalea as [...] "the hardworking Aussie girl and the feminist goddess urging with messianic fervour". John Lucas of The Georgia Straight describes the song as a [...] "bite-sized motivational seminar". [...] "Impossible Is Nothing" [...] was compared to songs by Eminem, specifically from his 2010 album Recovery.|$|E
500|$|Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami's 1999novel Battle Royale {{have been}} noted. Collins stated that she [...] "had {{never heard of}} that book or that author <b>until</b> <b>my</b> book was turned in. At that point, it was {{mentioned}} to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'." [...] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that [...] "the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff" [...] of Battle Royale but argued that [...] "there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently." [...] Stephen King noted that the reality TV [...] "badlands" [...] were similar to Battle Royale, {{as well as his}} own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk. Eric Eisenberg wrote that The Hunger Games was [...] "not a rip off of Battle Royale, but simply a different usage of a similar idea", pointing out various differences in both story and themes.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as Madonna: The First Album with a {{different}} artwork created by photographer George Holy. The cover features Madonna in similar style of dress to the original cover but this time with crucifix as her earrings. Madonna's trademark style was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and fans, with her crucifix accessories becoming the jewelry of the moment. Madonna said that wearing a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and two bonus remix tracks of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star". Madonna dedicated the album to her father, Tony Ciccone, with whom her relationship had not been good until {{the release of the}} album. In an interview with Time magazine, Madonna said: [...] "My father had never believed that what I was doing here [...] was worthwhile, nor did he believe that I was up to any good. [...] It wasn't <b>until</b> <b>my</b> first album came out and my father started hearing my songs on the radio that he stopped asking the questions." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers {{considered}} Middlesex to {{be overly}} verbose. The Economist described the novel as [...] "ponderous" [...] {{and said that the}} main story (that of Cal) does not [...] "get off the ground until halfway through" [...] the book. Times Richard Lacayo concurred; he considered the hundreds of pages about Cal's grandparents and several historical events to be trite, making Middlesexs focus [...] "footloose" [...] in some spots. Several passages in the novel exhibit Eugenides' obsession with [...] "verbose voluptuousness". An example noted by Thea Hillman in her review is an incident in which Cal says, [...] "I sat in my seat, in a state of voluptuous agitation, of agitated voluptuousness, <b>until</b> <b>my</b> stop. Then I staggered out." [...] A contrary opinion is given by Daniel Soar in his article for the London Review of Books. According to Soar, Eugenides did [...] "both background and foreground in all the necessary detail", seamlessly shifting from past to present. Despite the implausible tone of the novel's events, the author successfully makes them [...] "elaborately justified and motivated". The quality of Middlesexs writing was uneven in the opinions of Hillman and another reviewer, Sebastian Smee. The latter pointed out that Eugenides occasionally moves from the heartfelt ("I remember the first time we took off our clothes in front of each other. It was like unwinding bandages") to the [...] "trashily journalistic" [...] ("You've heard of installation artists? Well, the Object [...] was an exhalation artist") on several occasions.|$|E
500|$|Robben was inflicted {{with yet}} another injury in a match against Liverpool on 20 January 2007. Robben made his return in a 3–0 victory against Middlesbrough in February, driving in a shot that took a {{deflection}} past Mark Schwarzer for an own goal by Abel Xavier. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Claude Makélélé in the 2007 League Cup final against Arsenal and set up the winning goal for Didier Drogba. Robben scored a goal {{in the second round of}} the Champions League against Porto, which led to Chelsea winning the tie 3–2 on aggregate. At the end of March 2007, Robben underwent a knee operation after sustaining a knee injury upon returning from international duty that was expected to rule him out for at least four weeks. He only made two further appearances for Chelsea, both of which were as a substitute and both of which would prove to be key games for the club. His first appearance since returning from injury was against Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final second leg which went to penalties. Robben went on to have his penalty saved by Pepe Reina, and Chelsea ultimately lost. His final appearance for the club came against Manchester United in the 2007 FA Cup Final. Robben replaced Joe Cole at half-time, but was then substituted himself for Ashley Cole in extra time as Chelsea emerged victorious. Spanish club Real Madrid were interested in two of Chelsea's players. Then manager Bernd Schuster is said to have demanded Michael Ballack, while Real Madrid's then president Ramón Calderón was known to favour Robben. Robben said to reporters of Spanish newspaper AS, [...] "I do not know when a deal will be reached. I would like to send a message to the Madrid fans, but I can't <b>until</b> <b>my</b> future is sorted." ...|$|E
