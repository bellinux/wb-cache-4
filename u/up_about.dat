50|$|Achnatherum lettermanii is a tufting {{perennial}} bunchgrass {{which forms}} large clumps of erect stems <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 80 centimeters tall. The leaves are short and slightly curly. The inflorescence is <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 19 centimeters long and has open branches with few spikelets.

5|$|This {{system of}} limited {{suffrage}} caused the predominantly Polish landowning class {{to dominate the}} Diet. Whilst they only made <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 0.4% of the population, they held 28.2% of {{the seats in the}} Diet. Small-scale rural landowners, on the other hand, made <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 95% of the population, but held only 52.3% of the seats in Diet. This system also skewed representation for different ethnicities in the Diet. Whilst Ruthenians made <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 40% of the population of Galicia, they only held 15% of the seats in the Diet, as they lived primarily in rural communities. Reform of the suffrage system in late 1913 added a fifth curia for the upper peasantry, which had the right to elect twenty deputies. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, no further elections to the Diet took place, and hence the fifth curia existed only on paper.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2014 {{study by}} the Pew Research Center, 57% of the {{population}} of the city identified themselves as Christians, with 25% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 29% professing Roman Catholic beliefs. while 33% claim no religious affiliation. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism) collectively make <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 10% of the population.|$|E
5|$|Baltische Öl {{consisted}} of five units (Kiviõli, Küttejõu, Kohtla-Järve, Sillamäe, and Kohtla), {{all of which}} were partially restored, previously existing industries. In addition, Baltische Öl started construction of a new mining and shale oil extraction complex in Ahtme, but it never became operational. Prisoners of war and forced labour made <b>up</b> <b>about</b> two-thirds of the work force in these units.|$|E

50|$|Industrial-scale vacuum {{distillation}} has several advantages. Close boiling mixtures may require many equilibrium stages {{to separate the}} key components. One tool {{to reduce the number}} of stages needed is to utilize {{vacuum distillation}}. Vacuum distillation columns (as depicted in Figures 2 and 3) typically used in oil refineries have diameters ranging <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 14 meters (46 feet), heights ranging <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 50 meters (164 feet), and feed rates ranging <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 25,400 cubic meters per day (160,000 barrels per day).|$|R
5|$|Through the 18thand19thcenturies, {{chestnut}} {{in various}} shades was the prevailing colour of Finnish horses, making <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 40-50percent of the breed, and bays, blacks and greys existed in much greater numbers than today: 34percent were bay, 16percent black, {{and the remaining}} 3percent were grey, palomino or spotted. Wide blazes and high leg markings were rare, unlike today; bold markings became common only in the 20thcentury.|$|E

5|$|A senior {{national}} team official, Colonel Roman Lisiewicz of the Polish Army, {{said he saw}} the goalkeeper and the journalist reach the hotel in a taxi soon after 05:00—but rather than going to his room, Młynarczyk then left again with Zieliński before returning again around 07:00. Tired and hungover, Młynarczyk joined {{the rest of the}} players for breakfast, and according to Terlecki spent most of the meal getting worked <b>up</b> <b>about</b> possible managerial retribution. Młynarczyk was in such bad shape that he was unable to carry his own bags; Smolarek took them for him. Next to the team bus, one of Kulesza's assistants, Bernard Blaut, confronted Smolarek and told him that Młynarczyk was to stay behind.|$|E

5|$|According to the Yugoslav {{census of}} 1931, the {{population}} of eastern Herzegovina comprised 4 per cent Croats, 28 per cent Muslims, and 68 per cent Serbs. According to Professor Jozo Tomasevich, the estimated population of the districts of Bileća, Gacko and Nevesinje was only around 1.1 per cent Croat, so in those areas nearly all the NDH government appointments and local Ustaše units were staffed by Muslims, an ethnic group that made <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 23.7 per cent of the local population. The poor Muslim peasants of eastern Herzegovina largely sided with the Ustaše. The NDH government immediately tried to strengthen their position by vilifying the Serbs, who, according to Tomasevich, comprised around 75 per cent of the population.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the census}} of , 58.9% of all Belarusians adhere {{to some kind}} of religion; out of those, Eastern Orthodoxy (Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church) makes <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 82%. Roman Catholicism is practiced mostly in the western regions, and there are also {{different}} denominations of Protestantism. Minorities also practice Greek Catholicism, Judaism, Islam and Neopaganism. Overall, 48.3% of the population is Orthodox Christian, 41.1% is not religious, 7.1% is Catholic and 3.3% follows other religions.|$|E
5|$|After {{the story}} is printed, the {{neighborhood}} learns of Mac's past, and members of a local country–western band visit him to show their respect. Although he greets them politely, Mac remains reluctant to open <b>up</b> <b>about</b> his past. Later, he secretly attends Dixie's concert. She passionately sings several songs that Mac wrote years earlier, and he leaves {{in the middle of}} the performance. Backstage, he talks to Dixie's manager, his old friend Harry (Wilford Brimley). Mac gives him a copy of a new song he has written and asks him to show it to Dixie. Mac tries to talk to Dixie, but she becomes angry upon seeing him and warns him to stay away from their 18-year-old daughter, Sue Anne (Ellen Barkin).|$|E

50|$|Most of the scanned sources {{apply to}} all of Norway. These include parish {{registers}} <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 1930, real estate registers up to 1950, probate documents <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 1850, court journal transcriptions <b>up</b> to <b>about</b> 1800, feudal account books and county account records to about 1700, old censuses for 1664-1666 and 1701, the landed property tax initiative of 1723, and the landed property tax list of 1838. Some of the sources cover only parts of Norway, such as the address books for Kristiania/Oslo and Aker and certain genealogical collections.|$|R
5|$|All heavier {{elements}} (including those {{necessary for}} rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were {{hot enough to}} fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% {{of the mass of}} atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 23% of the universe's ordinary matter—nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Although the American white ibis is {{predominantly}} monogamous and both sexes provide parental care to their young, the male often flies off {{to engage in}} extra-pair copulation with other nesting females after mating with its primary female partner. These extra-pair copulations are usually done after the within-pair copulations, and make <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 45% of all total matings, although only about 15% of all extra-pair copulations are successful. By not restricting the number of females it copulates with, the male is able to increase its reproductive success considerably. Although females are receptive towards extra-pair copulations, male mate-guarding greatly reduces the rate of successful female involvement in attempted extra-pair copulations by other males.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made <b>up</b> <b>about</b> 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
