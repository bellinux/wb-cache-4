5|$|For {{the scene}} in which Ash is {{revealed}} to be an android, a puppet was created of the character's torso and upper body which was operated from underneath. During a preview screening of the film, this scene caused an usher to faint. In the following scene, Ash's head is placed on a table and re-activated; for portions of this scene, an animatronic head was made using a face cast of the actor, Ian Holm. However, the latex of the head shrank while curing {{and the result was}} not entirely convincing. For the bulk of the scene, Holm knelt under the table with his head coming <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> hole. Milk, caviar, pasta, fiber optics, and glass marbles were combined to form the android's innards.|$|E
5|$|The {{escape route}} led <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> fan vent; the prisoners removed the fan and motor, {{replacing}} them with a steel grill and leaving a shaft large enough for a prisoner to enter. Stealing a carborundum abrasive cord from the prison workshop, the prisoners then removed the rivets from the grill. In their beds, they placed papier-mâché dummies made with human hair stolen from the barbershop. The escapees also constructed an inflatable raft over many weeks from over 50 stolen raincoats, which they prepared {{on the top of}} the cellblock, concealed from the guards by sheets which had been put up over the sides. They escaped through a vent in the roof and departed Alcatraz.|$|E

5|$|The game also {{includes}} a multiplayer mode, where up to four players can compete {{against each other in}} seven different game types: Beach, Raptor, Heist, War, Tank, Race and Deathmatch. In Beach, some players must go <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> beach and into a waiting escape vehicle, while others must stop them by firing at them from fixed positions. Raptor involves players controlling raptors to feed a baby dinosaur, while others play as cavemen that have to steal dinosaur eggs. Heist engrosses players in the robbery of a bank, where the goal is to retrieve a cash bag {{from the center of the}} level and run with it to the team's vault without being damaged. War can either be a traditional capture the flag mode or Total War, where players have to get the other teams gas canister and use it to release a chemical gas that annihilates the enemy. Similarly, in Tank players fight against each other by using tanks and grabbing chemical canisters that can release a lethal corrosive gas, destroying all the tanks that are outdoors. Race is a racing mode which provides two variations of the same course. Items can be acquired and used against opponents. Finally, there is a standard deathmatch mode where players fight against each other in shooting style from a third-person perspective. Players can set a number of different options for each game, such as score limit, number of lives, and inclusion of optional bots.|$|E

25|$|This fortuitous {{collaboration}} came to {{an abrupt}} end with Mulligan's arrest on narcotics charges in mid-1953 leading to six months at Sheriff's Honor Farm. Both Mulligan and Baker had, like many of their peers, become heroin addicts. However, while Mulligan was in prison, Baker transformed his lyrical trumpet style, gentle tenor voice and matinee-idol looks into independent stardom. Thus when upon his release Mulligan attempted to rehire Baker, the trumpeter declined the offer for financial reasons. They did briefly reunite at the 1955 Newport Jazz Festival and would occasionally get together for performances and recordings <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> 1974 performance at Carnegie Hall. But in later years their relationship became strained as Mulligan, with considerable effort, would manage to kick his habit, while Baker's addiction bedevilled him professionally and personally almost constantly until his death in 1988.|$|E
500|$|Ruisdael is {{now seen}} as the leading artist of the [...] "classical" [...] phase in Dutch {{landscape}} art, which built upon the realism of the previous [...] "tonal" [...] phase. The tonal phase suggested atmosphere through the use of tonality, while the classical phase strived for a more grandiose effect, with paintings built <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> serious of vigorous contrasts of solid form against the sky, and of light against shade, with a tree, animal, or windmill often singled out.|$|E

The ground floor and first floor rooms would have originally been sub-divided to form living quarters for the garrison, but are now open spaces. Both have eight embrasure windows, suitable for holding lighter weaponry; the first floor room was sufficiently elevated to have potentially fired out over the external walls. The roof has the remains of gun positions dating from the 1850s, and was originally topped by a look-out tower, removed in 1805. When first built, the keep was linked by three bridges to the outer bastions.|$|E

500|$|The {{basement}} {{of the house was}} used for generating hydrogen gas and pure oxygen. The hydrogen making apparatus consisted of a tank half filled with water. This tank was also filled with iron filings from Navy cast-iron projectiles. Sulfuric acid was added into the tank of water and filings, which was slowly decanted. The acid separated the water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. The iron filings absorbed the oxygen gas which allowed the hydrogen to go <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> pipe into a wash-barrel, which had another pipe to the balloon envelope. The freed hydrogen gas then filled the balloon, which had a lifting ability of 60 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet of gas. The balloon was held down to the ground by sandbag weights so that when filled it didn't float away. A [...] diameter balloon would hold 65,000 cubic feet of hydrogen gas giving the filled balloon a lifting ability of about 4,000 pounds.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{and other}} {{political}} radicals during {{the last quarter of}} the 18th century focused their reform efforts on education because they believed that if people were educated correctly, Britain would experience a moral and political revolution. Religious Dissenters, especially, embraced this view; Wollstonecraft's philosophy in Thoughts and elsewhere closely resembles that of the Dissenters she met while teaching in Newington Green, such as the theologian, educator, and scientist Joseph Priestley and the minister Richard Price. Dissenters [...] "were most concerned with molding children into people of good moral character and habits". However, political conservatives, who also believed that childhood was the crucial time for the formation of a person's character, used their own educational works to deflect rebellion by promoting theories of compliance. Liberals and conservatives alike subscribed to Lockean and Hartleian associationist psychology: that is, they believed that a person's sense of self was built <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> set of associations made between things in the external world and ideas in the mind. Both Locke and Hartley had argued that the associations formed in childhood were nearly irreversible and must thus be formed with care. Locke famously advised parents to keep their children away from servants, as they would only tell children frightening stories that would foster a fear of the dark.|$|E

500|$|In Chinese opera, {{breath is}} based in the pubic region and {{supported}} by the abdominal muscles. Performers follow the basic principle that [...] "Strong centralized breath moves the melodic-passages" [...] (zhong qi xing xiang). Breath is visualized being drawn <b>up</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> central breathing cavity extending from the pubic region {{to the top of the}} head. This [...] "cavity" [...] must be under the performer's control at all times, and he or she develops special techniques to control both entering and exiting air. The two major methods of taking in breath are known as [...] "exchanging breath" [...] (huan qi) and [...] "stealing breath" [...] (tou qi). [...] "Exchanging breath" [...] is a slow, unhurried process of breathing out old air and taking in new. It is used at moments when the performer is not under time constraint, such as during a purely instrumental musical passage or when another character is speaking. [...] "Stealing breath" [...] is a sharp intake of air without prior exhalation, and is used during long passages of prose or song when a pause would be undesirable. Both techniques should be invisible to the audience and take in only the precise amount of air required for the intended vocalization. The most important principle in exhalation is [...] "saving the breath" [...] (cun qi). Breath should not be expended all at once at the beginning of a spoken or sung passage, but rather expelled slowly and evenly over its length. Most songs and some prose contain precise written intervals for when breath should be [...] "exchanged" [...] or [...] "stolen". These intervals are often marked by carats.|$|E
