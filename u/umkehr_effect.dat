5000|$|The Umkehr is {{the time}} {{variation}} of {{the ratio of the}} scattered intensity at two different wavelengths. The word means reversal in German. The <b>Umkehr</b> <b>effect</b> is observed when measurements are made with ultraviolet spectrophotometer of the ratio of the zenith sky light intensities of two wavelengths in the solar ultraviolet when the sun is near the horizon. The shorter of two wavelengths (intensity I) is strongly absorbed and other (intensity I [...] ) is weakly absorbed. If the value of log(I/I [...] ) is plotted against the suns zenith angle, it is observed that this log-intensity ratio decreases as the zenith angle increases until a minimum is reached for a zenith angle of about 80 (when the wavelengths are 3114 and 3324 A0). This effect was first noticed by Götz in 1930. The Umkehr measurement is known as customarily N-value and is given by the logarithm base 10 of the ratio of cloudless zenith sky intensitities at two different wavelengths scaled by a multiplicative factor 100 plus a constant which depends on instruments and extraterrestrial radiation. Methods for deriving vertical distribution from the umkehr measurements were developed by Götz, Dobson and Meetham in 1934, using the Dobson ozone spectrophotometer developed by Gordon Dobson. In 1964 Carlton Mateer provided analysis on information content in umkehr measurements.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study of the quenching effects on the gailvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic properties of bismuth single crystals is presented. Measurements made include components of the magneto resistivity and magnetothermoelectric power tensors at low and intermediate magnetic fields for samples in both the annealed and quenched conditions, at temperatures between 77 K and room temperature. Marked effects of quenching on each set of tensor components have been observed. After quenching the anisotropy ratio p(_ 11) / p(_ 33) of the zero field resistivity inverts from 0. 9446 to 1. 030 and the thermomagnetic data show a general reduction in magnetic field dependence. The quenching effects anneal out below room temperature. To allow a detailed quantitative investigation, a formalism has been developed by which the thermomagnetic data and the predictions of both the phenomenological theory and o f the band transport theory can be compared on the same basis as the galvanomagnetic effects. The expressions provide {{for the first time}} an analytical explanation for the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>effect</b> and lead to its prediction. The occurrence of <b>Umkehr</b> <b>effect</b> and sign reversal in the thermomagnetic power of bismuth directly follows from the nature o f the Fermi surface. Measurements a t low and intermediate magnetic fields have been analysed in terms of a two-band multi - valley Fermi surface model, using a least-means-square procedure. Reasonable agreement obtains between the model parameters computed from different sources. Magneto resistivity data at low and intermediate fields evidence consistent quenching-induced changes on the model parameters. Quenching results in an increase in carrier densities from 4. 4 10 (^ 23) m(^- 3) in annealed state to 4. 6 10 (^ 23) m(^- 3) and 5. 3 10 (^ 23) m(^- 3) for electrons and holes respectively. Carrier mobilities in the xy-plane are reduced but those along the trigonal (z) axis are increased slightly. The energy separation between the band edges increases markedly. Quenched-in defects have predominantly accepter-like character...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the galvanomagnetic effects in a particular A 7 structure material and a theoretical study of the symmetry properties of the transport tensors are presented. For the experimental study, arsenic-antimony alloy single crystals have been grown at the minimum melting point composition (25. 5 at. % A 8) where the solidus and liquids touch on the phase diagram. Dislocation etch pit studies have been made on the (111) cleavage faces. Measurements have been made between 1. 5 K and 300 K of the twelve components that define the low-field magnetoresistivity tensor and of the orientation dependence of the tensor components P (_ 11) (B (_ 1), B (_ 2), 0), P (_ 11) (B (_ 1), 0 B (_ 3)) and P (_ 21) (B (_ 1), 0, B (_ 3)). A least-mean-squares fit to the data {{has been used to}} obtain the model parameters for a two band, multivalley, ellipsoidal Fermi surface. The alloy model parameters are compared and contrasted with those of the parent elements. The alloy is semi metallic. In the theoretical work, the forms of the magnetic field dependent transport tensors are established for all 32 crystallographic point groups. A formulation of galvanomagnetic and thermomagnetic effects based on the separation of the tensor components into “even” and “odd” functions of the applied magnetic field is given. It is shown that the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>effect</b> is a natural result of the anisotropy of crystals...|$|E
40|$|Analyses of {{stratospheric ozone}} data {{determined}} from Dobson Umkehr measurements since 1977 at the Syowa (69. 0 &deg; S, 39. 6 &deg; E), Antarctica station show {{a significant decrease}} in ozone at altitudes higher than that of the 4 hPa pressure level during the 1980 s and 1990 s. Ozone values over Syowa have remained low since 2001. The time series of upper stratospheric ozone from the homogenized NOAA (/ 2) SBUV 8. 6 overpass data (± 4 &deg;, 24 h) are in qualitative agreement with Syowa station data. Ozone recovery during the austral spring over Syowa station appears to be slower than predicted by the Equivalent Effective Stratospheric Chlorine (EESC) curve. The long-term changes in station's equivalent latitude are derived from MERRA analysis at ~ 2 hPa and ~ 50 hPa. These data are used to attribute some of the upper and middle stratospheric ozone changes to the changes in vortex position relative to station location. In addition, high correlation of the Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode (SAM) with polar upper stratospheric ozone during years of maximum solar activity points toward a strong relationship between the strength of the Brewer-Dobson circulation and the polar stratospheric ozone recovery. We have analyzed the results of ozone profiles over Syowa determined from measurements of the <b>Umkehr</b> <b>effect</b> by Dobson ozone spectrophotometers. The ozone depletion attributable to CFCs is clearly visible in the record, but the recovery is slower than predicted. Further research indicates that dynamical and other chemical changes in the atmosphere are delaying the recovery over this station...|$|E
