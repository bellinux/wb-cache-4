40|$|A first {{principle}} {{mathematical model}} {{has been used to}} study the effects of ocean environment and cathodic protection on the formation of calcareous deposits and their ability to reduce the cathodic <b>urrent</b> density. These parameters include applied potential, rotation speed, temperature, salinity, and depth. The results showed the applied potential strongly influences the formation of calcareous deposits and their ability to reduce the cathodic current density. Among the environmental f ctors, rotation speed has the most influence on the cathodic <b>urrent</b> density. Salinity slightly influences the cathodic <b>urrent</b> density over the range of interest. Temperature is much more influential than salinity on the ability of calcareous deposits to reduce the cathodic <b>urrent</b> density. The results from modeling showed the formation rate of calcareous deposits is much lower at 5 ~ than at room temperature. The depth is very critical not only to cathodic <b>urrent</b> density but also to the formation of calcareous deposits in seawater. The formation of calcareous deposits would be expected to be slower and the deposits would contain more Mg(OH) 2 in deep water. In {{the first part of this}} research, a first principles mathe-matical model was presented for the formation of cal-careous deposits on cathodically protected steel in seawa-ter. 1 This model and the main results of the. model will b...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Excitable {{membranes}} {{have the}} special ability of changing rapidly and reversibly their permeability to ions, thereby controlling the ion move-ments that carry the electric <b>urrents</b> propagating nerve impulses. Acetylcholine (ACh) is the specific signal which is released by excitation and is recognized by a specific protein, the ACh-receptor; it induces a conformational change, trig-gering off {{a sequence of}} reactions resulting in increased permeability. The hy-drolysis of ACh by ACh-esterase r stores the barrier to ions. The enzymes hy-drolyzing and forming ACh and the receptor protein {{are present in the}} various types of excitable membranes.

40|$|SUMMARY. The {{recently}} described electrolysis {{of molten}} basalt (Oppenheim, I 968) gave indefinite results {{with regard to}} the behaviour of iron. Repeating the experiments in an inert atmosphere has shown that ferric iron moves towards the anode, and ferrous iron to the cathode. All metallic ions of valency three and more are now seen to be concentrated towards the anode, with relative nrich-ments in decreasing order: Fe 8 +, P, Ti, Si, and A 1; and oxygen gas is released at the anode. Metals of valency one and two are concentrated towards the cathode with relative nrichments in decreasing order: Na, Fe 2 +, K, Ca, Mn, and Mg. The series expected to be differentiated within a magma consequent upon its electrolysis i rede-fined. The absence of natural analogues suggests either the non-operation f suitable lectric <b>urrents</b> within magmas, or the destruction of their effects by convection, fractional crystallization, or both. An electrolytic process is feasible at the mantle-core boundary, leading mainly to deposition of iron on the core and release of oxygen upwards.
