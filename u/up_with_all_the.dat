[...] Sava applauded {{the fact that the}} episode delves into [...] "the demented relationship that develops between Ice King and his new wife", noting that while [...] "the writers could have easily depicted Ice King in a more unsympathetic light, ... the tragedy of the episode is that Ice King genuinely cares about his new wife." [...] He was also complimentary towards the song, describing it as a [...] "suitably bizarre Adventure Time version of 'A Whole New World'".|$|E

The band wanted to record it in as few takes as possible {{in spite of its}} length, which they addressed by recording the song in Pro Tools as they expected it could be up to forty minutes long; in the past they used analog tape which only allowed for about twenty minutes of music but, according to Rubalcaba, yielded the best recording quality. Earthless rehearsed [...] "From the Ages" [...] for three days before recording it in about three takes. In the last five minutes of the song, the band very gently ease into the end, to avoid having to end the song abruptly. Although he had said the same of [...] "Violence of the Red Sea" [...] with respect to the album itself in a previous interview, Rubalcaba later described [...] "From the Ages" [...] as the most organized, planned song the band had yet ever recorded, let alone recorded for this album. He described the mixture of influences in the song as [...] "A supreme psycho-delic buffet served <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sour Kraut, all the freshest sushi Japan has to offer & what not". Rubalcaba reiterated the [...] "pre-historic, caveman, dry & mysterious wasteland feel" [...] that inspired the title.

The next album I would like people to get more songs like [...] "Why I Love You So Much," [...] "Angel of Mine," [...] or the things they really, really love from me [...]" [...] Originally titled Lessons Learned—a reference to the mistakes Monica felt she made with The Makings of Me – the singer decided to change the project after recording the album's title track in 2008 as she felt that Still Standing was more appropriate for the body of work that she and Bryan-Michael Cox pulled off.|$|E

Once when he had been at his work for more than two hours, without a pause – except to take an occasional sip of water – the chairman (the House being in Committee), thought to get him to resume his seat by telling him that his observations had become almost inaudible and unintelligible to the chair.
