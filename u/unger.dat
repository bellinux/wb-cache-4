5|$|Within minutes all the Dorniers {{had been}} hit. Feldwebel Johannes Petersen's Do 17 was flying {{higher than the}} others. It was hit, and caught fire, but carried on. Günter <b>Unger</b> lined up his Do 17 in order to attack a hangar and {{released}} his 20 110-lb bombs before his starboard engine was knocked out. Unteroffizier (Junior Officer or NCO) Schumacher watched as three hangars were destroyed by Unger’s bombs. Unger’s Dornier was then was hit by something. It bled black smoke and lost speed. <b>Unger</b> was engaged by No. 111s Harry Newton. Newton was shot down by accurate return fire and bailed out. However, Newton fired a burst of machine gun fire at the Dornier in frustration before leaving the Hurricane. He damaged the Dornier, but <b>Unger</b> flew on. Oberleutnant (First Lieutenant) Hermann Magin was lining up a hangar when he was hit and slumped over. The quick reactions of the navigator, 28-year-old Wilhelm-Friedrich Illg, saved the crew. He took control and {{climbed out of the}} defensive fire before ordering the crew to abandon the aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Stone also {{praised the}} vivid quality of <b>Unger's</b> writing: [...] "The {{sound of the}} writing is one of <b>Unger's</b> signatures—the Epistle to the Romans meets the lawyer's appellate brief. And that is no accident. It's part of <b>Unger's</b> {{ambition}} to bring visionary modes of thought—those which are sometimes called prophetic or poetic—closer {{to the language of}} institutional rationality." [...] But Stone criticizes <b>Unger's</b> way of grappling with philosophical problems, arguing that his philosophical method is at odds with his message of plasticity, transcendence, and encounter: ...|$|R

5|$|The {{scope of}} the Christianization mission in its early phase was quite limited geographically, and the few relics that have survived come from Gniezno Land.

5|$|Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential {{election}}. While {{the election}} was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet. According to Craig <b>Unger,</b> Cheney advocated Donald Rumsfeld for the post of Secretary of Defense to counter the influence of Colin Powell at the State Department, and tried unsuccessfully to have Paul Wolfowitz named to replace George Tenet {{as director of the}} Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 {{the station}} {{underwent}} a major modernisation, removing the murals {{installed on the}} Central and Bakerloo line platforms in the 1980s and replacing them with plain white tiles, in a style {{similar to those used}} when the station opened in 1900. One 1980s mural remains on one of the platforms. The Central line platform works were substantially complete and a new Station Operations Room at top level opened. This enabled the entire CCTV system to be switched over to new recordable digital technology. The original motifs designed by Hans <b>Unger</b> on the Victoria line platforms were restored.|$|E
5|$|The Red Wings were in {{last place}} of the NHL's East Division late in the 1967–68 season when, on March 3, 1968, they {{completed}} {{one of the biggest}} trades in league history up to that time: Henderson was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs as part of a six-player deal, along with Norm Ullman and Floyd Smith, in exchange for Frank Mahovlich, Garry <b>Unger</b> and Pete Stemkowski. Henderson finished the season with 11 points in 13 games for Toronto, then scored 27 goals and 59 points in 1968–69.|$|E

5|$|Then 25-year-old Marc Burns, an Auburn University {{graduate}} from Port-of-Spain on Trinidad, represented Trinidad and Tobago in the 100meters at Beijing. His participation marked his third Olympic games (2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens) {{and his second}} time running the event for Trinidad and Tobago. Burns raced during the August 14 qualification round in the ninth heat, where he completed his race in 10.46seconds. Burns came in second and tied Slovenia's Matic Osovnikar, falling behind Qatari sprinter Samuel Adelebari Francis (10.40seconds). Burns and Osovnikar finished ahead of Honduran athlete Cruz Rolando Palacios Castillo (10.49seconds). Tying Osovnikar and Germany's Tobias Benjamin <b>Unger</b> for 38th place out of 80 athletes, Burns advanced to quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took {{a turn for the}} worse when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard <b>Unger</b> then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This turn of events had a profound effect on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed American support for Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a tool of the leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift political allies from the left to the right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|Next, Nesbitt {{reunited with}} Occupation screenwriter Peter Bowker {{to star in}} the ITV medical drama series Monroe, playing Gabriel Monroe. Nesbitt was Bowker's first choice for the part. Nesbitt {{researched}} {{the role of the}} neurosurgeon character by watching brain surgery being performed by Henry Marsh, and by consulting Philip Van Hille at Leeds General Infirmary. The series was filmed over 12 weeks in Leeds at the end of 2010 and broadcast on ITV during March and April 2011. Nesbitt will reprise the role in a second series, which is due to begin production in 2012. In film, Nesbitt co-stars as Irish writer Jack in Emilio Estevez's drama The Way, alongside Martin Sheen, Deborah Kara <b>Unger,</b> and Yorick van Wageningen, and has a role as Sicinius in Ralph Fiennes' contemporary Shakespeare adaptation Coriolanus.|$|E

25|$|<b>Unger</b> was {{admitted}} to Harvard Law School in September 1969. After receiving his LLM, <b>Unger</b> stayed at Harvard another year on a fellowship, and then entered the doctoral program. At 23 years old, <b>Unger</b> began teaching jurisprudence, among other things, to first year students.

25|$|The coup {{had been}} staged {{in the absence}} of American {{ambassador}} Leonard <b>Unger,</b> who was in Saigon conferring with Secretary of State Dean Rusk, Ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, and Assistant Secretary for State for Far Eastern Affairs William P. Bundy. American ambassador Leonard <b>Unger</b> hastily returned from his conference on 23 April, accompanied by Bundy. <b>Unger</b> confronted Siho and Kouprasith and informed them that the United States supported Souvanna Phouma and the International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos of 23 July 1962. <b>Unger</b> noted that the two mutinous officers reacted like frightened schoolboys. Bundy thought they were desperate to save face. <b>Unger</b> ordered Siho and Kouprasith to release their captives while announcing they had taken Souvanna Phouma into custody to secure the national government. In a face saving gesture, they did so. Unger's orders had ended the abortive coup.|$|E

5000|$|Jonathan Turley, {{writing in}} the Northwestern Symposium, praised Politics, observing that [...] "like the great {{majority}} of <b>Unger's</b> work, it penetrates its subject matter at the deepest level, analyzing the very language and foundation of social theory.... <b>Unger's</b> comprehensive theories and writings have implications for virtually all disciplines and professions." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ungers</b> {{worked in}} New York and Cologne. After several {{competition}} successes, <b>Ungers</b> became {{famous for his}} steel sculptures and light installations.

40|$|Roberto <b>Unger's</b> {{distinctive}} {{contribution to}} contemporary social thought is to radically deepen and sharpen John Dewey's notion of social experimentation {{in light of}} the crisis of Marxist theory and praxis. <b>Unger's</b> fundamental aim is to free Marxist conceptions of human society-making from evolutionary, deterministic, and economistic encumbrances. He seeks to accomplish this by building upon Deweyan concerns with the plethora of historically specific social arrangements and with the often overlooked politics of personal relations between unique and purposeful individuals. <b>Unger's</b> fascinating effort stakes out new discursive space on the contemporary political and ideological spectrum. This space is neither simply left nor liberal, Marxist nor Lockean, anarchist nor Kantian. Rather, <b>Unger's</b> perspective is both post-Marxist and post-liberal; that is, it consists of an emancipatory experimentalism that promotes permanent social transformation and perennial self-development toward ever increasing democracy and individual freedom...|$|R

25|$|For <b>Unger,</b> society emerges {{not through}} {{compromise}} or the winnowing down of best options, but rather though conflict and struggle {{for control of}} political and material resources. The victors of this struggle come to set the terms of social interaction and transaction, which is then institutionalized through law. This emergent order <b>Unger</b> calls formative context. Under a particular formative context, routines are established and people come to believe and act as if their social words were coherent wholes that are perfectly intelligible and defensible. They {{come to see the}} existing arrangements as necessary. <b>Unger</b> calls this false necessity. In reality, these arrangements are arbitrary and hold together rather tenuously, which leaves them open to resistance and change. This opposition <b>Unger</b> calls negative capability.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unger</b> {{also helped}} {{organize}} the presidential bids of former finance minister and governor of Ceará, Ciro Gomes, in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, Gomes came in third place with 11% of the vote, and in 2002 he came in fourth place with 12% of the vote. <b>Unger</b> had written The Next Step: An Alternative to Neoliberalism with Gomes in 1996. At the national level in 2002, again {{in the second round}} of the election, <b>Unger</b> supported Lula who went on to defeat José Serra to win the Presidency.|$|E
