500|$|... "Government Hooker" [...] {{begins as}} Gaga sings in an operatic fashion—backed by {{industrial}} synthesizers—and transcends into an electro-pop Gregorian chant. The song then progresses into the chorus: [...] "I {{can be good}} / I can be sex / I can be anything / I can be everything / I can be mom." [...] A male vocalist accompanies the singer's lyrics, [...] "Unless {{you want to be}} man / <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> hold hands / <b>Unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be dad". After Gaga sings [...] "I'm gonna drink my tears and cry / 'cos I know you love me baby" [...] during the techno-inspired bridge, she alludes to the alleged affair between Marilyn Monroe and John F. Kennedy with the lyrics [...] "Put your hands on me / John F. Kennedy / I'll make you squeal baby", singing in an impassive and monotonous manner.|$|E
500|$|The {{movie and}} Close were praised by The New York Times: [...] "Ms. Close, lean and more mature, hints that {{a touch of}} desperation lies in Nellie's cockeyed optimism." [...] The review also commented that the movie [...] "is beautifully produced, better than the stagy 1958 film" [...] and praised the singing. Kenrick, however, dislikes the adaptation: [...] "You {{certainly}} won't ever want to put this disaster in your player, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{hear the sound of}} Rodgers and Hammerstein whirling in their graves. Glenn Close is up to the material, but her supporting cast is uniformly disastrous. [...] A pointless and offensive waste of money, time and talent." ...|$|E
500|$|The film also {{received}} mixed reviews from other critics. Ananda Vikatan said, [...] "Though {{this effort to}} improve the quality of Tamil cinema must be appreciated, we do not see the dignity of the epic and only see the dominance of the extravaganza." [...] In 2012, Baradwaj Rangan called the film [...] "a historical epic with little so-called relevance to contemporary life (<b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge the Duryodhana-Karna storyline as the granddaddy of today's bromances)" [...] and stated that Ganesan's performance [...] "isn't as all-consuming as his performance in, say, The Mahabharata, after all, is a tale with an ensemble cast, unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero", while calling Rama Rao's performance a [...] "sly, campy take on Krishna".|$|E
6000|$|... "Draw it fine, Willum; don't be flowery," [...] {{said the}} sailor, {{renewing}} his quid. [...] "Moreover, if you'll take {{the advice of}} an old salt you'll keep a tighter grip o' that belayin'-pin you've got hold of, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be washed overboard. Now then, fire away! I'm all attention, as the cat said at the mouth o' the mouse-hole." ...|$|R

[Pressure to do {{something}} about the defensive system; returning responsibility to patient] What {{are you going}} to do about that here with me <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> that distance <b>to</b> continue and that sabotaging system to dominate you? [Challenge to change behaviour in the transference] [...]...|$|R

500|$|Senior {{executives}} at publishers Michael Joseph {{and at the}} Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, {{who worked for the}} Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered [...] "large sums of money" [...] to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as the Church reportedly believed that the CIA was driving investigations into its tax affairs in the U.S. According to Cynewulf, Miller's mail and phones were intercepted and his home was under constant surveillance. The newspaper reported that Cynewulf had chased its reporter and photographer through the streets of Bristol, armed with a pistol which he fired at them, saying, [...] "You'd better go now <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> end up in a wooden box. Do you want to be another Hungerford martyr?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hughes married Kate Murphy of San Antonio (d. 1980) in 1910. In 1981 Holocaust denier David Irving {{claimed that}} Hughes {{had a girlfriend}} whom he {{referred}} to as “JP” in his diary. Recent research has discovered that “JP” refers to Elizabeth Prismall, who was a British secretary on Hughes’ staff. The nature of their relationship was indeed close, but {{it is by no}} means certain that the two were having an affair. Hughes, of his own volition, informed Kate of Mrs. Prismall’s presence explaining in a letter dated March 8, 1943, [...] "I have taken Mrs. Prismall to the mess several times and during the past few days….So you’ll soon here [...] that Hughes has a girl friend [...] along with the rest. But don’t put the wrong interpretation on anything you hear or on what I have said <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make yourself unhappy.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then why don't you tear it up, {{and make}} another? I don't <b>want</b> anything, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> have it; and I'd ratha not have anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's jest where I left it, an' won't {{be touched}} till {{he comes to}} claim it, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> boys <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{take charge of the}} property." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For Heaven's sake, Dora, {{put away}} that mess! The Ellenboroughs are {{directly}} opposite, watching everything you do. Eat that omelet, or anything respectable, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> die of mortification." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{got to do}} it-- <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{be burned}} up. Now then, if you don't want to climb down the ladder, let me carry you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Impossible! Don't attempt it <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{throw your}} life away. Buzzard Jim, {{as we call}} Girty, is a butcher; he has {{probably}} murdered the girl." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had two {{prizes for}} {{arithmetic}} when I was at school," [...] she remarked; [...] "and don’t {{you call me}} Selina, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be called Bobbie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's the use {{of going}} back <b>to</b> that now, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> put my neck down to be trodden on? I am confessing my own sins as fast as I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, look on, then. I'd just as lief have you." [...] Then {{he turned}} to the cowboy. [...] "Moore, show up that wagon-load of stuff <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> me <b>to</b> throw it out in the road." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Civil! I don't {{know what}} <b>you</b> would have, <b>unless</b> <b>you</b> <b>wanted</b> me <b>to</b> embrace him. He {{shook hands with}} us all round. I really thought Mrs. Townsend would have looked him into the river {{when he came to}} her." ...|$|R
