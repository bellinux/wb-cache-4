25|$|UV {{has also}} been shown to reduce gaseous {{contaminants}} such as carbon monoxide and VOCs. UV lamps radiating at 184 and 254nm can remove low concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide if the air is recycled between the room and the lamp chamber. This arrangement prevents the introduction of ozone into the treated air. Likewise, air may be treated by passing by a single UV source operating at 184nm and passed over iron pentaoxide to remove the ozone produced by the <b>UV</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scorpions {{are also}} known to glow a vibrant blue-green {{when exposed to}} certain {{wavelengths}} of ultraviolet light such as that produced by a black light, due {{to the presence of}} fluorescent chemicals in the cuticle. One fluorescent component is now known to be beta-carboline. A hand-held <b>UV</b> <b>lamp</b> has long been a standard tool for nocturnal field surveys of these animals. Fluorescence occurs as a result of sclerotisation and increases in intensity with each successive instar. This fluorescence may have an active role in scorpion light detection.|$|E
25|$|The UV lamps {{for water}} {{treatment}} consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a polychromatic output from 200nm to visible and infrared energy. The <b>UV</b> <b>lamp</b> never contacts the water; {{it is either}} housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{our study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of medium-pressure <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> radiation on water quality in a chlorinated indoor swimming pool. An indoor swimming pool was equipped with two medium-pressure <b>UV</b> <b>lamps.</b> We collected eight samples of water daily over a four-weeks period and measured total and free chlorine, pH, water temperature, bacteriological parameters, total organic carbon and trihalomethanes. During the first week, which served as control, medium-pressure <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> were turned off. During the next three weeks, medium-pressure <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> were kept on 24 h per day. The third week, we reduced the level of the injected chlorine into water, and the last week we also reduced the water renewal volume by 27 %. Our results showed that bacteriological parameters remained within allowable french limits. When medium-pressure <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> were kept on, total, free and active chlorine levels were significantly increased (P< 0. 001), whereas combined chlorine level were significantly decreased (P< 0. 001 and P< 0. 05, respectively). The levels of chloroform and bromodichloromethane were significantly increased when medium-pressure <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> were kept on (P< 0. 001), whereas chlorodibromomethane and bromoform levels significantly decreased (P< 0. 05 and P< 0. 001, respectively). The additional formation of chloroform and bromodichloromethane may be explained by the increase in active chlorine and by radicalizing mechanisms initiated by UV radiation...|$|R
25|$|Lamps {{are either}} amalgam or {{medium-pressure}} <b>lamps.</b> Low-pressure <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1 W/cm power density (power {{per unit of}} arc length). Amalgam <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> are a higher-power version of low-pressure lamps. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly {{lower than that of}} traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2–3 W/cm. Medium-pressure <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> have a broad and pronounced peak-line spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30 W/cm³ or greater.|$|R

25|$|It {{can be used}} as an {{artificial}} biomarker in wildlife to check if wild animals are consuming a bait that contains a vaccine or medication. Since it is fluorescent and binds to calcium, a <b>UV</b> <b>lamp</b> can be used to check if it is in a tooth pulled from an animal. For example, it was used to check uptake of oral rabies vaccine baits by raccoons in the USA. However, this is an invasive procedure for the animal and labour-intensive for the researcher. Therefore, other dyes such as Rhodamine B that can be detected in hair and whiskers are preferred.|$|E
25|$|UV {{disinfection}} is {{most effective}} for treating high-clarity, purified reverse osmosis distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate—if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the <b>UV</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 2011 {{scientists}} at Italy's National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Development ENEA deduced from the STURP results that {{the color of}} the Shroud image is the result of an accelerated aging process of the linen, similar to the yellowing of the paper of ancient books.

When subsequently illuminated with a <b>UV</b> <b>lamp,</b> the irradiated linen fabrics behaved like the linen of the Shroud.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Photocatalytic {{oxidation}} is {{an emerging}} technology for destruction of dilute air contaminants {{that is currently}} under commercial development, which using TiO 2 as photocatalyst. UV illumination of the TiO 2 film placed in a gaseous formaldehyde (HCHO) / air container resulted in the total degradation of formaldehyde to CO 2 and H 2 O. Despite its potential advantages, the key unresolved issues in the commercial application of photocatalytic oxidation technologies to contaminated air purification are that of optimum photocatalytic reactor design and the load of photocatalyst. In this paper, successive alternating banks of <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> and structured catalyst support monoliths are mounted directly in a square duct. The photocatalyst TiO 2 was loaded {{on the surface of}} honeycomb monoliths by different methods. The square duct including banks of <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> and structured catalyst support monoliths was put in a 4 cubic meters glass container. The polluted gas was injected into the container. The photocatalytic degradation of air contaminants was studied. The results shown that the air contaminants formaldehyde can be degraded by photocatalytic oxidation technology. The photocatalytic efficiency was different photo-initiated by <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> with peak wavelength at 254 nm and 365 nm.

25|$|The PCR {{method is}} {{extremely}} sensitive, requiring {{only a few}} DNA molecules in a single reaction for amplification across several orders of magnitude. Therefore, adequate measures to avoid contamination from any DNA present in the lab environment (bacteria, viruses, or human sources) are required. Because products from previous PCR amplifications are a common source of contamination, many molecular biology labs have implemented procedures that involve dividing the lab into separate areas. One lab area is dedicated to preparation and handling of pre-PCR reagents and the setup of the PCR reaction, and another area to post-PCR processing, such as gel electrophoresis or PCR product purification. For the setup of PCR reactions, many standard operating procedures involve using pipettes with filter tips and wearing fresh laboratory gloves, {{and in some cases}} a laminar flow cabinet with <b>UV</b> <b>lamp</b> as a work station (to destroy any extraneomultimer formation). PCR is routinely assessed against a negative control reaction that is set up identically to the experimental PCR, but without template DNA, and performed alongside the experimental PCR.|$|E
2500|$|A shortwave <b>UV</b> <b>lamp</b> can be {{made using}} a {{fluorescent}} lamp tube with no phosphor coating. These lamps emit ultraviolet light with two peaks in the UVC band at 253.7nm and 185nm due to the mercury within the lamp, {{as well as some}} visible light. From 85% to 90% of the UV produced by these lamps is at 253.7nm, whereas only 5–10% is at 185nm. The fused quartz glass tube passes the 253nm radiation but blocks the 185nm wavelength. Such tubes have two or three times the UVC power of a regular fluorescent lamp tube. These low-pressure lamps have a typical efficiency of approximately 30–40%, meaning that for every 100 watts of electricity consumed by the lamp, they will produce approximately 30–40 watts of total UV output. These [...] "germicidal" [...] lamps are used extensively for disinfection of surfaces in laboratories and food-processing industries, and for disinfecting water supplies.|$|E
2500|$|Ethidium bromide is {{commonly}} used to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories. In the case of DNA this is usually double-stranded DNA from PCRs, restriction digests, etc. Single-stranded RNA can also be detected, since it usually folds back onto itself and thus provides local base pairing for the dye to intercalate. Detection typically involves a gel containing nucleic acids placed on or under a <b>UV</b> <b>lamp.</b> Since ultraviolet light is harmful to eyes and skin, gels stained with ethidium bromide are usually viewed indirectly using an enclosed camera, with the fluorescent images recorded as photographs. Where direct viewing is needed, the viewer's eyes and exposed skin should be protected. [...] In the laboratory the intercalating properties have long been used to minimize chromosomal condensation when a culture is exposed to mitotic arresting agents during harvest. The resulting slide preparations permit {{a higher degree of}} resolution, and thus more confidence in determining structural integrity of chromosomes upon microscopic analysis.|$|E

2500|$|UVGI {{can be used}} to {{disinfect}} air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms. [...] For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a <b>UV</b> <b>lamp</b> placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} {{regarding}} how medium pressure (MP) ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> <b>lamps</b> age under typical operating conditions, yet {{a number of}} assumptions regarding lamp aging are utilized when UV reactors are validated, often as unfounded approximations. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the aging of MP <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> utilized with a closed-vessel UV reactor technology for drinking water disinfection applications. Beginning in May 2002, measurements of MP <b>UV</b> <b>lamps</b> were recorded to track the total UV output, the germicidal output and the spectral wavelength distribution of four lamps under normal operating conditions. Of the four lamps, one aged to its end-of-life output (dropping below 70 % efficiency) at 6, 600 hours. The second lamp reached its end of lamp life at 13, 600 hours. Two lamps lasted the full span of testing (16, 500 h), ending at 68 % and 71 % efficiency. These data show that MP lamps are capable of lasting well beyond their guaranteed 4, 000 hour lifetime. No appreciable changes in the spectral wavelength distribution could be discerned until the efficiency dropped below approximately 70 %. These results demonstrate that appropriate use of sensor readings are essential for tracking lamp aging and with these readings, it may be unnecessary to presume a lamp’s lifetime or to constantly track a lamp’s spectral characteristics...|$|R
