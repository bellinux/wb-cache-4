5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote.</b> The compromise was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E
5|$|McGovern–Hatfield was put <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> {{again in}} 1971, with {{somewhat}} weaker provisions designed {{to gain more}} support. In polls, {{a large majority of}} the public now favored its intent, and McGovern took his name off a final form of it, as some senators were just objecting to him. Nevertheless, in June 1971, it failed to pass again, gaining only a few more votes than the year before. McGovern was now certain that the only way the war would come to a quick end was if there was a new president.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Frank {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts House of Representatives where he served for eight years. He {{made a name for himself}} in the mid-1970s as a {{political}} defender of the Combat Zone, Boston’s notorious red light district. Neighborhoods in Frank’s district bordered the Combat Zone. As a means of dealing with crime in the area (including violence, police corruption and the infiltration by organized crime), he introduced a bill into the Massachusetts General Court that would have legalized the sex-for-hire business but kept it quarantined in a red light district, which would have been moved to Boston’s Financial District. The bill, which had the support of Boston’s Police Commissioner, never came <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote.</b> Later, when Frank was running for Congress, opponents erroneously portrayed him as having attempted to permit red-light districts in all Bay State communities.|$|E

25|$|In 1994, Republican Congressional {{candidates}} ran on {{a platform}} of major reforms of government with measures such as a balanced budget amendment and welfare reform. These measures and others formed the famous Contract with America, which represented the first effort to have a party platform in an off-year election. The Contract promised to bring all points <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> {{for the first time in}} history. The Republicans passed some of their proposals, but failed on others such as term limits.|$|E
25|$|The {{bill was}} {{initially}} blocked by Republican {{leadership in the}} Legislature {{and when it came}} to a vote in the House {{on the morning of the}} last day of the 2005 session, it was blocked again in a procedural vote. After extensive lobbying from Gregoire, House Democratic and Republican leadership met and agreed to let the measure come <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote.</b> It cleared the House shortly thereafter and was swiftly passed by the state Senate and she signed it into law later that week.|$|E

In a press conference on 27 July Löfven announced a government reshuffling with Ygeman and Johansson resigning. He also stated {{that he would not}} resign himself over the incident.|$|E

50|$|On November 21, 2013, the Democratic Party, led by then-Majority Leader Harry Reid overrode the {{filibuster}} of a nomination with <b>a</b> simple majority <b>vote</b> {{to change the}} rules. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, <b>for</b> instance, judicial nominees to federal courts and a president's executive-branch nominations can be freed <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> confirmation <b>vote</b> by <b>a</b> simple majority <b>vote</b> of the Senate.

Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874. Neither U.S. Senate seat was <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> in 2006. In 2008, Democrats retained their majorities, governorship, and Congressional seats; and former governor Jeanne Shaheen defeated incumbent Republican John E. Sununu for the U.S. Senate in a rematch of the 2002 contest.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{moving to}} the Senate in March 1927, Hayden {{continued}} {{his opposition to the}} Boulder Canyon Project. With growing national support for the project, however, it became obvious to Hayden that passage of the bill was inevitable. Seeking time to gain terms more favorable to Arizona, he continued his opposition with the aid of two filibusters from Arizona's other Senator, Henry F. Ashurst, and was able to delay a vote of the full Senate on the measure {{until the end of the}} 70th Congress' first session. When the Swing-Johnston bill came <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> on May 28, 1928 Hayden made his first speech from the floor of the Senate, a filibuster in which he spoke for nine hours during an all-night session before allowing Ashurst to take over for another twelve hours.|$|E
25|$|On May 7, 2009, {{opponents of}} the law filed the {{necessary}} paperwork to launch a campaign to put the law <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> in the November elections, giving them until 90 days after the legislature adjourned to collect at least 55,087 valid signatures to put the measure on the ballot. In June 2009, Stand for Marriage Maine, the coalition group leading the veto effort, announced it had hired Schubert Flint Public Affairs, which had worked on the Proposition 8 effort in California, to handle public relations for the veto effort. In July 2009, No on 1/Protect Maine Equality was formed to oppose the veto. On September 2, 2009, the Secretary of State of Maine verified that the opponents had submitted {{a sufficient number of}} valid signatures and certified the ballot question for November.|$|E

25|$|On March 25, 2003 Rep. Amo Houghton re{{introduced}} the CDTA, as H.R 1415, to the 108th Congress.

The bill {{was introduced in the}} House, and referred to the House International Relations, House Ways and Means, and finally to the Subcommittee on Trade. The bill failed to be put <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote,</b> and went no further. In the same 108th Congressional Session, Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, introduced another version of the bill in the Senate. The bill was entitled S.760, and it was introduced on April 1, 2003 with 20 Co-Sponsors: 13 Democrats, 7 Republicans. The bill was read, and then referred to the Committee on Finance. The Committee passed the bill and it was placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. However, once the bill reached the floor, the Senate indefinitely postponed it by unanimous consent. This resulted in the bill never being voted on.|$|E

To bring the DREAM Act <b>up</b> <b>for</b> debate, <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> was scheduled on October 24 that would require a filibuster-proof count of 60 yes votes, but that failed. Senate opponents cited {{a variety of reasons}} for their opposition. Some labeled the DREAM Act as amnesty that would encourage chain migration and further illegal immigration in anticipation of new versions of the DREAM Act. Others stated that the DREAM Act, though worthy legislation, should be enacted only as part of a comprehensive immigration reform.|$|R
500|$|Most historians, {{such as one}} of Roosevelt's many biographers Howard K.

The U.S. public was very [...] "tense" [...] during the two-month blockade, and Roosevelt requested that Britain and Germany pull out their forces from the area. During the requests for the blockade’s end, Roosevelt stationed naval forces in Cuba, to ensure [...] "the respect of Monroe doctrine" [...] and the compliance of the parties in question. The doctrine was never ratified by the senate or brought <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote</b> to the American public. Roosevelt's declaration was the first of many presidential decrees in the twentieth century that were never ratified.|$|E
500|$|After the Louisville and Nashville Railroad incident, Gates {{found that}} public opinion had turned against {{him as a}} result of it.

[...] When young Gates' name was brought <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>vote,</b> the members of the admissions committee were unanimous in their [...] "no" [...] decision. [...] Gates threatened to sue the club and the members denied his charges of Morgan being behind Charlie Gates' refusal.
