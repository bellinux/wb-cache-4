Although these existing frameworks were in place before reunification, after the fall of the Wall there was a need to develop new instruments in order to facilitate the spatial and economic development of the re-unified city.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the short- and {{long-term effects of}} urbanization, via favorable <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies,</b> on income distribution and social welfare for a developing country. The urban manufacturing sector is characterized by imperfect competition and free entry. Urbanization shifts rural workers to the highly productive urban sector, while causing production in urban firms to expand because of scale economies. However, urbanization may worsen wage inequality between skilled and unskilled labor in the short term. In the long term, urbanization can attract new firms to the urban sector, and favorable <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> may result in excessive entry of firms, which can amplify wage inequality in the economy. This entry-amplifying effect is confirmed empirically, especially for low- and lower-middle-income countries. If the entry effect is not considered, the impact of urbanization on wage inequality could be understated by 18 % for low- and lower-middle-income countries...|$|R

The legacy of the Bristol Accord and the Leipzig Charter, two examples of the uploading of national policy, is then examined. It can be argued that by drawing closely on domestic policy agenda, as well as wide ranging-nature of the agenda, little has resulted from the UK's contribution to the emerging EU urban agenda. This contrasts with the more sustained legacy of the Leipzig Charter. And third, the involvement of British and German cities, as well as impact of their participation in European urban cooperation programs is examined and evaluated.

40|$|Based on {{socio-economic}} {{development and}} population growth, rapid urbanisation is currently happening in China, leading to urban expansion {{and land use}} changes. This, in turn, affects biodiversity, habitats and ecosystem services. It is therefore important to identify and {{assess the impact of}} <b>urban</b> <b>development</b> <b>policies</b> (UDP) on ecosystems and their components at a policy level. Ji'nan City, the capital of Shandong Province in Northern China, has been taken as a case study for assessing the ecological impact of UDP. The study found that, influenced by the traditional economy-oriented development strategy, the former UDP of Ji'nan City was mainly focused on urban socio-economic growth by speeding up the construction of urban infrastructure facilities, expanding urban built-up areas as well as strengthening the development of resource- and pollution-intensive industry, which in turn has negatively influenced the ecosystem services. The promulgation of eco-environmentally friendly UDP would contribute to protect and maintain the ecosystems and their components. Finally, recommendations for informing the legislation of new environmentally friendly UDPs and furthering the implementation of ecological impact assessment (EcIA) in China are proposed.

It includes a discussion on the issue of public land ownership, an investigation of post-revolutionary urban land policies in Iran, a discussion on the evaluation of <b>urban</b> land <b>development</b> <b>policy</b> in terms of land supply, and finally, presents an argument on the relationship between public land ownership and <b>urban</b> <b>development.</b> The paper argues that alongside the primary advantages of public land ownership, such as urban growth control, preventing land speculation and providing land for various social needs, the land policy has succeeded to some extent in meeting residential land demand in the study period. However, in terms of the effectiveness of the land supply policies, the paper raises some concerns such as the centralized nature of the land development process, land wastage and isolation from the general process of planning.
