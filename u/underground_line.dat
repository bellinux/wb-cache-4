5|$|The first {{rapid transit}} line, the Holmenkoll Line, opened in 1898, with the branch Røa Line opening in 1912. It {{became the first}} Nordic {{underground}} railway in 1928 when the <b>underground</b> <b>line</b> to Nationaltheatret was opened. After 1993 trains ran under the city between the eastern and western networks in the Common Tunnel, followed by the 2006 opening of the Ring Line. All the trains are operated with MX3000 stock. These replaced the older T1000 stock between 2006 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|Although {{operated}} by private companies, the system's fare structure is {{regulated by the}} Public Transport Council (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases {{over the past few}} years have caused public concern, the latest one having taken effect from 1 October 2008. There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's North East Line, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely <b>underground</b> <b>line,</b> as well as lower patronage.|$|E
5|$|Although the C {{was well}} used, low ticket {{prices and the}} {{construction}} cost of the extensions placed a strain on the company's finances. In 1913, the C {{became part of the}} Underground Group of railways and, in the 1920s, it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of the Group's railways, the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway, forming a single London <b>Underground</b> <b>line</b> called the Morden-Edgware line. In 1933, the C {{and the rest of the}} Underground Group was taken into public ownership. Today, its tunnels and stations form the Bank Branch of the Northern line from Camden Town to Kennington and the southern leg of the line from Kennington to Morden.|$|E

5|$|In 1912 the Lacroze Hermanos company won a {{concession}} to build another <b>Underground</b> <b>line.</b> The company was a competitor to the Anglo-Argentine company, operating tramways in Buenos Aires {{as well as the}} Buenos Aires Central Railway, which later became part of the Urquiza Line. Construction began in 1927 and this line became Line B when it was inaugurated on 17 October 1930. During 17–18 December 380,000 passengers travelled on the line's then 32 cars. The line was originally intended to continue above ground, with the current Federico Lacroze station to be the central terminal of the Buenos Aires Central Railway (today the General Urquiza Railway), however nowadays the overground service forms part of the Urquiza Line instead.|$|E
5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the <b>underground</b> <b>line</b> becomes {{elevated}}. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local track merges into the southbound express track, while the northbound express track becomes the El's bidirectional center express track. During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express track in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver Yard of the Coney Island Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on Coney Island.|$|E
5|$|The Great Blizzard of 1888 helped {{demonstrate}} {{the benefits of}} an underground transportation system. A plan {{for the construction of}} the subway was approved in 1894, and construction began in 1900. The first <b>underground</b> <b>line</b> of the subway opened on October 27, 1904, almost 36 years after the opening of the first elevated line in New York City, which became the IRT Ninth Avenue Line. The fare was $0.05 and on the first day the trains carried over 150,000 passengers. The oldest structure still in use opened in 1885 as part of the BMT Lexington Avenue Line in Brooklyn and is now part of the BMT Jamaica Line. The oldest right-of-way, {{which is part of the}} BMT West End Line near Coney Island Creek, was in use in 1864 as a steam railroad called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Rail Road.|$|E

5|$|In October 2015, {{the city}} of Buenos Aires {{together}} with the Inter-American Development Bank presented a 150-page plan for the Underground called the Strategic and Technical Plan for the Expansion of the Subterranean Network (Plan Estratégico y Técnico para la Expansión de la Red de Subtes, or PETERS), highlighting past expansion efforts {{and the need to}} adapt plans to the current needs of the city. In this version of the <b>Underground,</b> <b>Line</b> I is cancelled while Line G takes a different route through the centre of the city terminating at Constitucion railway station after going through the neighbourhood of San Telmo, rather than at Retiro railway station. Other changes include a Retiro Norte node where lines F and H terminate, rather than at Plaza Italia and Retiro respectively, while Line E is extended to Plaza Italia from Retiro – a segment which in the original plan was part of Line F. In these plans, Line C is extended both northwards in a loop to Retiro bus station and southwards to the Buenos Aires Belgrano Sur Line railway station minor terminal.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{section of}} the metro was the Holmenkollen Line, which opened as a suburban tramway in 1898. The Røa Line was the next to open as a branch, in 1912. The system became the first Nordic underground railway in 1928, when the <b>underground</b> <b>line</b> to Nationaltheatret was opened. The Østensjø Line opened in 1923, the Sognsvann Line in 1934, and the Kolsås Line in 1942. The opening of the upgraded metro system in the eastern boroughs occurred in 1966, after {{the conversion of the}} 1957 Lambertseter Line to metro standard. This involved the implementation of automatic train protection, longer platforms, replacement of the overhead wires with third rail and removal of level crossings. This was followed by the conversion of the Østensjø Line to metro standard, as well as the new Grorud Line and the Furuset Line. From 1987 to 1993, trains terminated at Stortinget, which has since then been the basis for the kilometer markers. In 1993, for the first time, trains ran through the city between the two networks in the Common Tunnel. The latest extension is the 2006 opening of the Ring Line, which connects the eastern and western network north of the city center. Between 2006 and 2010, the older T1000 stock was replaced with MX3000 trains.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} C {{extension}} {{had been completed}} in 1926, possibilities for the northward extension of the Piccadilly tube began to reappear. From 1922, a series of press campaigns called {{for the improvement of}} services at the GNR's Finsbury Park station where interchanges between tube lines, mainline trains, buses and trams were notoriously bad. In June 1923, a petition from 30,000 local residents was submitted to parliament, and, in 1925, the government called a public inquiry to review options. Pick presented plans to relieve the congestion at Finsbury Park by extending the Piccadilly tube north to Southgate. Opposition from the London and North Eastern Railway (successor to the GNR following the 1923 grouping of railway companies) was again considerable and based on claims that the new <b>Underground</b> <b>line</b> would take passengers from the mainline services. Using data from the Bakerloo tube, Hampstead tube and C extensions, Pick demonstrated that the route planned for the new line would stimulate new residential development and increase passenger numbers for all rail operators in the area, increasing those on the Piccadilly tube by 50 million per year. Parliamentary approval was granted in 1930 to extend the Piccadilly tube north beyond Southgate to a terminus at Cockfosters. The approval also included complementary extensions of the Piccadilly tube from its western terminus at Hammersmith to supplement District Railway services to Hounslow and South Harrow. The development was again financed with government backed loans, this time through the 1929 Development (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Act. To ensure the most efficient integration between the new tube line and the UERL's bus and tram operations, the stations were located further apart than in central areas and where road transport services could be arranged to deliver and collect the most passengers. At Manor House, the station was designed with subway exits directly on to pedestrian islands in the road served by the local trams.|$|E

5|$|The Great Northern and Strand Railway (GN) first {{proposed}} a {{station in the}} Strand area in a private bill presented to Parliament in November 1898. The station {{was to be the}} southern terminus of an underground railway line planned to run from Wood Green station (now Alexandra Palace) via Finsbury Park and King's Cross and was originally to be located at the corner of Stanhope Street and Holles Street, north of the Strand. When the two streets were scheduled for demolition as part of the London County Council's plans for the construction of Kingsway and Aldwych, the GN moved the location to the junction of the two new roads. Royal Assent to the bill was given and the Great Northern and Strand Railway Act 1899 was enacted on 1 August. In September 1901, the GN was taken over by the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway (B), which planned to build an <b>underground</b> <b>line</b> from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus via Knightsbridge. Both were under the control of Charles Yerkes through his Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company and, in June 1902, were transferred to Yerkes' new holding company, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Neither of the railways had carried out any construction, but the UERL obtained permission for new tunnels between Piccadilly Circus and Holborn to connect the two routes. The companies were formally merged as the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP) following parliamentary approval in November 1902. Prior to confirmation of the merger, the GN had sought permission to extend its line southwards from the future junction of Kingsway and Aldwych, under Norfolk Street to a new interchange under the Metropolitan District Railway's station at Temple. The extension was rejected following objections from the Duke of Norfolk under whose land {{the last part of the}} proposed tunnels would have run.|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} with some light rail <b>underground</b> <b>lines,</b> {{which are often}} provisionally equipped with low platforms or with tracks laid on raised ballast, there are {{new developments in the}} German cities of Düsseldorf (Wehrhahn line) and Dortmund (east-west line). In each of these cities, a new <b>underground</b> light rail <b>line</b> is equipped with platforms for low-floor trams and will be permanently operated with low floor vehicles.
