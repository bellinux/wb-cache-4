40|$|Forests are {{increasingly}} threatened by windthrows but those composed of uneven-aged stand plots are generally less impacted by their effects. As a consequence, {{the management of}} such forests {{should be based on}} a joint management of all their different uneven-aged stand plots. This article determines the optimal management regime of uneven-aged forests under risk of windthrow and furthermore takes the risk preferences of the forest owner into account. This study analyzes optimal harvesting of uneven-aged stand plots by applying a Markov decision process (MDP) framework using an economic description of uneven-aged forestry. Two management types are considered: the joint <b>uneven-aged</b> <b>forest</b> management model in which the forest owner jointly manages all the different stand plots, and the independent <b>uneven-aged</b> <b>forest</b> management model that assumes that the forest owner independently manages each plot of the forest. The MDP framework is applied to a non-industrial private forest owner located in northeastern France. First, we show that the forest owner tends to converge toward a forest structure that is close to a normal forest in the joint <b>uneven-aged</b> <b>forest</b> management model. Second, we find that the independent <b>uneven-aged</b> <b>forest</b> management model poorly approximates the optimal multi-stand harvesting policy. Third, and more surprisingly, the levels of windthrow probability changes considered have little influence on the optimal harvesting strategies of the forest owner. Lastly, in contrast, the forest owner's risk aversion is shown to have a strong influence on the optimal policy.

40|$|Markov chain {{models have}} been applied {{for a long time}} to {{simulate}} forest dynamics based on transitions in matrices of tree diameter classes or areas of forest size and structure types. To date, area-based matrix {{models have been}} applied assuming either even-aged or <b>uneven-aged</b> <b>forest</b> management. However, both management systems may be applied simultaneously due to land-use constraints or the rationality of combining the systems, which is called any-aged management.

We evaluate the impacts of parameterizing the model based on available data sets, namely permanent and temporary Finnish National Forest Inventory (NFI) sample plots and a plotlevel simulator to determine transitions due to different types of thinning treatments, and present recommendations for the related methodological choices. Our overall observation is that the combined modelling chain simulated the development of both the even- and <b>uneven-aged</b> <b>forest</b> structures realistically.

40|$|Research on {{the early}} stages of stand {{dynamics}} in <b>uneven-aged</b> <b>forests</b> often favours regeneration over recruitment of trees into forest stands. We contrasted both regeneration (i. e. seedlings and saplings existing in a stand) and recruitment (i. e. the number of trees annually crossing the threshold of 10 cm dbh) in two main stand types of <b>uneven-aged</b> <b>forests</b> (plenter and group selection). Data from 1710 permanent plots across the Dinaric Mountains in Slovenia were used to study recruitmenton 165 plots, regeneration was additionally analysed. The zero-inflated negative binomial modelling procedure was applied to identify factors influencing regeneration and recruitment. Total regeneration (30 212 ha− 1) and that of light-demanding species (14 879 ha− 1) were abundant. The latter regenerated more successfully in group selection stands compared with plenter stands. A large reduction in regeneration density was determined during its growth, which was more dramatic for light-demanding species (e. g. Acer pseudoplatanus) than for shade-tolerant species (e. g. Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba). The number of recruited trees (5. 83 ha− 1 y− 1) seemed to be sufficient to maintain the uneven structure but was less promising for light-demanding species (0. 13 ha− 1 y− 1). However, light-demanding species have the potential to establish and recruit into uneven-aged stands with a limited target proportion in the growing stock.
