5000|$|A {{high forest}} {{is a type}} of forest {{originated}} from seed or from planted seedlings. In contrast to a low forest (also known as a coppice forest), a high forest usually consists of large, tall mature trees with a closed canopy. High forests can occur naturally or they can be created and/or maintained by human management. Trees in a high forest can be of one, a few or many species. A high forest can be even-aged or <b>uneven-aged.</b> [...] Even-aged forests contain trees of one, or two successional age classes (generations). <b>Uneven-aged</b> forests have three or more age classes represented.|$|E

50|$|ProSilva {{recommends}} {{to use the}} <b>uneven-aged</b> forest system, {{in which}} the ages, and consequently sizes, of trees in a forest are different. It has the advantage to offer a stable structure regarding natural disasters and plagues, and is very adequate for fauna habitat and biodiversity promotion. It provides a better soil protection, since there is a permanent tree cover.|$|E
50|$|Spotted owls {{occur in}} a variety of {{hardwood}} and coniferous forest habitats, preferably in closed-canopy, <b>uneven-aged,</b> late-successional, and old-growth forests. The Mexican subspecies may also make use of chaparral and pinyon woodlands, including areas in deep, steep-walled canyons with little canopy cover. The California subspecies uses unlogged, complex early seral forests created by wildfire for foraging.|$|E
50|$|The {{north of}} Hainich is {{managed by the}} {{forestry}} service in Creuzburg. The forests belong to the municipality of Mühlhausen and to the cooperatives of Oberdorla, Niederdorla, Langula and Kammerforst. Selective tree cutting and <b>uneven-aged</b> management are dominant in the beech forests. Sycamore maple and Chequer tree are bringing the best yield. In former times oaks and hornbeam were favorised.|$|E
50|$|The group {{selection}} {{method is}} an <b>uneven-aged</b> regeneration method {{that can be}} used when mid-tolerant species regeneration is desired. The group selection method can still result in residual stand damage in dense stands, however directional falling can minimize the damage. Additionally, foresters can select across the range of diameter classes in the stand and maintain a mosaic of age and diameter classes.|$|E
50|$|Determining what a site tree {{should look}} like in a stand varies with what kind of stand one is {{standing}} in. The simplest stand to find a site tree in is an even aged stand of a single species, much like a forest plantation. In this stand almost any dominant or co-dominant tree can be used. Finding a site tree is more difficult in <b>uneven-aged,</b> mixed species, stands.|$|E
50|$|The diagram {{itself is}} a plot of the natural {{logarithm}} of the volume or yield against the natural logarithm of stems per acre. Just like a stocking diagram, the A-line, B-line, and C-line are plotted. In addition, the -3/2 rule maximum density line is plotted just above the A-line. The diagram works well for even aged, single cohort stands. However, {{it is not as}} effective with <b>uneven-aged</b> stands.|$|E
50|$|The single-tree {{selection}} {{method is}} an <b>uneven-aged</b> regeneration method most suitable when shade tolerant species regeneration is desired. It is typical for older and diseased trees to be removed, thus thinning {{the stand and}} allowing for younger, healthy trees to grow. Single-tree selection can {{be very difficult to}} implement in dense or sensitive stands and residual stand damage can occur. This method is also disturbs the canopy layer the least out of all other methods.|$|E
5000|$|... "Uneven-aged and even-aged methods {{differ in}} the scale and {{intensity}} of disturbance. <b>Uneven-aged</b> methods maintain a mix of tree sizes or ages within a habitat patch by periodically harvesting individual or small groups of trees, Even-aged methods harvest {{most or all of}} the overstory and create a fairly uniform habitat patch dominated by trees of the same age". Even-aged management systems have been the prime methods to use when studying the effects on birds.|$|E
50|$|Erosion {{control is}} {{addressed}} in the THP for each management unit. In general <b>uneven-aged</b> management helps ensure ground cover, which minimizes erosion. Road maintenance is done to decrease erosion. Between October and April ATV's and a Polaris are used for access and forestry work. During this time period no vehicles are permitted to use the roads. Each spring and early fall the roads are maintained. The ranch currently maintains road crossings and culverts by using GIS technology.|$|E
50|$|Selection cutting is the {{silvicultural}} {{practice of}} harvesting trees {{in a way}} that moves a forest stand towards an <b>uneven-aged</b> or all-aged condition, or 'structure'. Using stocking models derived from the study of old growth forests, '"Selection cutting"', also known as 'selection system', or 'selection silviculture', manages the establishment, continued growth and final harvest of multiple age classes (usually three, but 5 or even 10 are possible) of trees within a stand. A closely related approach to forest management is Continuous Cover Forestry (CCF), which makes use of selection systems to achieve a permanently irregular stand structure.|$|E
50|$|Even-aged forest {{management}} is the harvesting system {{of choice in}} many parts of the world because it is often considered to be the only method that is economically viable. Forestry operations have extremely high variable costs- per hour expenses for harvesting equipment and per kilometer expenses for log transportation compose a very large portion of the total cost to harvest a stand. Therefore, companies must obtain as much productivity as possible from their hourly equipment in order to be profitable. <b>Uneven-aged</b> management techniques where only certain trees are harvested, such as shelterwood systems, incur the same hourly costs while harvesting fewer trees per hour. This reality explains why in Canada, for example, 90% of forests harvested are done so by clear cut through an even-aged management system.|$|E
5000|$|Selection cutting {{is often}} (sometimes deliberately) {{confused}} with [...] "selective" [...] cutting, a term {{synonymous with the}} practice of highgrading (the removal of the most economically profitable trees in a forest, often with a disregard {{for the future of}} the residual stand). Often the latter term is used by foresters or loggers to imply the former (which has a generally positive connotation in forestry circles) and mislead landowners into stripping their woodlot of its most valuable timber. Used correctly, the term 'selection cutting', 'selection system', or 'selection silviculture' implies the implementation of specific silvicultural techniques—usually either 'single tree selection', 'group selection' or a combination of the two—to create an <b>uneven-aged</b> or all-aged condition in a forest stand, one more akin to a late successional or 'climax' condition.|$|E

"If {{there is}} a smart, multi-functional, low-cost, {{democratic}} strategy that can help to pull carbon out of the atmosphere, it's probably in this book: chinampas, step-harvest planting of trees (with six times the carbon density per acre), harnessing youth to the task, agroforestry, greening the desert, <b>uneven-aged</b> forest management, carbon farming, the soil food web, and more. Each of these gets a relatively brief, punchy, and fairly technical description. Bates is a good and stylish writer; he has an ear for the pithy phrase, and reading him is generally a pleasure.

5000|$|The project uses 9000 acre {{of state}} forest land as {{experimental}} tracts. That land {{is divided into}} nine compartments. One group of three compartments is a control group and experiences no logging. The second group is logged in an [...] "even-aged" [...] manner, with swaths comprising ten percent of each compartment logged every ten years. The third group is logged in an [...] "uneven-aged" [...] manner, with selective logging of trees throughout the three compartments in that group. The <b>uneven-aged</b> management style creates a forest with trees of various ages and sizes. In the two groups that are cut, 10% of trees are left uncut, to preserve them as old growth forest. In both groups, researchers expect all tracts of cut forest to regenerate {{by the end of}} the project. The uncut control group, of course, remains unaffected.|$|E
5000|$|They are dioecious, {{individual}} plants being either male or female. The {{fruit is}} unusual in that it builds up hydrostatic pressure internally when ripe and shoots the single sticky seed up to speeds nearly 50 mph, an example of rapid plant movement. The lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe, Arceuthobium americanum, {{has been found to}} explosively-disperse its seeds through thermogenesis. [...] Dwarf mistletoe seeds are enveloped in a hygroscopic, glue-like substance called viscin. Many fail to land on a suitable hosts shoot, but some succeed, and in this way they are spread through the forests as a pest front. The spread of dwarf mistletoes in forest stands is greatest from the overstory to the understory, due to gravity. Advantageous stand conditions for the spread of dwarf mistletoes include an <b>uneven-aged</b> stand structure with severely infected hosts in dominant and codominant crown classes, species composition dominated by the primary host, and tree densities that are between 175 - 500 trees/ha.|$|E
5000|$|An even-aged {{regeneration}} {{method that}} can employ either natural or artificial regeneration. It involves the complete {{removal of the}} forest stand at one time. [...] Clearcutting can be biologically appropriate with species that typically regenerate from stand replacing fires or other major disturbances, such as Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta). Alternatively, clearcutting can change the dominating species on a stand {{with the introduction of}} non-native and invasive species as was shown at the Blodgett Experimental Forest near Georgetown California. Additionally, clearcutting can prolong slash decomposition, expose soil to erosion, impact visual appeal of a landscape and remove essential wildlife habitat. It is particularly useful in regeneration of tree species such as Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) which is shade intolerant.. In addition, the general public's distaste for even-aged silviculture, particularly clearcutting, is likely to result in a greater role for <b>uneven-aged</b> management on public lands as well. Across Europe, and in parts of North America, even-aged, production-orientated and intensively managed plantations are beginning to be regarded {{in the same way as}} old industrial complexes: something to abolish or convert to something else.|$|E
50|$|Selection cutting or {{systems are}} {{generally}} considered to be more challenging to implement and maintain than even-aged silviculture, due to the difficulty of managing multiple age classes in a shared space, but there are significant ecological benefits associated with it. <b>Uneven-aged</b> stands generally exhibit higher levels of vertical structure (key for many species of birds and mammals), have higher levels of carbon sequestration, and produce a more constant flow of market and non-market forest resources than even-aged stands.. Although a forest composed of many stands with varied maturity ages maybe comparable, this would be at the forest rather than the stand level. This silvicultural method also protects forest soils from the adverse effects of many types of even-aged silviculture, including nutrient loss, erosion and soil compaction and the rapid loss of organic material from a forested system. Selection silviculture is especially adept at regenerating shade-tolerant species of trees (those able to function under conditions of low solar energy, both cooler and less light), but can also be modified to suit the regeneration and growth of intolerant and mid-tolerant species. This is one of many different ways of harvesting trees. Selection cutting as a silvicultural system can be modified in many ways and would be so done be a forester to take into account varied ownership goals, local site conditions and the species mix found from past forest conditions.|$|E

40|$|Forests are {{increasingly}} threatened by windthrows but those composed of <b>uneven-aged</b> stand plots are generally less impacted by their effects. As a consequence, {{the management of}} such forests {{should be based on}} a joint management of all their different <b>uneven-aged</b> stand plots. This article determines the optimal management regime of <b>uneven-aged</b> forests under risk of windthrow and furthermore takes the risk preferences of the forest owner into account. This study analyzes optimal harvesting of <b>uneven-aged</b> stand plots by applying a Markov decision process (MDP) framework using an economic description of <b>uneven-aged</b> forestry. Two management types are considered: the joint <b>uneven-aged</b> forest management model in which the forest owner jointly manages all the different stand plots, and the independent <b>uneven-aged</b> forest management model that assumes that the forest owner independently manages each plot of the forest. The MDP framework is applied to a non-industrial private forest owner located in northeastern France. First, we show that the forest owner tends to converge toward a forest structure that is close to a normal forest in the joint <b>uneven-aged</b> forest management model. Second, we find that the independent <b>uneven-aged</b> forest management model poorly approximates the optimal multi-stand harvesting policy. Third, and more surprisingly, the levels of windthrow probability changes considered have little influence on the optimal harvesting strategies of the forest owner. Lastly, in contrast, the forest owner's risk aversion is shown to have a strong influence on the optimal policy.

40|$|A {{shift from}} even-aged forest {{management}} to <b>uneven-aged</b> management practices {{leads to a}} problem rather different from the existing straightforward practice that follows a rotation cycle of artificial regeneration, thinning of inferior trees and a clearcut. A lack of realistic models and methods suggesting how to manage <b>uneven-aged</b> stands {{in a way that}} is economically viable and ecologically sustainable creates difficulties in adopting this new management practice. To tackle this problem, we make a two-fold contribution in this paper. The first contribution is the proposal of an algorithm that is able to handle a realistic <b>uneven-aged</b> stand management model that is otherwise computationally tedious and intractable. The model considered in this paper is an empirically estimated size-structured ecological model for <b>uneven-aged</b> spruce forests.

40|$|Growth and yield {{modeling}} has a {{long history}} in forestry. Methods of measuring the growth of <b>uneven-aged</b> forest stands have evolved from those developed in France and Switzerland during the last century. Furthermore, <b>uneven-aged</b> growth and yield modeling has progressed rapidly since the first models were pioneered by Moser and Hall (1969) (Moser Jr., J. W., Hall, O. F., 1969. For. Sci. 15, 183 – 188). Over the years, a variety of models have been developed for predicting the growth and yield of <b>uneven-aged</b> stands using both individual and stand-level approaches. Modeling methodology not only has moved from an empirical approach to a more ecological process-based mechanistic approach, but also has incorporated a variety of techniques, such as, (1) systems of equations, (2) nonlinear stand table projections, (3) Markov chains, (4) matrix models, and (5) artificial neural network models. However, modeling the growth and yield of <b>uneven-aged</b> stands has received much less attention than that of even-aged stands. This paper reviews the current literature regarding growth and yield models for <b>uneven-aged</b> stands, discusses basic types of models and their merits, and reports recent progress in modeling the growth and dynamics of <b>uneven-aged</b> stands. Furthermore, future trends involving integration of new computer technologies (object-oriented programming and user-friendly interfaces), tree visualization techniques, and the spatially explicit application of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) into <b>uneven-aged</b> modeling strategies are discussed. # 2000 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Climatic {{changes will}} affect the {{occurrence}} probability of extreme windstorms.

This study analyzes optimal harvesting of <b>uneven-aged</b> stands by applying a Markov Decision Processes (MDP) framework and an economic description of <b>uneven-aged</b> forestry.

The MDP framework is applied to a non-industrial private forest owner located in North-East of France. We show that the forest owner tends to converge toward a forest structure which is very close to a normal forest.

40|$|Abstract We {{evaluate}} the economic efficiency of even-and <b>uneven-aged</b> management systems under risk of wildfire. The management problems are formulated for a mixed-conifer stand and approximations of the optimal solutions are obtained using simulation optimization. The Northern Idaho {{variant of the}} Forest Vegetation Simulator and its Fire and Fuels Extension is used to predict stand growth and fire effects. Interest rate and fire risk {{are found to be}} critical determinants of the superior stand manage-ment system and timber supply. <b>Uneven-aged</b> management is superior with higher interest rates with or without fire risk. Alterations in the interest rate affect optimal stocking levels of <b>uneven-aged</b> stands, but have only minor effects on the long-run timber supply. Higher interest rates reduce rotation length and regeneration investments of even-aged stands, which lead to markedly reduced timber supply. Increasing fire risk increases the relative efficiency of even-aged management because a single age cohort is less sus-ceptible to fire damage {{over the course of the}} rotation than multiple cohorts in <b>uneven-aged</b> stands.

40|$|Existing optimal {{rotation}} models include even-aged management exogenously {{into the}} model structure. As an economic model, this Faustmann framework is restrictive and a more general model should not include any preconditions concerning the forest management system. Even-aged management should follow endogenously as an optimal solution if it proves out to be superior to other systems, such as <b>uneven-aged</b> management. Without such a general model, the economically optimal choice between even-aged and <b>uneven-aged</b> forestry remains somewhat arbitrary. This study specifies such a model and shows how even-aged management follows endogenously and reveals what factors work in favor of each management alternative. Numerical analysis shows that even and <b>uneven-aged</b> systems may represent locally optimal solutions and may yield equal economic outcomes. Instead of the usual comparative statics results of the Faustmann model, changes {{in the rate of}} discount, timber price or planting cost may imply that the optimal solution shifts from even-aged management to <b>uneven-aged</b> management...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{interest}} in <b>uneven-aged</b> forestry {{has been increasing}} in Britain, particularly for sensitive areas such as recreation and amenity forests. Literature on the economics of <b>uneven-aged</b> forestry is scarce and few operational, <b>uneven-aged</b> forests are available for study. Therefore, in order to quantify the operating costs associated with <b>uneven-aged</b> forestry, a modelling approach was chosen. The resulting model is written in FORTRAN and uses a series of square two-dimensional arrays to represent a block of forest. The block may then be managed by clearfelling and replanting at a specified age, or by a system of group management {{with a choice of}} four group sizes. The resulting model was then used to investigate the effect of the following management strategies on operating times: 1. Varying the scale of working (i. e. the group size and forest size) in the <b>uneven-aged</b> forest. 2. Using shortwood or pole-length harvesting systems and a range of machine types within each harvesting system. 3. Varying the length of time taken to transform the structure of the forest from even-aged to <b>uneven-aged.</b> 4. Varying the age of the trees when the transformation from even-aged to <b>uneven-aged</b> structure begins. The results obtained from running the model show that the time taken to carry out an operation is influenced both by the absolute size of the group within the forest block and by the number of groups of that size within the forest block. This fragmentation effect explains why {{it is difficult to determine}} the absolute costs of working for a specific group size, because it is the combination of group size, number of groups and forest block size, which determines costs. Most of the results below are based on a range of group sizes from 1. 000 ha. to 0. 0625 ha., with a block size of 16 ha. Forwarders were penalized when the group size was decreased to 0. 0625 ha.
