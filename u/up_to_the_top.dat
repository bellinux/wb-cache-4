5|$|The British {{magazine}} Sight & Sound {{has produced}} a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952, and is {{regarded as one of}} the most respected barometers of critical taste. Citizen Kane was a runner <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll, retaining the top spot in every subsequent poll until 2012, when Vertigo displaced it.|$|E

5|$|After this, the Allied forces {{advanced}} to the fortified naval outpost of Tobruk. The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January, following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea. The 2/3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2/1st Battalion to pass through. Following the initial breakthrough, the 2/3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences, attacking a number of Italian posts as they went. Tobruk fell the next day, with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson, {{the commander of the}} 19th Brigade. The Italian flag was taken down {{and in the absence of}} an Australian flag, a signaler from the 2/4th Battalion tied his slouch hat to the flag staff and hauled it <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> The battalion's losses during the fighting for Tobruk were seven officers and 50 men killed or wounded.|$|E
5|$|In 1552 {{the fort}} was decommissioned, but was {{subsequently}} recommissioned by Mary I. In {{addition to the}} fort's military role, it hosted a court to oversee the oysterfields along the East Mersea coast, which were particularly lucrative but at risk of overfishing. In 1566, Colchester introduced new rules to govern the oyster trade, which were enforced by an admiralty court, held when necessary in Mersea Fort; the location was chosen so as to demonstrate the town's authority all the way <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the estuary. A survey in 1586 showed the fort had been abandoned by the military once again: the defences were in a poor state, the guns' barrels were clogged with dirt and the site had been occupied by an elderly woman. It was brought back into use in 1588 and 1631 to defend against first the Spanish Armada and then the Dunkirker privateers.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} endemic to New Zealand’s subantarctic Auckland and Campbell Islands, {{where it is}} a {{striking}} component of the megaherb community.

It is most abundant at lower altitudes and where the vegetation {{is not subject to}} browsing by introduced animals.|$|R
50|$|The new {{government}} undertook two projects in Tigray. The {{first was the}} construction of terraces which, in agreement and with help of local communities, go <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> mountains at 2,500 meters. <b>The</b> goal was <b>to</b> prevent <b>the</b> rainfall flowing away immediately {{so that it could}} be conserved for the agricultural season. On the highest terraces there were planted trees, mainly eucalyptus which is the dominant tree in Ethiopia and is a native of Australia. These plants had to create a new microclimate.|$|R

5|$|Many {{key players}} left {{following}} the demotion to Serie B, including Lillian Thuram, star striker Zlatan Ibrahimović and defensive stalwart Fabio Cannavaro. However, other big name {{players such as}} Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet and Pavel Nedvěd remained to help the club return to Serie A, while youngsters from the Primavera (youth team), such as Sebastian Giovinco and Claudio Marchisio, were integrated into the first team. Juventus won the Cadetti (Serie B championship) and gained promotion straight back <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> division as league winners after the 2006–07 season, as captain Del Piero claimed the top scorer award with 21 goals.|$|E
5|$|O'Rourke {{left for}} a second time in May 1930, after he {{resigned}} because he was not allowed to sign a player he wanted. City spent eight seasons back in Division Two but the nearest they came to stepping <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> flight was in 1933–34 when at one point they topped the division. Their sixth-place finish was the highest position since the club had been in Division One and would not be bettered until the 1980s. Relegation back to Division Three (North) came in 1936–37. City were runners-up in the Division Three North Challenge Cup a year later before they won the same competition in the last year before league football was again suspended because of war.|$|E
5|$|The assault {{resulted}} in a public outcry over the event which pressured {{all levels of the}} government right <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> ranks of the federal government to investigate into the matter. In the closing months of 1992, and also the opening months of 1993, dozens of articles mentioning misdeeds by the royal families of several states–but in particular Sultan Iskandar himself were published. A good deal of these alleged misdeeds that were mentioned included the charging of exorbitant fines–way above the prescribed legal limits–upon offenders who had obstructed the Sultan's car, amongst others. Sultan Iskandar, nevertheless bore the brunt of the backlash by the numerous references centred towards alleged acts of criminal wrongdoings even though many of the listed acts were committed by other members of the royal family.|$|E

5|$|The castle motte {{was built}} up in several stages, {{originally}} being lower in height than today, before being built up during the medieval period and scarped by cutting away at the surrounding stone. It was then reinforced in 1700 {{with the addition of}} clay, before having large quantities of earth dumped on it in the late 18th century, and then being terraced in the mid-19th century. The motte is separated from the bailey by a ditch, now crossed by a modern bridge. In the 13th century this point was protected by a D-shaped tower, which still survives, located {{to one side of the}} gateway. The causeway steps <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the mound were originally a roofed, stone corridor. There are the foundations of the castle well on the west side of the causeway.|$|E
5|$|Barça's 2012–13 season {{yet again}} {{began with a}} Supercopa contention, this time another {{incarnation}} of El Clásico. Barcelona would win the first leg at home 3–2 with goals from Messi, Pedro and Xavi, but in the second leg, despite a wonderfully-struck free kick from Messi from 35 yards out, Barcelona would succumb 2–1 to their fiercest foes with goals from Ronaldo and Gonzalo Higuaín. In La Liga, Barcelona would shoot straight <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the league table with a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad. In the most-hyped {{game of the season}} so far, Barcelona and Real Madrid would play out what many regard as the best Clásico in recent memory, ending in a 2–2 draw at the Camp Nou with both Messi and Ronaldo netting twice for their respective clubs. Barça would also kick of their Copa del Rey defence with a 3–0 win over Alavés. In the Champions League on 7 November 2012, Barcelona would fall 2–1 to Celtic, with Messi grabbing his third Champions League goal of the 2012–13 season in the 90th minute in Glasgow. Barcelona were eliminated from Europe 0–7 on aggregate in the semi-finals against eventual champions Bayern Munich, the worst-ever aggregate loss in any European competition for the club.|$|E
5|$|Sarah takes Chuck {{on a date}} to {{find out}} what he knows. Sarah spots and quickly dispatches an NSA team {{following}} but flees with Chuck when she spots Casey. Sarah leads Chuck <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> floor of a skyscraper and attempts to call in an evacuation while Chuck explains what happened when he uploaded the Intersect. Sarah then aims her gun at Chuck when Casey arrives on the roof. Sarah warns Casey that Chuck uploaded the Intersect and tells Chuck that their mutual friend Bryce is dead. Chuck then flashes on the building where the visiting General Stanfield (Dale Dye) is giving an address and puts together all the pieces from the flashes he had been having: the stranger in the Large Mart is a demolitions expert and has set a bomb to destroy the conference. Chuck, Sarah, and Casey locate the bomb in the conference hall and Chuck defuses the bomb by deliberately infecting the machine with a computer virus.|$|E
50|$|Hip boots, or hip waders as {{they are}} {{sometimes}} called, are a type of tall boot initially designed to be worn by river fishermen. Hip boots are typically made out of rubber, and completely cover <b>the</b> legs, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> of <b>the</b> thighs or all <b>the</b> way <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> waist. Hip boots are designed <b>to</b> protect <b>the</b> fisherman from water, and allow wading out into deeper waters in hopes of getting a bigger catch. They also help <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> feet and legs warm in autumn and winter. Hip boots are also worn by many ecologists and environmental scientists who do tests in swamps or lakes <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> quality of water.|$|R

5|$|TNA {{held the}} first-ever Xscape match between Shocker, Michael Shane (who was {{accompanied}} Trinity), Sonjay Dutt, and Chris Sabin {{in the following}} bout. It lasted 15 minutes and 42 seconds. In this match, the four competitors fought until two were eliminated by pinfall or submission; the two remaining wrestlers then fought {{to escape from the}} cage, with the first to do so the winner. Dutt was the first wrestler eliminated after Shocker slammed him into the steel cage. After this elimination, Trinity climbed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the cage and performed a backflip off the top onto the three wrestlers below. Traci then entered the arena and forced Trinity to the backstage area. The second eliminated was Shane, after Sabin forced him back-first into the mat with his signature maneuver the Cradle Shock. Sabin and Shocker remained as they both fought to escape the cage, which Shocker did first to win the contest.|$|E
