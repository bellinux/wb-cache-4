5|$|The second Egyptian {{attempt was}} the last; the Port Said Sector did not launch another attack {{to capture the}} fort. Thus Budapest {{remained}} the only Israeli fortification of the Bar Lev Line to remain <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> control.

5|$|Bani Na'im was annexed by Jordan {{after the}} 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In June 1967, after the Six-Day War, the town came <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> rule. In 1982, an 18-year-old {{resident}} of the town {{was shot and killed}} by Jewish settlers from nearby Kiryat Arba. In 1987, during the First Intifada, a committee against the Israeli occupation was set up in Bani Na'im. In May 1988, two residents were killed by the Israeli Army (IDF) {{in the center of the}} town.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Western Wall came <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> control in 1967, a tefillin stand was erected with {{permission}} from Rabbi Yehuda Meir Getz, the first rabbi of the Kotel. The stand offers visitors the chance to put on Tefillin, a daily Jewish ritual. In the months following the Six-Day War an estimated 400,000 Jews observed this ritual at the stand. The stand is staffed by multilingual volunteers and an estimated 100,000 visitors put on tefillin there annually.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} special worship events {{have been held}} since the renovation. They have taken {{advantage}} of the cover, temperature control, and enhanced security. However, in addition to the more recent programs, one early event occurred in September 1983, even before the modern renovation. At that time U.S. Sixth Fleet Chaplain Rabbi Arnold Resnicoff was allowed to hold an unusual interfaith service—the first interfaith service ever conducted at the Wall during the time it was <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> control—that included men and women sitting together. The ten-minute service included the Priestly Blessing, recited by Resnicoff, who is a Kohen. A Ministry of Religions representative was present, responding to press queries that the service was authorized as part of a special welcome for the U.S. Sixth Fleet.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{was made for}} Christians to participate in Christmas ceremonies in Bethlehem. Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and did not have an Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E
5|$|During the {{periodic}} renovations undertaken, the various ruling dynasties of the Islamic Caliphate constructed {{additions to the}} mosque and its precincts, such as its dome, facade, its minbar, minarets and the interior structure. When the Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099, they used the mosque as a palace and the Dome of the Rock as a church, but its function as a mosque was restored after its recapture by Saladin in 1187. More renovations, repairs and additions were undertaken in the later centuries by the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, the Supreme Muslim Council, and Jordan. Today, the Old City is <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> control, but the mosque remains under {{the administration of the}} Jordanian/Palestinian-led Islamic Waqf.|$|E

5|$|On October 24, 1979, church {{president}} Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem {{to dedicate}} the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, {{located on the}} Mount of Olives. The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between {{the church and the}} Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984. The land the church wanted for the center, located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet, right next to the valley which separates it from Mount Scopus, had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.|$|E
5|$|Quneitra {{was founded}} in the Ottoman era as a way station on the caravan route to Damascus and {{subsequently}} became a garrison town of some 20,000 people. In 1946, it {{became part of the}} independent Syrian Republic within the Riff Dimashq Governorate and in 1964 became the capital of the split Quneitra Governorate. On 10 June 1967, {{the last day of the}} Six-Day War, Quneitra came <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> control. It was briefly recaptured by Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but Israel regained control in its subsequent counter-offensive. The city was almost completely destroyed before the Israeli withdrawal in June 1974. Syria had refused to rebuild the city and actively discouraged resettlement in the area. Israel was heavily criticized by the United Nations for the city's destruction, while Israel has also criticized Syria for not rebuilding Quneitra. During the Syrian civil war, Quneitra became a clash point between rebel forces and Syrian Arab Army. , it became controlled by the Syrian opposition.|$|E
5|$|The 139th Sa'iqa Group, {{having had}} its mission {{confirmed}} by GHQ, began moving southward from Ismailia at sunset. Both battalions advanced in columns, each pushing a company ahead as a vanguard. Col. Ibrahim sent four patrols ahead to reconnoitre, {{and only one}} returned; the rest were considered missing. As the Sa'iqa group moved south, they encountered groups of Egyptian paratroopers from the 81st and 89th Battalions, retreating northward <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> pressure. When the unit neared Ain Ghasin they were ambushed by an Israeli force. An intense firefight took place as the vanguard engaged the Israelis, after some of their transports had been hit. Soldiers disembarked their vehicles and took cover in nearby farms and orchards. The vehicles and transports were turned back with great difficulty, and the entire Sa'iqa group soon began to retreat to a position south of the village of Abu 'Atwa, itself roughly 3 kilometres south of Ismailia. Ibrahim called for artillery support, but the Israelis were jamming and interfering his radio net, and communicated with him in Arabic. This led to Israeli artillery fire falling on his forces instead. The Egyptians suffered few casualties though, due to {{the density of the}} mango trees, which minimized the hit radius of artillery rounds and provided cover from shrapnel.|$|E

5|$|Just {{north of}} the Lexicon-Tirtur {{junction}} was the village of al-Galaa. Prior to the 1967 Six Day War, the village had been {{the site of an}} agricultural project. This agricultural station incorporated several irrigation ditches and specialized Japanese-made machinery. When the Sinai came <b>under</b> <b>Israeli</b> occupation, Israeli soldiers unwittingly mistook the Japanese characters for Chinese ones, leading to the location being labeled 'Chinese Farm' on military maps. Just north and north-west of Chinese Farm was a hill mass known by its Israeli codename 'Missouri'. During Operation Badr, al-Galaa and the Chinese Farm fell within the designated bridgehead of the 16th Infantry Division. Abd el-Hamid's 16th Infantry Brigade occupied and defended these locations. After partaking in the initial canal-crossing, the brigade, {{along with the rest of}} the division, faced an attack by Raviv's brigade on October 9. The Israelis achieved some initial gains, but were repelled by the end of the day. Also located within 16th Division's bridgehead, as of October 13, was the 21st Armored Division. Its units were positioned in the center and the {{north of the}} bridgehead. The 14th Brigade had been involved in the crossing and, along with the 1st Brigade, participated in the Egyptian offensive on October 14; as a result, it had lost half of its operational tank strength. In the aftermath, Oraby's efforts to reorganize and replace armored losses were hampered by frequent artillery barrages and air strikes. On October 15, there were 136 tanks in the Egyptian bridgehead, unevenly split among Oraby's brigades: 66 with the 1st Armored Brigade, 39 with the 14th Armored Brigade, and 31 in the 18th Mechanized Brigade. Despite their heavy losses, the Egyptian forces in the bridgehead outnumbered Reshef's force.|$|E
