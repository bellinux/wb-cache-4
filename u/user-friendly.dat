5|$|The {{company was}} founded in January 2012 and {{operated}} in stealth mode until October 2013. It {{has received more than}} $10 million in venture funding. Analysts have praised Paxata for creating software that is <b>user-friendly</b> for non-technical business users, but caution that they are in a noisy marketplace.|$|E
5|$|Commenting on the gameplay, Famitsu {{noted that}} it was rather simple, but {{approved}} of the inclusion of Casual Mode and praised the content of each chapter for being just the right size. Moehnke praised the alterations made from the original version, such as not needing to dismount steeds when indoors, but also noted that some elements such as mechanics surrounding Marth showed the game's age. Nishioka generally enjoyed the gameplay experience, praising the inclusion of <b>user-friendly</b> options, but felt that these same new additions would divide fans.|$|E
5|$|Smartsheet {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the software was too difficult to use. At {{the end of its}} first year, it had only 10,000 users. The company began making changes to the software in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of making it more <b>user-friendly.</b> Following the 2010 launch of the redesign, adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012.|$|E
5|$|The V7 {{client is}} {{the seventh and}} latest {{generation}} of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems. It was released on March22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more <b>user-friendly</b> for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses Trac for managing its bug tickets so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.|$|E
5|$|The current {{building}} sits on {{reclaimed land}} first {{occupied by the}} Marine Parade Community Centre, which {{was built in the}} early 1980s and later renamed to Marine Parade Community Club. In March 1995, the People's Association (PA) announced plans to spend S$9.56 million to upgrade 54 community centres and clubs that were over ten years old, adding facilities such as lifts, dance studios, karaoke rooms and multi-purpose air-conditioned activities rooms, to make community centres more <b>user-friendly,</b> with open concept offices and reception areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles {{led him to}} make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was based on that of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more <b>user-friendly</b> interface.|$|E
5|$|The {{global market}} for {{brachytherapy}} reached US$680 million in 2013, {{of which the}} High-Dose Rate (HDR) and LDR segments accounted for 70%. Microspheres and electronic brachytherapy comprised the remaining 30%. One analysis predicts that the brachytherapy market may reach over US$2.4 billion in 2030, growing by 8% annually, mainly driven by the microspheres market as well as electronic brachytherapy, which is gaining significant interest worldwide as a <b>user-friendly</b> technology. The word brachy is Greek for short distance.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{substantially}} more reactive P(III) derivatives of nucleosides, 3'-O-chlorophosphites, were successfully {{used for the}} formation of internucleosidic linkages. This led to the discovery of the phosphite triester methodology. The group led by M. Caruthers took the advantage of less aggressive and more selective 1H-tetrazolidophosphites and implemented the method on solid phase. Very shortly after, the workers from the same group further improved the method by using more stable nucleoside phosphoramidites as building blocks. The use of 2-cyanoethyl phosphite-protecting group in place of a less <b>user-friendly</b> methyl group led to the nucleoside phosphoramidites currently used in oligonucleotide synthesis (see Phosphoramidite building blocks below). Many later improvements to the manufacturing of building blocks, oligonucleotide synthesizers, and synthetic protocols made the phosphoramidite chemistry a very reliable and expedient method of choice for the preparation of synthetic oligonucleotides.|$|E
5|$|Nights: Journey of Dreams {{was first}} conceptualised in November 2005 {{after the release}} of Sonic Team's Shadow the Hedgehog. Game design was {{primarily}} prepared by Takashi Iizuka and took around six months to reach the development process. Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next Nights game would stay faithful to the original, and felt the need to keep the game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new mechanics. Despite the cancellation of Air Nights, Iizuka stressed that he had always wanted to make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a Nights game—he felt that the industry was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and <b>user-friendly</b> design.|$|E
25|$|The Skytone Alpha-400 uses a {{customized}} version of Linux, {{based on a}} 2.4.x kernel, with a <b>user-friendly</b> interface optimized for children.|$|E
25|$|Perera {{has also}} turned a pioneer {{disability}} activist campaigning in Sri Lanka for enabling sports environments and <b>user-friendly</b> facilities.|$|E
25|$|The LIFE {{homepage}} {{also contains}} {{information on the}} LIFE III programme and projects, including a <b>user-friendly</b> database of all LIFE projects funded since 1992.|$|E
25|$|Of course, this {{algorithm}} is not useful for actual multiplication. This {{algorithm is}} just a <b>user-friendly</b> way {{to see what the}} result looks like.|$|E
25|$|Fedora Workstation – It targets {{users who}} want a reliable, <b>user-friendly,</b> and {{powerful}} operating system for their laptop or desktop computer. It comes with GNOME by default but other desktops can be installed or can be directly installed as Spins.|$|E
25|$|GS-98 (1997) – Incorporated a new {{consolidated}} {{electronic system}} {{that uses a}} two control box system {{to reduce the number}} of printed circuit boards needed to operate the pinsetter. Also, software and hardware improvements to make the pinsetter more efficient and <b>user-friendly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Consumer use of {{magnetic}} tape machines only {{took off in}} the early 1960s, after playback machines reached a comfortable, <b>user-friendly</b> design. This was achieved primarily {{by the introduction of}} transistors which replaced the bulky, fragile, and costly vacuum tubes of earlier designs. Reel-to-reel tape then became more suitable to household use, but still remained an esoteric product.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{informed}} consent forms for research studies now {{are required to}} include extensive detail on how the participant's protected health information will be kept private. While such information is important, {{the addition of a}} lengthy, legalistic section on privacy may make these already complex documents even less <b>user-friendly</b> for patients who are asked to read and sign them.|$|E
25|$|In December 2015, The Tor Project {{announced}} that it had hired Shari Steele as its new executive director. Steele had previously led the Electronic Frontier Foundation for 15 years, and in 2004 spearheaded EFF's decision to fund Tor's early development. One of her key stated aims is to make Tor more <b>user-friendly</b> {{in order to bring}} wider access to anonymous web browsing.|$|E
25|$|Yentha.com (part of Yentha Digital Network Pvt. Ltd.) is the {{foremost}} city portal in Kerala. A combination of editorial, business listing, user generated content, and <b>user-friendly</b> sections like events, movies, classifieds and jobs have made Yentha.com {{the most popular}} portal for cities in Kerala. It is currently in two leading cities, Trivandrum and Kochi, and is planning to be in Calicut. Yentha.com commenced operations in June 2010.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, Apple {{released}} a television commercial which introduced the Apple Macintosh during the telecast of Super Bowl XVIII by CBS, with allusions to George Orwell's noted novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four. The {{goal of the}} commercial was to make people think about computers, identifying the <b>user-friendly</b> interface as a personal computer which departed from prior business-oriented systems, and becoming a signature representation of Apple products.|$|E
25|$|Having {{been used}} by many students, {{teachers}} and researchers {{for more than two}} decades, ILWIS {{is one of the most}} <b>user-friendly</b> integrated vector and raster software programmes currently available. ILWIS has some very powerful raster analysis modules, a high-precision and flexible vector and point digitizing module, a variety of very practical tools, as well as a great variety of user guides and training modules all available for downloading. The current version is ILWIS 3.8.1.|$|E
25|$|By late October 2009, new {{features}} {{were incorporated into}} the emulator such as automatic frame-skipping, which increased {{the performance of the}} emulator as well as increased stability of the emulator overall. Also improved was the NetPlay feature of the emulator, which allowed players to play multiplayer GameCube and Wii games online with friends, as long as the game does not require a Wii remote. The GUI was reworked to make it more <b>user-friendly.</b> The DirectX plug-in also received further work.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{invention}} of the Urdu typewriter in 1911, Urdu newspapers continued to publish prints of handwritten scripts by calligraphers known as katibs or khush-navees until the late 1980s. The Pakistani national newspaper Daily Jang was the first Urdu newspaper to use Nastaʿlīq computer-based composition. There are efforts under way to develop more sophisticated and <b>user-friendly</b> Urdu support on computers and the internet. Nowadays, nearly all Urdu newspapers, magazines, journals, and periodicals are composed on computers with Urdu software programs.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Jacob's Pillow {{launched}} Jacob's Pillow Dance Interactive, {{an online}} resource of video clips curated from the Archives in Becket. The archive features performances {{that have taken}} place at the festival from 1937 to 2010, including footage rarely seen. This <b>user-friendly</b> free resource allows the user to browse dance footage by artist, genre, and era. The director of preservation, Norton Owen, curates the collection. Each entry includes a video clip, an informative paragraph describing the dancer/choreographer, and an artist portrait.|$|E
25|$|The quality {{gap between}} locally {{manufactured}} guns and European arms continued to widen as new rapid {{advances in technology}} and mass production in Europe quickly outstripped the pace of developments in Asia. Important developments were {{the invention of the}} flintlock musket and mass production of cast-iron cannon in Europe. The flintlock was much faster, more reliable and more <b>user-friendly</b> than the unwieldy matchlock, which required one hand to hold the barrel, and another to adjust the match and pull the trigger.|$|E
25|$|As Lisa Jardine relates in {{her account}} of the {{assassination}} of William the Silent of the Netherlands, in 1584, the small size, ease of concealment and <b>user-friendly</b> loading aspect of the wheellock, compared to more arduous hand-held weapons, meant that it was used for curtailing the lives of public figures, such as Francis, Duke of Guise and William himself. Jardine also argues that a stray wheellock pistol shot may {{have been responsible for}} the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of French Huguenots in 1572.|$|E
25|$|Revision {{numbers are}} {{difficult}} to remember in any version-control system. For this reason, most systems offer symbolic tags as <b>user-friendly</b> references to them. Subversion does not have such a feature and what its documentation recommends to use instead is very different in nature. Instead of implementing tags as references to points in history, Subversion recommends making snapshot copies into a well-known subdirectory ("tags/") {{in the space of}} the repository tree. Only a few predefined references are available: HEAD, BASE, PREV and COMMITTED.|$|E
25|$|To {{the first}} end, it {{recommends}} making the village's government more <b>user-friendly</b> for existing and prospective businesses, addressing the 18% vacancy rate reported in 2007. The Village Board and Planning Board should both {{be able to}} provide more information and reach out to local and regional business organizations. The zoning process could be improved, since many existing businesses downtown are on conditional uses, and site plan approvals should have a time limit, forcing owners to begin development. A Main Street Manager could be appointed to concentrate on downtown, and a business improvement district created.|$|E
25|$|The online {{multiplayer}} had {{an integrated}} friends system which allowed players {{to add one}} another without becoming friends on the PSN. The online friends list showed a player's friend to be either In Lobby, staging or in-game. From here players could Invite to Game, Invite to Party or Send a Message. This in game system allowed for <b>user-friendly</b> interaction between friends and bypassed the need for players to exit the game to talk to friends; a feature that was absent from most other PS3 titles, until system firmware 2.40 was released.|$|E
25|$|Phyre and Phyre2 (Protein Homology/AnalogY Recognition Engine; {{pronounced}} as 'fire') are web-based {{services for}} protein structure prediction that are free for non-commercial use. Phyre {{is among the}} most popular methods for protein structure prediction having been cited over 1500 times. Like other remote homology recognition techniques (see protein threading), it is able to regularly generate reliable protein models when other widely used methods such as PSI-BLAST cannot. Phyre2 has been designed (funded by the BBSRC) to ensure a <b>user-friendly</b> interface for users inexpert in protein structure prediction methods.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, a {{study by}} the USAF's Scientific Advisory Board {{identified}} several improvements for operating the Reaper in contested airspace; adding readily available sensors, weapons, and threat detection and countermeasures could increase situational awareness and enable riskier deployments. Suggestions included a radar warning receiver (RWR) to know when it's being targeted, air-to-air and miniature air-to-ground weapons, manned-unmanned teaming, multi-UAV control, automatic take-offs and landings, and precision navigation and timing systems to fly in GPS-denied areas. Another idea was redesigned ground control stations with <b>user-friendly</b> video game-like controllers and touchscreen maps to access data without overwhelming operators.|$|E
25|$|Michael Bloomberg's 1997 {{autobiography}} {{contains a}} chapter entitled Computers for Virgins, which explains {{the differences in}} the design of the terminal and its keyboard from the standard IBM PC keyboard layout that was popular at that time. The terminal's keyboard layout was designed for traders and market makers who had no prior computer experience. While the look and feel of the Bloomberg keyboard is very similar to the standard computer keyboard, there are several enhancements that help users navigate through the system, from the idea for a <b>user-friendly</b> system when originally designed in the early 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Minister of Trade and Industry Trond Giske took {{initiative}} in June 2010 {{to investigate a}} merger of the Norwegian Ship Registers and the Norwegian Maritime Authority. An internal ministry committee concluded on 1 November that a merger would be favorable. It cited that a common organization would be more uniform, <b>user-friendly</b> and competitive, allowing shipping companies to relate to a single organization. The handling of the registers would remain in Bergen, despite the Maritime Authority being based in Haugesund. The merger took effect on 1 January 2012. At the time there were eighteen employees in the agency.|$|E
25|$|Sixty-three high- and medium- power {{transmitters}} from Thomson's GreenPower range {{have been}} ordered together with installation and commissioning services, in a deal which follows on from the company's earlier deployment of DVB-T multiplexes over thirty transmission and sixty-two repeater sites. Equipped with dualcast-ready digital exciters, the GreenPower range offers the ability to smoothly migrate from DVB-T to DVB-T2 and to easily offer additional HDTV content. Ranging from low- to high- power, the range covers all the power requirements of The Second Authority. Thomson will also deploy its <b>user-friendly</b> centralized Network Management System to control and monitor the overall transmission system from a single facility.|$|E
25|$|GS-X (1999) – Incorporated {{a setting}} table and ball {{accelerator}} redesign that reduced {{the amount of}} parts, the number of adjustments, {{and the amount of}} preventive maintenance required. In 2000 the GS-X consolidated electronics was replaced with a single box electrical system called the NexGen Controller. This change reduced the overall size, weight, and number of electrical components needed to operate the pinsetters and made the setup for the machine more <b>user-friendly.</b> An additional modification lowered the overall profile of the pinsetter, allowing it to be installed in centers with low ceilings and reducing the number of parts and adjustments and the amount of preventative maintenance required.|$|E
25|$|Ridership {{has been}} rising, and <b>user-friendly</b> {{features}} {{that have grown}} up through custom and practice help this. For instance, passengers open the doors by pressing a green strip on the central pole (in PCC trams) or an illuminated button (on Flexity trams), and drivers usually {{make a point of}} waiting for latecomers. However, overcrowding at rush hours and at weekend is common. The rate of detected fare-dodging is 4.15%, despite periodic enforcement campaigns, and this is being addressed by the installation of ticket barriers in all metro stations. From 2013, the obligation to check out of as well as into the system is being progressively introduced.|$|E
