40|$|Explicit {{contracts}} are used most frequently by theorists to model many relationships, ranging from labor markets to investment projects. Experimental evidence has accumulated recently highlighting {{the limitations of}} formal and explicit contracts in certain situations, and has documented environments in which informal and implicit {{contracts are}} more efficient. This paper compares the performance of explicit and implicit contracts in a new partnership environment in which both contracting parties must incur effort to generate a joint surplus, and one (“strong”) agent controls the surplus division. In the treatment in which the strong agent makes a non-binding “bonus ” offer to the weak agent, this <b>unenforceable</b> <b>promise</b> doubles the rate of joint high effort compared to a baseline with no promise. The strong agents most frequently offered a bonus to split the gains of the high effort equally, but actually delivered this bonus amount only about one-quarter of the time. An explicit and enforceable contract offer performs substantially better, raising {{the rate of the}} most efficient outcome by over 200 percent relative to the baseline. Interestingly, the initial bonus offer helped agents to coordinate their effort choices...|$|E
50|$|The {{agreement}} to use P3P not only puts in place <b>unenforceable</b> <b>promises,</b> {{but it also}} prolongs the adoption of federal laws that would actually inhibit the access and ability to use private information. If the government were {{to step in and}} attempt to protect Internet users with federal laws on what information can be accessed, and specific regulations on how user information can be used, companies wouldn’t maintain the leeway they do now to use information as they please, despite what they may actually tell users. In 2002, then EPIC employee Chris Hoofnagle argued that P3P was displacing chances for government regulation of privacy.|$|R
40|$|Proposing marriage, {{an eager}} suitor might promise a {{lifetime}} of devoted service to the whims f his beloved. But a sensible young woman, even if she hasn't studied game theory, {{is likely to be}} skeptical. She is more likely to base her expectations about marriage on what she knows of the way her mother and other married female acquaintances have fared, than on her suitor's flattering, but <b>unenforceable</b> <b>promises.</b> At the time of a marriage, property transfers could be arranged between the family of the bride and the family of the groom, but it is simply not possible to write a premarital contract that legally binds the new couple to detailed courses of action over the course of their marriage. Most of the important decisions that they make will have to be resolved as they arise, after marriage. A theory of courtship and mating that deals satisfactorily with each individual's prospects in a marriage, must include postmarital bargaining between spouses. Conversely, since a person's bargaining power within a marriage may depend on the threat of exercising the "outside options" of divorcing and reentering the marriage market, a satisfactory theory of bargaining within marriage must include a theory of courtship and mating...|$|R
5000|$|Colonias {{began in}} the state of Texas in the 1950s and 1960s as an {{informal}} housing solution for low-income predominantly Hispanic wage earners through a model referred to by scholars as the [...] "incremental approach." [...] Due to the rise of the maquiladora industry in 1965, the border population quickly grew and created a housing shortage for these workers. The overlap of four variables attributed to the development of colonias: high demand from a population of low-income wage earners meeting a low supply of affordable housing, a supply of low-cost and fruitless land, the absence of regulations on the subdivision of that land, and a legal way for that land to be sold to individuals. Land developers recognized the high demand and dire need of affordable housing and began purchasing this land in peri-urban areas where strict enforcement of housing and environmental laws was either nonexistent or weak. Subsequently, these developers as well as hired realtors would section off the area and sell sections to individual buyers via contracts for deed; these deals, which sold unimproved lots, included undocumented and thus <b>unenforceable</b> <b>promises</b> to soon provide basic provisions such as water, sewage, and electricity. Because these deals lack a foreclosure period or buyer's protection, this allows sellers to repossess and resell lots, as well as keep all payments the buyer had made until the buyer paid the property off in full and subsequently received the title. As more dwellings and minimal infrastructure made an appearance, the initial cost of the land decreased. As such, colonias became an affordable and viable living option to low-income families on the U.S.-Mexico border.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{social and}} {{political}} developments in the EU have clearly shown the profound structural changes in European society and its politics. Reflecting on these developments and responding to the existing body of academic literature and scholarship, this book critically discusses the emerging notion of European constitutionalism, its varieties and different contextualization in theories of EU law, general jurisprudence, sociology of law, political theory and sociology. The contributors address different problems related {{to the relationship between}} the constitutional state and non-state constitutionalizations and critically analyze general theories of constitutional monism, dualism and pluralism and their juridical and political uses in the context of EU constitutionalism. Individual chapters emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary and socio-legal methods in the current research of EU constitutionalism and their potential to re-conceptualize and re-think traditional problems of constitutional subjects, limitation and separation of power, political symbolism and identity politics in Europe. This collection simultaneously describes the EU and its self-constitution as one polity, differentiated society and shared community and its contributors conceptualize the sense of common identity and solidarity {{in the context of the}} post-sovereign multitude of European society. Contents: Introduction: on Europe’s crises and self-constitutions. Part I The European Self-Constitution - Concepts and Theories: The European Constitution and the pouvoir constituent - no longer, or never, sui generis?, Chris Thornhill; The concept of self-limiting polity in EU constitutionalism: a systems theoretical outline, Jiří Přibáň; A political-sociological analysis of constitutional pluralism in Europe, Paul Blokker.

40|$|In their 1959 {{proposal}} {{to build a}} new international legal order founded upon principles of human dignity, Professors Myres McDougal and Harold Lasswell admonished international legal scholars to continuously reappraise the suitability and necessity of existing international legal institutions, taking due notice of the 2 ̆ 2 myths 2 ̆ 2 on which current arrangements are based and justified. 2 ̆ 7 The aim of this Article is to take McDougal and Lasswell 2 ̆ 7 s admonition seriously in analyzing one of the persistent myths that serves to explain and to justify bilateral investment treaties (2 ̆ 2 BIT 2 ̆ 2 s) that form the backbone of the modern system of international investment law. The author’s aim is simply to establish that developing countries enjoy significant flexibility to exit the BIT system-if they {{come to the conclusion that}} BITs are, on net, undesirable-without harming their ability to make binding commitments to investors on a case-by-case basis through investment contracts, supported by international arbitration. In Part I, the author first briefly describes the modern BIT regime. The author then summarize and discuss the most important extant theoretical study of BITs and the source of the myth challenged here. Part II presents the mythic account of BITs. Part III analyzes the extensive jurisprudence of international arbitral tribunals in the pre-BIT era, which the author defines as the period prior to the 1990 s. This jurisprudence demonstrates that international tribunals reliably expressed support in the abstract for the principle of pacta sunt servanda, and that they reliably awarded investors meaningful compensation for violations of the principle. Part IV discusses why the permanent sovereignty movement failed to make state <b>promises</b> <b>unenforceable.</b> Part V summarizes the Article 2 ̆ 7 s main points and responds to four potential objections. Part VI concludes...|$|R
