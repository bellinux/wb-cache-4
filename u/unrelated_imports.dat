Its impact on donors exports usually {{depends on whether}} it is given for altruistic reasons (to {{overcome}} human tragedies and disasters) or in an understanding to promote development (to finance infrastructure or social projects). As to humanitarian aid the impact of aid on donors exports will be most probably lower than {{in the latter case}} where related and <b>unrelated</b> <b>imports</b> for realizing development projects have been explicitly or implicitly agreed upon. Germany is known to be a country that ranks below average in tying its aid among the EU countries. Nonetheless there have been studies that found an extremely high positive impact of German bilateral aid on German exports. This finding will be re-examined in this study. An augmented gravity model is utilized to evaluate the impact of German bilateral aid on German exports. Stochastic and deterministic trends in the series are controlled to avoid spurious regression results.

40|$|AbstractMost organisms {{contain a}} single Rieske/cytb complex. This enzyme can be {{integrated}} in any respiratory or photosynthetic electron transfer chain that is quinone-based and sufficiently energy rich {{to allow for the}} turnover of three enzymes â€” a quinol reductase, a Rieske/cytb complex and a terminal oxidase. Despite this universal usability of the enzyme a variety of phylogenetically distant organisms have multiple copies thereof and no reason for this redundancy is obvious. In this review we present an overview of the distribution of multiple copies among species and describe their properties from the scarce experimental results, analysis of their amino acid sequences and genomic context. We discuss the predicted redox properties of the Rieske cluster in relation {{to the nature of the}} pool quinone. It appears that acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria specialized one of their two copies for reverse electron transfer, archaeal Thermoprotei adapted their three copies to the interaction with different oxidases and several, phylogenetically <b>unrelated</b> species <b>imported</b> a second complex with a putative heme ci that may confer some yet to be determined properties to the complex. These hypothesis and all the more the so far completely unexplained cases call for further studies and we put forward a number of suggestions for future research that we hope to be stimulating for the field.

By reconstructing what would be the archetype of sixteen surviving Anglo-Latin manuscript copies of De proprietatibus rerum, one may begin to judge two hypotheses: that they form a coherent textual tradition and that John Trevisa used a representative of this Anglo-Latin tradition when making his translation, finished in 1398. Conclusions for the last half of Book XIX differ from those for Book X by Susan Clinton and those for the whole through a quick survey by M. C. Seymour. A wider view of the transmission and of historical realities reveals that these differences can be explained easily: the text is greatly complicated through prolific copying in the university pecia system and the Anglo-Latin tradition results from several <b>unrelated</b> manuscripts <b>imported</b> from the continent. The evidence for this portion of the text shows that a coherent Anglo-Latin tradition is restricted to eight manuscripts (JLNSTUVY) and that Trevisa did not use a manuscript related to these. The close relationship of the other manuscripts (the groups PQR and WX and the individuals I and O) to manuscripts originating in continental Europe is examined briefly, Bartholomew's sources are used only where necessary, and Trevisa's translation is studied only for its textual relationships, not for its style or manner. Clearly, future work on Trevisa should not ignore continental manuscripts and an edition of Bartholomew must include them...|$|R
40|$|Western Australia (WA) {{has been}} able to prevent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains from outside of the state from {{becoming}} established in its hospitals. Recently, a single-strain outbreak of MRSA occurred in a WA metropolitan teaching hospital following admission of an infected patient from a remote community. The strain responsible for the outbreak was <b>unrelated</b> to any <b>imported</b> strains and spread rapidly in the hospital. Screening of two remote communities in the region from which the index case came revealed that 42 % of the people in one community and 24 % in the other carried MRSA. Isolates were typed by resistance pattern, plasmid analysis, contour-clamped homogeneous electric field electrophoresis, bacteriophage pattern, and coagulase gene restriction fragment length polymorphism. It was found that of the people carrying MRSA, 39 % in the former community and 17 % in the latter community were carrying an MRSA strain which was indistinguishable from the strain that caused the hospital outbreak...|$|R
40|$|The Jersey is a {{ubiquitous}} {{and successful}} breed of cattle that originates from the UK Channel Island of Jersey. While the breed has been exported extensively, no imports {{have taken place}} to the island since 1789, leading to a concern regarding possible losses of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding. We have conducted the first large-scale genetic analysis of the Jersey cattle using only samples from the island. A total of 223 cattle from all parishes except one were genotyped for 12 microsatellite loci. The average number of alleles per locus and expected heterozygosity {{were found to be}} comparatively high (nA= 4, He= 0. 64) with respect to that observed in a number of continental breeds. Only breeds that have been upgraded and are therefore the result of admixture are clearly more variable than the Jersey. We also found a significant but limited amount of genetic differentiation between parishes (Fst= 0. 013), or even between farms (Fst= 0. 035) despite an apparent lack of movement. This is confirmed by the application of two recent statistical methods. A Bayesian partition analysis shows that the most probable value of K, the number of possible hidden partitions, is 1 (P 0. 98). K= 2 has a much lower probability (P 0. 02) while other values are essentially zero. Similarly, we were able to show that there was no support for departure from panmixia other than due to population structure, and thus that there is sufficient background gene flow across the island to overcome local drift. Overall, it appears that the current level of genetic diversity and its distribution within the island means it is unnecessary to <b>import</b> <b>unrelated</b> genetic material to the island for management purposes...|$|R
