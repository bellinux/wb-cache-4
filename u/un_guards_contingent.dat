50|$|The Adjutant General campaign, {{the only}} one {{of its kind in the}} nation, was {{interesting}} not only for its novelty but also because of the entrance of an Iraq War veteran as a Democratic challenger to the incumbent, Stan Spears, a former businessman. The Democrat, Glenn Lindmann, was critical of the decreasing size of the state's national <b>guard</b> <b>contingent</b> over Spears' time in office, and also wanted to make the position an appointed one instead of an elected one. Spears countered that the size decrease is due to a national policy decision, not a state one, and said the position should remain elected. Spears won re-election.|$|R

In 2007, Carney returned to Iraq from February until June to serve as Coordinator for Economic Transition and was again with the State Department as Head of the Interagency Election Support Team in Kabul from March until November 2009. Throughout his long foreign service career, Carney advocated a policy of [...] "constructive engagement" [...] with rogue countries, often against policy prescriptions formulated by White House advisers in the administrations for whom he worked. Viewed {{as something of a}} maverick diplomat, he was often at odds with senior national security officials as well as political appointees {{on both sides of the}} aisle in Washington.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ship was}} requisitioned {{for use as}} a {{military}} transport in February 1941. She made a few voyages, including one transferring roughly 1,200 American prisoners of war from Wake Island to Japan in January 1942. The ship departed on 12 January, arriving in Yokohama six days later. After unloading 20 men there, she departed for China. En route, the Japanese commander of the <b>guard</b> <b>contingent,</b> Lieutenant Toshio Sato, picked five men at random and ordered them topside. There they were ordered to kneel and he told them in Japanese: [...] "You have killed many Japanese soldiers in battle. For what you have done you are now going to be killed … as representatives of American soldiers." [...] The Japanese then beheaded them. The bodies were used for bayonet practice and then thrown overboard.|$|R
50|$|President Kasa-Vubu began {{fearing a}} Lumumbist coup d'état would take place. On {{the evening of}} 5 September, Kasa-Vubu {{announced}} over radio that he had dismissed Lumumba and six of his ministers from {{the government for the}} massacres in South Kasai and for involving the Soviets in the Congo. Upon hearing the broadcast, Lumumba {{made his way to the}} national radio station, which was under <b>UN</b> <b>guard.</b> Though they had been ordered to bar Lumumba's entry, the UN troops allowed the prime minister in, as they had no specific instructions to use force against him. Lumumba denounced his dismissal over the radio as illegitimate, and in turn labeled Kasa-Vubu a traitor and declared him deposed.|$|R
2500|$|On 6 February 1922 the Cheka was {{replaced}} by the State Political Administration or OGPU, a section of the NKVD. The declared function of the NKVD was to protect the state security of the Soviet Union, which was accomplished by the large scale political persecution of [...] "class enemies". The Red Army often gave support to the NKVD in the implementation of political repressions. As an internal security force and a prison <b>guard</b> <b>contingent</b> of the Gulag, the Internal Troops repressed political dissidents and engaged in war crimes during periods of military hostilities throughout Soviet history. They were specifically responsible for maintaining the political regime in the Gulag and conducting mass deportations and forced resettlement. The latter targeted a number of ethnic groups that the Soviet authorities presumed to be hostile to its policies and likely to collaborate with the enemy, including Chechens, Crimean Tatars, and Koreans.|$|R
50|$|They {{go to the}} Wailing Wall to {{meet the}} two witnesses.

During the broadcast, Nicolae cuts the feed right in the middle of the Ben-Judah/Two Witnesses confrontation. Buck then learns that the broadcast got cut and Ben-Judah ran off. Ivy comes to the church to give Chloe some food, and witnesses Chloe ministering to a severely burned fireman who then passes away. Ivy hugs Chloe, and states that the fireman was at peace. Chloe remarks that he found God.|$|R
5000|$|Between 1038 and 1040, he {{and other}} Normans fought in Sicily along with the Lombards as mercenaries for the Byzantine Empire against the Saracens. It was there that he won his {{nickname}} [...] "Iron Arm" [...] by single-handedly killing the emir of Syracuse during a sally at the siege of Syracuse. When the Byzantine general George Maniakes publicly humiliated the Salernitan leader, Arduin, the Lombards withdrew from the campaign, along with the Normans and the Varangian <b>Guard</b> <b>contingent.</b> After Maniakes was recalled to Constantinople, the new catapan of Italy, Michael Doukeianos, appointed Arduin the ruler of Melfi. Melfi, however, soon joined other Apulian Lombards in a revolt against Byzantine rule, {{in which they were}} supported by William and the Normans. The Byzantines, however, managed to buy off the nominal leaders of the revolt - first Atenulf, brother of Pandulf III of Benevento, and then Argyrus. In September 1042, the Normans elected their own leader, ignoring Arduin. The revolt, originally Lombard, had become Norman in character and leadership.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} recorded {{instance of}} {{a force of}} guards for the executive residence was during the government of Manuel Bulnes in 1851. The Carabineros became responsible for defense of La Moneda in 1932 and the <b>guard</b> <b>contingent</b> at the palace assumed its current name, the Palace Guard, in 1996. In addition to public duties, the Palace Guard also has practical security responsibilities {{for the defense of}} La Moneda. In 2016 Carabineros assigned to the Palace Guard physically ejected a group of student protesters who stormed the courtyard of the palace before its gates could be sealed. During the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, a 300-man force of the then-named Presidential Guard, and other carabineros, fortified the perimeter of La Moneda against the Chilean Army. They remained at their posts until 9:00 a.m. the day of the putsch, withdrawing after being informed that Gen. César Mendoza had thrown his support to the newly-declared junta.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>UN</b> {{security}} <b>guards</b> responded {{and fired}} pistols at the attackers, while 25 {{of the guests}} escaped {{out the back of}} the house. One <b>UN</b> security <b>guard,</b> an American from Miami named Louis Maxwell, climbed to the roof of the building to fire at the attackers. Maxwell and the other security guard, Laurance Mefful from Ghana, were able to prevent the attackers from entering the building for almost one hour. Maxwell and Mefful were then reportedly killed by the attackers, although later reports suggest Maxwell was wounded but survived the confrontation, only to be executed by Afghan policemen responding to the attack. The attackers then apparently approached the building. Two of the attackers were killed by gunfire from unknown sources and the third detonated a suicide vest, killing himself and at least two guests who had not evacuated the building.|$|R
50|$|The Gulf of Corona is an {{extension}} of the Mirianic Ocean. Invaders from the Julianthes typically attack throughout the gulf's coastal region.

50|$|The U.S. Mission to Berlin {{was housed}} in a {{building}} {{that was part of}} a series of structures that formed the former headquarters of the Luftwaffe for Berlin defense during the Nazi years. This complex became the headquarters of the Berlin Brigade, part of the United States Army Berlin command in Berlin during the Cold War years. On the end of some of these buildings were Nazi ornamentations. The purely Nazi symbols were removed, but large cement eagles can still be seen at the corners of some of the buildings (including the one to be used by U.S. Mission Berlin) minus the swastikas that used to be below their feet. The complex had numerous buildings, several of which were quite large. One of these had one portion of one its wings serve as the U.S. State Department's Consular functions. Unique to Berlin at that time, U.S. Army Military Police served as guards to this U.S. State Department facility, instead of the normal Marine Security <b>Guard</b> <b>contingent</b> at all other U.S. Embassies. The presence of U.S. Marines at the Mission might have been seen as a movement towards establishing a full-fledged Embassy, which the U.S. was careful to avoid.|$|R
