40|$|In {{the seventies}} and eighties, the {{environmental}} and health risks of the application of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) have been discerned, resulting in a restriction {{of the use of}} PCBs in most western countries. Several PCB substitutes, such as <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> - a technical mixture of dichlorobenzyldichlorotoluenes (DBDTs) - with comparable physical and chemical properties, became commercially available for use in hydraulic systems. <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> has been detected in sediments of rivers in mining areas in Germany and in fish in the boundary-crossing river Rur in the Netherlands. The production, import and use of <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> is forbidden in the Netherlands. To control waste oil import and processing, it was requested to develop a method for the analysis of <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> in waste mineral oils. The method development was based on an extension and combination of known procedures for comparable components and matrices, e. g. the analysis of PCBs in oil. The column chromatography consists of several clean-up steps and specific analysis was performed with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Besides a time consuming clean-up procedure, an accurate and adequate method is developed for the analysis of <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> in waste oils with a limit of determination of 0, 25 mg/kg of waste oil. In 1990 and 1993 oil samples were collected by several producers in the Netherlands, to control the occurrence of <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> in Dutch waste oil. From 74 samples, only one sample was positive, containing 5. 7 mg <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> /kg oil. On the other hand, during an inspection inquiry two samples with high concentrations were found of 45 and 116 g (!) <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> /kg of oil. Concluding, there is no big import or processing of waste oil contaminated with <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> in the Netherlands, but incidentally contaminations can occur...|$|E
40|$|Questions {{about the}} health risk of {{consumption}} of eel from the river Rur for anglers, were the reason for {{an investigation into the}} occurrence of PCBs, dioxins and <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> in this eel. Methods developed at the Laboratory of Organic-analytical Chemistry have been used for the analysis of <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141,</b> planar, mono-ortho and indicator PCBs and dioxins. Preliminary treatment of the samples was combined for the different kind of analytes. The different kind of analytes were found varying from pg/g fat till ug/g fat. Planar PCBs were found at a level of 0. 2 - 0. 8 ng/g of fat. Dioxins were found at a level of 0. 1 - 12 pg/g of fat. Mono-ortho, indicator PCBs and <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> were found at a level of 0. 1 - 1. 2 ug/g of fat. The total amount of the different components, expressed in 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD equivalents, is mainly determined by the contribution of the planar and mono-ortho PCBs. PCB 126 gives the greatest contribution to the total toxicity, due to the high TEQ value of 0. 1, in combination with the concentration level. <b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> and the dioxins contribute of 4 % each in the total toxicity. A decreasing trend in the levels was found for all components in eel from the river Rur, determined in this investigation. Levels in eel from the Rur were higher than the levels found in other Dutch surface waters...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ugilec</b> <b>141</b> is a {{technical}} mixture of tetrachlorobenzyltoluenes (TCBTs). It {{was introduced in}} the early 1980 s as a replacement for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Based on physicochemical properties and accumulation in the environment, the use of this mixture was prohibited. To gain more insight in the toxicokinetics of these compounds in mammals, rats were exposed to a single iv bolus injection of a mixture of 3 TCBTs. At different time points after dosing, the tissue and blood concentrations of the TCBTs were determined. The adipose tissue is the main storage compart-ment, followed by skin and muscle. The TCBTs were rapidly eliminated from the liver and the blood, with half lives ranging from 65 to 72 h. Additionally, the tissue concentration data for all 3 TCBTs were analyzed using a physiologically based pharmaco-kinetic (PB-PK) model. Sensitivity analysis illustrated that the elimination of the TCBTs was not influenced by metabolism only...|$|E
