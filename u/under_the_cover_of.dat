5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck on 4 April 1945. On the night of 7/8 April they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese, catching them by surprise.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} from early to mid-April in Britain and Ireland, from mid-May in {{southern}} Scandinavia, and from June in the north. The nest is always {{close to the}} shore, in a cliff crevice or hole, or <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> vegetation. It is constructed by the female from seaweed and dead grass, and lined with finer fibres or hair.|$|E
5|$|The 21st did {{not reach}} the stone wall on Marye's Heights but took shelter in a very slight {{depression}} in the terrain, remaining pinned in that position until night. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness, the regiment retired, only to be ordered to the same spot the next morning, expecting a Confederate counterattack which never came. The regiment lost {{a third of its}} numbers at Frederickburg.|$|E
60|$|William Philander's {{trials for}} that night {{were not yet}} at an end. On the march to the camp some of the cadets had picked up a number of burrs of fair size.

5|$|At Nhu's request, Tung was {{reported}} to have been planning an operation <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> a government-organised student demonstration outside the US Embassy, Saigon. In this plan, Tung's men would assassinate ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr. and other key officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader Thích Trí Quang, who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According to the plan, Tung's men would then burn down the embassy.|$|E
5|$|Each side's {{front line}} was {{constantly}} under observation by snipers and lookouts during daylight; movement was therefore restricted {{until after the}} dusk stand-to and night had fallen. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness, troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply, with rations and water being brought to the front line, fresh units swapped places with troops moving to the rear for rest and recuperation. Trench raiding was also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications, while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew the barbed wire in no man's land. An hour before dawn, everyone would stand-to once more.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army {{defeated}} Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly {{created an}} alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly {{what they wanted to}} hear, and they cloaked themselves <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> Chinese nationalism.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bed warmer}} {{was a common}} {{household}} item in countries with cold winters, especially in Europe. It consisted of a metal container, usually fitted with a handle and shaped somewhat like a modern frying pan, with a solid or finely perforated lid. The pan would be filled with hot coals and placed <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>covers</b> <b>of</b> a bed, to warm it up and/or dry it out before use.|$|R

5|$|In September and October 1945 Europeans and pro-Dutch Eurasians were {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} Indonesian mobs. Ferocious fighting erupted when 6,000 British Indian troops landed in the city. Sukarno and Hatta negotiated a ceasefire between the Republicans and the British forces led by Brigadier Mallaby. Following the killing of Mallaby on 30 October, the British sent more troops into the city from 10 November <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> air attacks. Although the European forces largely captured the city in three days, the poorly armed Republicans fought on until 29 November and thousands died as the population fled to the countryside.|$|E
5|$|In early July the 2/31st {{commenced}} {{operations to}} the north of Jezzine with the aim of securing the high ground around Amatour and Badarane. On the night of 9/10 July they advanced up steep terrain <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> a heavy artillery barrage. During the fighting that followed, one of the battalion's members, Private James Gordon, performed the deeds for which he subsequently received the Victoria Cross, crawling forward and single-handedly attacking a French post that was holding up his company's advance.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December, von Frank {{informed}} Potiorek that {{he considered}} it impossible for Austro-Hungarian forces to remain in Belgrade for much longer. As a result, Potiorek ordered the Austro-Hungarian forces {{in the city to}} withdraw. The Austro-Hungarians left Belgrade on 14 and 15 December and retreated back into Austria-Hungary <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> their river monitors on the Sava and the Danube. The Serbian Army re-entered Belgrade on 15 December and was in full control of the city {{by the end of the}} following day.|$|E

5|$|On 18 August, {{a general}} advance began and the {{following}} morning No. 6 Commando took part in an attack to seize an area of high ground {{to the east of}} the Dives, north of Dozule. The attack took place <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness and the lead elements were able to infiltrate deep into the German positions before they were detected. By daybreak the position had been captured and {{over the course of the}} day four determined counter-attacks were repelled. In one attack, a troop from No. 6 Commando rushed their attackers, killing the senior German officer and capturing 25 prisoners as the attack was broken up.|$|E
5|$|Skírnir {{requests}} that Freyr {{give him}} a horse and Freyr's sword; a sword which fights jötnar by itself. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness, Skírnir rides the horse over nations and dew-covered mountains until he reaches Jötunheimr, {{the home of the}} jötnar, and proceeds to Gymir's courts. Ferocious dogs are tied before the wooden fence that surrounds Gerðr's hall. Skírnir rides out to a herdsman (unnamed) sitting on a mound, greets him, and asks the herdsman how he may speak to the maiden beyond Gymir's dogs. An exchange occurs between the herdsman and Skírnir, during which the herdsman tells Skírnir that he will never speak to the girl.|$|E
5|$|The French {{artillery}} {{concealed in}} wooded areas proved more potent than the tanks. The German 1st Panzer Company was {{wiped out by}} French artillery, and pulled back with just one battleworthy tank. The Company retreated <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> part of the ridge, and moved its single tank back and forth, simulating the presence of many German tanks. Diverted from their success at Gaulier, near Sedan, the 2nd Panzer Company {{was rushed to the}} spot and managed to delay the French armoured advance. The Großdeutschland Infantry Regiment's late arrival tilted the scales. They managed to eliminate the anti-tank lines and entrenched French infantry.|$|E

5|$|The Mirabello group {{engaged the}} Austro-Hungarian cruisers at 07:00, but were heavily outgunned, and instead {{attempted}} to shadow the fleeing cruisers. At 07:45, Rear Admiral Acton's ships encountered the destroyers Csepel and Balaton. After 20 minutes, the Italian destroyers {{were able to}} close {{the distance to the}} Austro-Hungarian ships; the two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from Csepel struck Aquila and disabled the ship's boilers. By this time, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers were <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> the coastal batteries at Durazzo, and were able to make good their escape.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{began on}} 12 October, when the Kaiser-class battleships engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula. Simultaneously, Moltke, Bayern, and the Königs began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Stiff Russian {{resistance in the}} Kassar Wick, the entrance to Moon Sound, slowed the German advance. On 14 October, Kaiser was detached from the bombardment force {{to deal with the}} Russian destroyers holding up the German minesweepers. <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> Kaisers 30.5cm guns, the German torpedo boats dashed into the Sound. During the ensuing clash, the Russian destroyer Grom was disabled and eventually sunk.|$|E

Once the Priest returns he finds her {{in a state of shock}} and comforts her then shows her what he has discovered. As everyone gathers in a hallway, he explains that each of the girls, the women who are now dying, share their names with Catholic saints. As these saints died, so are the women dying.

5|$|Throughout the day, the Australians {{came under}} heavy shellfire from the Germans. At 22:00, the German forces {{launched}} a severe counter-attack against the mill <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> an intense barrage of artillery and bombs. Advancing {{down the main}} road, they managed to enter the trench Whittle was holding. Gathering all available men, Whittle charged the Germans {{and was able to}} restabilise the position. Newland arrived soon after, and the two men worked together until the position was re-established. The 12th Battalion was relieved on 10 April by the 11th Battalion, having succeeded in capturing Boursies at the cost of 240 casualties, of which 70 were killed or missing.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day {{to break up the}} Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted to disengage, but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E
5|$|After {{resting on}} their arms through the night, the 21st awoke to light {{fighting}} in their front. Over {{the course of}} the morning, Union forces gradually shifted to the left, including the 21st, and it became apparent that the Union right flank had collapsed. Meanwhile, Lee's forces had joined Jackson's and were pressing the Union left flank with a massive and rapid assault. Pope's entire army was soon in retreat. Ferrero's brigade was moved by Brig. Gen. Reno to a position on Henry House Hill to cover the Union retreat along the Centreville Turnpike. The brigade, with the 21st in the center, successfully held off Confederate advances from 7 to , buying critical time for the Union army. Finally, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>cover</b> <b>of</b> darkness, the brigade quietly retired across Bull Run. During this defeat for the Union army, the 21st suffered light casualties of seven wounded, or two percent.|$|E
