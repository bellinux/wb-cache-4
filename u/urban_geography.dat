40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the changes in}} the Antwerp Skipper’s Quarter, {{one of the oldest and}} largest red light districts on the European continent. While the geography of sex work has received considerable scholarly attention since the 1970 s, such analyses have focused upon the interplay between market pressures and sexual values in the production of sexual spaces. This paper takes a different stance, as it analyses the Skipper’s Quarter’s restructuring in the light of the globalization of the sex industry. This analysis reveals how more attention should be paid to globalization’s local mediation (glocalization) in the analysis of the changing <b>urban</b> <b>geographies</b> of sex work. Such an approach not only supports the interpretation of local diversity in the <b>urban</b> <b>geographies</b> of sex work. It also conveys a more politicized understanding as it zooms in on the political struggles in which new <b>urban</b> <b>geographies</b> of sex work unfold. status: publishe...|$|R

The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than twenty-five percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas. One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger <b>urban</b> <b>geography.</b> [...] "I learned the process of development," [...] he said later, [...] "and about the city as a living organism."

500|$|The {{geographer}} E. G. R. Taylor, {{reviewing the}} book for the Royal Geographical Society in 1955, wrote that Hoskins {{made the case for}} getting a strong pair of boots to learn landscape history clearly enough. Taylor compared the book to Dudley Stamp's Man and the Land, published a few months earlier in 1955, saying that Hoskins seemed to have missed it, but that given the differences in their approaches, they could be read side by side. She noted also that Hoskins did not talk about London though he covered town landscapes, and appeared unaware of <b>urban</b> <b>geography.</b> Her review ended by remarking that Hoskins [...] "views the industrial revolution with mounting horror, and the industrialists themselves are bitterly chastised as 'completely and grotesquely insensitive. No scruples weakened their lust for money; they made their money and left their muck.'" [...] She noted however that Hoskins had happily moved to [...] "a quiet spot in Oxfordshire where he can forget the 'barbaric England of the scientists, the military men and the politicians' and look out of his study window on to the past", where, she wrote, he [...] "draws for us a last tender and evocative picture of the 'gentle unravished English landscape.'" [...] Dr. Hoskins, she wrote, forgetting all the horrors, [...] "reaches back through the centuries one by one and rediscovers Eden".|$|E

The central point of the town is the priory, near the ancient Roman temple. This centre could also have been the administrative centre since at least the 13th century. Aix was a seigneurie subservient to the [...] , who had a château which, even if we do not place with certainty, was probably the location of the actual château. Two hamlets are attested, Saint-Hippolyte, in the immediate vicinity of the town but outside the ramparts, with a small priory at the centre and at its side, now under the Villa Chevalley, a strong House, the maison forte de Saint-Pol , dependent upon the de Savoie family which recent studies date back to the 13th century. A second important village appears, Saint Simond (Saint Sigismond) with it having a church and a cemetery, established as a parish, and a dependant of Saint-Hippolyte.|$|E
50|$|Cities {{have played}} an {{important}} role in geographical studies dating back to Strabo. In a 1924 study of <b>urban</b> <b>geography,</b> Marcel Aurousseau observed that <b>urban</b> <b>geography</b> cannot be considered a subdivision of geography because it plays such an important part. However, <b>urban</b> <b>geography</b> did emerge as a specialized discipline after World War II, amidst increasing urban planning and a shift away from the primacy of physical terrain in the study of geography. Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman were among its earliest exponents.|$|E

The literature show disparities in access to healthy foods through low density of large grocers/supermarkets, low variety and quality of produce and higher prices for a healthy diet in rural versus <b>urban</b> <b>geographies.</b> Rural areas are of unique concern due to poor health indicators such as higher obesity rates, higher diabetes rates, lower incomes and lower educations than urban residents. The goal {{of this study was}} to explore differences in the community and consumer level food environments between two Nevada geographies. Evidence was sought to test the hypotheses of venue density, the availability and quality of produce, and the price difference between standard and healthy items between rural and <b>urban</b> Nevada <b>geographies.</b> A cross-sectional study took place through direct quantitative and descriptive data collection in two rural Nevada counties and two urban census tracts in Las Vegas, NV. A Kruskal–Wallis, Mann–Whitney and a Bonferroni correction were performed on the quantitative store audit data to compare produce availability and quality scores, and the price differences between standard and healthy items between geographies. Primary data show a greater per-capita density of grocery and convenience venues in the rural area than the urban. A greater per-capita density of fast-food venues was found in the urban sample area. The variety and quality of produce in the rural grocer venues were lower than the urban supermarkets. No significant or functional price difference was found between the standard and healthier versions of select items within commonly purchased food groups, between rural and <b>urban</b> <b>geographies...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies multiple <b>urban</b> <b>geographies</b> of ‘Islamic’, i. e. Shari’a-compliant {{financial services}} (IFS) from a ‘decentred’ world city perspective. IFS such as banking, finance, and insurance services {{are grounded in}} a discourse of Islamic economics that amongst others prohibits interest-based products, contractual uncertainty, and speculative trade - features which have come to typify {{the organization of the}} current global financial system. Because IFS involve a broad range of institutions, firms, and actors, which operate across various scales, its geographies are addressed through multiple lenses. The specific focus hereby is not on core ‘economic’ or ‘business’ aspects, but rather on the geographical dimensions of IFS as a global practice. To this end, the dissertation studies how financial elites, firms, assets classes and investment products within and at the borders of IFS geographically link up cities, IFCs, markets, regions, and states across the globe. The <b>urban</b> <b>geographies</b> of IFS studied in this dissertation can be read as an illustration of the changing nature of the global financial system as it expands. Furthermore, IFS constitute a prime example of the multiple ‘alternative’ ways cities are being integrated into the global economy. As such, the dissertation concludes that this experiment to ‘decentre’ economic geography might further instigate post-colonial perspectives within contemporary research on world cities and world city networks...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010. Includes bibliographical references. This PhD {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} {{ways in which}} Māori have embraced {{the city as a}} place of opportunity and have developed uniquely Māori urbanisms that are based in whakamanatanga (empowerment) rather than crisis or resistance. These whakamanatanga-based Māori urbanisms are connected to what I refer to as Māori <b>urban</b> <b>geographies</b> of whakamanatanga. These geographies are characterized by Māori, living and working in Aotearoa New Zealand cities, who are creating <b>urban</b> <b>geographies</b> that foster, maintain and reproduce positive Māori urban identities and ways of life. These geographies are framed within a theoretical approach that views both space and place as interdependent concepts. I argue that the development of space and place has reached a critical moment whereby these two concepts can no longer be viewed as separate in any theoretically meaningful way. Instead, I propose a space/place conceptual framework that treats space/place as mutually constitutive. I further argue that the insertion of indigenous perspectives into this space/place framework is necessary when applying this theory to research involving indigenous related issues. This framework is then applied to the development of Māori urbanisms in Aotearoa New Zealand. These urbanisms are, it is argued, a product of both the challenges and opportunities cities have afforded Māori. Their responses to these urban challenges/opportunities have lead to multiple ways in which Māori, individually and in groups, have responded to life in cities. The main focus of this research is forms of Māori urbanisms grounded in whakamanatanga, and in particular the geographic manifestations of these urbanisms. The final chapters of this dissertation draw on empirical research undertaken in Aotearoa New Zealand over the course of six months in 2007 and 2008. This research shows how Māori, across a broad range of professions and in one specific place, are creating historically, socially and materially these <b>urban</b> <b>geographies</b> of whakamanatanga in the context of everyday life. A more specific focus on a place called Mana Moko-Te Karanga (Kfm) demonstrates how these geographies are simultaneously locally informed and globally connected. Kfm also demonstrates one possible socio-geographic formation whereby Māori can engage forces of globalization without cultural compromise...|$|R
