5000|$|Techniques {{that help}} prevent food borne illness {{in the kitchen}} are hand washing, rinsing produce, {{preventing}} cross-contamination, proper storage, and maintaining cooking temperatures. In general, freezing or refrigerating prevents virtually all bacteria from growing, and heating food sufficiently kills parasites, viruses, and most bacteria. Bacteria grow most rapidly at the range of temperatures between , called the [...] "danger zone". Storing food below or above the [...] "danger zone" [...] can effectively limit the production of toxins. For storing leftovers, the food must be put in shallow containersfor quick cooling and must be refrigerated within two hours.

They may be used when retrofitting a building with hot water plumbing is too costly or impractical. Since they maintain water temperature thermostatically, they can only supply a continuous flow of hot water at extremely low flow rates, unlike high-capacity tankless heaters.|$|E

50|$|The loader sat to the gunner's right, and fed in belts of cloth, {{into which}} the rounds had been placed. The weapon would draw in the belt from right to left, pull the next round out of the belt and into the chamber, fire it, then send the fired brass {{cartridge}} down {{and out of the}} receiver while the cloth belt would continue out the left side. During sustained fire, the barrel would heat up which heated the water in the jacket <b>until</b> <b>hot</b> enough for the water to evaporate or boil thereby cooling the barrel releasing the heat through steam. It took the Mk I 600 rounds of continuous fire to boil the water in the jacket, evaporating at a rate of 1.5 pints (0.852 L) per 1,000 rounds. The steam would reach the top of the jacket and enter a steam tube which led to a port that was situated under the jacket near the muzzle. A hose was connected to this, which released the steam into a metal water can allowing it to be vented away {{from the rest of the}} gun hiding the steam cloud and the gun's position. This also allowed any condensate to be reclaimed from the steam. Before the can got too full, it would be emptied back into the jacket to replenish the water level which would have fallen as the water evaporated and boiled away. If the water jacket needed to be emptied, a plug under the jacket could be unscrewed to drain the entire jacket.|$|E
