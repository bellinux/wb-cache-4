40|$|The {{relations}} between <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community under the Nixon Administration (1969 - 1974) were considerably changing. Post- 1945 cooperation and dependence increasingly {{gave way to}} economic competition and division in military and foreign policies. Yet, <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community {{knew that they were}} strategically important to each other, thus they had to continue cooperation and coordination to defend and advance their economic and strategic interests. With a documentary research approach, this paper aims to examine how <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community their partnership evolved between 1969 and 1974. It explores the ties that the Nixon Administration designed to bind <b>the</b> European Community <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community’s responses. It also puts forth that despite their efforts to continue cooperation; the {{relations between}} <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community were on a downward course. It will be concluded that <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> European Community experienced a difficult time in their relations between 1969 and 1974, but both sides showed certain efforts to maintain the partnership...|$|R
