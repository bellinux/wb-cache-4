40|$|Text in AfrikaansThe <b>utilization</b> <b>value</b> of the {{paradoxical}} theory {{of change in}} Gestalt Play Therapy with adolescents Adolescents undergo significant changes on physical, emotional, and cognitive levels during this development stage. These changes have a great influence on their self-awareness. Most adolescents experience great problems with {{who they are and}} who they should be according to the expectations of others. This causes a never-ending process of efforts to change. Change can only take place if the adolescent is who he is, but not if he tries to be what he is not. The consequence hereof is that change cannot take place in the adolescent, because he should first become aware of who he is. The awareness of who he is leads to change. The paradoxical theory of change is all about being who one is and not about trying to be what others expect one to be. The adolescent should be accompanied to become aware of who he is, by utilization of {{the paradoxical}} theory, {{in order to be able}} grow and change. The aim of this study was to explore and describe the <b>utilization</b> <b>value</b> of the paradoxical theory of change in Gestalt Play Therapy with adolescents. In order to achieve this goal, the research process was directed by qualitative research, and triangulation was utilized as a technique for gathering information.

Before the first plucking, and after each subsequent plucking, we took two photos that were perpendicular to {{each other at the}} intersection of the shrub. Each photo was evaluated using image-processing software to produce red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color band images. Green leaf area was determined as follows: pixel = ([G-R] + [G-B]) / (G+R+G+B); Green leaf area, cm 2 = (Calibration [C], cm 2 ∙pixel- 1) × (LA, pixel). Green leaf area calculated from the photographic technique was strongly correlated (r 2 = 0. 83 - 0. 94, P < 0. 001) with forage yield for all three shrubs.

40|$|Peak power {{consumption}} {{is a universal}} problem across energy control systems in electrical grids, buildings, and industrial automation where the uncoordinated operation of multiple controllers result in temporally correlated electricity demand surges (or peaks). While there exist several different approaches to balance {{power consumption}} by load shifting and load shedding, they operate on coarse grained time scales and do not help in de-correlating energy sinks. The Energy System Scheduling Problem is particularly hard due to its binary control variables. Its complexity grows exponentially with {{the scale of the}} system, making it impossible to handle systems with more than a few variables. We developed a scalable approach for fine-grained scheduling of energy control systems that novelly combines techniques from control theory and computer science. The original system with binary control variables are approximated by an averaged system whose inputs are the <b>utilization</b> <b>values</b> of the binary inputs within a given period. The error between the two systems can be bounded, which allows us to derive a safety constraint for the averaged system so that the original system 2 ̆ 7 s safety is guaranteed. To further reduce the complexity of the scheduling problem, we abstract the averaged system by a simple single-state single-input dynamical system whose control input is the upper-bound of the total demand of the system. This model abstraction is achieved by extending the concept of simulation relations between transition systems to allow for input constraints between the systems. We developed conditions to test for simulation relations as well as algorithms to compute such a model abstraction. As a consequence, we only need to solve a small linear program to compute an optimal bound of the total demand. The total demand is then broken down, by solving a linear program much smaller than the original program, to individual <b>utilization</b> <b>values</b> of the subsystems, whose actual schedule is then obtained by a low-level scheduling algorithm.

This thesis presents statistics of the Internet traffic for Users connected through the public frame relay network. It also presents some observations that may help in improvement of the service to be of a better quality and affordable cost. Measurements and statistics in this research showed that most of the Internet users are concentrated in Khartoum center and Khartoum south areas, and are allocated percentages of the total bandwidth between 43 % for users in Khartoum center area and 37 % for users in Khartoum south area. Statistics of bandwidth distribution per user category showed that 42. 9 % of the bandwidth is allocated to Service providers. Statistics of the daily traffic variations showed that the Overall traffic has its peak hour at 2 pm and drops to its minimum at 6 a. m. it also showed that the mean of traffic intensity is twice its standard deviation and the variance is very high if related to the mean. Per weekday analysis of the traffic showed that the average traffic utilization per weekday for the aggregate links maintains the same level with slight drop on Fridays. From the study of traffic variations per user category it is observed that traffic generated by local service providers has a great impact on the overall traffic pattern. The percentage of traffic uploaded and downloaded by each of the international links implies that the routing policy used to load share the upload traffic between the international links resulted in an equal load sharing. And that the shortest path of 18 % of downloads traffic is through Emirate link. A straight line with a slope of 0. 5 can represent the relation between download and upload traffic for aggregate links. The packet arrival model of the aggregate links do not follow Poisson distribution, and is proved to be self similar. The queuing delay increased sharply for <b>utilization</b> <b>values</b> greater than 55 %, and maintains the same level for <b>utilization</b> <b>values</b> less than 53 %...|$|R
