5|$|Because of {{increasing}} Muslim resentment {{against the use}} of the mosque as a military garrison, the British set up the Badshahi Mosque Authority in 1852 to oversee the restoration and to re-establish it as a place of religious worship. From then onwards, piecemeal repairs were carried out <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Badshahi Mosque Authority. The building was officially handed back to the Muslim community by John Lawrence, who was the Viceroy of India. The building was then re-established as a mosque.|$|E

George Sherriff leased the castle between 1868 and 1873, building a stone wall around the front of property.|$|E

5|$|After the Romanian Communist Party seized {{political}} power, the sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of the officers and noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also {{in the context of}} Romania's integration in the strategic system of the Soviets, {{at the beginning of the}} Cold War.|$|E
5|$|During {{the start}} of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, President Manuel Quezon hired Paris-trained Filipino {{architect}} Andrés Luna de San Pedro, son of painter Juan Luna, to take charge of the renovations of the Manila Hotel. It was done <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renowned engineering firm Pedro Siochi and Company. The hotel was the residence of General Douglas MacArthur when he became the Military Advisor of the Commonwealth. Luna converted the hotel's top floor into an elegant penthouse and expanded the west wing northward – creating the air-conditioned annex - and designed some key public rooms like the Fiesta Pavilion, then the biggest function room of the hotel. The hotel was the site of festivities during the inauguration of the Philippine Commonwealth government in November, 1935.|$|E

5|$|In England {{the brigade}} trained for {{operations}} in North-West Europe <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> I Airborne Corps. Although {{they were not}} scheduled {{to take part in}} the Normandy landings, under Operation Tuxedo the brigade would be parachuted in to support operations if any of the five invasion beaches experienced difficulties. Tuxedo was the only operation planned where the brigade would act as an independent formation whereas 13 other operations were prepared which would have deployed the entire 1st Airborne Division. However, the speed of the Allied advance towards the River Seine and then onwards from Paris northwards, was accomplished without airborne assistance and the plans were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|On 18 April 1943, a Royal Air Force {{breakdown}} lorry {{heading to the}} airfield at Ta' Qali at night with no street light hit the arch and severely damaged its Santa Venera-facing façade. The central arch was dismantled by military personnel <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Public Works Department about two months later. The arch was completely destroyed on 12 February 1944, when a Royal Army Service Corps truck hit the remaining parts of the structure. The stone remains were supposedly stored by the British but, similar to several other historic relics, they were never retrieved by the Maltese and the whereabouts are unknown. However, the arch's two marble plaques were repossessed.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, Spain was {{approached}} by the US ambassador with a request to use Spanish ports for evacuating the wounded, following landings in southern France. Originally the plan had been to request access {{for the purposes of}} staging the initial invasion. However, this was toned down in light of historical resistance to any foreign occupation of Spanish soil as well as the implausibility of invading France via the Pyrenees. On 5 June the British ambassador reinforced the request, and after some discussion the Spanish government agreed but only after an invasion had occurred, and <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Red Cross. To emphasise the change in objective, the Allies followed this up with Operation Ferdinand which threatened an invasion in Italy.|$|E

5|$|President dos Santos {{met with}} Savimbi in Lisbon, Portugal and signed the Bicesse Accords, {{the first of}} three major peace agreements, on 31 May 1991, with the {{mediation}} of the Portuguese government. The accords laid out a transition to multi-party democracy <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations' UNAVEM II mission, with a presidential election to be held within a year. The agreement attempted to demobilize the 152,000 active fighters and integrate the remaining government troops and UNITA rebels into a 50,000-strong Angolan Armed Forces (FAA). The FAA would consist of a national army with 40,000 troops, navy with 6,000, and air force with 4,000. While UNITA largely did not disarm, the FAA complied with the accord and demobilized, leaving the government disadvantaged.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{concerns}} over security led to Henry II investing heavily {{in a new}} castle structure on the site between 1171 and 1174. It was unusual for a new royal castle {{to be built in}} this part of England during the 12th century, and Henry appears to have been driven by the military threat from Scotland before and during the Great Revolt of 1173 to 1174. Henry II spent almost £600 on the castle between 1170 and 1187, most of it in the first few years, rebuilding the older structure <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Count of Brittany's local tenants, Torfin, Osbert and Stephen of Barningham.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient City of Damascus, {{including}} the citadel, {{was listed as}} a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.

In 1999 a joint French-Syrian mission was initiated <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>supervision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DGAM and the Institut français du Proche-Orient (IFPO).
