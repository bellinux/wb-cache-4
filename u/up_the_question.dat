5|$|Even {{in ancient}} times these {{similarities}} were controversial. Non-Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other. Reacting to these claims by outsiders, early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion. The 17th-century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults. Charles-François Dupuis, in the late 18th century, went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults. Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants, Catholics, and non-Christians, the controversy has continued to the present day.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, the Senate took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{of ending}} the joint {{occupancy}} of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, {{a senator from}} Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the dividing line between the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E

5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all other respects, the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question.</b>|$|E

The Concept of Anxiety was published on {{exactly the same}} date as Prefaces, June 17, 1844. Both books deal with Hegel’s idea of mediation. Mediation is a common thread throughout Kierkegaard’s works. His work {{up to this point}} was to show that faith was being mediated by knowledge. Here he takes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> of sin and guilt.|$|R
25|$|The CBS {{independent}} {{panel report}} did not specifically take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{of whether the}} documents were forgeries, but retained a document expert, Peter Tytell, who concluded the documents used by CBS were produced using current word processing technology.|$|E
25|$|In 1563 William Cecil {{drafted a}} bill, envisaging the Privy Council having wide powers if the Queen died without an heir; {{but he did}} not put it forward. Parliament petitioned the Queen to name her successor, but she did not do so. An Act was passed by Parliament in 1572, but the Queen refused her assent. In the early 1590s Peter Wentworth {{attempted}} to bring <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> again, but debate was shut down sharply. The matter surfaced mainly in drama.|$|E

It was not until the Twenty-fifth Amendment was ratified in 1967 that there was an official procedure for what to do if the president became incapacitated.|$|E

They took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of an affinity of Isostylis with Dryandra, finding George's arguments unconvincing but failing to find any further evidence for or against Isostyliss placement within Banksia. They eventually accepted both of George's subgenera, using each as an outgroup {{in the analysis of}} the other. Thus their analysis yielded no information about the circumscription and placement of Isostylis, and their arrangement maintained Isostylis as a subgenus.|$|E
25|$|The {{handyman}} cleared <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the headless female corpse {{found in}} the ruins of Gunness' home. Gunness had lured this woman from Chicago on the pretense of hiring her as a housekeeper days before she decided to make her permanent escape from La Porte. According to Lamphere, Gunness had drugged the woman, then bashed in her head and decapitated the body, taking the head, which had weights tied to it, to a swamp where she threw it into deep water. Then she chloroformed her children, smothered them to death, and dragged their bodies, along with the headless corpse, to the basement.|$|E
25|$|Early efforts {{focused on}} the first option, which was to revise the county {{charters}} to force greater representation of city interests on the county court. In spite of efforts by state representatives from the city (including a young Joseph Pulitzer), county lobbyists persuaded the General Assembly to deny changes to the county charter. In 1873, the Democratic Party regained political control in Missouri {{for the first time}} after the Civil War, prompting the rewriting of the Missouri Constitution in 1875. At the convention, St. Louis area delegates took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of how to solve the region's city-county disputes. The delegates ruled out consolidation as too impractical and expensive from a management perspective; separation was considered the primary goal.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} {{to commemorate the}} dead only took off when political differences between Federalists and Democratic-Republicans deepened {{in the last years}} of the eighteenth century and the latter took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of a memorial in response to the Federalist erection of a statue of George Washington in 1803. The Tammany Society, headed by Benjamin Romaine was created and grew into a Republican organization. On February 10, 1803 Republican Congressman Samuel L. Mitchill asked the federal government to erect a monument to the fallen, but had no success They then turned their efforts to a grand ceremonial re-interment of the prisoners' remains, emphasizing less the construction of a monument than something more suited to the common man. Tammany formed the Wallabout Committee in January 1808. Their efforts took strength from renewed anti-British feeling stemming from British incidents in 1806 & 1807. Finally, when President Thomas Jefferson enacted the Embargo Act of 1808, Tammany and the Republicans used their plans for a re-interment as part of their campaign to bolster anti-British sentiment.|$|E
25|$|The Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language {{was founded}} in 1900 by Louis Couturat and others; it {{tried to get the}} International Association of Academies to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of an {{international}} auxiliary language, study the existing ones and pick one or design a new one. However, the meta-academy declining to do so, the Delegation decided to do the job itself. Among Esperanto speakers there was a general impression that the Delegation would of course choose Esperanto, as it was the only auxlang with a sizable speaker community at the time; it was felt as a betrayal by many Esperanto speakers when in 1907 the Delegation came up with its own reformed version of Esperanto, Ido. Ido drew a significant number of speakers away from Esperanto in the short term, but in the longer term most of these either returned to Esperanto or moved on to other new auxlangs. Besides Ido, a great number of simplified Esperantos, called Esperantidos, emerged as concurrent language projects; still, Ido remains today one of the three most widely spoken auxlangs.|$|E
25|$|An {{example is}} a {{contemporary}} responsum by the well-known Israeli posek, Ovadia Yosef to Rabbi Grubner of Detroit, Michigan, establishing an impossibility to prove mamzer status {{in a situation where}} the evidence might appear to be clear-cut. The case involved the daughter of an aguna, who had been married by a Haredi rabbi to a husband who subsequently converted to Christianity and refused to participate in a Jewish divorce. The mother eventually divorced and remarried civilly and had the daughter years later. The daughter, who had been raised as an Orthodox Jew and attended a Haredi day school, brought <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of her status herself prior to an impending marriage. Rabbi Yosef proceeded systematically to disqualify evidence that a prior marriage had ever taken place. The mother's evidence was immediately disqualified as an interested party. The ketubah (Jewish marriage contract/certificate) was never found. The rabbi who performed the marriage was contacted, but Rabbi Yosef wrote that his testimony could not be accepted without the ketubah, and in any event required corroboration by a second witness. Attempts to contact the husband were abandoned after an adversarial conversation with his new, non-Jewish wife. Thus, Rabbi Yosef concluded there was insufficient evidence that a valid prior marriage had ever taken place. Rabbi Yosef then proceeded to establish the possibility that the former husband might be the daughter's father. The mother testified that her former husband occasionally brought alimony payments and came for visitation in person and hence the two were sometimes at least momentarily alone together. Applying an ancient rule that when a husband and wife are known to be alone together behind a closed door the law presumes sexual intercourse may well have taken place, Rabbi Yosef concluded that it was possible the former husband was the daughter's father and hence Jewish law, which very strongly construes all evidence in favour of birth within marriage, had to presume that he was. Thus, Rabbi Yosef concluded that there was insufficient evidence of either a former marriage or that the new husband was the father, and hence he concluded that no evidence of mamzerut had occurred.|$|E

500|$|However, Tom Burns of Underground Online had {{previously}} criticized Supernatural for ruining a surprise ending by giving {{it away in}} the show's recap.

Burns liked the episode, but did find some fault with it. He felt that [...] "Part One" [...] focusing on Sam and [...] "Part Two" [...] on Dean was a mistake since [...] "Supernaturals strongest asset has always been the chemistry between the leads". In addition, Burns felt the season had set <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether Sam was going to [...] "go evil", and the finale did not follow through, which Burns described as a [...] "tease".|$|E

[...] Archibald MacLeish, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs, stated that when the press had finished with Sir Frederick, [...] "..the sum total effect was a lie and a disastrous and evil lie.

Calling the death a [...] "lightning bolt" [...] David Hinckley of New York Daily News wrote, [...] "In one of the most stunning moments from a high-mortality television season, [...] "Grey's Anatomy" [...] killed off Patrick Dempsey's Dr. Derek Shepherd". Also talking about the shock value Shepherd's death in her New York Post review Lindsay Putnam wrote, [...] "“Grey’s Anatomy” did the unthinkable, killing off {{one of the few remaining}} original cast members", additionally putting <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of the future of the series asking, [...] "with Derek out of the picture, what will become of the rest of the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital family? Is there still a future for “Grey’s Anatomy”?" [...] The sentiment was echoed by Slate writer Aisha Harris who weighed heavily upon importance of the death and its impact saying that despite the show’s ensemble cast, [...] "Meredith has always remained the central figure of Grey’s, so this death marks a very important turning point in the show". Optimistic of the prospects for the show, she added, [...] "if anyone can come out of this tragedy as a tougher, better character than ever, it’s Meredith Grey." ...|$|E
