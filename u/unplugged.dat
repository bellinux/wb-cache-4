The show, titled MTV <b>Unplugged,</b> originally aired on MTV to help promote Carey's album Emotions, as well as help shun critics who deemed Carey a possible studio artist.

5|$|Originally, MTV {{planned to}} air the show {{several times during}} April 1992, it was normal for MTV <b>Unplugged</b> {{sessions}} to air around six times {{during the month of}} release, before being archived. Carey's version was met with critical acclaim and extended popularity, leading to it being shown more often than usual.

The concert's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were already making headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993. This being so, Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.|$|E
