As she shrank the other followed, till presently Lysbeth saw her expression of rage and <b>hate</b> <b>change</b> to one of terror.

Pteppic succeeds in destroying the Pyramid, returning Djelibeybi to the real world and sending Dios back through time (where he meets the original founder of the Kingdom, thereby restarting the cycle).

In the 2002 film Abandon, written by Oscar winner Stephen Gaghan, Holmes plays a delusional, homicidal college student named [...] "Katie". Todd McCarthy of Variety and Roger Ebert commended her performance, but other critics savaged it. During the final season of Dawsons Creek, Holmes played the mistress of the public relations flack played by Colin Farrell in Phone Booth, which was both critically and financially successful. She also appeared as Robert Downey, Jr.s nurse in The Singing Detective (2003). Dawsons Creek ended its run in 2003, and Holmes was the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes.

We pro-pose to learn distributed low-dimensional representations of comments using recently proposed neural language models, that can then be fed as inputs to a classification algorithm. Our approach addresses issues of high-dimensionality and sparsity that impact the current state-of-the-art, resulting in highly efficient and effective hate speech detectors. 1...|$|R

From a Mahendra Dhoni haircut to getting rid of Manucha, the flirt. From gifting her poetry by Rumi to taking the perfect 'DP' over the Allahabad Naini bridge, he is on course to woo Sonia for good. Supporting him all along are his two buddies, ‘Foot- ball’ and ‘Khatri’. However while on this pure and sweet journey, Guddu is also involved in a sinis-ter one - one that would bring him to a crossroads where one path leads to achieving love {{and the other to}} losing it forever. Guddu Engiineer symbolizes the youth, both from India and Pakistan for whom each day is a vote between warmth and loathing. Ultimately the story's moral can be best encompassed with a line from Rumi's poetry which Sonia cherishes: “It's not our task to seek love but the barriers we have built against it." ...|$|R

For that there are several tasks: search strategy or algorithm, node similarity computation metric, learning from exemplary poles serving as training data, stopping criterion, node classier and queue manager. There will implementation of: classification algorithm named shark search. There will be comparison of number of words in the language model based comparer, similarity threshold for the classifier and present the results of comparison using standard Information Retrieval metrics such as precision, recall and F-measure.

The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them; <b>hating</b> <b>change</b> of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all {{the rest of her life}} at Hartfield.

60|$|The {{political}} {{history of the}} world from the sixteenth century onward was, we have said, an effort, a largely unconscious effort, of mankind to adapt its political and social methods to certain new conditions that had now arisen. The effort to adapt was complicated by the fad that the conditions themselves were changing with a steadily increasing rapidity. The adaptation, mainly unconscious and almost always unwilling (for man in general <b>hates</b> voluntary <b>change),</b> has lagged more and more behind the alterations in conditions. From the sixteenth century onward the history of mankind is a story of political and social institutions becoming more and more plainly misfits, less comfortable and more vexatious, and of the slow reluctant realization of the need for a conscious and deliberate reconstruction of the whole scheme of human societies in the face of needs and possibilities new to all the former experiences of life.|$|R
