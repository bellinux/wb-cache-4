5|$|At {{particular}} issue was {{the ability of}} sensors to differentiate an <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> from an earthquake. There were four techniques examined: measurement of acoustic waves, seismic signals, and radio waves, and inspection of radioactive debris. The Soviet delegation expressed confidence in each method, while Western experts argued that a more comprehensive compliance system would be necessary.|$|E
5|$|On 19 September 1957, the US {{conducted}} the first contained <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> at the Nevada Test Site, codenamed Rainier. The Rainier shot complicated {{the push for}} a comprehensive test ban, as underground tests could not be as easily identified as atmospheric tests.|$|E
5|$|A notable {{atmospheric}} {{release of}} radioactive gas followed the Soviet Chagan test of 15 January 1965 in present-day Kazakhstan. Roughly 20% of the radioactive debris {{produced by the}} 140-kiloton detonation was released into the atmosphere, with some fallout occurring over Japan. The US complained to Moscow, but no subsequent action was taken. On 25 April 1966, the Pin Stripe <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> in Nevada (part of Operation Flintlock) experienced a venting malfunction and produced a radioactive plume headed towards the Midwestern US; the AEC determined that the test did not threaten human health.|$|E
500|$|Early {{compliance}} with the PTBT {{was believed to be}} good, though {{there have been a number}} of accidental releases of nuclear debris into the atmosphere by parties to the treaty. Additionally, [...] "venting" [...] of <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> by the US and Soviet Union also continued to release radioactive debris into the atmosphere. Fully contained <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> were not wholly [...] "clean" [...] either. <b>Underground</b> <b>testing</b> reduced the risk caused by radionuclides with short half-lives, such as iodine-131, and is generally safer than other forms of <b>testing.</b> However, <b>underground</b> <b>testing</b> may also cause long-lived radionuclides, including caesium-135, iodine-129, and plutonium, to seep into the ground.|$|R
50|$|France, {{having had}} to abandon aerial tests {{and replace them}} with less-polluting <b>underground</b> <b>tests,</b> opted for <b>underground</b> <b>testing</b> in marine (atoll) or desert zones. The Saharan test sites were {{produced}} “in galleries”, those having been horizontally excavated in the Tan Afella on the site In Eker.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Underground</b> <b>testing</b> {{refers to}} nuclear tests {{conducted}} {{under the surface}} of the earth, at varying depths. <b>Underground</b> nuclear <b>testing</b> made up the majority of nuclear tests by the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War; other forms of nuclear testing were banned by the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963. True <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> are intended to be fully contained and emit a negligible amount of fallout. Unfortunately these nuclear tests do occasionally [...] "vent" [...] to the surface, producing from nearly none to considerable amounts of radioactive debris as a consequence. <b>Underground</b> <b>testing,</b> almost by definition, causes seismic activity of a magnitude that depends on the yield of the nuclear device and the composition of the medium it is detonated in, and generally creates a subsidence crater. In 1976, the United States and the USSR agreed to limit the maximum yield of <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> to 150 kt with the Threshold Test Ban Treaty.Underground testing also falls into two physical categories: tunnel tests in generally horizontal tunnel drifts, and shaft tests in vertically drilled holes.|$|R
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{results were}} supplemented by the <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, {{as it was}} hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and vaporizing the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.|$|E

5|$|The decade {{following}} {{ratification of}} the PTBT (1963–72) featured more US nuclear tests than the decade prior (1953–62). In the following decade, the US conducted 385 nuclear tests and 23 peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs), versus 268 tests and three PNEs in the preceding decade. In contrast, the number of Soviet detonations fell from 218 in the preceding decade to 157 in the following decade, as the Soviet Union {{was never able to}} meet the pace of US underground explosions. China and France, both non-signatories, conducted 53 tests between 1963 and 1973. In all, 436 tests were conducted between the signing of the PTBT and 1 July 1973, compared to 499 tests between 16 July 1945 and the signing of the PTBT. In the 1960s and 1970s, China conducted 22 atmospheric tests and France conducted 50. The last atmospheric test was conducted by China in 1980, after French atmospheric testing stopped in 1974. Public opposition to nuclear testing continued following the treaty's enactment. Greenpeace was founded in 1971 in opposition to a planned <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. In 1982, a Greenpeace ship docked at Leningrad without permission demanding that the Soviet Union stop testing.|$|E
5000|$|The PTBT {{had mixed}} results. On the one hand, {{enactment}} of the treaty {{was followed by a}} substantial drop in the atmospheric concentration of radioactive particles. On the other hand, nuclear proliferation was not halted entirely (though it may have been slowed) and nuclear testing continued at a rapid clip. Compared to the 499 tests from 1945 to the signing of the PTBT, 436 tests were conducted over the ten years following the PTBT. Furthermore, US and Soviet <b>underground</b> <b>testing</b> continued [...] "venting" [...] radioactive gas into the atmosphere. Additionally, though <b>underground</b> <b>testing</b> was generally safer than above-ground <b>testing,</b> <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> continued to risk the leaking of radionuclides, including plutonium, into the ground. From 1964 through 1996, the year of the CTBT's adoption, an estimated 1,377 <b>underground</b> nuclear <b>tests</b> were conducted. The final non-underground (atmospheric or underwater) test was conducted by China in 1980.|$|R
5000|$|France: 210 tests by {{official}} count (50 atmospheric, 160 underground), four atomic atmospheric {{tests at}} C.E.S.M. near Reggane, 13 atomic <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> at C.E.M.O. near In Ekker in the French Algerian Sahara, and nuclear atmospheric and <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> at and around Fangataufa and Moruroa Atolls in French Polynesia. Four of the In Ekker tests are counted as peaceful use, {{as they were}} reported {{as part of the}} CET's APEX (Application pacifique des expérimentations nucléaires), and given alternate names.

50|$|The Rainier shot, {{conducted}} September 19, 1957, was {{the first}} fully contained <b>underground</b> nuclear <b>test,</b> meaning that no fission products were vented into the atmosphere. This test of 1.7 kt could be detected around the world by seismologists using ordinary seismic instruments. The Rainier test became the prototype for larger and more powerful <b>underground</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> {{took place}} in 1951; further tests {{provided}} information that {{eventually led to the}} signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, which banned all nuclear tests except for those performed underground. From then until the signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, most nuclear tests were performed underground, in order to prevent nuclear fallout from entering into the atmosphere.|$|E
500|$|Long Shot was detonated on October 29, 1965, and {{the yield}} was [...] It {{was the first}} <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> in a remote area, and the first test managed by the DoD. While there was no surface collapse, tritium and krypton were found at the surface {{following}} the test; this was not made public until 1969.|$|E
500|$|In June 1959, {{a report}} of a panel headed by Lloyd Berkner, a physicist, was {{introduced}} into discussions by Wadsworth. The report specifically concerned whether the Geneva System could be improved without {{increasing the number of}} control posts. Berkner's proposed measures were seen as highly costly and the technical findings themselves were accompanied by a caveat about the panel's high degree of uncertainty given limited data. Around the same time, analysis conducted by the Livermore National Laboratory and RAND Corporation at Teller's instruction found that the seismic effect of an <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> could be artificially dampened (referred to as [...] "decoupling") to the point that a 300-kiloton detonation would appear in seismic readings as a one-kiloton detonation. These findings were largely affirmed by pro-ban scientists, including Bethe. The third blow to the verification negotiations was provided by a panel chaired by Robert Bacher, which found that even on-site inspections would have serious difficulty determining whether an <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> had been conducted.|$|E
5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} for a comprehensive test ban conditional on proper monitoring of <b>underground</b> <b>tests.</b> On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth announced a new US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. <b>Underground</b> <b>tests</b> measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|R
25|$|Five <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> {{were set}} up at Area5; four of those {{suffered}} accidental release of radioactive materials. On 16March 1968, physicist Glenn T. Seaborg toured the upcoming Milk Shake shot of Operation Crosstie.|$|R
25|$|In 1963, all {{nuclear and}} many non-nuclear states signed the Limited Test Ban Treaty, {{pledging}} {{to refrain from}} testing nuclear weapons in the atmosphere, underwater, or in outer space. The treaty permitted <b>underground</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
500|$|In 1970, the AEC {{announced}} plans for another test, named Cannikin. The environmental movement, then in its infancy, vehemently opposed the testing, and filed a suit in the United States Supreme Court to stop the testing. This motion was denied by a 4 to 3 vote. On November 6, 1971, the Cannikin bomb was detonated, creating a [...] deep crater in the island, killing 1,000 sea otters and thousands of birds. The blast was 385 times that created by the Hiroshima bombing, and was the largest <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> of a nuclear weapon in history.|$|E
500|$|Amchitka was {{selected}} by the United States Atomic Energy Commission to be the site for underground detonations of nuclear weapons. Three such tests were carried out: Long Shot, an [...] blast in 1965; Milrow, a [...] blast in 1969; and Cannikin in 1971– at , the largest <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> ever conducted by the United States. The tests were highly controversial, with environmental groups fearing that the Cannikin explosion, in particular, would cause severe earthquakes and tsunamis. [...] Amchitka is no longer used for nuclear testing. It is still monitored for the leakage of radioactive materials.|$|E
500|$|Agnew became {{director}} of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1970, when it had 7,000 employees. He took over {{at a time of}} great change. His predecessor, Norris Bradbury, had rebuilt the laboratory from scratch after the war, and many of the people he had brought in were approaching retirement. Under his directorship, Los Alamos developed an <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> containment program, completed its Meson Physics Facility, acquired the first Cray supercomputer, and trained the first class of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Agnew managed to get the Los Alamos Laboratory responsibility {{for the development of the}} W76, used by the Trident I and Trident II Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles, and the W78 used by the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. He was proud of the work with insensitive high explosive that made nuclear weapons safer to handle. Support from the Atomic Energy Commission for reactor development dried up, but during the [...] 1970s energy crisis, the laboratory explored other types of alternative fuels.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. {{conducted}} <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> {{of nuclear}} weapons on Amchitka Island from 1965 to 1971 {{as part of the}} Vela Uniform program. The final detonation, the Cannikin, was the largest underground nuclear explosion by the U.S.|$|R
500|$|On 2 July 1963, Khrushchev {{proposed}} a partial ban on {{tests in the}} atmosphere, outer space, and underwater, which would avoid the contentious issue of detecting <b>underground</b> <b>tests.</b> Notably, Khrushchev did not link this proposal to a moratorium on <b>underground</b> <b>tests</b> (as had been proposed earlier), but said it should {{be followed by a}} non-aggression pact between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. [...] "A test ban agreement combined with the signing of a non-aggression pact between the two groups of state will create a fresh international climate more favorable for a solution of the major problems of our time, including disarmament," [...] Khrushchev said.|$|R

2500|$|On February 12, {{monitors}} in Asia {{picked up}} unusual seismic activity at a North Korean facility at 11:57 (02:57 GMT), later {{determined to be}} an artificial quake with an initial magnitude 4.9 (later revised to 5.1). The Korean Central News Agency subsequently said that the country had detonated a miniaturized nuclear device with [...] "greater explosive force" [...] in an <b>underground</b> <b>test.</b> According to the Korea Institute of Geosciences and Mineral Resources, the estimated yield was 7.7–7.8 kilotons.|$|E
2500|$|... 1963 saw the {{implementation}} of the Limited Test Ban Treaty which banned most atmospheric nuclear tests. The largest <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> in Novaya Zemlya took place on September 12, 1973, involving four nuclear devices of 4.2 megatons total yield. Although far smaller in blast power than the Tsar Bomba and other atmospheric tests, the confinement of the blasts underground led to pressures rivaling natural earthquakes. In the case of the September 12, 1973 test, a seismic magnitude of 6.97 on the Richter Scale was reached, setting off an 80 million ton avalanche that blocked two glacial streams and created a lake [...] in length.|$|E
2500|$|The next <b>underground</b> <b>test</b> was Teapot Ess, on 23 March 1955. The 1 kiloton {{explosion}} was {{an operational}} test of an {{atomic demolition munition}} (ADM).
