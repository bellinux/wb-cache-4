60|$|Every day, {{through the}} heat of the afternoon, the governor, and his wife also, <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> for two or three hours in their own rooms, and so, for the matter of that, did most people in the palace. But the princess, like many other girls, was restless, and {{preferred}} to wander about the garden, rather than rest on a pile of soft cushions. What a torment her stout old attendants and servants sometime thought her when she insisted on staying awake, and making them chatter or do something, when they could hardly keep their eyes open! Sometimes, however, the princess would pretend to go to sleep, and then, after all her women had gladly followed her example, she would get up and go out by herself, her veil hanging loosely about her. If she was discovered her old hostess scolded her severely; but the princess only laughed, and did the same thing next time.|$|E
6000|$|No cement was used, but the edifice is {{firm and}} compact and {{is capable of}} {{resisting}} storm and decay for centuries. Who built this temple, and how was it built, and when, are mysteries that may never be unraveled. Outside of these ancient walls lies a sort of coffin-shaped stone eleven feet four inches long and three feet square at the small end (it would weigh a few thousand pounds), which the high chief who held sway over this district many centuries ago brought thither on his shoulder one day {{to use as a}} lounge! This circumstance is established by the most reliable traditions. He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> on it, in his indolent way, and keep an eye on his subjects at work for him and see that there was no [...] "soldiering" [...] done. And no doubt there was not any done to speak of, because {{he was a man of}} that sort of build that incites to attention to business on the part of an employee.|$|E

I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> go away with a {{companion}} into a grass-field, and, selecting a spot where the grass was long and tangled, and mixed with various kinds of weeds, we <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>lie</b> flat <b>down</b> with our faces as near {{to the ground as}} possible, and gaze through the grass-stems until we fancied the blades were trees, and the pebbles were large rocks, and the clods were mountains. Sometimes a huge beetle would crawl past, and we instantly thought of Saint George and the dragon, and, as the unwieldy monster came stumbling on through the forest, we actually became quite excited, and could scarcely believe that what we tried to imagine was not real.|$|R
2500|$|In anteroposterior (AP) views, the {{positions}} of the x-ray source and detector are reversed: the x-ray beam enters through the anterior aspect and exits through the posterior aspect of the chest. AP chest x-rays are harder to read than PA x-rays and are therefore generally reserved for situations where it is difficult for the patient to get an ordinary chest x-ray, such as when the patient is bedridden. [...] In this situation, mobile X-ray equipment is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> obtain a <b>lying</b> <b>down</b> chest x-ray (known as a [...] "supine film"). [...] As a result, most supine films are also AP.|$|R

5|$|Horses must <b>lie</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> reach REM sleep.

This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.|$|R
