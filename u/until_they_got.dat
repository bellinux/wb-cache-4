He sent dispatches to Scotland {{ordering}} that all runaways from the Covenanter regiments which broke at Marston Moor be returned, {{but not before}} every tenth deserter was hanged according to article 14 of Leven's Articles of War.

5|$|Despite the {{unfavorable}} {{developments in}} South Vietnam, North Vietnamese General Tran Van Tra believed North Vietnam and the Viet Cong could still {{win the war}} if they pursued a strategy of attrition. In other words, the Communists would have to fight on {{for as long as}} possible, until the United States recognized that the war was unwinnable and would disengage from the conflict in Vietnam. To achieve that objective at the tactical level, Tra argued that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces would have to destroy American military units, and cause as many casualties as possible <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> tired and left. Indeed, towards mid-1967 General Thanh, who had the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Division at his disposal, was out to do just that. In June, U.S. military forces in III Corps Tactical Zone began to detect the build-up of Viet Cong troops in northern Phuoc Vinh located War Zone D. To stop a major enemy attack on Phuoc Vinh, Major General John H. Hay—commander of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division—launched Operation Billings with the objective of trapping three Viet Cong battalions in War Zone D.|$|E

The regiments were ordered to report to Shreveport, Louisiana, to be paroled. None of them did so. Some soldiers went to Shreveport on their own to be paroled, but the regiments simply disbanded without formally surrendering.

25|$|Ford usually {{gave his}} actors little {{explicit}} direction, although on occasion he would casually {{walk through a}} scene himself, and actors were expected to note every subtle action or mannerism; if they did not, Ford would make them repeat the scene <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> it right, and he would often berate and belittle those who failed to achieve his desired performance. On The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Ford ran through a scene with Edmond O'Brien and ended by drooping his hand over a railing. O'Brien noticed this but deliberately ignored it, placing {{his hand on the}} railing instead; Ford would not explicitly correct him and he reportedly made O'Brien play the scene forty-two times before the actor relented and did it Ford's way.|$|E

Six Wildcats were on CAP duty and four were vectored toward the attacking aircraft while {{the other two were}} retained to cover the takeoff of the 10 Wildcats fueling on deck. The Japanese were jumped at 14:38 by two Wildcats which shot down one torpedo bomber before they were both shot down by the escorting Zeros. Two Zeros were shot down later for the loss of one Wildcat. Two more B5Ns were shot down before they could drop their torpedoes and three afterwards, but none of these aircraft hit the carrier. The last four torpedo bombers scored two hits (one B5N had its torpedo-release gear fail) on Yorktown that damaged three boilers and knocked out all electrical power so that she could not pump fuel oil to starboard to counteract her six degree list to port. Seventeen minutes later, after the list increased to 23 degrees, the crew was ordered to abandon ship. Of the four Zeros and five B5Ns that returned to Hiryū, only one Zero and three dive bombers were still flight-worthy.|$|E

500|$|More recent {{research}} has revealed {{that it was only}} Dr Francisco who told the news people that Elvis apparently died of heart failure. In fact, the doctors [...] "could say nothing with confidence <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> the results back from the laboratories, if then. That would be a matter of weeks." [...] One of the examiners, Dr E. Eric Muirhead [...] "could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached." [...] "Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [...] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments." [...] Therefore, Frank Coffey is of the opinion that a plausible cause of Elvis' death is [...] "a phenomenon called the Valsalva maneuver (essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppage— plausible because Elvis suffered constipation, a common reaction to drug use)..." [...] In similar terms, Dr Dan Warlick, who was present at the autopsy, [...] "believes Presley's chronic constipation— the result of years of prescription drug abuse and high-fat, high-cholesterol gorging— brought on what's known as Valsalva's maneuver. Put simply, the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singer's abdominal aorta, shutting down his heart." ...|$|E

The final hit single from this line-up, [...] "The Green Manalishi", was recorded in a difficult session after Green had announced he was leaving the band.

2500|$|From the insurers' {{point of}} view, medical {{underwriting}} {{is necessary to}} prevent people from purchasing health insurance coverage only when they are sick, pregnant or need medical care. Adverse selection {{is a system that}} attracts high-users and discourages low-users from participating. Proponents of underwriting believe that if given the ability to purchase coverage without regard for pre-existing medical conditions (no underwriting), people would wait to purchase health insurance <b>until</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> sick or needed medical care. Waiting to obtain health insurance coverage until one needs coverage then creates a pool of insureds with [...] "high use," [...] which then increases the premiums that insurance companies must charge to pay for the claims incurred. In turn, high premiums further discourage healthy people from obtaining coverage, particularly when they realize {{that they will be able}} to obtain coverage when they need medical care.|$|E
