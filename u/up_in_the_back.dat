5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether to stay together or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
25|$|On {{her final}} shot, Kim Schneider makes a nice draw {{around a corner}} guard. Jones then {{attempts}} to freeze on it, but wrecks on the guard, barely moving it. Holland then draws around it to sit two. Jones then decides to draw around her own stone sitting in the top 12ft, {{but it is a}} tad heavy and ends <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> 4ft. Amber Holland navigates through a port with soft weight, bumping it out to score three.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} the 2005 Tour de France, Ullrich was {{training}} when his team car stopped unexpectedly. Ullrich hit the back window, ending <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat of the car. Less than 24 hours later Ullrich was passed by Armstrong in the time trial. Ullrich fell again in the mountains, bruising his ribs. He could {{not keep up with}} Armstrong or Ivan Basso. Ullrich began focusing on finishing ahead of Michael Rasmussen for a podium position. He rode a good second time trial, beating all but Armstrong. Rasmussen had several crashes and bike changes, which gave Ullrich a podium place in the Tour.|$|E

500|$|Live {{shows on}} Tool's {{headline}} tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display. Keenan and Carey line <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor {{stand in the}} front, toward {{the sides of the}} stage. Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience. No followspots or live cameras are used; instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage [...] "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, [...] " [...] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows." [...] The big screens are used to play back [...] "looped clips that aren't tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They’ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice." [...] During the 10,000 Days tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, Chet Zar, Meats Meier, and Haggerty. Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD Disturb the Normal.|$|E
2500|$|The car had {{independent}} suspension all round with transverse wishbones {{at the front}} and Chapman struts at the rear. The rear struts were so long, that they poked <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and the tops could be seen through the rear window. The Series 2 cars, with Bristol-built bodies, had triangulated trailing radius arms for improved toe-in control.

2500|$|By the 1770s extreme hairstyles and wigs {{had come}} into fashion. Women wore their hair high upon their heads, in large plumes. To create tall extreme hair, rolls of horse hair, tow, or wool was used to raise up {{the front of the}} hair. The front of the hair was then frizzed out, or {{arranged}} in roll curls and set horizontally on the head. Women turned their hair <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> often in a knot. [...] In addition, pomatum and false hair was used to give more height to the hair. Pomatum was paste that women used to stiffen their hair. Pomatum was also used to hold powder, which women put in their hair. The Pomatum was made of many ingredients including hog's grease, tallow, or a mix of beef marrow and oil.|$|E

The full-length album, Dance or Die, received a favorable review in World Magazine.|$|R

60|$|My first {{consideration}} was to {{make him}} more clean, wherefore I fetched some water from a rivulet which I had noticed flow nigh to that place, and washed his hands and face, and {{so much of his}} body as seemed to me fitting. Then I gathered some fresh palm-leaves, and covered them over with a bit of sail which I found rolled <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> part of the hut, and having thus made thereof a clean and comfortable bed, I carried the poor wretch thither and laid him upon it.|$|E

50|$|The {{tour was}} a success, {{although}} problems plagued both nights. <b>In</b> London, since <b>the</b> stage {{had recently been}} repositioned, the sound system was incorrectly set <b>up</b> resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> track being too quiet (at one point the band stopped playing {{and listened to the}} crowd's conversation instead until the sound engineer could adjust <b>the</b> volume). <b>In</b> Vienna, excessive rain threatened to flood the venue, and indeed succeeded <b>in</b> flooding <b>the</b> toilets. The performance nevertheless went ahead and was well received.|$|R

60|$|Phineas Duge kept {{up during}} the day the {{assumption}} of severe indisposition. No one was allowed to see him. A bulletin posted outside {{announced that he had}} been ordered complete and entire rest; and all the time the telephone wires from his bedroom, high <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the house, were busy flashing messages east and west, all over the country. The work in which he had been engaged was zealously pushed home. No one saw his secretaries coming and going so often from his room, and neither of them was willing to admit, in fact they flatly denied when questioned, that they had seen their chief at all. Towards afternoon, Virginia returned from a short drive in the park to be told that two gentlemen were waiting to see her. She found no one in the drawing-room or waiting-room, however, or any of the usual reception-rooms, and rang the bell for the butler.|$|E

60|$|Now, {{as to the}} reading. I {{am sorry}} {{to say that it}} is out of the {{question}} this season. I have had an attack of rheumatism--quite a stranger to me--which remains hovering about my left side, after having doubled me <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> and which would disable me from standing for two hours. I have given up all dinners and town engagements, and come to my little Falstaff House here, sensible of the necessity of country training all through the summer. Smith would have proposed any appointment to see you on the subject, but he has been dreadfully ill with tic. Whenever I read in London, I will gladly put a night aside for your purpose, and we will plot to connect your name with it, and give it some speciality. But this could not be before Christmas time, as I should not be able to read sooner, for in the hot weather it would be useless. Let me hear from you about this when you have considered it. It would greatly diminish the expenses, remember.|$|E
60|$|We all know, on {{the other}} hand, the great station hotel {{belonging}} to the company of proprietors, which has suddenly sprung <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> outskirts of any place we like to name, and where we look out of our palatial windows at little back yards and gardens, old summer-houses, fowl-houses, pigeon-traps, and pigsties. We all know this hotel {{in which we can}} get anything we want, after its kind, for money; but where nobody is glad to see us, or sorry to see us, or minds (our bill paid) whether we come or go, or how, or when, or why, or cares about us. We all know this hotel, where we have no individuality, but put ourselves into the general post, as it were, and are sorted and disposed of according to our division. We all know that we can get on very well indeed at such a place, but still not perfectly well; and this may be, because the place is largely wholesale, and there is a lingering personal retail interest within us that asks to be satisfied.|$|E
60|$|Felix, coming one {{day into}} his wife's study--for the house knew not the word drawing-room--found Flora, with eyebrows lifted up and smiling lips, {{listening}} to Sheila proclaiming the doctrine {{that it was}} impossible not to live 'on one's own.' Nothing else--Felix learned--was compatible with dignity, or even with peace of mind. She had, therefore, taken a back room high up in a back street, in which she was going to live perfectly well on ten shillings a week; and, having thirty-two pounds saved up, she would be all right for a year, after which {{she would be able to}} earn her living. The principle she purposed to keep before her eyes was that of committing herself to nothing which would seriously interfere with her work in life. Somehow, it was impossible to look at this girl, with her glowing cheeks and her glowing eyes, and her hair frizzy from ardor, and to distrust her utterances. Yes! She would arrive, if not where she wanted, at all events somewhere; which, after all, was the great thing. And in fact she did arrive the very next day in the back room high <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> street, and neither Tod's cottage nor the house on the Spaniard's Road saw more than flying gleams of her, thenceforth.|$|E
5000|$|By 9 p.m., the Regulators and McSween {{made plans}} to break free of the house. Jim French went out first, {{followed}} by Billy the Kid, Tom O'Folliard, and Jose Chavez y Chavez. The Dolan men saw the running men and opened fire, killing Morris. Some US Cavalry troopers had arrived by that time, with instructions to make arrests to avoid executions by the Dolan Faction, and they'd taken <b>up</b> position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> yard to take those left into custody. However, a close-order gunfight erupted, and McSween was killed, as was Seven Rivers cowboy Bob Beckwith.|$|R
50|$|Walker had now dropped <b>back</b> to <b>the</b> left half {{position}} and lined <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> half <b>back</b> trio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final v Sheffield United at Old Trafford. The final {{became known as}} the Khaki final due to the number of servicemen in attendance. United though beat Chelsea’s 3-0. Andy then joined up and spent most of the next four years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forces. He did play two matches for Raith Rovers in 1916 but looked pretty rusty. Post war, he played three times for Chelsea in 1919/20 before joining Newport County in May 1920. He followed that with a spell at Accrington Stanley.|$|R
