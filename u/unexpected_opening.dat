[...] "As an earnest of this king's future conversion and translation to the kingdom of heaven," [...] says Bæda, with pardonable Northumbrian patriotic pride, [...] "even his temporal power was allowed to increase greatly, so that he did what no Englishman had done before–that is to say, he united under his own over-lordship all the provinces of Britain, whether inhabited by English or by Welsh." [...] Eadwine now took in marriage Æthelburh, daughter of Æthelberht, and sister of the reigning Kentish king. Justus seized the opportunity to introduce the Church into Northumbria. He ordained one Paulinus as bishop, to accompany the Christian lady, to watch over her faith, and if possible to convert her husband and his people.|$|E

In general, the 1500 tons submarines were able to dive in thirty seconds. Le Prométhée was still in a training phase {{and it was one}} of the boat's initial sorties at sea.

40|$|Missing You is a {{collection}} of three short stories, the first two of which are fiction and the third a memoir. Though these stories stand independently, they are linked through their Montreal setting, their grounding in the medical profession, and their theme of connection and control in intimate human relationships. In "Break," "Ward," and "Play," the central relationships explored are, respectively, husband-wife, child-mother and child-father. In each story, the basic need and desire for connection with some important other is palpable. The characters typically respond to this need and desire with a fear of loss of control, based on an underlying threat of absence, chaos, unreality and/or the annihilation of the self. When the other ultimately eludes control, it can be both shattering and depressing, {{but at the same time}} can provide an <b>unexpected</b> <b>opening</b> for connection to take place. Though each story originates within the conventions of realism, differing concerns for each necessitate differing perspectives and styles. The impressionistic interiority of the second-person in "Break" allows an appreciation of the depth of the protagonist's anxieties. The more distanced stance in the third-person "Ward" provides a level of objectivity in observing the protagonist, who both needs connection and is also herself an important other with whom connection is sought. Finally, the memoir-style approach of "Play" underscores the gradual, tectonic shifting, with episodic, sudden ruptures and transformations, that can characterize a person's relationship to the other over time. The conversational approach of this last story also suggests the importance of the reader as other...|$|E
40|$|Most authoritarian {{elections}} are non-competitive affairs, manipulated by state actors to guarantee seats for regime- backed candidates. However, on rare occasions, the state provides an <b>unexpected</b> electoral <b>opening</b> {{for the political}} opposition, leading to a defeat for regime-backed candidates. This dissertation traces these <b>unexpected</b> electoral <b>openings</b> to factional rivalries within the state's constitutional structure. Actors within an authoritarian state can be grouped broadly into conservative and reformist camps. Satisfied with the political status quo, conservatives oppose any meaningful steps toward political liberalization. In contrast, reformists aim to increase {{their share of the}} state by opening the political system to societal groups. The ability of reformists to change the electoral process and provide an electoral opening depends on the country's constitutional framework. The configuration of accountability relationships within the state, as well as the jurisdiction over the different parts of the electoral process, determines the leeway reformists have in steering the elections to their favor. This dissertation tests the above theory through comparative analyses of parliamentary elections in Egypt, Algeria, and Iran. The parliamentary {{elections are}} presented as qualitative stories. These stories identify relevant political agents, their preferences, and their powers, and then discuss political strategies adopted, constraints on strategies, and paths taken and paths rejected. By doing so, the narratives highlight the importance of institutional variation in determining electoral openings and outcomes in authoritarian system...|$|R

40|$|When {{designing}} concrete slabs, it {{is rather}} difficult to make a performant design that already takes the effect into account of <b>unexpected</b> <b>openings.</b> This is needed because it becomes unfortunately a common practice to add some openings at a final stage, which then requires rough time-saving rules. Even when the concrete is already casted some openings will be cut afterwards, certainly when a building gets refurbished in his life-time. Some standards require that if the reinforcement is designed for a homogeneous slab, the interrupted amount of reinforcement by the opening must be distributed around the opening. However, it is logical that for bigger openings, the flow of internal forces will {{be influenced by the}} opening itself. So {{it is clear that the}} previouslymentioned method can overestimates and, more dangerously, underestimates some reinforcements. To develop a more accurate design method, FEM analyses were conducted for different spans and opening sizes in slab areas with one- (central part) and two-way bearing (towards the edges) behaviour. Because flat slabs are much less sensible for openings, they are not included in this study. As result of this study, reduction and magnification factors were found which may be applied with an easy rule to obtain a better-performing method. These factors depend on the opening width/span ratio and must be normalized for the span in meters. In addition to the ultimate limit state, the service limit state was also verified. A magnification factor on the deformations must be applied, of the same order as that one on the lower reinforcement. This work was done in the scope of a new technical document about reinforcement for the Belgian Centre of Science and Technology for Construction Works...|$|R

40|$|Graphene is an {{extraordinary}} two-dimensional (2 D) system with chiral charge carriers and fascinating electronic, mechanical and thermal properties. In multilayer graphene, stacking order provides an important yet rarely explored degree of freedom for tuning its electronic properties. For instance, Bernal-stacked trilayer graphene (B-TLG) is semi-metallic with a tunable band overlap, and rhombohedral-stacked trilayer graphene (r-TLG) is predicted to be semiconducting with a tunable band gap. These multilayer graphenes are also expected to exhibit rich novel phenomena at low charge densities owing to enhanced electronic interactions and competing symmetries. Here we demonstrate the dramatically different transport properties in TLG with different stacking orders, and the <b>unexpected</b> spontaneous gap <b>opening</b> in charge neutral r-TLG. At the Dirac point, B-TLG remains metallic, whereas r-TLG becomes insulating with an intrinsic interaction-driven gap ~ 6 [*]meV. In magnetic fields, well-developed quantum Hall (QH) plateaux in r-TLG split into three branches at higher fields. Such splitting is a signature of the Lifshitz transition, a topological change in the Fermi surface, that is found only in r-TLG. Our results underscore the rich interaction-induced phenomena in trilayer graphene with different stacking orders, and its potential towards electronic applications...|$|R

In order to design effective novel targeted therapeutic approaches, gaining detailed insights into downstream ALK signaling is crucial. We and others identified PI 3 K/AKT and RAS/MAPK as major downstream signaling axes. Also, we connected FOXO 3 a controlled RET expression to the PI 3 K/AKT axis. Here, using multiple ALK activating and inhibiting cell models, we firmly establish ETV 5 {{as a major}} RAS/MAPK downstream target upregulated through mutant ALK. ETV 5 is known to act as regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and controls stem cell properties and neuronal cell fate decisions. Knockdown of ETV 5 reduced the clonogenic potential and growth of NB cells in vitro and in vivo. RNAseq transcriptome profiling following ETV 5 knock down provided an ETV 5 signature score which identifies patients with poor overall survival and was enriched in gene sets controlling EMT in keeping with observed reduced invasive properties in ETV 5 depleted NB cell lines. Finally, the chemokine receptor CXCR 4 emerged as a crucial ETV 5 target gene thus <b>opening</b> <b>unexpected</b> novel opportunities for drugging, as CXCR 4 inhibitors are available.

40|$|International audienceOnly {{three years}} have passed since the first volume on {{environment}} for multi-agent systems was published. In the meantime, the notion of environment hasbecome an active subject of research in multiagent systems and has stimulatedresearchers of various types of multiagent systems to exploit new opportunitiesfor their agent systems. In the preface of the first volume, Parunak noted that the environment hasbeen considered as a first-class member in the artificial life (AL) from the earlydays of this research line. During the three last years, an increasing numberof multiagent system studies have successfully applied bio-inspired approacheswhere the environment plays a crucial role. Several papers in this volume gener-alize this idea to different kinds of agent systems, making it a multiagent systemdesign principle: “taking away complexity from the agents’ internal structure andputting it in the environment enables designers to manage complexity better. ”This principle has influenced designers of artificial societies that apply normsto regulate agents’ interactions up to engineers that have developed real-worldtraffic control applications. Interestingly, the environment is also the key aspect of innovative approachesthat fruitfully reconcile the cognitive and the reactive point of views by havingboth kinds of agents cooperating through a delegate multiagent system soft-ware architecture. Also very interesting is the fact that classical environmentalprocesses such as diffusion and evaporation are extended to process high-levelinformation, introducing the notion of cognitive stigmergy. At the first E 4 MAS workshop in New York 2004, participating researcherswere mainly interested in comparing and sharing their visions on this both fun-damental but still fuzzy concept of environment. Despite the fact that there wasalready a general agreement that environments were essential for multiagent sys-tems, the very question “what is the very nature of an environment?” has notyet been fully answered. The papers in this volume clearly illustrate how the environment can activelysupport the mediation of interactions among agents. The environment can beprovided with different mechanisms and processes that enable agents to interactin original and <b>unexpected</b> ways, <b>opening</b> interesting research perspectives forthe multiagent systems community. So, even if there still remain some differenceson how researchers translate the concept of environment within their own agencyperspective, the benefits of considering the environment as a concrete and ac-tive entity {{is becoming more and more}} obvious. The E 4 MAS series volumes arewitnesses of this general awareness. Including both selected and revised papers from the third E 4 MAS workshopas well as invited papers, this volume shows the use of the environment at dif-ferent stages of the life cycle of multiagent systems. Without doubt, we are onlyat the beginning of exploiting the true potential that lies in the dynamics of theenvironment for multiagent systems. We hope that this volume is a stimulus forresearchers to further explore this fascinating research line further. Acknowledgements. We are grateful to the PC members for their criticalreview work.

40|$|Graphene is an {{exciting}} new atomically-thin two-dimensional (2 D) system of carbon atoms organized in a hexagonal lattice structure. This "wonder material" has been extensively studied {{in the last few}} years since it's first isolation in 2004. Its rapid rise to popularity in scientific and technological communities can be attributed to a number of its exceptional propertiess. In this thesis I will present several topics including fabrication of graphene devices, electrical and mechanical properties of graphene. I will start with a brief introduction of electronic transport in nanosclae system including quantum Hall effect, followed by a discussion of fundamental electrical and mechanical properties of graphene. Next I will describe how graphene devices are produced: from the famous "mechnical exfoliation" to our innovative "scratching exfoliation" method, together with the traditional lithography fabrication for graphene devices. We also developed a lithography-free technique for making electrical contacts to suspended graphene devices. Most of the suspended devices presented in this thesis are fabricated by this technique. Graphene has remarkable electrical properties thanks to its crystal and band structures. In Chapter 3, I will first focus on proximity-induced superconductivity in graphene Josephson transistors. In this section we investigate electronic transport in single layer graphene coupled to superconducting electrodes. We observe significant suppression in the critical current Ic and large variation in the product IcRn in comparison to theoretic prediction; both phenomena can be satisfactorily accounted for by premature switching in underdamped Josephson junctions. Another focus of our studies is quantum Hall effect and many body physics in graphene in suspended bilayer and trilayer graphene. We demenstrate that symmetry breaking of the first 3 Landau levels and fractional quantum Hall states are observed in both bilayer and trilayer suspended graphene devices. A surprising finding in these systems is the observation of insulating states in both suspended bilayer and trilayer graphene devices, which arises from electronic interactions. In bilayer graphene, we observe a phase transition between the single-particle metallic state and the interaction-induced insulating state in ultra-clean BLG, which can be tuned by temperature, disorder, charge density n and perpendicular electric field E. In trilayer graphene we demonstrate dramatically different transport properties arising from the different stacking orders, and an <b>unexpected</b> spontaneous gap <b>opening</b> in charge neutral ABC-stacked trilayer graphene. One of graphene's unique properties is that it is nature's thinnest elastic membrane with exceptional mechanical properties. In chapter 7 I will describe the first direct observation and controlled creation of one- and two-dimensional periodic ripples in suspended graphene sheets, using both spontaneously and thermally generated strains. We are able to control ripple orientation, wavelength and amplitude by controlling boundary conditions and exploiting graphene's negative thermal expansion coefficient, which we measure to be much larger than that of graphite. In addition, we also study the morphological change of suspended graphene sheets by apply gate voltages, which is a simple and direct method to strain and buckle graphene. Our experimental results contribute to the fundamental understanding of electrical and mechanical properties of graphene, and may have important implications for future graphene based applications...|$|R
