He was the eldest of seven {{brothers}} born into a Congregationalist family of the 10acre-owning farmer James Webster. Webster acquired the small Fountain Head Brewery in Ovenden Wood in 1838 when he was 25 and opened an office in <b>Union</b> <b>Cross</b> Yard, Halifax. The company bought its first public house in 1845. In 1860 he was joined in partnership by his three sons Isaac, George Henry and Samuel Green, and the firm began trading as Samuel Webster & Sons.

5000|$|The IWW {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} all workers in one big union. Ever cognizant of the common practice of AFL craft <b>unions</b> <b>crossing</b> each other's picket lines, the IWW adopted the WFM's description of the AFL as the [...] "American Separation of Labor." ...|$|R
5|$|Later, {{the player}} visits the Moogle's shop and discovers {{it has been}} {{attacked}} by a giant Heartless. The player helps four Keyblade wielders chase down the Heartless in the sewers but it proves to be very powerful while in water. While the four Keyblade wielders hold it off, the player drains out the water and defeats the giant Heartless. Afterwards, they return to the Moogle's shop just as the Moogle has repaired the damage and returns to chat with the four Keyblade Wielders, who now admit that they are friends and continues {{to assist them in}} various missions (either together, separately, or alone). Throughout this point, significant scenes are shown as the player progresses (which actually take place in the real world either before or after the Keyblade War): the first scene takes place {{after the end of the}} Keyblade War, where Ephemer meets up with Skuld, revealing that they are two of the five people selected to become new Foretellers. Two others selected Keyblade Wielders, Ventus and Brain, appear to greet them followed by the fifth selected person, Lauriam (who is the original form of Marluxia). Later, they come to the Foreteller's room where they learn that they must start their own unions and to avoid the terrible incidents that happened in the past, they decide to create Spirit Dream Eaters to help the other Keyblade Wielders. The second shows a flashback of the Master of Masters instructing Ava to form the Dandelions and select five of them to be the new Foretellers, who also plans to give the Book of Prophecies to one of them. Ava later informs this to Ephemer and plans to have him and four others become the new Foretellers. The third shows Chrithy informing Ephemer and Skuld that the player's character is dreaming and Ephemer warns them that a stronger source of darkness is coming and plans to form the <b>Union</b> <b>Cross</b> to stop it while encouraging Chrithy to protect the player. The fourth introduces Strelitzia, a Dandelion Keyblade Wielder who has secretly been following the player on their quest until being recruited by Ava, revealing that she is the true fifth selected Keyblade Wielder. She is skeptical of this but is encouraged by her Chrithy to do so, despite also having doubts. After realizing that the player is not a Dandelion, she decides to find and convince them to join the Dandelions. While searching a dark building, she and her Chrithy are ambushed by an unseen person, who steals the book that Ava gave her. The dying Strelitzia carries her Chrithy towards the door before they fade from existence. Later (taking place after the player fights Master Aced), the story itself goes through an entirely different plot after that. The player and Chrithy later meet another Chrithy, who entrusts them a gift from the Foretellers, a Spirit Dream Eater.|$|E
25|$|On July 22, Governor Wilbur L. Cross of Connecticut asked Governor Martin L. Davey of Ohio and Governor Lehman of New York to {{meet with}} him and Rand's {{president}} to discuss an end to the strike.

2500|$|The Organization XIII {{characters}} {{were created by}} Tetsuya Nomura, director of the series, {{and other members of}} his development staff. The concept began with Xemnas as the first member and Roxas as the last. Each member's name is an anagram of their name prior to becoming a Nobody, with the letter [...] "X" [...] added to it. As of the latest storyline development in the mobile game <b>Union</b> <b>Cross</b> in 2017, the names of the Organization members' original selves are all known except for Demyx, Luxord, and Larxene. The emblem associated with the Nobodies and Organization XIII was designed to look like a splintered heart as a complement to the Heartless emblem. Nomura tried to portray the characters ambiguously, rather than explicitly good or evil. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events related to and connections between the Organization XIII characters—along with the series' other characters—unexplained until the release of sequels; he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination.|$|E
