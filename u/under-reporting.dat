5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in <b>under-reporting</b> (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

25|$|Public Health {{surveillance}} {{systems can}} be passive or active. A passive surveillance system consists of the regular, ongoing reporting of diseases and conditions by all health facilities in a given territory. An active surveillance system is one where health facilities are visited and health care providers and medical records are reviewed {{in order to identify}} a specific disease or condition. Passive surveillance systems are less time consuming and less expensive to run but risk <b>under-reporting</b> of some diseases. Active surveillance systems are most appropriate for epidemics or where a disease has been targeted for elimination.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the central}} {{government}} revised the law on the control of infectious diseases in March 2004. The revision provides instructions to tackle infectious-disease outbreaks, improve the reporting of infectious diseases, implement interventions to control the spread of such diseases, provide clinical services, and fund the control of infectious diseases. This law directly benefited tuberculosis control by addressing the <b>under-reporting</b> of tuberculosis by health facilities. Tuberculosis now has to be reported to local public-health authorities within 24 hours. Because failure to report is now a crime, hospitals have begun to take the reporting of tuberculosis very seriously.|$|E

25|$|<b>Under-reporting</b> {{of deaths}} {{was also a}} problem. The death {{registration}} system, which was inadequate before the famine, was completely overwhelmed by {{the large number of}} deaths during the famine. In addition, many deaths went unreported so that family members of the deceased could continue to draw the deceased's food ration. Counting the number of children who both were born and died between the 1953 and 1964 censuses is problematic. However, Ashton, et al. believe that because the reported number of births during the GLF seems accurate, the reported number of deaths should be accurate as well. Massive internal migration made both population counts and registering deaths problematic, though Yang believes the degree of unofficial internal migration was small and Cao's estimate takes internal migration into account.|$|E
25|$|A 2012 review found {{a number}} of adverse events were {{reported}} after acupuncture in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) but most (95%) were not severe, though miscategorization and <b>under-reporting</b> may alter the total figures. From January 2009 to December 2011, 468 safety incidents were recognized within the NHS organizations. The adverse events recorded included retained needles (31%), dizziness (30%), loss of consciousness/unresponsive (19%), falls (4%), bruising or soreness at needle site (2%), pneumothorax (1%) and other adverse side effects (12%). Acupuncture practitioners should know, {{and be prepared to}} be responsible for, any substantial harm from treatments. Some acupuncture proponents argue that the long history of acupuncture suggests it is safe. However, there is an increasing literature on adverse events (e.g. spinal-cord injury).|$|E

25|$|Lindsay {{initiated}} an anti-trust {{lawsuit against}} the league, alleging a monopoly since 1926. The players had a strong case, that could be easily proved with an exposure of the Norris syndicate's operations, and Frank Calder's efforts against the American Hockey Association (AHA) in 1926 and 1932, ironically involving James E. Norris on the AHA side. Also, the various Norris arenas were hiding revenues through ticket scalping and <b>under-reporting</b> arena capacities and actual ticket sales.

25|$|A 2011 {{systematic}} review of {{systematic review}}s (internationally and without language restrictions) found that serious complications following acupuncture {{continue to be}} reported. Between 2000 and 2009, ninety-five cases of serious adverse events, including five deaths, were reported. Many such events are not inherent to acupuncture but are due to malpractice of acupuncturists. This might be why such complications have not been reported in surveys of adequately-trained acupuncturists. Most such reports originate from Asia, which may reflect {{the large number of}} treatments performed there or a relatively higher number of poorly trained Asian acupuncturists. Many serious adverse events were reported from developed countries. These included Australia, Austria, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. The number of adverse effects reported from the UK appears particularly unusual, which may indicate less <b>under-reporting</b> in the UK than other countries. Reports included 38 cases of infections and 42 cases of organ trauma. The most frequent adverse events included pneumothorax, and bacterial and viral infections.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 Suzuki's career came to {{an abrupt}} halt when Eiji Yamada, the President of her {{production}} company AG Communication, was convicted on tax evasion charges. AG Communication had evaded tax by <b>under-reporting</b> their earnings, and by consequence were underpaying royalties to artists. Suzuki's parents Tadao and Miyako Suzuki sued AG Communication for termination of her contract on these grounds, and that the association would taint her squeaky clean image. They attempted to set up a subsidiary called Music Tribe to solve the problem. The Tokyo District Court found in her favor, but the lawsuit resulted in Ami Suzuki's blacklisting because of an unwritten rule of the entertainment business in Japan: artists who get into legal disputes with their agents are blacklisted. In court documents, it was revealed that AG Communication had paid her very little to begin with: despite eight-figure record sales that year, Suzuki earned just $1500 a month at the start of her career, and a minuscule 0.4% royalty rate on CDs, raised to $9780 and 0.55% in 1999.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the {{proposed}} paper, an attempt {{is made to}} estimate the proportion of unstated income for Russian households based on micro data.

The resulting subsample estimates were applied to the general population and compared with those obtained by other researchers using alternative methods and other data.

25|$|In {{response}} to aforementioned shortcoming in the tsunami warning system, JMA have started investigation in year 2011 and updated their system in 2013. In the updated system, for powerful earthquake with possibility {{to cause the}} JMA magnitude scale to saturate, no quantitative prediction will be released in the initial warning, and instead there will be words that describe the situation's emergency. It have been planned to install new teleseismometers with ability to measure larger earthquake to prevent the inability to calculate moment magnitude scale in timely manner. A simpler empirical method to integrate data from GPS tidal meter as well as undersea water pressure meter into tsunami warning have been deployed, {{and there are also}} plan to install more of these meters and develop further technology to utilize data observed from them. To prevent <b>under-reporting</b> tsunami height, early quantitative observation data that are smaller than expected amplitude will be overridden and public will instead get told the situation is under observation.An additional report on possibility of tsunami about 90 seconds after earthquakes will also be included into observation report in order to warn people before JMA magnitude can be calculated.|$|E
500|$|The <b>under-reporting</b> {{was exposed}} through a {{revision}} of the forecast for the 2009 budget deficit from [...] "6–8%" [...] of GDP (no greater than 3% of GDP was a rule of the Maastricht Treaty) to 12.7%, almost immediately after PASOK won the October 2009 Greek national elections. Large upwards revision of budget deficit forecasts due to the international financial crisis were not limited to Greece: for example, in the United States forecast for the 2009 budget deficit was raised from $407 billion projected in the 2009 fiscal year budget, to $1.4 trillion, while in the United Kingdom there was a final forecast more than 4 {{times higher than the}} original. In Greece, the low ("6–8%") forecast was reported until very late in the year (September 2009), clearly not corresponding to the actual situation.|$|E
500|$|Because {{records from}} the period are {{incomplete}} and inconsistent in format, {{the total number of}} bal maidens working in this period is unclear. Estimates for the total number employed {{at the end of the}} 18thcentury range from 1,200 to 5,000, with women and children constituting up to half the total number of people working in copper mining and a lower proportion in the less labour-intensive tin mining. Mayers(2008) estimates that at a minimum 55,000 women and girls in total worked as bal maidens between 1720 and 1921, based on an estimate of each working an average of 10 years, with the number peaking in the early 1860s at at least 7,000. The actual figures are likely to have been considerably higher; not all mines recorded male and female workers separately, and after 1872 there may have been deliberate <b>under-reporting</b> of the [...] number of children working, owing to legal restrictions on their employment. These estimates do not include female workers performing non-manual administrative work at the mines, nor those in related industries such as slate and [...] quarrying.|$|E

500|$|As one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} and widely distributed sharks on Earth, the silky shark was once thought to be mostly immune to depletion despite heavy fishing mortality. In 1989 alone, some 900,000 individuals were taken as bycatch in the southern and central Pacific tuna longline fishery, seemingly without effect on the total population. Fishery data on this shark are often confounded by <b>under-reporting,</b> lack of species-level separation, and problematic identification. Nevertheless, mounting evidence indicates the silky shark has, in fact, declined substantially worldwide, a consequence of its modest reproductive rate which is unable to sustain such high levels of exploitation. The total annual catch reported to the Food and Agricultural Organization fell steadily from 11,680tons [...] in 2000 to 4,358tons in 2004. Regional assessments have found similar trends, estimating declines of some 90% in the central Pacific from the 1950s to the 1990s, 60% off Costa Rica from 1991to2000, 91% in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1950s to the 1990s, and 85% (for all large requiem sharks) in the northwestern Atlantic from 1986to2005. The silky shark fishery off Sri Lanka reported a drop from a peak catch of 25,400tons in 1994 to only 1,960tons in 2006, indicative of a local stock collapse. However, Japanese fisheries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans have recorded no change in catch rate between the 1970s and the 1990s, and the validity of the methodologies used to assess declines in the Gulf of Mexico and the northwestern Atlantic have come under much debate.|$|E
