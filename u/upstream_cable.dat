Introduction High-speed digital modems are currently being developed for wire-line access networks, like CATV networks and Digital Subscriber Lines as well as for broadband wireless communications, e. g. wireless LAN, wireless ATM or mobile broadband systems. A common aspect of these modems is that they make use of complex signal processing algorithms, like adaptive equalizers, Viterbi decoders and FFTs, that have to be performed at high speed.

40|$|In recent years, the {{state-of-the-art}} {{in field}} {{programmable gate array}} (FPGA) technology has been advancing rapidly. Consequently, the use of FPGAs is being considered in many applications which have traditionally relied upon application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). FPGA-based designs have a number of advantages over ASIC-based designs, including lower up-front engineering design costs, shorter time-to-market, and the ability to reconfigure devices in the field. However, ASICs have a major advantage in terms of computational resources. As a result, expensive high performance ASIC algorithms must be redesigned to fit the limited resources available in an FPGA. Concurrently, coaxial cable television and internet networks have been undergoing significant upgrades that have largely been driven by a sharp increase in the use of interactive applications. This has intensified demand for the so-called upstream channels, which allow customers to transmit data into the network. The format and protocol of the upstream channels are defined by a set of standards, known as DOCSIS 3. 0, which govern the flow of data through the network. Critical to DOCSIS 3. 0 compliance is the upstream demodulator, which is responsible for the physical layer reception from all customers. Although upstream demodulators have typically been implemented as ASICs, the design of an FPGA-based upstream demodulator is an intriguing possibility, as FPGA-based demodulators could potentially be upgraded in the field to support future DOCSIS standards. Furthermore, the lower non-recurring engineering costs associated with FPGA-based designs could provide an opportunity for smaller companies to compete in this market. The upstream demodulator must contain complicated synchronization circuitry to detect, measure, and correct for channel distortions. Unfortunately, many of the synchronization algorithms described in the open literature are not suitable for either <b>upstream</b> <b>cable</b> channels or FPGA implementation. In this thesis, computationally inexpensive and robust synchronization algorithms are explored. In particular, algorithms for frequency recovery and equalization are developed. The many data-aided feedforward frequency offset estimators analyzed in the literature have not considered intersymbol interference (ISI) caused by micro-reflections in the channel. It is shown in this thesis that many prominent frequency offset estimation algorithms become biased in the presence of ISI. A novel high-performance frequency offset estimator which is suitable for implementation in an FPGA is derived from first principles. Additionally, a rule is developed for predicting whether a frequency offset estimator will become biased in the presence of ISI. This rule is used to establish a channel excitation sequence which ensures the proposed frequency offset estimator is unbiased. Adaptive equalizers that compensate for the ISI take a relatively long time to converge, necessitating a lengthy training sequence. The convergence time is reduced using a two step technique to seed the equalizer. First, the ISI equivalent model of the channel is estimated in response to a specific short excitation sequence. Then, the estimated channel response is inverted with a novel algorithm to initialize the equalizer. It is shown that the proposed technique, while inexpensive to implement in an FPGA, can decrease the length of the required equalizer training sequence by up to 70 symbols. It is shown that a preamble segment consisting of repeated 11 -symbol Barker sequences which is well-suited to timing recovery can also be used effectively for frequency recovery and channel estimation. By performing these three functions sequentially using a single set of preamble symbols, the overall length of the preamble may be further reduced...|$|E
5000|$|Myrinet {{physically}} {{consists of}} two fibre optic <b>cables,</b> <b>upstream</b> and downstream, connected to the host computers with a single connector. Machines are connected via low-overhead routers and switches, as opposed to connecting one machine directly to another.

50|$|The initial default {{hardware}} implementation for AppleTalk was {{a high-speed}} serial protocol known as LocalTalk that used the Macintosh's built-in RS-422 ports at 230.4 kbit/s. LocalTalk used a splitter {{box in the}} RS-422 port to provide an <b>upstream</b> and downstream <b>cable</b> from a single port. The topology was a bus: cables were daisy-chained from each connected machine to the next, up to the maximum of 32 permitted on any LocalTalk segment. The system was slow by today's standards, {{but at the time}} the additional cost and complexity of networking on PC machines was such that it was common that Macs were the only networked personal computers in an office. Other larger computers, such as UNIX or VAX workstations, would commonly be networked via Ethernet.|$|R
40|$|An {{initialization}} {{protocol for}} a CDMA based communications system for {{hybrid fiber coax}} (HFC) central antenna television (CATV) networks is described. HFC CATV networks are shared medium access networks, employing the coaxial bus principle between an optical network terminator and the subscriber. To realize access in the upstream direction, a multiple access scheme based on CDMA can be used. However, before access is granted in the <b>upstream</b> direction, each <b>cable</b> modem connected to the coaxial bus needs to undergo a startup procedure at activation of the modem to determine timing and physical layer related settings. The initialization mechanism described performs time synchronization of a modem and {{the determination of the}} power the modem should use. Next to these physical layer settings, also the identity of a modem is determined during the initialization proces...|$|R
50|$|A major {{disadvantage}} to {{this style}} of connector {{is that it can}} be mated with one connector reversed, reversing ground and line connections. For equipment mechanically attached to grounded building structures such as a lighting instrument mounted to a batten or grid this will cause a line-ground short circuit. For equipment not attached to a building ground, such as a floor-mounted lighting instrument, this condition will cause the chassis of the equipment to become electrified creating a shock hazard. Care must therefore be taken to avoid misaligning plugs. It is also possible to mate stage pin connectors such that the ground pin is inserted into the neutral socket and the neutral pin is inserted into the ground socket, but this mistake does not usually result in a fault condition unless there is a hot-neutral reverse <b>upstream</b> in the <b>cabling.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Soldiers {{stationed}} in the region frequently used the bridge, and two battalions of the same regiment had crossed earlier that day. The third battalion arrived during a powerful thunderstorm when the wind was making the bridge oscillate. When the soldiers began to cross, they gave the wind still more purchase. Survivors {{reported that they had}} been walking as if drunk and could barely keep themselves from falling, first to one side and then to the other. As usual in crossing that bridge, the soldiers had been ordered to break step and to space themselves farther apart than normal. However, their efforts to match the swaying and keep their balance may have caused them to involuntarily march with the same cadence, contributing to the resonance. In any case, the oscillation increased. At a time when the bridge was covered with 483 soldiers and four other people (though the police had prevented many curiosity seekers from joining the march), the <b>upstream</b> anchoring <b>cable</b> on the right bank broke in its concrete mooring, three to four meters underground, with a noise like [...] "a badly done volley from a firing squad". The adjacent downstream cable broke a second later, and the right-bank end of the deck fell, making the deck slope very steeply and throwing soldiers into the river. Many of those who fell were saved by their fellow soldiers who had not yet crossed and by residents of Angers who came to the rescue, but a total of 226 people died.|$|R
