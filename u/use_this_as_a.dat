Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> starting point for the defence.|$|E
5|$|Archibald {{and colleagues}} {{suggested}} the life habits of extinct Myrmeciinae ants including Prionomyrmex {{may have been}} similar to extant ants within the subfamily. These ants foraged {{on the ground and}} possibly onto trees and low vegetation while preying on arthropods. These ants may have collected plant nectar, as Myrmecia species <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> food source. Workers may have not recruited nest mates to food sources or lay down pheromone trails, as these ants were solitary hunters. Workers would have relied on their vision to hunt for prey and help themselves navigate.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E

5|$|As {{the term}} double burden might suggest, when people {{consider}} paid work vs. unpaid work, they often consider them as two separate entities - {{that the man}} or woman is doing one or the other, {{but not at the}} same time. In reality, men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously, creating the issue of work intensity, where the person undertakes many activities {{at the same time in}} order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day. Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time, and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning, or sewing while taking care of the children. Because of this, the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated. This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries. For example, many Caribbean rural women <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> method of increasing the number of things they can accomplish in a day.|$|E

25|$|Violations {{of trade}} treaty {{obligations}} by Austria were considered by Napoleon to be insufficient grounds for a war. There was discussion {{of whether the}} presence of an Austrian military garrison in Bologna might justify war against Austria, but the French emperor was in the end reluctant to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pretext. There were Austrian troops not only in Bologna but also in Rome preserving the status quo, but in Rome there were also French troops for broadly similar reasons, and parallels between the garrisoning of Bologna and of Rome were uncomfortably close.|$|E
25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show just so they could cut him off.|$|E

25|$|On 27 October 1496, the Chapter of Notre Dame Cathedral {{ordered all}} the priests in the diocese {{to give up}} any women they were living with. There was violent {{opposition}} to this. The following year he got one vote in the election for Archbishop of Rheims and Jan was persuaded to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> challenge to the dubious methods used by the winner, the candidate of the King. Charles VIII had died and the new king, Louis XII was crowned by the new archbishop at Rheims Cathedral on 17 December 1498. To consolidate his position, Louis divorced his wife, Jeanne, and married the widow, Queen Anne, of the late King, who had been his nephew. Jan unwisely advised the Queen against the marriage and preached against divorce (interestingly enough, except in cases of adultery). Early the following year, he, {{along with the other}} Doctors in the University went on strike in protest against what they saw as unlawful interference in their affairs by the King. He was prominent in setting out their case. He also helped one of the more forceful opponents of the divorce escape. The King got his divorce and set about punishing his opponents. Standonck was lucky to get only two years exile. He handed over direction of the College to Noël Béda and John Mair and set off to Cambrai in his native Flanders, where he was welcomed by the Bishop.|$|E

Renolds, was summoned before the committee for a hearing, where Minton demanded to know why he was accepting money from corporations. When Renolds asked his manager, Dr. Glen Frank, to help him answer the questions, Minton and fellow Democratic senators began to shout Dr. Frank down. As he was saying that the money from the corporations was for advertising in the magazine, Minton beat his gavel and yelled, [...] "This committee doesn't intend to permit you to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> forum to air your Republican views." ...|$|E

500|$|The Dano-Swedish War of 1658–60 ( [...] , , [...] ) was a {{war between}} Denmark–Norway and Sweden. It was a {{continuation}} of an earlier conflict between the two belligerents which had ended just months earlier, after Sweden and Denmark brokered a peace agreement in Roskilde in 1658. In the aftermath of that conflict, the Swedish king Charles X Gustav desired to add the province of Royal Prussia in Poland to the Swedish realm, but his position in the region was not strong enough with the opposition of Brandenburg and Austria. However, the Danes stalled and prolonged the fulfillment of some provisions of the earlier peace; the Swedish king decided to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> pretext to attack with an ambitious goal: to vanquish Denmark as a sovereign state and raze the capital of Copenhagen. A quick and decisive defeat of Denmark was however only seen {{as a means to}} a greater end. The long-term goal was to wage war in Europe without fearing Danish interference.|$|E

2500|$|British strategists {{argued over}} {{the nature of}} British {{strategy}} in the 1939–1941 period, the essence of which formed the fundamental base of RAF strategy throughout the war.

Some in the Air Ministry argued that the bombing technology was not accurate {{and as a result of}} this precision attacks could not be undertaken. To support their findings, they used the Butt report, which indicated only 30% of RAF bombers arrived within the target area, and just 10% within the Ruhr region. Those in RAF Bomber Command who were in favour of precision bombing of selected targets criticised the report as [...] "selective". When Air Marshal Arthur Harris took over RAF Bomber Command in 1942, he was to <b>use</b> <b>this</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tool to push for his area bombing policies.|$|E
