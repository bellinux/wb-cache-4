50|$|The {{threat of}} vouchers, {{wavering}} support for public education, and bipartisan support for charters {{has led some}} unions to start charters themselves.

50|$|In 2006, an {{elephant}} slaughter was documented in southeastern Chad by aerial surveys. A series of poaching incidents, {{resulting in the}} killing of over 100 elephants, was carried out from May to August, 2006 in the vicinity of Zakouma National Park. This region has a decades-old history of poaching of elephants, which has caused the population of the region, which exceeded 300,000 in 1970, to drop to about 10,000 today. The African bush elephant officially is protected by Chadian government, but the resources and manpower provided by the government (with some European <b>Union</b> <b>assistance)</b> have proven insufficient to stop the poaching.|$|E

In November 2005 two agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority permitted the reopening of the crossing with third-party European <b>Union</b> <b>assistance.</b> However the movement of people would be very restricted and goods should pass through another checkpoint (Kerem Shalom), under the supervision of Israelis and monitored by EU monitors. In 2006, the Rafah crossing was opened up to June. During the rest of the year it was open during 31 days at random.|$|E

5000|$|Robin Gollan {{argues in}} The Coalminers of New South Wales that {{anti-competitive}} practices {{developed in the}} coal industry of Australia's Newcastle {{as a result of}} the business cycle. The monopoly was generated by formal meetings of the local management of coal companies agreeing to fix a minimum price for sale at dock. This collusion was known as [...] "The Vend". The Vend ended and was reformed repeatedly during the late 19th century, ending by recession in the business cycle. [...] "The Vend" [...] was able to maintain its monopoly due to trade <b>union</b> <b>assistance,</b> and material advantages (primarily coal geography). During the early 20th century, as a result of comparable monopolistic practices in the Australian coastal shipping business, the Vend developed as an informal and illegal collusion between the steamship owners and the coal industry, eventually resulting in the High Court case Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd v. R. & AG.|$|E
50|$|The tunnel {{was opened}} for traffic in 1862. It {{was on the}} Lentvaris - Kaunas - Virbalis branch towards Prussia, of the Saint Petersburg-Warsaw railway. The tunnel's gauge was rebuilt to {{standard}} gauge by the Germans during World War I. The Kaunas tunnel was bombed by the retreating armed forces of Germany on 30 July 1944. The biggest explosion deformed a 100-metre-long section of the tunnel. The Soviet army rebuilt the tunnel in 1,5 months later in 1944.The explosions changed the hydrological condition of the tunnel. Water began to deform the tunnel in 1947-1948. Minor reconstruction {{was carried out in}} 1949. A train accident occurred in the tunnel in 1963. It was determined to leave one rail track, instead of two in 1964. Passenger locomotives were completely replaced by electric locomotives in 1975. As the last repairs on the tunnel had only been made in 1972, railway traffic was not safe due to the existing emergency state of the tunnel, thus, the speed of the traffic was limited to 40 km/h. In 2002−2003 the Danish company Niras made adjustments to the feasibility study, and an application for European <b>Union</b> <b>assistance</b> was made in accordance with the conclusions drawn by this company. The tunnel reconstruction project was launched in 2007.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the fall}} of the Soviet <b>Union,</b> <b>assistance</b> to civil society has been at the {{forefront}} of the European Union’s (EU) strategy in its post-Soviet Eastern neighbourhood. The literature on the EU support to civil society in post-Soviet countries has so far primarily focused on democratisation and the research assessing the effects of EU assistance to civil society has been limited. This study builds on existing literature about the EU cooperation with civil society in the South Caucasus by focusing on the following question. How successful were the EU’s efforts in supporting civil society in the South Caucasus so far? By relying on a combination of qualitative elite interviews and secondary sources, this article assesses the impact of the key EU initiatives and programmes implemented in the South Caucasus during the past two decades. It is concluded here that despite steady improvements of EU policies and approaches of empowering civil actors in the region, the European Union’s assistance to civil society in the South Caucasus region remains inconsistent and limited...|$|E
