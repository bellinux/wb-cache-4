5|$|Cordyline australis is a light-demanding pioneer species, and {{seedlings}} die when overtopped {{by other}} trees. To grow well, young plants require open space {{so they are}} not shaded out by other vegetation. Another requirement is water during the seedling stage. Although adult trees can store water and are drought resistant, seedlings need a good supply of water to survive. This stops the species from growing in sand dunes <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> are wet depressions present, and from hillsides <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> is a seepage area. The {{fertility of the soil}} is another factor—settlers in Canterbury used the presence of the species to situate their homesteads and gardens. The fallen leaves of the tree also help to raise the fertility of the soil when they break down. Another factor is temperature, especially the degree of frost. Young trees are killed by frost, and even old trees can be cut back. This is why C.australis is absent from upland areas and from very frosty inland areas.|$|E

5|$|As a large country {{spanning}} {{over three}} timezones, Indonesia possesses a vast airspace. However, Indonesia {{is not a}} participant of the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), therefore both Indonesian airspace and airports are closed for foreign commercial airlines' freedoms of the air, <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> were bilateral transit agreements negotiated with other countries. Indonesia and Australia for example, signed a bilateral agreement relating to air service on 7 February 2013. According to this agreement, each nations grants to the other party the right to fly across its territory without landing, {{and the right to}} make stops in its territory for non-traffic purposes (1st and 2nd freedom), and the rights for designated airlines to operate services.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{faithful}} {{are obliged to}} attend Mass <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> is a grave impediment, pastors have the corresponding duty to offer everyone the real possibility of fulfilling the precept....

5|$|In 2011, Fox {{announced}} that, due {{to financial}} difficulties, {{they were unable}} to continue to produce The Simpsons under its current contract and that <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> were pay cuts, the show could end. For the negotiations, the studio requested that the cast members accept a 45% cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the last. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30%, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut.|$|E

5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and {{were not in the}} bombed area. No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the bombing appeared to have destroyed a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{submitted}} that such judicial {{deference to the}} executive results in a clear neglect of the enshrined fundamental liberties in the Constitution. The flip side to this criticism is that fundamental liberties may still be given due accord though other avenues, for example, the application of rules of natural justice. As the meaning accorded to a particular fundamental liberty may be a potential ground for overturning Parliamentary legislation, {{it is crucial that}} the court should not merely rely on international law to determine the meaning of the liberty, <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> is evidence that the executive considers there is indeed an adoption of the particular international law norm.|$|E

If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss teams will be left out.|$|E

5|$|A delegation, {{consisting}} of {{the representatives of the}} twelve important clans of Medina, invited Muhammad to serve as chief arbitrator for the entire community; due to his status as a neutral outsider. There was fighting in Yathrib: primarily the dispute involved its Arab and Jewish inhabitants, and was estimated to have lasted for around a hundred years before 620. The recurring slaughters and disagreements over the resulting claims, especially after the Battle of Bu'ath in which all clans were involved, made it obvious to them that the tribal concept of blood-feud and {{an eye for an eye}} were no longer workable <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> was one man with authority to adjudicate in disputed cases.

5|$|A {{more general}} medical and {{neurological}} examination {{may be needed}} to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, AIDS dementia complex, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy Body dementia may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> is a specific medical indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies.|$|E
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of hormone replacement and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E

5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability.

5|$|In 1995, {{a tunnel}} was {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the Connector, traveling underneath Horace J.

The same year, Mirage Resorts president Steve Wynn proposed a new casino resort in the marina district, and stated that resort would not be built <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> was better access to the site. Additional plans were later researched, and six different plans were proposed. The plans included the tunnel underneath Horace J. Bryant Drive, a tunnel underneath the adjacent Penrose Canal, two alternative tunnel locations, the elevated highway above the wetlands, and the improvement of existing streets to direct traffic through the city. Transportation officials determined all of the plans, except for the first two tunnel proposals, to have significant drawbacks.|$|E
5|$|King Philip VI of France (1293–1350) {{stayed at}} the castle in 1332. Due to the Anglo-French {{hostilities}} the castle was playing an increasingly important role.

The castle was yielded reluctantly to Edward III of England's regent in France, John Chandos, on 25 October 1361. He had brought {{the brother of the}} keeper to the castle and threatened to behead him <b>unless</b> <b>there</b> was an immediate capitulation. French troops commanded by the Duke of Bouillon and Geoffroy III of Rochefoucauld laid siege to the castle in 1380, but it did not yield until five years later.
