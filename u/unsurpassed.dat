U-70s {{contribution}} {{came in the form of}} ten ships of 23,530 tons sent to the bottom, four of them on the same day, 24 April.|$|E
5|$|In performance, Mina {{combined}} several modern styles {{with traditional}} Italian melodies and swing music, {{which made her}} the most versatile pop singer in Italian music. Mina dominated the country's charts for fifteen years and reached an <b>unsurpassed</b> level of popularity. She has scored 79 albums and 71 singles on the Italian charts.|$|E
5|$|The victory made Woodfull {{the only}} captain {{to regain the}} Ashes twice. He scored 1,268 runs at 52.83 during the tour with three centuries. His tally of 25 Tests as captain was a world record and {{remained}} <b>unsurpassed</b> {{for a quarter of}} a century.|$|E
5|$|After this rejection, the {{painting}} was sold to a Swedish art collector who offered {{to sell it to}} the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million Swedish kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if {{the painting}} belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that {{the painting was}} both an <b>unsurpassed</b> masterpiece of Swedish art and a work of suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by Sotheby's in London to a Japanese art collector.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{interior}} and exterior of the mosque are decorated with elaborate white marble carved with a floral design common to Mughal art. The carvings at Badshahi mosque {{are considered to be}} uniquely fine and <b>unsurpassed</b> works of Mughal architecture. The chambers {{on each side of the}} main chamber contains rooms which were used for religious instruction. The mosque can accommodate 10,000 worshippers in the prayer hall.|$|E
5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative. He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the {{necessary}} {{existence of the}} greatest possible being, it follows {{that there is a}} being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such a being has <b>unsurpassed</b> greatness in this world.|$|E
5|$|The Perl {{languages}} borrow features {{from other}} programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed. They provide powerful text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating easy manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread {{popularity in the}} late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, {{in part due to}} its then <b>unsurpassed</b> regular expression and string parsing abilities.|$|E
5|$|Two essays written {{during this}} time {{foreshadow}} Smuts's later views, both political and philosophical. The first of these, entitled South African Customs Union, was written in 1890 in competition for the JB Ebden prize offered by the University of the Cape of Good Hope. This essay, {{an examination of the}} economic relations of the colonies and states of South Africa, though 'Highly Commended' by the judges, failed to win the prize. Nevertheless, despite achieving only modest success, it is <b>unsurpassed</b> as a clear and authoritative statement of Smuts's political outlook at this time.|$|E
5|$|Posted to {{a fighter}} wing on the Eastern Front, Lang claimed his first aerial {{victories}} in March 1943. He {{was credited with}} 72 victories in a three-week period, among them an <b>unsurpassed</b> total of 18 on 3 November 1943. He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 22 November 1943 for his 119 victories to that time. By March 1944, his claims totaled 144, for which he received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 11 April 1944. Transferred to the Western Front, he claimed his 150th victim during the Normandy Invasion on 14 June 1944. He scored his last three victories on 26 August 1944; on 3 September 1944, {{he was killed in}} action over Belgium.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} role {{of copper}} has been important, particularly in currency. Romans in the 6th through 3rd centuries BC used copper lumps as money. At first, the copper itself was valued, but gradually {{the shape and}} look of the copper became more important. Julius Caesar had his own coins made from brass, while Octavianus Augustus Caesar's coins were made from Cu-Pb-Sn alloys. With an estimated annual output of around 15,000t, Roman copper mining and smelting activities reached a scale <b>unsurpassed</b> until {{the time of the}} Industrial Revolution; the provinces most intensely mined were those of Hispania, Cyprus and in Central Europe.|$|E
5|$|This {{same period}} of {{economic}} and political uncertainty, however, produced an <b>unsurpassed</b> literary flowering in England. The first signs of a new literary movement had appeared {{at the end of the}} second decade of Elizabeth's reign, with John Lyly's Euphues and Edmund Spenser's The Shepheardes Calender in 1578. During the 1590s, some of the great names of English literature entered their maturity, including William Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe. During this period and into the Jacobean era that followed, the English theatre reached its highest peaks. The notion of a great Elizabethan era depends largely on the builders, dramatists, poets, and musicians who were active during Elizabeth's reign. They owed little directly to the queen, who was never a major patron of the arts.|$|E
5|$|Wallace {{returns to}} Sarawak, where {{he stays in}} the {{circular}} 'head-house' of a Dyak village, travels upriver, and describes the Durian, praising it as the king of fruits with exquisite and <b>unsurpassed</b> flavour, and the Dyak's slender bamboo bridges, as well as ferns and Nepenthes pitcher plants. On a mountain he finds {{the only place in}} his entire journey where moths are abundant; he collected 1,386 moths on a total of 26 nights, but over 800 of these were caught on four very wet and dark nights. He attributes the reason to having a ceiling that effectively trapped the moths; in other houses the moths at once escaped into the roof, and he recommends naturalists to bring a verandah-shaped tent to enable them to catch moths.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft {{attacked}} {{not only}} hereditary privilege, {{but also the}} rhetoric that Burke used to defend it. Most of Burke's detractors deplored what they viewed as his theatrical pity for Marie Antoinette, but Wollstonecraft was unique in her love of Burke's gendered language. By saying the sublime and the beautiful, terms first established by Burke himself in A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful (1756), she kept his rhetoric {{as well as his}} argument. In her first unabashedly feminist critique, which Wollstonecraft scholar Claudia Johnson describes as <b>unsurpassed</b> in its argumentative force, Wollstonecraft indicts Burke's justification of an equal society founded on the passivity of women.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{missed a}} large part of the 1927 season with a {{combination}} of illness and injury. In between his absences, he performed well, although he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players match. He scored 1,641 runs at 52.93, including seven centuries. He began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month, but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks. When he recovered, he was selected in the last two of the three Tests against the West Indies, playing their first Test series. In his first game, he and Sutcliffe shared a century partnership; in the third, Hobbs scored 159, having opened with a 155-run partnership with Sutcliffe. England won the series 3–0. Hobbs maintained his batting form until the end of the season; he finished second in the batting averages, scoring 2,542 runs at an average of 82.00 and hitting 12 centuries. Critics believed he remained <b>unsurpassed</b> among English batsmen.|$|E
5|$|The National Art Collection {{is located}} at the Wawel, the former {{residence}} of three dynasties of Polish monarchs. Royal Chambers feature art, period furniture, Polish and European paintings, collectibles, and an <b>unsurpassed</b> display of the 16th-century monumental Flemish tapestries. Wawel Treasury and Armoury features Polish royal memorabilia, jewels, applied art, and 15th to 18th century arms. The Wawel Eastern Collection features Turkish tents and military accessories. The National Museum is the richest museum in the country with collections consisting of several hundred thousand items kept in big part in the Main Building at Ul. 3 Maja, although there are as many as eleven separate divisions of the museum in the city, {{one of the most popular}} being The Gallery of the 19th Century Polish Art in Sukiennice with the collection of some of the best known paintings and sculptures of the Young Poland movement. The latest division called Europeum with Brueghel among a hundred Western European paintings was inaugurated in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The club {{moved in}} 1997 to the Britannia Stadium, a 28,383 all-seater stadium; having spent 119 {{years at the}} Victoria Ground. In the 2007–08 season, Stoke won {{promotion}} from the Football League Championship, the second tier of English football, and as of 2008–09 are playing in the top flight (currently Premier League) {{for the first time}} since the 1984–85 season, when they were relegated with a total of 17 points, a record low <b>unsurpassed</b> for 21 years. Stoke's only major trophy was the 1972 Football League Cup, won when they beat Chelsea 2–1 in the final at Wembley Stadium before a crowd of 97,852. The club have also won the Football League Trophy twice, in 1992 and 2000. In terms of league achievement the closest Stoke have come to winning the title was in the 1946–47 season where a final day defeat cost Stoke top spot.|$|E
5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained <b>unsurpassed</b> by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total that is also tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the Song dynasty (960–1279) the {{porcelain}} makers had achieved a high level of skill. Some experts consider their work to be <b>unsurpassed</b> in its purity of design.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} his success as an actor, he was very poor through most of his life. His friend Speroni remarked that while Angelo had <b>unsurpassed</b> {{understanding}} of comedy, {{he was unable to}} perceive his own tragedy.|$|E
25|$|A {{very talented}} orator, Kim could command unwavering loyalty among his supporters. His staunchest support {{came from the}} Jeolla region, where he {{reliably}} garnered upwards of 95% of the popular vote, a record that has remained <b>unsurpassed</b> in South Korean politics.|$|E
25|$|Since 1900, of British-bred {{racehorses}} only Ribot has {{won more}} races and finished his career unbeaten (racing largely in Italy). Frankel's record of nine consecutive Group 1 wins is <b>unsurpassed</b> {{and has been}} equalled only by the U.S.A. filly Zenyatta.|$|E
25|$|For decades, California {{had enjoyed}} full funding for its schools and <b>unsurpassed</b> {{educational}} programs. Then in 1978, California voters approved Proposition 13 {{in an attempt}} to cut property taxes. The state’s public school system and its employees would never be the same.|$|E
25|$|Especially in {{the field}} of soloistic {{improvisation}} (taqsīm) over the common scales (maqām) in Arabian music, his colleagues considered him to be an <b>unsurpassed</b> master. It surely attributes to Bashir's pioneering work, that nowadays oud-players are able to give solo-concerts all over the world.|$|E
25|$|Wildlife was {{abundant}} in this area. The buffalo were still plentiful in the Virginia Piedmont {{up until the}} 1700s. The Upper Potomac watershed (above Great Falls, Virginia) was once renowned for its <b>unsurpassed</b> abundance of wild geese, earning the Upper Potomac its former Algonquian name, Cohongoruton (Goose River).|$|E
25|$|In 2009, ESPN writer Chris Low listed Tiger Stadium's Saturday night {{atmosphere}} as <b>unsurpassed</b> in the country, ranking it No. 1 {{out of the}} conference's 12 stadiums. In 2016, Tiger Stadium {{was again}} ranked No. 1 out of the conference's 14 stadiums by USA Today writers Laken Litman & Steven Ruiz.|$|E
25|$|The summit has two cairns of {{very similar}} height, {{that to the}} north-west being nearer to the cliff edge and having the better view. Northwards along Borrowdale the vista is <b>unsurpassed,</b> but the whole {{panorama}} is excellent. The heads of the gullies can also be approached for startling views down the face.|$|E
25|$|While {{the ability}} of nuclear {{metabolism}} to image disease processes from differences in metabolism is <b>unsurpassed,</b> it is not unique. Certain techniques such as fMRI image tissues (particularly cerebral tissues) by blood flow and thus show metabolism. Also, contrast-enhancement techniques in both CT and MRI show regions of tissue that are handling pharmaceuticals differently, due to an inflammatory process.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{stone or}} megalith, {{referred to as}} the Lochmabonstone by Logan Mack in 1926, has, in the Borders context, an <b>unsurpassed</b> extent of history attached to it. It is an erratic, 7 feet high and 18 feet in girth and weighs approximately ten tons. It is composed of weathered granite, exposed to severe glacial action.|$|E
25|$|Erdős {{published}} around 1,500 mathematical papers {{during his}} lifetime, {{a figure that}} remains <b>unsurpassed.</b> He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity, living an itinerant lifestyle with {{the sole purpose of}} writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians. Erdős's prolific output with co-authors prompted the creation of the Erdős number, the number of steps in the shortest path between a mathematician and Erdős in terms of co-authorships.|$|E
25|$|The largest dome in {{the world}} for more than 1,700 years was the Pantheon in Rome. Its {{concrete}} dome spans an interior space of 43.45m, which corresponds exactly to its height from floor to top. Its apex concludes with an 8.95m wide oculus. The structure remained <b>unsurpassed</b> until 1881 and stills holds the title of the largest unreinforced solid concrete dome {{in the world}}. The Pantheon has exercised an immense influence on Western dome construction to this day.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{the canal}} offers {{numerous}} sightseeing and tourist attractions. Its <b>unsurpassed</b> beauty {{comes from the}} natural qualities of the landscape with coniferous forests and lakes, especially around the Biebrza and Netta Rivers, and it runs through the Augustów Primeval Forest from west to east. The biggest attraction is to navigate the waterway in a kayak, canoe, fishing boat or a motorboat. It is also possible to visit part of the canal and the Augustów lakes in a passenger ship.|$|E
25|$|Bruckner is {{the first}} {{composer}} since Schubert about whom {{it is possible to}} make such generalizations. His symphonies deliberately followed a pattern, each one building on the achievements of its predecessors.... His melodic and harmonic style changed little, and it had as much of Schubert in it as of Wagner.... His technique in the development and transformation of themes, learnt from Beethoven, Liszt and Wagner, was <b>unsurpassed,</b> and he was almost the equal of Brahms in the art of melodic variation.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Rossy {{returned}} to Madagascar, giving {{a series of}} concerts at Mahamasina Stadium in Antananarivo. These concerts were wildly successful; the first sold over 35,000 tickets, a number that in 2013 remained <b>unsurpassed</b> by any other Malagasy artist. He currently lives in Antananarivo {{with his family and}} gives regular performances. In addition, he serves as cultural adviser to the administration of Andry Rajoelina, current interim head of state for the High Transitional Authority following the 2009 Malagasy political crisis that removed Ravalomanana from power.|$|E
25|$|Metaphysical naturalists {{hold that}} {{reason is the}} {{refinement}} and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false should seek to perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are <b>unsurpassed</b> for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of pure reason alone can securely discover logical errors.|$|E
