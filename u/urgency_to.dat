5|$|Nash did not rush {{to enlist}} in the Australian armed forces on the {{outbreak}} of war in 1939. While there was no public statement from Nash, {{it is thought that}} with a family to support and an Irish Catholic anti-pathy to the British, Nash did not feel an <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> fight. However, following the commencement of the war against Japan, Nash enlisted on 2 February 1942.|$|E

5|$|Smith and Seguin {{confirmed}} {{the fate of}} the mission upon their return. Houston dispatched orders to Fannin to abandon Goliad, blow up the Presidio La Bahía fortress, and retreat to Victoria, but Fannin delayed acting on those orders. Believing the approach of Urrea's troops brought a greater <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> local civilians, he sent 29 men under Captain Amon B. King to help evacuate nearby Refugio.|$|E

40|$|This paper puts {{side by side}} {{philosophy}} and artistic creation in Catalonia in the twentieth century. We have to grasp how art and philosophy are able to generate and share thought and expression: a vision and a unique understanding of reality. This is a key reflection to understanding our times and reflects on the meaning and value of art and philosophy, humanism and the human condition in a society doomed <b>to</b> noise, <b>to</b> <b>urgencies,</b> and <b>to</b> lack of dialogue...|$|R

5|$|Before the {{students}} in Nashville {{had a chance to}} formalize their plans, events elsewhere brought renewed <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> the effort. During the first week of February 1960, a small sit-in demonstration in Greensboro, North Carolina, grew into a significant protest with over eighty students participating by the third day. Although similar demonstrations had occurred previously in other cities, this was the first to attract substantial media attention and public notice. When Lawson's group met the subsequent Friday night, about 500 new volunteers showed up to join the cause. Although Lawson and other adult organizers argued for delay, the student leaders insisted that the time had come for action.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning Sissener {{suggests}} the two go driving blindfolded. The stunt goes surprisingly well, but as Sissener pulls over the car, he dies. Odd is now left with responsibility for Sissener's dog and with an <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> live life to the fullest. He makes {{his way up to}} the Holmenkollen ski jump, where he sees a vision of his mother as a young woman, doing the jump. He comes to a decision and starts to do the ski jump. Odd, for the first time no longer wearing his railwayman's jacket, rides the train to Bergen, where Svea is happily waiting for him on the platform.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1772, amid various {{political}} machinations, Count Hieronymus von Colloredo {{was elected to}} the archbishopric as a compromise candidate acceptable to the imperial court in Vienna. Although unpopular among Salzburgers, this appointment appeared at first to be to the Mozarts' advantage: Leopold's withheld salary was paid, and on 31 August Colloredo authorised the payment of Wolfgang's Konzertmeister salary. However, the new archbishop began to look for someone outside the Salzburg court to be his new Kapellmeister. Eventually, he chose the Italian Domenico Fischietti, who was several years younger than Leopold. Realising that his chances of promotion had probably been irrevocably lost, Leopold turned his hopes for a comfortable old age towards Wolfgang, giving new <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> the third Italian journey which began in October 1772.|$|E
40|$|ButTo {{describe}} the adequate work-up and differential diagnosis {{in the presence}} of transient diplopia. MéthodesAnamnesis is most important to avoid unnecessary investigations. If patient's informations are sparse or doubtful, and if anamnestic clues are not consistent with a matter of urgency, homework questionnaire and a new appointment may be given to the patient. RésultatsTransient or intermittent binocular diplopia occurs in decompensated phoria, myasthenia, convergence spasm, neuromyotonia, dysthyroïd ophthalmopathy, multiple sclerosis, transient ischemic attack and giant cell arteritis. ConclusionTrue <b>urgencies</b> <b>to</b> be worked up without delay consist in giant cell arteritis, vertebral artery dissection and myasthenia. Some delay in the work-up is acceptable when transient binocular diplopia comes from other causes. Session sur le thème :"Les urgences neuro-ophtalmologiques"info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

5|$|Sigismund II's childlessness added <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> {{the idea}} of turning the {{personal}} union between Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into a more permanent and tighter relationship; {{it was also a}} priority for the execution movement. Lithuania's laws were codified and reforms enacted in 1529, 1557, 1565–1566 and 1588, gradually making its social, legal and economic system similar to that of Poland, with the expanding role of the middle and lower nobility. Fighting wars with Moscow under Ivan IV and the threat perceived from that direction provided additional motivation for the real union for both Poland and Lithuania.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after leaving}} Fitzgerald, Flanagan played solo piano in New York. In 1979 {{he was a}} guest on the first series of Marian McPartland's Piano Jazz radio programs. He {{continued}} {{to work with other}} players, including as a trio with Tal Farlow and Red Mitchell in 1980. For much of the 1980s he led a trio that featured bassist George Mraz and various drummers. By around 1990 Flanagan was concentrating on his own appearances and recordings rather than sideman activities. In the early 1990s Mraz was replaced by Peter Washington, whose heavier bass lines added <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> the trio's sound.|$|E
5|$|Under President Obama the Department of Energy (DOE) was {{reviewing}} options {{other than}} Yucca Mountain for a high-level waste repository and the Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future, {{established by the}} Secretary of Energy, released its final report in January 2012. It expressed <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> find a consolidated, geological repository, and said that any future facility should be developed by a new independent organization with {{direct access to the}} Nuclear Waste Fund, which is not subject to political and financial control as is the cabinet department of the Department of Energy. In the meantime, most nuclear power plants in the United States have resorted to the indefinite on-site dry cask storage of waste in steel and concrete casks.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{together}} with the future historian A. J. P. Taylor, Driberg formed {{the membership of the}} Oxford University Communist Party. During the General Strike of May 1926, most Oxford students supported the government and enrolled as special constables and strike-breakers. A minority, which included the future Labour Party leader Hugh Gaitskell and the future Poet Laureate John Betjeman, sided with the strikers, while Driberg and Taylor offered their services at the British Communist Party's headquarters in London. The Party showed no <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> employ them, and Taylor soon left. Driberg, given a job distributing strike bulletins, was arrested by the police before he could begin and was detained for several hours. This ended his active role in the strike. Notwithstanding his extreme left-wing associations, he secured 75 votes (against the winner's 152) in the 1927 elections for the presidency of the Oxford Union.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were made}} to work hard for their 249, with only Bradman {{reaching}} 50. Harvey and Hamence passed 40 but could not convert their starts into large scores. Alec Coxon took 4/66 for the hosts and was selected for the Second Test. Yorkshire made 206 in reply, Toshack taking 7/81 and Johnston 3/101: together, they bowled 81.1 of the 90.1 overs in the innings. Like the Australians, the local batsmen struggled {{to make the most}} of their starts; eight batsmen reached double figures but none passed 40. Not wanting to tire his bowlers ahead of the Second Test, Bradman declared Australia's second innings with a lead of 328 runs and only seventy minutes of play remaining. Brown hit 113 and Bradman himself 86, putting on 154 for the second wicket. Yardley expressed his displeasure by bowling his part-timers and then promoting tailenders to the upper half of the order in the second innings. The Australians batted in leisurely fashion with no <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> force a result. Bradman then allowed his second-string bowlers to deliver 24 of the 27 overs as the match petered into a draw. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E
5|$|Varis zos Galvus is crowned Garlean {{emperor and}} begins {{consolidating}} power, lending new <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> {{the search for}} Ivy. The Braves discover that Ivy is Raubahn's trusted advisor Eline Roaille, who is captured {{at the gates of}} a Garlean Castrum. A new Scion, Moenbryda, arrives from Sharlayan and provides critical advice for locating Iceheart. Using her body as a vessel, Iceheart summons Shiva into herself and challenges the Warrior of Light. Though the adventurer's band defeats Shiva, Iceheart escapes, bidding the meddler to consult with Midgardsormr. Based on the player's encounters with Lahabrea and Shiva, Moenbryda hypothesizes that Ascians may be permanently destroyed by trapping their souls within white auracite and cleaving them with a blast of pure aether, much like Hydaelyn's blade of light. Lucia of the Temple Knights requests that the Warrior of Light investigate suspicious activity at the Keeper of the Lake. At its apex, the adventurer discovers that Midgardsormr lives on, slowly regenerating from his apparent death. He divulges that Nidhogg, one of his seven children, has rallied the Dravanian horde to renew their attack on Ishgard. Sensing the hero's connection to Hydaelyn, Midgardsormr invokes an ancient pact with the Mothercrystal and seals away her blessing as a test of the player's worth. The Ascian Nabriales takes advantage of the opportunity to infiltrate the Scions' headquarters in pursuit of Louisoix's staff. Moenbryda sacrifices herself to create the blade of light necessary to completely destroy the Ascian.|$|E

5|$|Wootten had {{predicted}} this, based upon documents {{that had been}} captured by the Australians, and Brigadier Selwyn Porter's 24th Brigade had thoroughly prepared for the onslaught. The 79th Infantry Regiment crossed the Song River and attacked Scarlet Beach from the west, while the 2nd Battalion, 238th Infantry Regiment, which had been detached from the 41st Division, attacked south from Gusika. By using infiltration tactics the Japanese skirted around the lead elements of the 24th Brigade in an attack that was intended to roll up the Australian rear elements, however, the Australians in turn attacked the flanks of the Japanese units, mauling their supply columns and inflicting heavy casualties upon them. This {{had the effect of}} squeezing the strength out of the Japanese counterattack and forcing them into undertaking piecemeal attacks which were dealt with by the Australians with relative ease. As a result, although the fighting around Scarlet Beach continued until 28 November when the Japanese units that had been involved were withdrawn towards Wareo, it did not have the <b>urgency</b> <b>to</b> affect the 26th Brigade's advance on Sattelberg and was largely broken up by 23 November.|$|E

But taking short term measures also minimizes the room for a learning asset management style and an anticipating strategy for long-term uncertainties.
