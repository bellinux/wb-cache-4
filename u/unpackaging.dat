40|$|Most {{packaged}} food products must contain trans-fat labelling; however <b>unpackaged</b> snacks such as cookies, donuts, and muffins at supermarkets, gas station convenience stores, and bakeries {{often do not}} have or require nutrition fact labels. Hence, consumers {{are not aware of}} the trans-fat content in <b>unpackaged</b> food products.

40|$|Abstract: Ligand-conjugated polymer (polyplex) gene {{delivery}} vectors have strong potential as targeted, in vivo gene transfer vehicles; however, {{they are currently}} lim-ited by low delivery efficiency. A number of barriers to polyplex-mediated delivery have been previously identi-fied, including receptor binding, internalization, endo-somal escape, and nuclear localization. However, based on understanding of viral {{gene delivery}} systems, yet an-other potential barrier may exist; a limited ability to un-package the plasmid DNA cargo following localization to the nucleus. We have developed {{a model system that}} employs a cationic polymer linked to epidermal growth factor (EGF) as a ligand to target delivery of plasmid DNA encoding the green fluorescent protein to mouse fibro-blasts bearing the EGF receptor. Using fluorescence mi-croscopy to simultaneously trace both the plasmid and polymer during gene delivery in combination with an in vitro transcription assay, we provide evidence that plas-mid <b>unpackaging</b> can indeed be a limiting step for gene expression for sufficiently large polymer constructs. Short-term expression is significantly enhanced by using short polycations that dissociate from DNA more rapidly both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we describe a thermo-dynamic model that supports these data by showing that shorter polycations can have a higher probability of dis-sociating from DNA. This work demonstrates that vector <b>unpackaging</b> should be added to the list of barriers to receptor-mediated polyplex gene delivery, thus provid-ing an additional design principle for targeted syntheti...|$|E

40|$|Previous two-nation {{comparisons}} {{have provided}} evidence that self-efficacy {{may be a}} protective factor against depression in individualist cultures, whereas relationship harmony may be a stronger protective factor in collectivist cultures. However, wider sampling and more specific measures of cultural difference are required to test these conclusions. Student ratings of depression and life satisfaction were surveyed in 10 samples drawn from nine nations. Culture-level individualism positively moderated the relationship of self-efficacy to low depression. However, culture-level collectivism negatively moderated the linkage of relationship harmony to depression. To better understand these effects, four separate nation-level predictors derived from dimensions of self-construal were employed. Effects of self-efficacy were strongest where cultural models of selfhood emphasized self-direction (vs. receptiveness to influence); effects of relationship harmony were strongest where cultural models of selfhood emphasized dependence on others (vs. self-reliance).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} vacuum-packaging on both the sensory properties and the degradation level of their lipid fraction, some ripened sausages (30 days) were further stored for 40 days under vacuum-packaging and compared to sausages kept <b>unpackaged</b> {{for the same period}} of time. The same kind of sausages was used in both the trials. As for the sensory properties, after storage the <b>unpackaged</b> sausages showed significantly higher mean scores of red intensity and global flavour than vacuum-packed ones (P < 0. 01 and p < 0. 05, respectively) indicating a brighter red colour of meat and a greater overall appreciation by the panelists. Regarding the degradation of the lipid fraction, significantly higher values (p < 0. 01) of the free fatty acids were detected in the vacuum-packed samples, indicating a greater hydrolytic degradation of their lipid fraction as compared to the sausages stored <b>unpackaged.</b> The oxidative degradation of the fatty fraction, measured by the combined use of conventional (determination of peroxide value and TBA test) and nonconventional techniques (HPSEC analysis of the polar compounds of the lipid fraction) showed significant increases during storage for both the storage conditions considered but {{no significant differences were found}} between packaged and <b>unpackaged</b> sausages.

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} the growing field of {{research}} concerned with the application of adenovirus proteins to improve the transfection efficiency of synthetic gene delivery systems. Several adenovirus component proteins influence cellular activity of the infecting adenovirus and the overall effect is a highly regulated and efficient infection pathway. It {{is possible that some}} of these proteins may be incorporated into synthetic gene delivery vectors, to Improve specific components of their cellular processing and improve transfection activity. Several adenovirus proteins have been introduced into synthetic vector systems. In particular, the penton base, which participates in cellular entry and endosomal escape of the adenovirus, shows an ability to increase cellular uptake and cytoplasmic penetration of synthetic systems. Similarly, hexon, the major adenovirus coat protein, is involved in the nuclear delivery of the infecting virus and can be exploited for enhancing nuclear targeting of synthetic systems. The possibility of using classical nuclear localization sequences from adenovirus proteins has also been evaluated. Finally, there is considerable interest in the use of adenovirus core proteins, such as mu, to improve properties of DNA condensation and <b>unpackaging</b> following the arrival of synthetic vectors in the nuclei of target cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{modulation}} of DNA accessibility by nucleo-somes is {{a fundamental}} mechanism of gene regu-lation in eukaryotes. The nucleosome core particle (NCP) consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a symmetric octamer of histone proteins. The dy-namics of DNA packaging and <b>unpackaging</b> from the NCP affect all DNA-based chemistries, but de-pend on many factors, including DNA positioning sequence, histone variants and modifications. Al-though {{the structure of the}} intact NCP has been studied by crystallography at atomic resolution, lit-tle is known about the structures of the partially un-wrapped, transient intermediates relevant to nucle-osome dynamics in processes such as transcrip-tion, DNA replication and repair. We apply a new experimental approach combining contrast varia-tion with time-resolved small angle X-ray scatter-ing (TR-SAXS) to determine transient structures of protein and DNA constituents of NCPs during salt-induced disassembly. We measure the structures of unwrapping DNA and monitor protein dissociation from Xenopus laevis histones reconstituted with two model NCP positioning constructs: the Widom 601 sequence and the sea urchin 5 S ribosomal gene. Both constructs reveal asymmetric release of DNA from disrupted histone cores, but display different patterns of protein dissociation. These kinetic inter-mediates may be biologically important substrates for gene regulation...|$|E
40|$|Most cryptosystems are {{designed}} and evaluated at a mathematical level. Attackers, however, will always target the physical realisation {{of a system}} {{which is much more}} complicated (see [14] for discussion of this disconnect). Real-world electronic implementations of ciphers will usually leak additional information to attackers in the form of side-channels such as timing, power consumption, electromagnetic radiation, heat, noise, and more. In many cases, an attacker can combine side-channel information with the observed input and/or output of a cryptographic algorithm to recover secret information. It is important to draw a distinction between side-channel cryptanalysis and related physical attacks. Compromising Emanation attacks or tempest attacks utilise electromagnetic emanations from computers to recover secret data, for example using electromagnetic radiation from a computer screen to recover the text being displayed [11] (for a survey, see chapter 17 of [1]). Tempest attacks target secret information directly, completely bypassing the cryptographic keys. Invasive or semi-invasive attacks, in contrast, involve physical manipulation of a target system to extract secret information, for example by <b>unpackaging</b> a chip and reading secret data stored in its memory using a micro-probe or a microscope (see [4, 2] for a survey of physical attacks and defences).

We examined their ability to mediate siRNA uptake into cells focusing on hepatocyte delivery. Co-delivery of EGFP siRNA with pEGFP plasmid DNA reduced reporter gene expression by 85 %. However while DNA transfection efficiency increased with polymer size, with 162 k His 6 RPCs proving the most effective, delivery of siRNA alone to EGFP stably expressing cells was only possible using 36 - 80 k polymers. Analysis of particle sizes showed that 80 k polymers formed more compact siRNA complexes than 162 k polymers. The reducible nature of the polymer was necessary for siRNA activity, since siRNA combined with non-reducible polylysine showed little activity. Incorporation of a targeting peptide from the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein onto His 6 RPCs, significantly improved transfection of plasmid DNA and siRNA activity in hepatocytes, but not in most non-liver cells tested. siRNA targeted to the hepatitis B virus surface antigen delivered by CS-His 6 RPC, mediated falls in both mRNA and protein expression, suggesting that this delivery system could be developed for potential therapies for viral hepatitis...|$|E
40|$|Crosslinked polyethylenimines (PEIs) {{have been}} {{frequently}} examined {{over the past}} decade since they can maintain the transfection efficiency of commercially available, 25 k branched PEI, but exhibit less cytotoxicity. The argument is often made that the degradability of such polymers, generally synthesized with either disulfide or hydrolytically degradable crosslinkers, is critical to the high efficiency and low toxicity of the system. In this work, we present a crosslinked linear PEI (xLPEI) system in which either disulfide-responsive or non-degradable linkages are incorporated. As with previous systems, strong transfection efficiency in comparison with commercial standards was achieved with low cytotoxicity. However, these properties were shown to be present when either the degradable or non-degradable crosslinker was used. Uncomplexed polymer was demonstrated to be the critical factor determining transfection efficiency for these polymers, mediating efficient endosomal escape without signs of cell membrane damage. While several crosslinked PEI systems in the literature have demonstrated the effect of the disulfide moiety, this work demonstrates that disulfide-mediated <b>unpackaging</b> may not be as important as conventionally thought for some PEI systems.

40|$|A semi-analytical {{algorithm}} {{was tested}} {{with a total}} of 733 points of either <b>unpackaged</b> or packaged-pigment data, with corresponding algorithm parameters for each data type. The 'unpackaged' type consisted of data sets that were generally consistent with the Case 1 CZCS algorithm and other well calibrated data sets. The 'packaged' type consisted of data sets apparently containing somewhat more packaged pigments, requiring modification of the absorption parameters of the model consistent with the CalCOFI study area. This resulted in two equally divided data sets. A more thorough scrutiny of these and other data sets using a semianalytical model requires improved knowledge of the phytoplankton and gelbstoff of the specific environment studied. Since the semi-analytical algorithm is dependent upon 4 spectral channels including the 412 nm channel, while most other algorithms are not, a means of testing data sets for consistency was sought. A numerical filter was developed to classify data sets into the above classes. The filter uses reflectance ratios, which can be determined from space. The sensitivity of such numerical filters to measurement resulting from atmospheric correction and sensor noise errors requires further study. The semi-analytical algorithm performed superbly on each of the data sets after classification, resulting in RMS 1 errors of 0. 107 and 0. 121, respectively, for the <b>unpackaged</b> and packaged data-set classes, with little bias and slopes near 1. 0. In combination, the RMS 1 performance was 0. 114. While these numbers appear rather sterling, one must bear in mind what mis-classification does to the results. Using an average or compromise parameterization on the modified global data set yielded an RMS 1 error of 0. 171, while using the <b>unpackaged</b> parameterization on the global evaluation data set yielded an RMS 1 error of 0. 284. So, without classification, the algorithm performs better globally using the average parameters than it does using the <b>unpackaged</b> parameters. Finally, the effects of even more extreme pigment packaging must be examined in order to improve algorithm performance at high latitudes. Note, however, that the North Sea and Mississippi River plume studies contributed data to the packaged and <b>unpackaged</b> classess, respectively, with little effect on algorithm performance. This suggests that gelbstoff-rich Case 2 waters do not seriously degrade performance of the semi-analytical algorithm...|$|R
