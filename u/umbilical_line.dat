The <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>lining</b> membrane comprises two layers: the amniotic (or epithelial) layer and the sub-amniotic (or mesenchymal) layer. The <b>umbilical</b> cord <b>lining</b> membrane is a rich source of two strains of stem cells: epithelial stem cells (from the amniotic layer) and mesenchymal stem cells (from the sub-amniotic layer).

50|$|An <b>umbilical</b> <b>line</b> is a {{catheter}} that is inserted {{into one of}} the two arteries or the vein of the umbilical cord. Generally the UAC/UVC (Umbilical Artery Catheter/Umbilical Vein Catheter) is used in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) as it provides quick access to the central circulation of premature infants. UAC/UVC lines can be placed at the time of birth and allow medical staff to quickly infuse fluids, inotropic drugs, and blood if required. It is sometimes used in term or near-term newborns in whom the umbilical cord stump is still connected to the circulatory system. Medications, fluids, and blood can be given through this catheter and it allows monitoring of blood gasses and withdrawing of blood samples. Complications include infection and thromboembolism.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Liver abscesses {{are rare}} in {{neonates}} {{with the majority}} resulting from an ascending infection via the umbilical and portal veins, haematogenous spread, or via the biliary tree, or via direct contiguous spread from neighbouring structures. They may present in unusual ways often presenting with ongoing sepsis and resulting in diagnostic difficulties. We present the clinical and radiological findings on six neonates with hepatic abscesses and underline the association with misplacement of <b>umbilical</b> <b>line,</b> association with hypertonic glucose infusions and TPN. Methods: A retrospective chart review made of six patients diagnosed with hepatic abscesses between 2000 and 2006. Methods included clinical and radiological review as well as evaluation of potential risk factors. Results: Five of the six patients with neonatal liver abscess were of low birth weight and low gestational age (range 30 - 34 weeks), but one was post mature (42 weeks). Sex distribution was equal and two were HIV exposed (mother positive), two HIV negative with two having an unknown HIV status. Clinical signs included raised infective markers (CRP) (6) and non-specific signs of septicaemia (4), but a tender hepatomegaly (1) and abdominal distension with ileus (1) were also noted. Five were right-sided abscesses (2 associated with malposition of <b>umbilical</b> <b>line)</b> and one central in position. Predisposing factors included association with a misplaced <b>umbilical</b> <b>line</b> with high concentration glucose infusions (2) and tuberculosis was later diagnosed in one. Infective markers (CRP) remained high with positive blood cultures persisting in all. Causative organisms included Klebsiella (3) Staphylococcus (3) [one a multi-resistant staphylococcus (MRSA) ], Gonococcus (1) and Enterobacter (1). Abdominal X-ray demonstrated a mal-positioned <b>umbilical</b> <b>line</b> in three patients (50 %). Ultrasound (US) proved a reliable method of diagnosis although some difficulty was encountered in interpreting resolving abscesses and trans-diaphragmatic spread occurred in one. Three patients (50 %) responded to antibiotic therapy alone, but interventional drainage was required in the remainder. Needle aspiration was successful in two of these, but one further patient had a radiologically placed pigtail drainage, but later required open drainage. This patient then developed trans-diaphragmatic spread and empyema requiring thoracoscopic decortication. Conclusion: Neonatal hepatic abscesses are rare but should enter the differential diagnosis of a neonate with ongoing sepsis. This study serves {{to draw attention to}} their association with misplaced central (umbilical) catheters. Failure to respond to antibiotic therapy necessitates interventional drainage. © 2008 Springer-Verlag. Articl...|$|E

40|$|Abstract - The {{interaction}} {{in the upper}} ionosphere between the ambient medium and the space station or other orbiting vehicles in the 1990 s will require measurements from essentially nonintrusive instrumentation {{and the ability to}} repeat those measurements at will in an extended region about a space vehicle. A diagnostic package on a communications and control umbilical, a 'spin-cast' diagnostic package (SCDP), can complement free flyers and attached instrumentation in the region from 10 m to 1 km which is prohibited to free flyers. The basic concept for the SCDP is to cast off on an <b>umbilical</b> <b>line</b> in some chosen direction a small, battery powered, instrumentation package and then to reel it back in while taking measurements. A typical package might include pressure monitors, various plasma probes, magnetometers, plasma wave, and optical sensors which could include video imaging. This paper proposes a method for rapid deployment and retrieval of the constrained plasma package. The package follows a 'quasi' free orbit for most of the time while the umbilical is used to impart the required Delta Vs to the package. The paper also proposes a complementary method for collecting data beyond the restricted zone whereby a free-flying plasma package is injected into a moon orbit around the space station...|$|E

There were no {{differences between the two groups}} in mean operative time (45 min), postoperative complications (0. 7 %) and clinical course (hospital stay: 36 hours on average). We believe that the right compromise between ergonomic and cosmetic considerations is the one shown in scheme B. In this way it is possible to perform all diagnostic and therapeutic manoeuvres such as pulling the appendix out through the umbilical trocar and using suprapubic trocars as an access route for a possible drainage...|$|E

Majority of these infants were preterm and admitted to NICU for special care. these infants had indwelling <b>umbilical</b> <b>line</b> and had indication of sepsis workup. A total of 141 pairs of blood cultures were obtained from 134 infants. In 16 infants blood culture pairs were positive for one organism in both peripheral vein and umbilical site. 71. 6 % of total cultures (n= 11) pairs were negative in boths site. A total of 22 pairs were positive in one site only,with 5 positive from peripheral vein only and the other 17 from umblical site. Two pairs were positve in boths site with two different organism. In over all 16 infant (11 %) of blood were considered to be contaminated. Contamination rate were 2. 4 % and 9. 2 % for peripheral and umbilical catheter site. Contamination rate increased after 48 hours of age in umbilical catheter.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which the surface {{parameters}} of Progressive Addition Lenses (PALs) affect successful patient tolerance was investigated. Several optico-physical evaluation techniques were employed, including a newly constructed surface reflection device which was shown to be of value for assessing semi-finished PAL blanks. Detailed physical analysis was undertaken using a computer-controlled focimeter and from these data, iso-cylindrical and mean spherical plots were produced for each PAL studied. Base curve power was shown to have little impact upon the distribution of PAL astigmatism. A power increase in reading addition primarily caused a lengthening and narrowing of the lens progression channel. Empirical measurements also indicated a marginal steepening of the progression power gradient with an increase in reading addition power. A sample of the PAL wearing population were studied using patient records and questionnaire analysis (90 % were returned). This subjective analysis revealed the reading portion to be the most troublesome lens zone and showed that patients with high astigmatism (> 2. 00 D) adapt more readily to PALs than those with spherical or low cylindrical (2. 00 D) corrections. The psychophysical features of PALs were then investigated. Both grafting visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) were shown to be reduced with an increase in eccentricity from the central <b>umbilical</b> <b>line.</b> Two sample populations (N= 20) of successful and unsuccessful PAL wearers were assessed for differences in their visual performance and their adaptation to optically induced distortion. The possibility of dispensing errors being the cause of poor patient tolerance amongst the unsuccessful wearer group was investigated and discounted. The contrast sensitivity of the successful group was significantly greater than that of the unsuccessful group. No differences in adaptation to or detection of curvature distortion were evinced between these presbyopic groups...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare, {{in a large}} {{representative}} sample of European neonatal intensive care units, the policies and practices regarding parental involvement and holding babies in the kangaroo care position as well as differences in the tasks mothers and fathers are allowed to carry out. DESIGN: Prospective multicenter survey. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units in eight European countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). PATIENTS: Patients {{were not involved in}} this study. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A structured questionnaire was mailed to 362 units (response rate 78 %); only units with ≥ 50 very-low-birth-weight annual admissions were considered for this study. Facilities for parents such as reclining chairs near the babies' cots, beds, and a dedicated room were common, but less so in Italy and Spain. All units in Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Belgium reported encouraging parental participation in the care of the babies, whereas policies were more restrictive in Italy (80 % of units), France (73 %), and Spain (41 %). Holding babies in the kangaroo care position was widespread. However, in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Spain, many units applied restrictions regarding its frequency (sometimes or on parents request only, rather than routinely), method (conventional rather than skin-to-skin), and clinical conditions (especially mechanical ventilation and presence of <b>umbilical</b> <b>lines)</b> that would prevent its practice. In these countries, fathers were routinely offered kangaroo care less frequently than mothers (p <. 001) and less often it was skin-to-skin (p <. 0001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that, although the majority of units in all countries reported a policy of encouraging both parents {{to take part in the}} care of their babies, the intensity and ways of involvement as well as the role played by mothers and fathers varied within and between countries.
