50|$|The {{first modern}} {{use of a}} single cymbal was the orchestral use of a {{suspended}} cymbal, using one of a pair suspended by its strap. As suspended cymbals became more common, stands were devised to support them from below. However, even towards {{the middle of the}} twentieth century, there was no provision for tilting the cymbal. Cymbals were supported in the same horizontal position as a cymbal suspended by its strap, by brackets affixed to drums, particularly to bass drums, and increasingly on stands. Such horizontal mounting required neither <b>upper</b> <b>felt</b> nor wingnut.|$|E

50|$|The {{conditions}} of sale for land in the Huron Tract were open to interpretation. Sir John Robinson, 1st Baronet, of Toronto, an important member of the 9th Parliament of <b>Upper</b> Canada, <b>felt</b> that those persons who automatically became American citizens after 1783 {{should be required to}} renounce their American citizenship to qualify as a Loyalist. The opposition, the Colborne Clique, had a different opinion and were able to sway a victory in defiance of the Family Compact and Sir John Robinson's position. This issue is one of many that lead to the Rebellion of 1837. Another issue pertinent to the {{conditions of}} sale, was who qualified for the Government free grants and who did not.|$|R

Layers of shungite rocks interspersed with tuffs, dolomite and siltstone. Within the Zazhoginskoe field are sills and dikes of metadiabases and metagabbro. Thickness of the sills is typically less than 50 m, but at the upper base sills reach thicknesses of over 150 m. In general, igneous rocks make up about 30% of the productive series. Rocks of the <b>upper</b> base <b>felt</b> weak regional metamorphism (initial stage greenschist facies). A significant part of the deposits developed with metasomatic replacement of primary minerals by carbonate, sericite, albite and quartz.

50|$|Mengistu's {{overthrow}} in May 1991 {{caused a}} number of shifts. With the shifting of forces towards the Western Equatoria offensive {{and the beginning of}} the rains, commanders in <b>Upper</b> Nile <b>felt</b> dangerously exposed. At the same time, the Nasir faction noted that Western support for Garang had fallen due to his alliance with the socialist Mengistu; the United States was the only country to respond favorably to the Nasir commanders' call for a separate South, which they interpreted as a sign of support. As thousands of refugees were returned from Ethiopia, the Nasir faction established contact with government forces beginning in July 1991 to arrange for relief supplies through government lines. By May, negotiations had led the government to agree to support the Nasir group against Garang. However, support for an attempt to remove Garang fell among other SPLA commanders, who felt that a coup attempt would further weaken the movement.|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of irregular and clandestine marriage ran rampant throughout Britain for centuries, {{but when the}} <b>upper</b> class <b>felt</b> they needed to reassert their social supremacy, marriage was one arena in which they sought to do so. The restrictions placed on irregular marriages were specifically aimed at protecting the elite and maintaining a separation between themselves and the lower echelon of society. The political, social, and economic importance of marriage motivated its regulation, as the connections made with the matrimonial bond did not affect only the couple, but their family, and, possibly, their country. Current historiography addresses this issue extensively, particularly in regards to Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act of 1753 in England. There is, however, a lack of investigation into other groups that influenced and were influenced by the English approach to clandestine marriage. The Scots, Irish, and British military all factor into the greater landscape of clandestine marriage in eighteenth-century Britain and an investigation of them yields a more complete explanation of marital practices, regulations, and reactions to both that led to and stemmed from Hardwicke's Act. This explanation shows the commonality of ideas among Britons regarding marriage {{and the necessity of}} maintaining endogamous unions {{for the benefit of the}} elite...|$|R

5000|$|The {{expulsion}} of the Moriscos in 1609 {{was the final}} blow for {{the economy of the}} Kingdom of Valencia, as thousands of people - mostly peasants serving the nobility - were forced to leave; in the process, entire villages were deserted and the countryside lost its main labor force. Some 125,000 people are supposed to have left the land. [...] The expulsion was broadly welcome within the Valencian citizenry, especially for its more popular segments. The expulsion meant the loss of a cheap labor force for the nobility, and consequently a massive socio-economic destabilisation. The nobles together with the <b>upper</b> class bourgeoisie <b>felt</b> threatened by an increasingly self-confident general populace, and sought the king's protection of their privileges. As a concession to the monarchy, they had to gradually relinquish their check and balance role on its power, which {{had been one of the}} distinguishing traits of the Kingdom's autonomy before the Crown. In line with similar processes in other parts of feudal Europe, the power vacuum left by rapid socio-economic change was readily filled by an increasingly emboldened monarchy.|$|R
50|$|In 1168, the Banu Kanz {{provided}} {{safe haven}} to the disbanded black African regiments of the Fatimid army by the influential aides of Caliph al-Adid, Shirkuh and his nephew Saladin. Saladin toppled al-Adid in 1171 and established the Ayyubid Sultanate in Egypt. In 1171/72, the Nubian army, {{together with the}} Fatimids' former black African contingents, attempted to occupy Upper Egypt and sacked Aswan, prompting the Kanz al-Dawla to request military assistance from Saladin, to which he complied. The Ayyubids and the Banu Kanz drove out the Nubians and the Fatimid rebel army units from Upper Egypt. Although the Ayyubids helped the Banu Kanz in repelling the Nubian invasion, their rule also saw {{the rise of a}} Syrian Turco-Kurdish military elite in Egypt {{at the expense of the}} Arab tribes and African regiments, both of which the Fatimids had maintained close ties with and at one point governed Egypt. Accordingly, the Banu Kanz and the Arab tribes of <b>Upper</b> Egypt <b>felt</b> that their iqta (fiefs) and official privileges were threatened by the new Ayyubid order. When Saladin transferred the iqta of the Banu Kanz to an Ayyubid emir (a brother of senior Ayyubid emir Abu al-Hayja al-Samin), the Banu Kanz killed the emir and his retinue. In 1174, Ibn al-Mutawwaj, the Kanz al-Dawla, launched an insurrection against the Ayyubids to restore the Fatimids. He gained the support of other Arab tribes in the region and the African regiments and sought to join the revolt of Abbas ibn Shadi, the leader of the Arab tribes in Middle Egypt. Before the Banu Kanz could link with Abbas, Saladin's forces under Abu al-Hayja's command defeated and killed Abbas. The Ayyubid army proceeded to confront the Banu Kanz, who were defeated after major clashes in Aswan. Ibn al-Mutawwaj was eventually captured and executed in the aftermath of his army's defeat.|$|R
40|$|A cold {{sensation}} (hie) {{is common}} in Japanese women and is an important treatment target in Kampo medicine. Physicians diagnose patients as having hiesho (cold disorder) when hie disturbs their daily activity. However, differences between hie and hiesho in {{men and women are}} not well described. Hie can be of three types depending on body part where patients feel hie. We aimed to clarify the characteristics of patients with hie and hiesho by analyzing data from new patients seen at the Kampo Clinic at Keio University Hospital between 2008 and 2013. We collected information about patients’ subjective symptoms and their severity using visual analogue scales. Of 4, 016 new patients, 2, 344 complained about hie and 524 of those were diagnosed with hiesho. Hie was most common in legs/feet and combined with hands or lower back, rather than the whole body. Almost 30 % of patients with hie <b>felt</b> <b>upper</b> body heat symptoms like hot flushes. Cold sensation was stronger in hiesho than non-hiesho patients. Patients with hie had more complaints. Men with hiesho had the same distribution of hie and had symptoms similar to women. The results of our study may increase awareness of hiesho and help doctors treat hie and other symptoms...|$|R
2500|$|Immediately {{after finding}} out the {{election}} results, a special South Carolina convention declared [...] "that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina {{and other states}} {{under the name of}} the 'United States of America' is hereby dissolved"; by February six more cotton states would follow (Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas), forming the Confederate States of America. In 1960, Lipset examined the secessionist vote in each Southern state in 1860–61. In each state he divided the counties by the proportion of slaves, low, medium and high. He found that in the 181 high-slavery counties, the vote was 72% for secession. In the 205 low-slavery counties, the vote was only 37% for secession and in the 153 middle counties, the vote for secession was at 60%. [...] Both the outgoing Buchanan administration and the incoming Lincoln administration refused to recognize the legality of secession or the legitimacy of the Confederacy. After Lincoln called for troops, four border states (that lacked cotton) seceded (Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee). The Upper Southern States were in a dilemma, they wanted to retain their slaves but were afraid that if they joined with the lower southern states that were rebelling they would be {{caught in the middle of}} a conflict, and their states would be the battle ground.

50|$|As constructed, the County-class {{ships were}} {{armed with a}} pair of twin QF 4.5-inch gun mountings. The second batch of four ships (Antrim, Fife, Glamorgan and Norfolk) were {{refitted}} in the mid-1970s - their 'B'-position turrets were removed and replaced by four single MM38 Exocet surface-to-surface anti-ship-missile launcher boxes. This was partly to counter the continuing threat of Soviet gun- and missile-armed cruisers, but also because the two twin 4.5 mountings, located forward on the County-class, were cramped and hot to fire, with the heat from firing the <b>upper</b> gun being <b>felt</b> by the gun crew in the turret below; also, the forward twin turrets had space for only small magazines - only 225 shells for each gun, two-thirds of the magazine capacity for the same guns in the Leander (Type 12L) frigates. This made the County-class ships the only Royal Navy ships to be fitted with three separate types of guided missile: Seaslug, Seacat and Exocet. It also left the un-refitted ships as the last Royal Navy vessels able to fire a broadside from multiple main armament gun turrets. HMS London fired the last Royal Navy broadside on 10 December 1981 in the English Channel, after returning from its final deployment in the West Indies. It had also fired off the last Seaslug Mk 1 stocks that year, as targets for Type 42 Sea Dart workups, prior to her hand-over to the Pakistani Navy. Sold by the British Government 23 March 1982, she sailed without notice from Portsmouth in late May 1982 for Pakistan during the Falklands crisis, and consideration may have been given to reclaiming it for war service.|$|R
50|$|The {{existence}} of minerals {{was reported by}} the sawbwa, or chief, to Francis Garnier in 1867, but none is worked or located. Gold is washed {{in most of the}} streams. Teak forests exist in Mong Pu and Mong Hsat, and the sawbwa works them as government contracts. One-third of the price realized from the sale of the logs at Moulmein is retained as the government royalty. There are teak forests also in the Mekong drainage area in the south of the state, but there is only a local market for the timber. Rice, as elsewhere in the Shan States, is the chief crop. Next to it is sugarcane, grown both as a field crop and in gardens. Eai-th-nuts and, tobacco are the only other field crops in the valleys. On the hills, besides rice, cotton, poppy and tea are the chief crops. The tea is carelessly grown, badly prepared, and only consumed locally. A great deal of garden produce is raised in the valleys, especially near the capital. The state is rich in cattle, and exports them to the country west of the Salween. Cotton and opium are exported in large quantities, the former entirely to China, {{a good deal of the}} latter to northern Thailand, which also takes shoes and sandals. Tea is carried through westwards from Keng Hung, and silk from the Siamese Shan States. Cotton and silk weaving are dying out as industries. Large quantities of shoes and sandals are made of buffalo and bullock hide, with Chinese <b>felt</b> <b>uppers.</b> There is a good deal of pottery work. The chief work in iron is the manufacture of guns, which has been carried on for many years in certain villages of the Sam Tao district.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{current study}} compares {{artifact}} (motion at the lung bases and beam hardening from the superior vena cava and subclavian vein), clarity of vessels (hilar vessels, great vessels and aorta) and {{clarity of the}} nodal systems (stations 2 R, 2 L, 4 R, 5, 6 and hilar) in the caudad to cranial and cranial to caudad direction when CT scanning the thorax. The purpose {{was to determine if}} one direction was associated with less artifact. [...] Methods: 100 consecutive consenting patients were randomized into either cranial to caudad or caudad to cranial CT scanning of the thorax using block randomization. The images were interpreted independently by two radiologists who were blind to the direction for the scan. Images were analyzed using a 5 point Likert scale for artifact (motion, superior vena cava, subclavian vein), clarity of the vasculature structures (hilar vessels, great vessels, aorta), clarity of the nodal stations (2 R, 2 L, 4 R, 5, 6,hilar) and overall impression. Each scan was assessed on two separate occasions by the radiologists. Inter and intra observer correlations were measured with the Spearman Rank Coefficient. The Wilcoxin Rank Sum test was used to compare the direction of scanning. [...] Results: Intra-observer correlations were strong ranging form 0. 616 - 0. 902 for Radiologist 1 and 0. 537 - 0. 902 for Radiologist 2. The inter-observer correlations were also good with Spearman Rank Coefficients values ranging from 0. 102 - 0. 793. The caudad to cranial direction of CT scanning was significantly better than cranial to caudad direction with respect to total artifact (motion+ superior vena cava+ subclavian vein), however, there was no statistically detectable difference in motion artifact. Clarity of the vasculature was deemed better by one radiologist in the caudad to cranial direction but not the other. Lymph node clarity in the <b>upper</b> thorax was <b>felt</b> to be better visualized with caudad to cranial scans versus cranial to caudad imaging, however, hilar lymph nodes and lymph nodes in the lower mediastinum showed not statistical difference. The quality of the overall images was significantly better. [...] Conclusion: The caudad to cranial direction of CT scanning is significantly better with less beam hardening artifact and improved image quality, allowing better assessment of the great vessels and select nodal stations...|$|R

She took it with a sigh that struck him to the heart; and they began once more to trace the deserted streets.
