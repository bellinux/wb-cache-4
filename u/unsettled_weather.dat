5|$|At a dock {{owned by}} Shell Oil Company in Deer Park near Houston, a {{lightning}} bolt from thunderstorms of Elena struck the oil supertanker SS Chevron Hawaii. The lightning started a fire on the ship, which expanded and wrecked one adjacent barge and burned nearby docks. The ship was nearly split in half from the lightning strike, and oil seeped into Houston Ship Channel for several hours. Firefighters combated the fire on the tanker in boats, but their efforts were hindered due to <b>unsettled</b> <b>weather</b> from Elena, as well as unsafe water to travel through. The fire caused three deaths and 13 injuries, and damage related to the incident totaled $27 million (1979 USD, $76 million 2007 USD).|$|E

5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of October 9, reports from the Leeward Islands of low pressures and <b>unsettled</b> <b>weather</b> indicated that a storm was forming in the vicinity. The disturbance strengthened into a tropical storm on October 12 to the northeast of Puerto Rico. The quickly escalating storm tracked northwestward before turning towards the northeast, away from a high pressure area building in from the west. Early on October 15, the storm attained hurricane intensity and continued to mature until October 16, when it reached its peak at a strength corresponding to Category 4 status on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day it passed just east of Bermuda. It weakened as it accelerated to the northeast, and became extratropical near Newfoundland {{a couple of days}} later.|$|E
5|$|While Ophelia {{was still}} {{impacting}} Newfoundland, forecasters in the United Kingdom warned residents that {{the remnants of}} the storm would bring <b>unsettled</b> <b>weather</b> to the nation within a few days. In the midst of a record-breaking heat wave, with temperatures reaching an all-time monthly record high of 86 °F (29.9 °C), the storm was expected to bring much cooler weather across the region. Strong winds and heavy rains were also anticipated, leading to the cancellation of ferry services. Plummeting temperatures in association with {{the remnants of the}} storm were expected to produce snowfall across the United Kingdom as well. In Donegal the first snows of the season fell, leaving hundreds of residents without electricity.|$|E
5|$|Along Long Island, {{the high}} storm surge flooded {{hundreds}} of streets and caused heavy beach erosion. High winds downed thousands {{of trees and}} damaged hundreds of homes, causing widespread power outages. About 1.5 {{million people in the}} state lost power, including two-thirds of the Long Island Lighting Company customers, {{making it one of the}} worst power outages in the state. There were four deaths on Long Island, two of whom related to heart attacks and the other two related to fallen trees. There were also 14 injuries in the region, many of them due to downed tree branches. In the New York mainland, heavy rainfall flooded rivers and alleviated drought conditions. Rough waves damaged boats and docks along the Hudson River. <b>Unsettled</b> <b>weather</b> contributed to a traffic fatality and an airplane crash that killed one in the New York mainland.|$|E
60|$|The small care {{which the}} {{nightingale}} took {{to live up}} to his reputation in this place surprised me a little. Here he could always be heard in the daytime--not one bird, but a dozen--in different parts of the village; but he sang not at night. This I set down to the fact that the nights were dark and the <b>weather</b> <b>unsettled.</b> But later, when the weather grew warmer, and there were brilliant moonlight nights, he was still a silent bird except by day.|$|R
25|$|After {{the period}} of <b>unsettled</b> but drier <b>weather</b> in September, heavy rain began again on 4 October and {{affected}} {{the remainder of the}} campaign, working more to the advantage of the German defenders, being pushed back on to far less damaged ground. The British had to move their artillery forward into the area devastated by shellfire and soaked by the return of heavy rain, restricting the routes on which guns and ammunition could be moved, which presented German artillery with easier targets. In the next British attack on 9 October, after several days of rain, the German defence achieved a costly success, holding the approaches to Passchendaele village, which was the most tactically vital ground.|$|R
25|$|As {{part of the}} United Kingdom, the Vale of Pickering {{generally}} has cool summers and relatively mild winters. Weather conditions vary {{from day to day}} as well as from season to season. The latitude of the area means that it is influenced by predominantly westerly winds with depressions and their associated fronts, bringing with them <b>unsettled</b> and windy <b>weather,</b> particularly in winter. Between depressions there are often small mobile anticyclones that bring periods of fair weather. In winter anticyclones bring cold dry weather. In summer the anticyclones tend to bring dry settled conditions which can lead to drought. For its latitude this area is mild in winter and cooler in summer due to the influence of the Gulf Stream in the northern Atlantic Ocean.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} storms of the season was Hurricane Carla, which peaked as a Category5 hurricane, before weakening slightly and striking Texas. Carla caused 43deaths and approximately $325.74million in damage. Hurricane Debbie was a Category3 storm that existed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Early in its duration, <b>unsettled</b> <b>weather</b> from Debbie in Cape Verde resulted in a plane crash that killed 60people. Debbie then brushed Ireland as either a Category1 hurricane or shortly after becoming extratropical. The next storm, Hurricane Esther, threatened to strike New England as a major hurricane, but rapidly weakened and made landfall in Massachusetts as only a tropical storm. Impact was generally minor, with about $6million in damage and seven deaths, all of which from a United States Navy plane crash. An unnamed tropical storm and Hurricane Frances caused minimal impact on land. In mid-October, Tropical Storm Gerda brought flooding to Jamaica and eastern Cuba, resulting in twelve deaths.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the hurricane's track, it posed {{little to}} no threat to any major landmasses or {{populated}} islands. During Celia's early development stages, it brought moderate rainfall to parts of Oaxaca and Guerrero; however, no loss of life or structural damage was reported. Beaches in both states {{increased the number of}} lifeguards on duty since the threat of rip currents would remain high for several days. On June22, the Sistema Nacional de Protección Civil (National System of Civil Protection) in the Mexican state of Jalisco raised the alert level to stage two for coastal areas. People were urged to be cautious about venturing out into coastal waters as the storm produced rough seas near the coast. The alert was later expanded upon to include coastal areas of Michoacán and Colima. Although out of the storm's projected path, a precautionary alert was issued for Socorro Island. However, between June22 and 23, the outer bands of the storm brought <b>unsettled</b> <b>weather</b> to France's Clipperton Island. Since this island is unpopulated, the NHC did not issue any warnings for it.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Francelia {{struck the}} Bay Islands, the Honduran health {{ministry}} flew {{a doctor and}} nurse with medical supplies to the islands. Undamaged boats were used to transport people and supplies to the islands, utilizing relief goods intended for the recovery after a war earlier in 1969. In Guatemala, the president organized the National Emergency Committee to coordinate disaster relief, but after few organizations complied, there was duplicate relief work in some areas and no assistance in other areas. The Guatemalan Red Cross and the country's air force and army helped in the relief efforts. Citizens throughout the country donated over $200,000 worth of food and clothing. The government made widespread road and bridge repairs following the floods {{with the assistance of}} the United States, installing two Bailey bridges that were completed by early November; there were delays installing the bridges due to persistent <b>unsettled</b> <b>weather.</b> The United States ultimately provided $281,659 in aid to the country, mostly through the road reconstruction and C-rations. Other countries and Red Cross chapters sent money to Guatemala, including 10tons of medicine from Brazil, 500blankets from Chile, and 200bottles of snake bite serum from Costa Rica. El Salvador also received assistance from the United States, including food and blankets.|$|E
500|$|The United Kingdom has {{the highest}} {{incidence}} of tornadoes, measured by unit area of land, {{than any other country}} in the world. [...] <b>Unsettled</b> conditions and <b>weather</b> fronts transverse the Islands at all times of the years and are responsible for spawning the tornadoes, which consequently form at all times of the year. The United Kingdom has at least 34 tornadoes per year and possibly as many as 50, more than {{any other country in the}} world relative to its land area. Most tornadoes in the United Kingdom are weak, but they are occasionally destructive. For example, the Birmingham tornado of 2005 and the London tornado of 2006. Both registered F2 on the Fujita scale and both caused significant damage and injury.|$|R

5|$|Hutton scored 2,145 runs in 1951 {{with nine}} centuries, {{including}} his 100th in first-class cricket. The South Africans toured England, losing the Test series 3–1. After Hutton scored fifty {{in the first}} Test, which was won by South Africa, his 100th century almost came during the third Test, when he scored an unbeaten 98 in the second innings to take England to victory. But the innings provoked controversy when Hutton's team-mates seemed to decline easy runs to allow Hutton the opportunity to reach his hundred {{before the end of}} the match, thereby jeopardising England's chances of victory in <b>unsettled</b> <b>weather.</b> The 100th century came a week later, against Surrey, when Hutton became the thirteenth player to achieve the landmark. He followed this immediately with 194 not out against Nottinghamshire and 100, in the drawn fourth Test at Headlingley. In the final Test, which England won to take the series, Hutton became the first man in Tests, and only the fourth in all first-class cricket, to be given out obstructing the field: he edged a ball in the air and legitimately knocked it away from his wickets with his bat; in doing so, he prevented a catch being taken and was given out. This remains the only such instance in Tests. Hutton ended the Test series with 378 runs at an average of 54.00. Late in the season, he scored a century against Gloucestershire to become the second Yorkshire player after Sutcliffe to complete centuries against the other 16 first-class counties.|$|E
