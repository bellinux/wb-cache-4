5|$|Humans in {{good health}} excrete <b>urine</b> that is largely free of protein. Therefore, since 1827 {{physicians}} and scientists {{have been interested in}} proteinuria, the excess of protein in human <b>urine,</b> as an indicator of kidney disease. To better understand the etiology of proteinuria, some scientists attempted to study the phenomenon in laboratory animals. Between 1932 and 1933 a number of scientists, including Thomas Addis, independently reported the surprising finding that some healthy rodents have protein in their <b>urine.</b> However, {{it was not until the}} 1960s that the major urinary proteins of mice and rats were first described in detail. It was found that the proteins are primarily made in the liver of males and secreted through the kidneys into the <b>urine</b> in large quantities (milligrams per day).|$|E

Blood tests may also be useful. Stones are typically classified by their location: nephrolithiasis (in the kidney), ureterolithiasis (in the ureter), cystolithiasis (in the bladder), or by what they are made of (calcium oxalate, uric acid, struvite, cystine).|$|E

40|$|Ethylsuccinylcarnitine, a {{previously}} undescribed acylcarnitine, was identified in <b>urines</b> obtained from 81 % of adult volunteers.

Its urinary excretion followed a circadian rhythm with a maximum occurring between 8 p. m. and 1 a. m. Excretion of this compound was enhanced after a load of L-carnitine and in this case, total 24 -h urinary excretion may raise up to about 75 microM.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>urines</b> of 23 stone-formers {{presenting}} repeated {{calcium oxalate}} lithiasis and 12 control subjects were collected at six different time periods daily. Super-saturations for calcium oxalate and brushite (DCPD) were calculated using ionic and solubility products. <b>Urines</b> {{of both groups}} were supersaturated for calcium oxalate but only <b>urines</b> of the stone-formers were super-saturated for brushite, the most simple calcium phosphate which nucleates very easily at the urinary pH.

5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance <b>urine</b> production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the <b>urine</b> more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If <b>urine</b> alkalinization is used, the pH of the <b>urine</b> is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is often used to ensure sufficient <b>urine</b> production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E

40|$|Crystal {{agglomeration}} is a {{major element}} in calcium oxalate urinary stone formation. The effects of <b>urines</b> from 36 healthy subjects and 86 calcium oxalate renal stone formers on calcium oxalate monohydrate crystallization kinetics were studied using a seeded crystal growth method in which the solubility, the growth and the agglomeration of the crystals are measured as three separate and system-independent parameters. The <b>urines</b> of healthy subjects were found to increase the solubility and to strongly inhibit the growth and the agglomeration of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. The <b>urines</b> of stone formers had a similar effect on the solubility, but a significantly lower ability to inhibit the crystal growth and the crystal agglomeration. Of these two kinetic processes the inhibition of crystal agglomeration was more clearly affected, with 55 % of the stone formers having abnormally low values, while the changes in crystal growth inhibition occurred within the normal range. The defect in crystal agglomeration inhibition was related to stone frequency, and <b>urines</b> from patients with very high stone frequency rates had also the most severely impaired ability to inhibit the agglomeration of the calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals. The inhibitory effect of <b>urines</b> on crystal agglomeration {{was found to be}} related to its citrate content (r = 0. 68, P < 0. 001). All patients with hypocitraturia, except two, had also abnormally low values for crystal agglomeration inhibition. In a group of 15 hypocitraturic stone formers, alkali treatment for a mean period of 18 months resulted in a parallel increase in urinary citrate excretion and in the ability of <b>urines</b> to inhibit crystal agglomeration (r = 0. 77, P < 0. 001). These results show that defective inhibition of the kinetic process of crystal agglomeration constitutes a major physicochemical mechanism of calcium oxalate renal stone formation, which appears to be modulated by urinary citrate concentrations...|$|R

5|$|Chelation challenge, {{also known}} as {{provocation}} testing, is used to indicate an elevated and mobilizable body burden of heavy metals including lead. This testing involves collecting <b>urine</b> before and after administering a one-off dose of chelating agent to mobilize heavy metals into the <b>urine.</b> Then <b>urine</b> is analyzed by a laboratory for levels of heavy metals; from this analysis overall body burden is inferred. Chelation challenge mainly measures the burden of lead in soft tissues, though whether it accurately reflects long-term exposure or the amount of lead stored in bone remains controversial. Although the technique {{has been used to}} determine whether chelation therapy is indicated and to diagnose heavy metal exposure, some evidence does not support these uses as blood levels after chelation are not comparable to the reference range typically used to diagnose heavy metal poisoning. The single chelation dose could also redistribute the heavy metals to more sensitive areas such as central nervous system tissue.|$|E

40|$|Background—Currently used {{biomarkers}} for acute kidney injury (AKI), namely Ngal, SCr, and BUN, {{are inadequate}} for timely detection of AKI in preterm infants. Methods—Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling {{was conducted on}} <b>urines</b> from 20 preterm infants to determine if novel metabolic biomarkers could be identified for early detection of AKI. <b>Urines</b> were collected from every patient each day for the first 14 days of life. NMR spectra were measured for all <b>urines</b> and metabolic profiling analysis conducted. Results—One metabolite, carnitine, increased significantly in <b>urines</b> of three extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants starting on day five of life. The three affected infants either received prolonged antibiotic treatment, extended treatment with indomethacin, or both. One ELBW patient who received both treatments and reached the highest urinary carnitine level died on day 10 of life due to localized gut perforation complicated by suspected AKI. Conclusions—It was concluded that carnitine increased in the three neonates {{in part due to}} antibiotic- and/or indomethacin-induced AKI. It is hypothesized that combined antibiotic and indomethacin treatment promoted AKI resulting in reduced proximal renal tubule reabsorption of carnitine and that β-lactam antibiotics blocked renal carnitine uptake by human organic cation transporter, hOCTN 2...|$|R

On the other hand, urinary excretions of both estrogens and ratios of estriol/estrone + estradiol appeared to increase in patients with regeneration of liver cells, distortion of lobular architecture, and increase of connective tissue accompanied with its collagenation. 4) At acute icteric stages of most acute hepatitis urinary excretions of total estrogens were increased.
