40|$|Corporation, {{is part of}} a {{strategy}} to boost economic growth, in this case through increasing {{the quantity and quality of}} available human resources. The plan envisions subsidies to encourage the return of former residents. Indiana’s population growth has been weak relative to the rest of the country, though not as weak as in the 1970 s and 80 s. It is set to return to a much weaker pace, however, according the US Census Bureau. In 1972 - 87, Indiana’s population growth rate was only 0. 2 percent per year, well below the <b>US</b> <b>pace</b> of one percent per year. In some years, population even fell (1980 - 83 and 1986). Subsequently, Indiana’s population grew at a 0. 8 percent average annual rate from 1987 to 2005, closer to, but still below, the national pace of 1. 2 percent per year. Over the next 25 years US population growth is expected to slow (0. 8 percent per year) and Indiana’s is expected to fall back more sharply (to 0. 3 percent per year). Such slow growth in population and the workforce will curtail the pace of expansion of overall output and income in the US and all the more so in Indiana. 1 A broader effort could usefully focus on recruiting others to migrate to Indiana or on inducing existing residents to stay.

6000|$|Highways and cross-paths are hastily traversed, and, clambering down a crag, I {{find myself}} at the {{extremity}} of a long beach. How gladly does the spirit leap forth and suddenly enlarge its sense of being to {{the full extent of}} the broad blue, sunny deep! A greeting and a homage to the sea! I descend over its margin and dip my hand into the wave that meets me, and bathe my brow. That far-resounding roar is Ocean's voice of welcome. His salt breath brings a blessing along with it. Now let <b>us</b> <b>pace</b> together--the reader's fancy arm in arm with mine--this noble beach, which extends a mile or more from that craggy promontory to yonder rampart of broken rocks. In front, the sea; in the rear, a precipitous bank the grassy verge of which is breaking away year after year, and flings down its tufts of verdure upon the barrenness below. The beach itself is a broad space of sand, brown and sparkling, with hardly any pebbles intermixed. Near the water's edge there is a wet margin which glistens brightly in the sunshine and reflects objects like a mirror, and as we tread along the glistening border a dry spot flashes around each footstep, but grows moist again as we lift our feet. In some spots the sand receives a complete impression of the sole, square toe and all; elsewhere it is of such marble firmness that we must stamp heavily to leave a print even of the iron-shod heel. Along the whole of this extensive beach gambols the surf-wave. Now it makes a feint of dashing onward in a fury, yet dies away with a meek murmur and does but kiss the strand; now, after many such abortive efforts, it rears itself up in an unbroken line, heightening as it advances, without a speck of foam on its green crest. With how fierce a roar it flings itself forward and rushes far up the beach! ...|$|R
30|$|Long term {{outcomes}} are still unclear in LDCs, {{such as the}} precise mortality reduction rate, the overdiagnosis rate and false positive rate. Based on the current evidence from DC, they are still controversial (Jorgensen 2013). Some studies show a “significant” mortality reduction benefit {{of as much as}} 28 – 65  %, (Berry et al. 2005) while others show a “minimum” benefit of as little as 15  % (Gotzsche and Jorgensen 2013). Improvement in systemic treatments also contributed to mortality reduction, as 30  % reduction in breast cancer mortality was observed after screening and adjuvant therapy, 10  % of this reduction is due to screening and 20  % is due to treatment (Berry 2013). Overdiagnosis refers to MS detected breast cancers that might never have progressed to become symptomatic during a woman’s lifetime (The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2002). SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) incidence and mortality data showed increased cancer diagnosis with no obvious change in cancer mortality, suggesting the existence of overdiagnosis (Welch and Black 2010). Based on varying assumptions and statistical methods, one study extracted incidence data from two randomized controlled trials and found a “minimum rate” to be around 1  %; (Duffy et al. 2005) while a review based on published trends on incidence in five DCs found a “substantial rate” of 52  % (Jorgensen and Gotzsche 2009). Plausible estimates need appropriate adjustments for lead time bias and the pre-existing trend of increasing incidence in the population, so an overdiagnosis rate range from 1 to 10  % is generally accepted (Puliti et al. 2012). False positive findings are another inevitable challenge, may result in subsequent unnecessary surgical intervention, as well as greater short-term and long-term negative psychosocial consequences (Brodersen and Siersma 2013). Estimated false positive rate was 17  % for women undergoing 10 biennial screening tests in Europe, (Paci 2012) and about 61  % for 40 - or 50 -year-old women undergoing 10  years of annual mammography in <b>US</b> (<b>Pace</b> and Keating 2014).|$|R
