2500|$|The network {{continued}} {{to be limited to}} its six-transmitter chain in Ontario for its first decade. However, soon after Asper bought controlling interest in Global, he seemed eager to grow his chain of stations into a third national network. He started by launching two stations in Saskatchewan, and winning a legal battle for a station in Vancouver {{during the second half of}} the 1980s. He also acquired a fledgling system in the Maritimes in the early 1990s. Canwest's stations now reached seven of Canada's ten provinces. The Canwest stations purchased many of their programs collectively, and consequently had similar – although not identical – broadcast schedules. They did not share common branding, however — although stations were sometimes indicated as being part of the [...] "CanWest Global System" [...] as a secondary brand, throughout the 1980s and early 1990s they each retained their own branding and {{continued to}} function as an ownership group of independent stations rather than as a fully <b>unified</b> <b>network.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Line 12 {{was founded}} as [...] "Line A" [...] by the Nord-Sud Company, who also built line 13. It was built between 1905 and 1910, {{to connect the}} districts of Montparnasse, in the south, and Montmartre, in the north. The first trip, from Porte de Versailles to Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, was on 5 November 1910. The line was the second to be built on the north-south axis of the city, in {{competition}} with Line 4 of the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (Paris Metropolitan Railway Company," [...] CMP). It was extended bit by bit until 1934 when it reached Mairie d'Issy in the south. Tunnelling to the northern terminus at the Porte de la Chapelle on the perimeter of Paris had been completed in 1916. In 1930, the CMP bought the Nord-Sud company and Line A was integrated into the new, <b>unified</b> <b>network</b> as Line 12. In 1949, the CMP was itself merged into the RATP, Paris's public transport company. They operate the line today and have plans to extend it south {{as far as the}} town of Issy, and north to La Plaine Saint-Denis.|$|E
