40|$|Abstract. Magnetars (SGRs and AXPs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{evolutionary}} paths of a neutron star. These objects have an <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> B ∼ 10 15 G at their surface and show persistent X-ray pulsations and transient bursts. Till date there are 14 magnetars known: 5 SGRs (4 confirmed, 1 candidate) and 9 AXPs (7 confirmed, 2 candidates). It is an open puzzle that all these objects are isolated and none have been found in binaries. We discuss the formation scenario which can lead to such a situation...|$|E
40|$|Magnetars {{are young}} and highly {{magnetized}} neutron stars which display {{a wide array of}} X-ray activity including short bursts, large outbursts, giant flares and quasi-periodic oscillations, often coupled with interesting timing behavior including enhanced spin-down, glitches and anti-glitches. The bulk of this activity is explained by the evolution and decay of an <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> stressing and breaking the neutron star crust, which in turn drives twists of the external magnetosphere and powerful magnetospheric currents. The population of detected magnetars has grown to about 30 objects and shows unambiguous phenomenological connection with very highly magnetized radio pulsars. Recent progress in magnetar theory includes explanation of the hard X-ray component in the magnetar spectrum and development of surface heating models, explaining the sources' remarkable radiative output.

40|$|Magnetars {{comprise}} {{two classes}} of rotating neutron stars (Soft Gamma Repeaters (SGRs) and Anomalous X-ray Pulsars), whose X-ray emission is powered by an <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> B ~ 10 ^ 15 G. Occasionally SGRs enter into active episodes producing many short X-ray bursts; extremely rarely (about once per 50 years per source), SGRs emit a giant flare, an event with total energy at least 1000 {{times higher than the}}ir typical bursts. Here we report that, on 2004 December 27, SGR 1806 - 20 emitted the brightest extra-solar transient event ever recorded, even surpassing the full moon brightness for 0. 2 seconds. The total (isotropic) flare energy is 2 x 10 ^ 46 erg, 100 times higher than the only two previous events, making this flare a once in a century event. This colossal energy release likely occurred during a catastrophic reconfiguration of the magnetar's magnetic field. Such an event would have resembled a short, hard Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) if it had occurred within 40 Mpc, suggesting that extragalactic SGR flares may indeed form a subclass of GRBs.

40|$|The {{recently}} discovered soft gamma-ray emission from the anomalous X-ray pulsar 1 E 1841 - 045 has a luminosity L_g ~ 10 ^{ 36 } ergs/s. This luminosity exceeds the spindown power by three {{orders of magnitude}} and must be fed by an alternative source of energy such as an <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> A gradual release {{of energy in the}} stellar magnetosphere is expected if it is twisted and a strong electric current is induced on the closed field lines. We examine two mechanisms of gamma-ray emission associated with the gradual dissipation of this current. (1) A thin surface layer of the star is heated by the downward beam of current-carrying charges, which excite Langmuir turbulence in the layer. As a result, it can reach a temperature kT ~ 100 keV and emit bremsstrahlung photons up to this characteristic energy. (2) The magnetosphere is also a source of soft gamma rays at a distance of ~ 100 km from the star, where the electron cyclotron energy is in the keV range. A large electric field develops in this region in response to the outward drag force felt by the current-carrying electrons from the flux of keV photons leaving the star. A seed positron injected in this region undergoes a runaway acceleration and upscatters keV photons above the threshold for pair creation. The created pairs emit a synchrotron spectrum consistent with the observed 20 - 100 keV emission. This spectrum is predicted to extend to higher energies and reach a peak at ~ 1 MeV.

40|$|We {{study the}} pulse morphologies and pulse amplitudes of {{thermally}} emitting neutron stars with ultrastrong magnetic fields. The beaming of the radiation {{emerging from a}} magnetar was recently shown to be predominantly non-radial, with a small pencil and a broad fan component. We show {{that the combination of}} this radiation pattern with the effects of strong lensing in the gravitational field of the neutron star yields pulse profiles that show a qualitatively different behavior compared to that of the radially-peaked beaming patterns explored previously. Specifically, we find that: (i) the pulse profiles of magnetars with a single emission region on their surface exhibit 1 − 2 peaks, whereas those with an antipodal emission geometry have 1 − 4 peaks depending on the neutron star compactness, the observer viewing angle, {{and the size of the}} hotspots; (ii) the energy dependence of the beaming pattern may give rise to weakly or strongly energy-dependent pulse profiles and may introduce phase lags between different energy bands; (iii) the non-radial beaming pattern can give rise to high pulsed fractions even for very relativistic neutron stars; (iv) the pulsed fraction may not vary monotonically with neutron star compactness; (v) the pulsed fraction does not decrease monotonically with the size of the emitting region; (vi) the pulsed fraction from a neutron star with a single hotspot has, in general, a very weak energy dependence, in contrast to the case of an antipodal geometry. Comparison of these results to the observed properties of anomalous X-ray pulsars strongly suggests that they are neutron stars with a single hot region of <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Subject headings: radiation mechanisms:thermal — stars:magnetic fields — stars:neutron — X-rays:stars 1...|$|E

40|$|SGRs/AXPs are {{considered}} a subclass of pulsars powered by magnetic energy and not by rotation, as normal radio pulsars. They are understood as strongly magnetized neutron star, with large periods of rotation P∼(2 - 12) s, and large spin-down, with typical Ṗ∼(10 ^- 13 - 10 ^- 10) s/s in contrast to Ṗ∼ 10 ^- 15 s for ordinary pulsars. Their persistent X-ray luminosity, {{as well as the}} bursts and flares typical of these sources, are instead believed to be powered by the decay of their <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> SGRs/AXPs typically have a larger X-ray luminosity that can not be explained by their spin-down luminosity (L_X>Ė_ rot), unlike rotation-powered pulsars. However, the recent discovery of radio-pulsed emission in four of this class of sources, where the spin-down rotational energy lost Ė_ rot is larger than the X-ray luminosity L_X during the quiescent state - as in normal pulsars - opens the question of the nature of these radio sources in comparison to the others of this class. In this contribution, we show that the radio SGRs/AXPs obey a linear log-log relation between L_X and Ė_ rot, very similar to the one satisfied by X-ray and gamma-ray neutron star pulsars, suggesting their neutron star nature. Furthermore, we show that almost all the high-B pulsars are also near the line found for the radio AXPs. In contrast, for almost all the others SGRs/AXPs, L_X does not vary too much as function of Ė_ rot, a phenomenology not shared by X-ray neutron star pulsars, suggesting a different nature for these sources.

50|$|Energy is {{typically}} stored within electrostatic <b>fields</b> (capacitors), <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> (inductor), as mechanical energy (using large flywheels connected to special purpose high current alternators), or as chemical energy (high-current lead-acid batteries, or explosives). By releasing the stored energy over {{a very short}} interval (a process that is called energy compression), {{a huge amount of}} peak power can be delivered to a load. For example, if one joule of energy is stored within a capacitor and then evenly released to a load over one second, the average power delivered to the load would only be 1 watt. However, if all of the stored energy were released within one microsecond, the average power would be one megawatt, a million times greater.

Besides Russian, the Kapitsa family also spoke Romanian. Kapitsa's studies were interrupted by the First World War, in which he served as an ambulance driver for two years on the Polish front. He graduated from the Petrograd Polytechnical Institute in 1918. He subsequently studied in Britain, working for over ten years with Ernest Rutherford in the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, and founding the influential Kapitza club. He was the first director (1930-34) of the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge. In the 1920s he originated techniques for creating <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> by injecting high current for brief periods into specially constructed air-core electromagnets.

40|$|The objects {{known as}} {{anomalous}} X-ray pulsars and soft gamma repeaters are commonly identified with magnetars, neutron stars with <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> The rotational history {{of these objects}} has, so far, revealed no evidence of free precession. At the same time these objects do not generally appear to have magnetic axes nearly parallel or orthogonal to their spin axes. In this paper we show {{that the combination of}} these two observations, together with simple rigid-body dynamics, leads to non-trivial predictions about the interior properties of magnetars: either (i) elastic stresses in magnetar crusts are close to the theoretical upper limit above which the crustal matter yields or (ii) there is a "pinned" superfluid component in the magnetar interior. As a potentially observable consequence of these ideas we point out that, in the case of no pinned superfluidity, magnetars of stronger <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength than those currently observed would have to be nearly aligned/orthogonal rotators.

40|$|The phase {{velocity}} of light is co-parallel to {{the direction of}} energy flow in classical vacuum. However, in certain uncommon materials, these two vectors can be oppositely directed, {{in which case the}} {{phase velocity}} is termed `negative'. This negative phase velocity (NPV) gives rise to many exotic phenomenons, such as negative refraction, inverse Doppler shift and inverse Cerenkov radiation, and has technological allure. According to quantum electrodynamics, the presence of a magnetostatic field makes vacuum an anisotropic medium for the passage of light. Under the influence of a sufficiently strong magnetostatic field, vacuum supports NPV. Such <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are believed to arise due to dynamo action in newborn neutron stars and in binary neutron star mergers, for examples. In view of the possible occurrence of negative refraction, the influence of ultrastrong magnetostatic fields must be carefully taken into account in astronomical observations relating to neutron stars and associated gamma-ray bursts...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model for the {{anomalous}} X-ray pulsars (AXPs) in which the emission is powered by accretion from a fossil disk, established from matter falling back onto the neutron star following its birth. The time-dependent accretion drives the neutron star towards a ``tracking'' solution in which the rotation period of the star increases slowly, in tandem with the declining accretion rate. For appropriate choices of disk mass, neutron star <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength and initial spin period, we demonstrate that a rapidly rotating neutron star can be spun down to periods characteristic of AXPs on timescales comparable to the estimated ages of these sources. In other cases, accretion onto the neutron star switches off after a short time, and the star becomes an ordinary radio pulsar. Thus, in our picture, radio pulsars and AXPs are drawn from the same underlying population, in contrast to models involving neutron stars with <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields,</b> which require a new population of stars with very different properties.

40|$|Recent {{models of}} {{spectral}} formation in magnetars called renewed attention on electron-photon scattering {{in the presence}} of <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Investigations presented so far mainly focused on mildly relativistic particles and magnetic scattering was treated in the non-relativistic (Thomson) limit. This allows for consistent spectral calculations up to a few tens of keV, but becomes inadequate in modelling the hard tails (<~ 200 keV) detected by INTEGRAL from magnetar sources. In this paper, the second in a series devoted to model the X-/soft γ-ray persistent spectrum of magnetar candidates, we present explicit, relatively simple expressions for the magnetic Compton cross-section at resonance which account for Landau-Raman scattering up to the second Landau level. No assumption is made on the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength. We find that sensible departures from the Thomson regime can be already present at B ~ 5 × 1012 G.

40|$|The {{observed}} {{upper bound}} on the spin down rate of the otherwise typical Soft Gamma-ray Repeater SGR 0418 + 5729 has challenged the interpretation of this source as a neutron star with <b>ultrastrong</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Current limits imply a dipole <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength of less than 7. 5 x 10 ^{ 12 } G (Rea et al. 2010), which is significantly smaller {{than that of a}} typical SGR. Independent of the properties inferred from X-ray timing, the X-ray spectra of neutron stars allow a measurement of their <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strengths because they are distorted from pure blackbodies due to the presence of a <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in a radiative equilibrium atmosphere. In this paper, we model high signal-to-noise XMM-Newton spectra of SGR 0418 + 5729 to place constraints on the strength of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> at the surface of the neutron star. Our analysis shows that neutron star atmosphere models with moderate <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strengths (10 ^{ 12 - 13 } G) cannot fit the X-ray spectra, whereas, models with stronger <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> are able to account for the observations. We find that the strength of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> at the surface is 1. 0 x 10 ^{ 14 } G. This value, although lower than all of the other SGRs analyzed to date, is still high enough to generate the observed X-ray bursts from the source.

In particular, when a weak dc electric field is applied, we prove that the phase shifts of all harmonics linearly depend on the dc field strength. In addition, when an <b>ultrastrong</b> static <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is applied collinearly with the driving laser polarization, harmonic generation efficiency is enhanced and higher harmonics beyond the usual "cutoff" are generated {{as a result of the}} squeezing of the transversely spreading electron wave packets.

Positive pressure triggered gaps have a limited operating voltage range (for instance, from 1/3 to 2/3 of the self breakdown voltage). Triggered vacuum gaps offer a wide operating voltage range (400 V to 90 kV is achievable). Both classes can switch higher energy levels than any thyristor, thyratron, krytron, or sprytron. Triggered gaps are popular for single-shot and low-repetition-rate applications. One such switch is known as a trigatron. The Ignitron and Crossatron could be considered triggered gaps. The latter is unique in that it can be turned back off by the control electrode after conduction begins. The xenon flash tube is another common triggered gap.

The increased <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> therefore both increases the loss of ions in certain regions (magnetic cusps) and reduces it in other regions (a closed <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> line region). The maximum total ion loss rate is obtained in the situation where the magnetic cusps enable <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> aligned ion loss but where the intrinsic <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> has not yet formed very large and strong closed field line region.|$|R
