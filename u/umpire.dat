5|$|West {{has been}} {{mentioned}} in several polls of MLB players. In 2006, the spring after he was crew chief in the World Series, a Sports Illustrated survey asked 470 MLB players to identify {{the best and worst}} umpires. West was identified as the best MLB <b>umpire</b> by 2 percent of those players, ranking him ninth on that list. With respect to the worst <b>umpire,</b> 6 percent of players in the survey selected West. Only three umpires were named more frequently as worst <b>umpire</b> in the survey. A 2007 review of <b>umpire</b> strike zones by The Hardball Times determined that West was the most consistent <b>umpire</b> in the major leagues.|$|E
5|$|Amanda Clement {{was born}} in Hudson, South Dakota, then part of the Dakota Territory, on March 20, 1888 to Harriet Clement, one of the {{original}} settlers of Eden, South Dakota, and her husband, who died when Amanda was very young. In 1904 Clement traveled to Hawarden, Iowa to watch her brother Hank pitch in a semi-professional game. The <b>umpire</b> for the amateur game taking place before Hank's did not show, and Hank suggested that Amanda, who had played baseball with her brothers and was knowledgeable about the game, serve as the <b>umpire.</b> In so doing, Clement became the first woman paid to <b>umpire</b> a baseball game. Her performance was so well received that she was hired to <b>umpire</b> further semi-professional games.|$|E

5|$|Armando Galarraga and Jim Joyce, {{along with}} Daniel Paisner, {{released}} {{a book titled}} Nobody's Perfect, chronicling their experiences {{during and after the}} game. In June 2011, one year after the near-perfect game, Major League Baseball put a rule into effect that Joyce cannot <b>umpire</b> any games in which Galarraga's team plays. Due to the book release, the two are now business partners, and this relationship could affect Joyce's impartiality while umpiring Galarraga's team. It is similar to the policy that prevented <b>umpire</b> Jim Wolf from being the plate <b>umpire</b> in games that his younger brother Randy pitched in.|$|E
5|$|Fieldin Henry Culbreth III (born March 16, 1963) is an American <b>umpire</b> in Major League Baseball (MLB). He umpired in {{his first}} MLB game in 1993 and became an American League (AL) staff member in 1999 (MLB merged its two <b>umpire</b> staffs into one the {{following}} year).|$|E

25|$|The Elite Panel of ICC <b>Umpires</b> is a {{panel of}} cricket <b>umpires</b> {{appointed}} by the International Cricket Council to officiate in Test matches and One Day Internationals around the world. The panel was first established in April 2002 when the ICC decided to reform the way that international cricket was <b>umpired.</b> The main change was that both <b>umpires</b> in a Test match {{and one of the}} <b>umpires</b> in a One-day international are now independent of the competing nations, whereas before 2002 just one of the <b>umpires</b> in a Test was independent and in ODIs both <b>umpires</b> were from the home nation. The majority of these ICC appointments are fulfilled by the members of the Elite Panel, who are generally thought to be the best <b>umpires</b> in the world. As such the ICC hopes to ensure that <b>umpiring</b> standards are as high as possible. Members of the panel stand in around 10 Tests and 15 ODIs each year. The list of <b>umpires</b> in the panel are revised every year by the ICC <b>umpires</b> selection panel and the current panel consists of ICC general manager Geoff Allardice, chief match referee Ranjan Madugalle, former <b>umpires</b> David Lloyd and Srinivas Venkataraghavan.|$|R

50|$|The 1999 Major League <b>Umpires</b> Association mass {{resignation}} was a labor tactic used by 68 Major League Baseball (MLB) <b>umpires,</b> including 66 {{members of}} the Major League <b>Umpires</b> Association (MLUA), the official <b>umpires</b> union at the time. Unable to strike {{because they had a}} labor agreement in place at the time, 54 <b>umpires</b> formally resigned by orchestrated letters in an attempt to force negotiations with MLB for a new labor agreement. MLB instead immediately accepted the resignations of 22 <b>umpires</b> and hired new ones. The union membership became fractured on the issue, and 42 of the <b>umpires</b> tried to rescind their resignations, but the MLUA was unsuccessful in retaining the jobs of the 22 <b>umpires</b> and the resignations were seen as final. The incident led to the decertification of the MLUA and the formation of a new union, the World <b>Umpires</b> Association (WUA).|$|R
5|$|Culbreth {{became a}} member of the {{official}} AL <b>umpire</b> staff in 1999, when multiple call-up umpires were hired to take the place of umpires who had participated in a mass resignation. He began his career on the AL staff, but in 2000 MLB merged the umpires from its two leagues. Culbreth wore #42 as an AL <b>umpire,</b> but he had to stop using that number after it was retired in recognition of Jackie Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Culbreth was the first-base <b>umpire</b> for Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Matt Garza's no-hitter {{against the}} Detroit Tigers on July 26, 2010. In the third inning, Tigers manager Jim Leyland was {{ejected from the}} game by second-base <b>umpire</b> Marty Foster. Garza's no-hitter was the first by a Rays pitcher. Culbreth was at second base on June 1, 2012, when New York Mets pitcher Johan Santana threw a no-hitter against the St. Louis Cardinals. This no-hitter {{was the first to}} be thrown by a Mets pitcher. Santana benefited from a close call on the third base line by <b>umpire</b> Adrian Johnson; the Carlos Beltrán line drive {{appeared}} to be fair, but Johnson ruled it foul.|$|E
5|$|Culbreth was {{the left}} field <b>umpire</b> for the single-game playoff between the Colorado Rockies and the San Diego Padres that decided the NL's 2007 wild card team. The game {{ended in the}} 13th inning when home plate <b>umpire</b> Tim McClelland called Rockies player Matt Holliday safe at home plate; the call was {{controversial}} and replays did not show clearly whether or not Holliday touched the plate on the play. Colorado won by a score of 9–8.|$|E
50|$|The Major League <b>Umpires</b> Association was a {{union for}} the <b>umpires</b> {{of both the}} American League and the National League. It was formed in 1970. It was {{superseded}} by the World <b>Umpires</b> Association which became the bargaining agent for MLB <b>umpires</b> before the 2000 season.|$|R
25|$|In 1994 the ICC {{introduced}} a policy whereby {{one of the}} <b>umpires</b> in each Test match would be independent of the competing nations, selected from the International Panel of <b>Umpires.</b> Bucknor {{was a member of}} this panel from its foundation until the ICC changed its policy on <b>umpires</b> again in 2002. Since then both <b>umpires</b> in Test matches, and one of the <b>umpires</b> in ODI's have been independent of the competing countries. The officials are now chosen from the Elite Panel of ICC <b>Umpires,</b> whom the ICC consider to be the world's best <b>umpires.</b> Bucknor maintained a place on the Elite Panel from its foundation until his retirement.|$|R
50|$|Adams <b>umpired</b> one National League game on August 26, 1897. He then {{returned}} to Major League <b>umpiring</b> in 1903 for the American League, where he <b>umpired</b> 15 games.|$|R
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with <b>umpire</b> Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and handed it to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the <b>umpire</b> for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is wrong, {{and if he}} {{is incapable}} of interpreting the laws correctly, he should not stand in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single <b>umpire,</b> they are very much guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the <b>umpire</b> to extreme embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|In July of that year, McAleer {{presided over}} the Blues' upset 6–1 loss to the Detroit Tigers. Although the Tigers' manager, Tommy Burns, agreed to forfeit the game for fear that the <b>umpire,</b> Joe Cantillon, would be injured by an angry crowd, McAleer agreed to play the Tigers using a reserve <b>umpire.</b> The Blues {{eventually}} closed {{the season with a}} 54–82 record, placing seventh in the eight-team American League.|$|E

He <b>umpired</b> Grand Finals in 1963, 1965, 1966, 1968, and 1969.|$|R
25|$|The {{association}} employs ten full-time <b>umpires,</b> paired up {{into five}} two-man crews. These <b>umpires</b> service the league as a whole; {{there are not}} separate <b>umpiring</b> crews for each conference. Depending on the flexibility of all ten <b>umpires,</b> the leagues does its best to rotate the game and location assignments. There are also temporary <b>umpires</b> that float in and out in a reserve role. Some of these <b>umpires</b> come {{from the ranks of}} Minor League Baseball and college's Big XII Conference, joining the league {{for a week or two}} while passing through the St. Louis area.|$|R
5|$|In {{his first}} season as a {{full-time}} MLB <b>umpire,</b> West umpired the game in which Willie McCovey hit his 500th career home run. In the same year, he was at first base when Pete Rose tied the NL record for most consecutive games with a hit, {{and he was the}} home plate <b>umpire</b> when Rose broke it the following day. In 1981, West worked first base for Nolan Ryan’s fifth career no-hitter. On October 13, 1981, West was 28 when he became the youngest NL <b>umpire</b> to call an LCS. In 1983, West was suspended for three days and fined US$500 after a shoving incident with Atlanta Braves manager Joe Torre.
