500|$|Musically, {{the first}} wave of bands were just {{considered}} to be playing heavier forms of metal – Venom was part of the new wave of British heavy metal, Celtic Frost was variously described as thrash metal or death metal, and Quorthon of Bathory simply labeled his music [...] "heavy metal". It was not until the second wave that black metal was more clearly defined. A key development during that period was a guitar playing style featuring fast, <b>un-muted</b> tremolo picking or [...] "buzz picking", introduced by Euronymous of Mayhem and Snorre Ruch ("Blackthorn") of Thorns. Other common traits for guitar playing include a high-pitched or treble guitar tone and heavy distortion. Solos and dropped tunings are rare. Overall, the guitar sound tends to be [...] "thin and brittle" [...] compared to other heavy metal genres, with the idea of [...] "heaviness" [...] conveyed through harshness and timbral density rather than low frequency. The bass guitar tends to be buried under the guitar tones, even non-existent. Drums and even vocals are likewise often mixed low, with these production techniques resulting in a blurred [...] "wash" [...] of sound. Vocals are usually high-pitched and raspy shrieks, screams, and snarls, and rarely gutturals and death growls are also employed. The use of keyboards is also frequent.|$|E
2500|$|Norwegian-inspired {{black metal}} guitarists usually favor high-pitched or trebly guitar tones and heavy distortion. The guitar is usually played with fast, <b>un-muted</b> tremolo picking. Guitarists often use dissonance—along with {{specific}} scales, intervals and chord progressions—to {{create a sense}} of dread. The tritone, or flat-fifth, is often used. Guitar solos and low guitar tunings are rare in black metal. The bass guitar is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is not uncommon for the bass to be muted against the guitar, or for it to homophonically follow the low-pitched riffs of the guitar. While electronic keyboards were initially [...] "not heard in [...] type of music", Dimmu Borgir say they started using keyboards [...] "in the background" [...] and then started using them as a [...] "proper instrument" [...] for creating [...] "atmosphere". Some newer black metal bands began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as synthesizers and even orchestras.|$|E
50|$|Xiaoxiang Morning News did not reprint the {{editorial}} on January 8, hence was {{criticized by the}} Central Propaganda Department. It reprinted {{the editorial}} with How to Trust the Feeling to Correction (今天我们如何弥合信任拨正情绪), Follow the Time (要跟得上时代的节拍), and an advertisement for deinsectization service on the same page, and this was understood to be an insinuation to the Global Time. Gong Xiaoyue (龚晓跃), former head of Xiaoxiang Morning News, who got demoted in 2010 because of a special cover, voiced against editorial by Global Times. He got muted on Sina Weibo soon after. His personal Weibo account, {{as well as some}} Nanfang Weekly journalists, got <b>un-muted</b> at the midnight of January 12.|$|E
50|$|The {{transmission}} of a selcall code involves the generation and sequencing {{of a series}} of predefined, audible tones. Both the tone frequencies, and sometimes the tone periods, must be known in advance by both the transmitter and the receiver. Each predefined tone represents a single digit. A series of tones therefore represents a series of digits that represents a number. The number encoded in a selcall burst is used to address one or more receivers. If the receiver is programmed to recognise a certain number, then it will <b>un-mute</b> its speaker so that the transmission can be heard; an unrecognised number is ignored and therefore the receiver remains muted.|$|R
50|$|With {{the rock}} or pop band example, after {{recording}} {{some parts of}} a song, an artist might listen to only the guitar part, by 'muting' all the tracks except the one on which the guitar was recorded. If one then wanted {{to listen to the}} lead vocals in isolation, one would do so by muting all the tracks apart from the lead vocals track. If one wanted to listen to the entire song, one could do so by <b>un-muting</b> all the tracks. If one did not like the guitar part, or found a mistake in it, and wanted to replace it, one could do so by re-recording only the guitar part (i.e., re-recording only the track on which the guitar was recorded), rather than re-recording the entire song.|$|R
5000|$|In {{devices such}} as two-way radios (also known as radiotelephones), the squelch on a local {{receiver}} can be adjusted with a knob, others have push buttons or a sequence of button presses. This setting adjusts the threshold at which signals will open (<b>un-mute)</b> the audio channel. Backing off the control will turn on the audio, and the operator will hear white noise (also called [...] "static" [...] or squelch noise) {{when there is no}} signal present. The usual operation is to adjust the control until the channel just shuts off - then only a small threshold signal is needed to turn on the speaker. However, if a weak signal is annoying, the operator can set the control a little higher thereby adjusting the squelch to open only when stronger signals are received.|$|R

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 format, 55 : 18 in length. The two contrasting works {{performed on the}} recital were Requiem by Gabriel Faure, and The Beautitude of John by Lloyd Pfautsch. The forces employed on the Requiem were a twenty-two voice choir, two violas, two cellos, a contrabass, two horns, an <b>un-muted</b> solo violin, and organ. The Requiem by Gabriel Faure has earned {{a special place in}} the history of music due to its intimate nature. Faure Presents a Mass for the Dead with a sense of calm assurance. There exists no dramatic depiction of impending doom and death is viewed as a happy deliverance rather than a painful passage. (See more in text. ...|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{successful}} linking, {{the receiving}} station generally emits an audible alarm and shows a visual {{alert to the}} operator, thus indicating the incoming call. It also indicates the callsign or other identifying information of the linked station, similar to Caller ID. The operator then <b>un-mutes</b> the radio and answers the call then can talk in a regular conversation or negotiates a data link using voice or the ALE built-in short text message format. Alternatively, digital data can be exchanged via a built-in or external modem (such as a STANAG 5066 or MIL-STD-188-110B serial tone modem) depending on needs and availability. The ALE built-in text messaging facility {{can be used to}} transfer short text messages as an [...] "orderwire" [...] to allow operators to coordinate external equipment such as phone patches or non-embedded digital links, or for short tactical messages.|$|R
40|$|A semi-centralized joint cell muting and user {{scheduling}} scheme for interference coordination in a multicell network is proposed under two different temporal fairness criteria. The main principle behind the proposed scheme {{is that a}} central entity selects a cell muting pattern out of a pattern set at a decision instant, and subsequently the <b>un-muted</b> base stations opportunistically schedule the users in the associated cells, both decisions made on a temporal-fair basis. Although some pattern sets are easily obtainable from static frequency reuse systems, we propose a more general pattern set construction algorithm in this paper. As for the first fairness criterion, all cells are assigned to receive the same temporal share with the ratio between the temporal share of a cell center section {{and that of the}} cell edge section is set to a fixed desired value for all cells. The second fairness criterion is based on the max-min temporal fairness for which the temporal share of the network-wide worst-case user is maximized. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for both criteria. The impact of choice of the cell muting pattern set is also studied through numerical examples for various cellular topologies...|$|E
