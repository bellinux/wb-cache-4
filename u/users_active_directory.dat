50|$|A {{new way of}} {{organizing}} Windows network domains, or groups of resources, called Active Directory, is introduced with Windows 2000 to replace Windows NT's earlier domain model. Active Directory's hierarchical nature allowed administrators a built-in way to manage user and computer policies and user accounts, and to automatically deploy programs and updates with {{a greater degree of}} scalability and centralization than provided in previous Windows versions. User information stored in Active Directory also provided a convenient phone book-like function to end <b>users.</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> domains can vary from small installations with a few hundred objects, to large installations with millions. Active Directory can organise and link groups of domains into a contiguous domain name space to form trees. Groups of trees outside of the same namespace can be linked together to form forests.|$|E

50|$|Unlike other {{high-profile}} vulnerabilities like Heartbleed, Shellshock, Gotofail and POODLE, JASBUG was {{a design}} problem, not an implementation problem, making {{this type of}} vulnerability unusual and {{much more difficult to}} fix.

40|$|This {{project is}} based around the installation, {{configuration}} and deployment of a Microsoft Dynamics CRM On Premise Environment, Microsoft’s Customer Relationship Management software that {{is widely used}} by business for Sales, Marketing and Service purposes. This project also addresses the issue of portability and usability of Microsoft Dynamics CRM as a sales/opportunity tracking system for Relationship Managers and other Sales based employees, by implementing a ‘Portal Application’. The Microsoft Dynamics CRM web client is resource-heavy and quite cluttered, meaning low-powered devices can lead to slow loading times and crashing due to the JavaScript loads and heavy HTML forms. Microsoft’s options for portability (Dynamics CRM for Mobile/Tablet) are also considerably poor ports of the system to a mobile platform. I plan to address this by creating an external portal, using a hosted ASP. Net application using web forms, hosted in Azure, that will also be ported for mobile devices using Xamarin. For the CRM environment, I will be deploying a Microsoft CRM 2015 On Premise environment. For {{the purposes of the}} project, the deployment’s authentication will be done through the <b>user’s</b> <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> credentials. In this instance, the user’s credentials/profiles are stored and managed on an external AD server, using CodeTwo as the <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> management software. The basis of the portal will be created around the ASP. Net web application, connected to a Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2015 organisation, which will be out of the box configuration. Authentication will be done through Form based authentication. Integration between the two systems will be done through a combination of the Microsoft CRM Developer Extensions, and the Microsoft Dynamics CRM API endpoint...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: There {{are several}} systems {{for dealing with}} two way mobile {{authentication}} which may differ in delivering the password to the authorized user or a different entity based on the security constraints. One of the disadvantage of the one factor authentication systems is {{the ease with which}} they can be cracked. This threat has increased over time as new and modern methods can be used for guessing and cracking authentication systems. The need for better and more secure systems has given rise to the concept of the two factor authentication system. In system mentioned here, two factor authentication for android client is provided. Android client is accessing different resources such as users files in a network. One factor is username and password which user gets when they become <b>user</b> of <b>active</b> <b>directory</b> and the second factor is OTP which is generated at client side and encrypted using RSA algorithm and at server side it is decrypted using same algorithm. OAuth is used to authorize the android client and providing it limited access in network. Client gets access token and only by using that client can access user’s resources...|$|R
50|$|<b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> {{roles are}} {{expanded}} with identity, certificate, and rights management services. <b>Active</b> <b>Directory,</b> until Windows Server 2003, allowed network administrators to centrally manage connected computers, to set policies {{for groups of}} users, and to centrally deploy new applications to multiple computers. This role of <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> is being renamed as <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Domain Services (ADDS). A number of other additional services are being introduced, including <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Federation Services (ADFS), <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS), (formerly <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Application Mode, or ADAM), <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Certificate Services (ADCS), and <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Rights Management Services (ADRMS). Identity and certificate services allow administrators to manage user accounts and the digital certificates {{that allow them to}} access certain services and systems. Federation management services enable enterprises to share credentials with trusted partners and customers, allowing a consultant to use his company user name and password to log in on a client's network. Identity Integration Feature Pack is included as <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Metadirectory Services. Each of these services represents a server role.|$|R

5000|$|Microsoft previewed <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> in 1999, {{released}} it first with Windows 2000 Server edition, and revised it to extend functionality and improve administration in Windows Server 2003. Additional improvements came with subsequent versions of Windows Server. In Windows Server 2008, additional services {{were added to}} <b>Active</b> <b>Directory,</b> such as <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Federation Services. The part of the directory in charge of management of domains, which was previously a core part of the operating system, was renamed <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> Domain Services (ADDS) and became a server role like others.

5000|$|<b>Active</b> <b>Directory,</b> {{like many}} information-technology efforts, {{originated}} {{out of a}} democratization of design using Request for Comments or RFCs. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), which oversees the RFC process, has accepted numerous RFCs initiated by widespread participants. <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> incorporates decades of communication technologies into the overarching <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> concept then makes improvements upon them. For example, LDAP underpins <b>Active</b> <b>Directory.</b> Also X.500 directories and the Organizational Unit preceded the <b>Active</b> <b>Directory</b> concept that makes use of those methods. The LDAP concept began to emerge even before the founding of Microsoft in April 1975, with RFCs as early as 1971. RFCs contributing to LDAP include RFC 1823 (on the LDAP API, August 1995), [...] RFC 2307, RFC 3062, and RFC 4533.|$|R
