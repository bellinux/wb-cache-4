5|$|Niandra LaDes and <b>Usually</b> <b>Just</b> a T-Shirt {{combines}} avant-garde and stream-of-consciousness styles, with guitar, {{piano and}} various effects on a four-track recorder. The album's first half, Niandra Lades, was recorded before Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992; during {{the recording of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik. The second half, <b>Usually</b> <b>Just</b> a T-Shirt, was recorded while the band was on tour {{in the months leading}} up to Frusciante's departure. Niandra Lades and <b>Usually</b> <b>Just</b> a T-Shirt sold poorly upon its release in 1994, and was taken off the market, only to be re-released in 1999.|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} while incubating, {{this bird}} <b>usually</b> (<b>just</b> under 50% of the time) partly covers its eggs with nest material when the disruption is not sudden, but a bird with an incomplete clutch usually does {{not attempt to}} cover the eggs. When the disruption is sudden, on the other hand, the black-necked grebe <b>usually</b> (<b>just</b> under 50% of the time) does not cover its eggs. In comparison, other species of grebes cover up their eggs when leaving the nest. Predation is usually not {{the primary cause of}} egg loss, with most nesting failures occurring after the chicks have hatched. A major cause of this is the chilling of the young.|$|E
5|$|From {{the data}} he {{collected}} and documented, Aristotle inferred {{quite a number}} of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (<b>usually</b> <b>just</b> one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.|$|E

5|$|It is {{very rare}} for snow to fall in the U.S. state of Florida, {{especially}} in the central and southern portions of the state. With {{the exception of the}} far northern areas {{of the state and the}} Jacksonville area, most of the major cities of Florida have never recorded measurable snowfall, have only recorded trace (T) amounts, or have only reported flurries in the air, <b>usually</b> <b>just</b> a few times each century.

5|$|Niandra LaDes and <b>Usually</b> <b>Just</b> a T-Shirt {{incorporated}} Frusciante's avant-garde {{style of}} song composition, with his stream-of-consciousness methodology. He recorded, mixed, produced and mastered the entire record by himself, and released it on Rick Rubin's label, American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, originally held {{the rights to}} the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. Because he was living as a recluse, however, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album under his label.|$|E
5|$|Some noncoding DNA {{sequences}} play structural {{roles in}} chromosomes.

An abundant form of noncoding DNA in humans are pseudogenes, which are copies of genes that have been disabled by mutation. These sequences are <b>usually</b> <b>just</b> molecular fossils, although they can occasionally serve as raw genetic material {{for the creation of}} new genes through the process of gene duplication and divergence.|$|E

5|$|The discography of John Frusciante, who is {{best known}} as the former guitarist of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{consists}} of eleven solo albums and four EPs, as well as two albums with collaborators Joe Lally and Josh Klinghoffer under the name Ataxia and one EP and one album under the alias of Trickfinger. After recording Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, Frusciante left the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1992 when he got tired of the growing success of the band. He released his first solo album, Niandra LaDes and <b>Usually</b> <b>Just</b> a T-Shirt, in 1994 on American Recordings. His second record, Smile From the Streets You Hold, was released in 1997 and later taken off the market at his request in 1999. After returning to the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1998, Frusciante recorded Californication with the band and subsequently released his third solo album, To Record Only Water for Ten Days, in February 2001 on Warner Music Group.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} eighteen, {{he joined}} the Red Hot Chili Peppers, first {{appearing}} on the band's 1989 album, Mother's Milk. The group's follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered {{a long period of}} drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra Lades and <b>Usually</b> <b>Just</b> a T-Shirt (1994) and Smile from the Streets You Hold (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their next album, Californication (1999) would eventually go on to sell 16 million copies. His album To Record Only Water for Ten Days was released in 2001. A fourth album with the Chili Peppers, By the Way was released in 2002. On a creative spree, Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004; each album explored different recording techniques and genres. 2006 saw the release of his fifth and final album with the Chili Peppers, Stadium Arcadium. In 2009, Frusciante released The Empyrean, which features Flea and Josh Klinghoffer, and announced he had again parted ways with the Chili Peppers.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, <b>usually</b> <b>just</b> prior to the glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of}} the flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing door release. Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the door release line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

25|$|Mongolians {{do not use}} {{surnames}} in the {{way that}} most Westerners, Chinese or Japanese do. Since the socialist period, patronymics – then called ovog, now called etsgiin ner – are used instead of a surname. If the father's name is unknown, a matronymic is used. The patro- or matronymic is written before the given name. Therefore, if a man with given name Tsakhia has a son, and gives the son the name Elbegdorj, the son's full name is Tsakhia Elbegdorj. Very frequently, the patronymic is given in genitive case, i.e. Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj. However, the patronymic is rather insignificant in everyday use and <b>usually</b> <b>just</b> given as an initial – Ts. Elbegdorj. People are normally just referred to and addressed by their given name (Elbegdorj guai – Mr. Elbegdorj), and if two people share a common given name, they are <b>usually</b> <b>just</b> kept apart by their initials, not by the full patronymic.|$|E

25|$|Like their Irish neighbours, the Norsemen of Dublin {{used the}} post-and-wattle method to {{construct}} their dwellings.
