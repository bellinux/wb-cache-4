25|$|The Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) {{formerly}} known as the <b>Ultra</b> <b>Light</b> Combat Vehicle (ULCV), is a U.S. Army proposed air-droppable light off-road vehicle to improve the mobility of light infantry brigades. In March 2015, the Army changed the name of the ULCV to the Ground Mobility Vehicle. GMV is intended to be carried internally in a CH-47 Chinook or externally by a UH-60 Black Hawk. In order to be survivable but transportable, the GMV would be lightly armored and use speed, maneuverability, and off-road mobility to avoid major threats.|$|E
25|$|In July 1938, the British Government {{formed a}} Civil Air Guard to train pilots {{for what was}} widely seen as the {{forthcoming}} war. The Bristol and Wessex Aeroplane Club {{was one of the}} training organisations enlisted in this effort, and in addition No. 33 Elementary and Reserve Flying Training School was established at Whitchurch to prepare RAFVR pilots. In August 1938, Frank Barnwell, the chief designer of the Bristol Aeroplane Company, died when an <b>ultra</b> <b>light</b> monoplane he had designed and built himself, the Barnwell B.S.W., struck a bump when taking off and stalled, crashing onto a nearby road.|$|E

2500|$|A {{suitable}} powerplant for {{a compact}} rotorcraft {{had been identified}} {{in the form of}} the Turbomeca Palouste turbojet engine, for which arrangements had already been independently reached with British firm Blackburn to produce the engine under licence from Turbomeca. Fairey adopted the Palouste engine, which provided compressed air through the hollow rotor blades to the tip jets. According to aviation author Derek Wood: [...] "the Fairy <b>Ultra</b> <b>Light</b> was a masterpiece of simplicity. It dispensed with a tail rotor since the tip-driven main rotor was torqueless and it eliminated the shafts, gears, and clutches associated with piston-engined designs".|$|E

2500|$|In the 1949 season, the 125cc, or <b>ultra</b> <b>light</b> weight class, gained new prestige. More {{motorcycle}} manufacturers were {{competing in}} the inaugural world championships that were held in Switzerland, Netherlands and Italy. The Mondial 125cc DOHC design dominated the 1949 season. The MV riders placed ninth and tenth in the final standings. In 1950, Arturo Magni and Piero Remor joined the company after working with Gilera. Magni was the chief mechanic and Remor was chief designer. [...] The 1950 season and 1951 season were development years, as the company adopted the 125 Dohc four-stroke engine. Racing efforts only produced a fifth-place finish at the Dutch TT in 1950. The 1951 results were only slightly better.|$|E

50|$|The {{packaging}} {{has evolved}} {{to keep up}} with the times. Packaging went from a soft pack with the trademark flowers and drawing of Eve in the garden (gen. 1) to losing the female figure and retaining only the flowers (gen. 2) then moving the flowers to a band lengthwise on a white cardboard box (gen. 3). This packaging went unchanged until 1992 when the small multicolored flowers were replaced by thin orchid-like flowers in jewel tones on the box, and a single small colored flower on the filter band of the cigarette (gen. 4). In Germany the packaging and cigarette design did not change, retaining the floral band. Menthol versions of Eve used similar designs but with more green tones. Shorter 100mm Eves in Regular and Menthol boxes were reintroduced in 1985 but gradually disappeared due to lack of interest. In 1990 Eve <b>Ultra</b> <b>Lights</b> 120s were introduced in Regular and Menthol, promising lowered tar and nicotine, and milder flavor. Packaging was white flip top box with long stemmed flowers done in pale pastels, with a single pale pastel flower on the filter band. Menthols were similar but with more green. After 1992 packaging remained unchanged until 2002, except for yet another unsuccessful reintroduction of 100mm length Eve <b>Lights</b> and Eve <b>Ultra</b> <b>Lights</b> in 1991. In 2002 the flowers were replaced by butterflies (gen. 5). <b>Ultra</b> <b>Lights</b> lost the long stemmed flowers they had since their introduction and unified with the regulars for the first time by assuming the butterfly motif, with different colors identifying <b>Ultra</b> <b>Lights</b> (blue) and Menthol <b>Ultra</b> <b>Lights</b> (teal), to complement the colors identifying Lights (purple) and Menthol |Lights (green). In 2002 soft pack 100s were reintroduced yet again, using the butterfly design of the 120s. And as before, 100s gradually disappeared.|$|R
50|$|Viceroy {{originated}} in the U.S. in 1936, produced by B&W as the world's first cork-tipped filter cigarette. It was a mid-priced brand at the time, equivalent to B&W's Raleigh cigarettes flagship brand, but more expensive than Wings cigarettes introduced by B&W in 1929. In 1952 Viceroy was the first brand to add a cellulose acetate filter which established a new industry standard. In 1953, Viceroy Filter Kings were introduced. In 1990, Viceroy Box Kings and Lights Box Kings were introduced on the U.S. market, followed by Viceroy <b>Ultra</b> <b>Lights</b> Kings and <b>Ultra</b> <b>Lights</b> 100's in 1992.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, at school, he {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} child prodigy. He had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. Sachin consistently featured in the school team in the Matunga Gujarati Seva Mandal (MGSM) Shield. Besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing John Bright Cricket Club in Bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the Kanga League, and later went on to play for the Cricket Club of India. In 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the MRF Pace Foundation in Madras (now Chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, who took a world record 355 Test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that Tendulkar focus on his batting instead. On 20 January 1987, he also turned out as substitute for Imran Khan's side in an exhibition game at Brabourne Stadium in Bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of Cricket Club of India. A couple of months later, former Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar gave him a pair of his own <b>ultra</b> <b>light</b> pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the Bombay Cricket Association's [...] "Best junior cricket award" [...] (He was 14 years that time). [...] "It was the greatest source of encouragement for me," [...] Tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing Gavaskar's world record of 34 Test centuries. Sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 Cricket World Cup when India played against England in the semifinal in Bombay. In his season in 1988, Tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. He was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a Lord Harris Shield inter-school game against St. Xavier's High School in 1988 with his friend and teammate Vinod Kambli, who would also go on to represent India. The destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. Tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament. This was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at Hyderabad in India.|$|E
