50|$|The Merlin (Falco columbarius) {{is a small}} {{species of}} falcon from the Northern Hemisphere, with {{numerous}} subspecies throughout North America and Eurasia. A bird of prey once known colloquially as a <b>pigeon</b> <b>hawk</b> in North America, the Merlin breeds in the northern Holarctic; some migrate to subtropical and northern tropical regions in winter. Males typically have wingspans of 53 - 58 cm, with females being slightly larger. They are swift fliers and skilled hunters who specialize in preying on small birds in the size range of sparrows to quail. The Merlin has for centuries been well regarded as a falconry bird. In recent decades merlin populations in North America have been significantly increasing, with some merlins becoming so well adapted to city life that they forgo migration.|$|R

50|$|Looking for backers, he bounces his Flubber {{ball for}} an audience, but his {{investment}} pitch proves so long-winded {{that most of}} the crowd has left before they notice that the ball bounced higher on its second bounce than on its first. For a more successful demonstration, he makes his Model T fly by bombarding Flubber with radioactive particles. Other adventures and misadventures result as Flubber is used on the bottoms of basketball players' shoes (in a crucial game) giving them tremendous jumping ability; Brainard (at a school dance) making him an accomplished dancer, and the scheming businessman Alonzo Hawk, who switches cars on the professor, with a car containing a squirrel and <b>pigeons.</b> <b>Hawk</b> then must be tackled by a full football team to bring him down after Brainard tricks him into testing Flubber on the bottom of his shoes. The Professor retrieves the old Model T from the warehouse, and Hawk is arrested for having a gun in his possession, when the car crashes into a police car. Eventually, Brainard shows his discovery to the government, after being scared by a missile in flight, and also wins back Miss Carlisle, culminating in a wedding at last.|$|R

5000|$|Sage Narada {{visits the}} Pandava brothers. He {{suggests}} tirthas to Pandava brothers - {{a visit to}} holy places in India. The parva provides the benefits, directions {{and a list of}} tirthas - Kurukshetra, Ganga, Yamuna, Prayaga, Pratisthana, Brahmasara, and others. Pandavas start the Narada-recommended tirthas. The history of various gods is described. The parva includes the story of Ushinara, the <b>pigeon</b> and the <b>hawk.</b> The hawk wants to eat the pigeon, pigeon comes to Ushinara and requests protection from hawk. The hawk questions Ushinara as to why he is going against Dharma - the principles of life. Ushinara explains that it is his Dharma to protect the weak from the strong. The hawk claims that by denying him pigeon-food, Ushinara is denying food to his children and his wife in his nest, as well he who is oppressed by hunger; by protecting the pigeon, Ushinara is saving the pigeon but killing baby-hawks. The parva then presents the theory of contesting virtues, that is when one good is in conflict with another good, how must one choose between two goods, between two conflicting virtues? Ushinara answers with the theory of preponderance, then offers to hunt and feed the hawk, an offer that is questioned and rejected on celestial Dharma grounds by the hawk. Finally, to save the pigeon's life, Ushinara offers his own flesh to feed the hawk. The hawk accepts the offer; Ushinara cuts his own flesh of volume equal to pigeon, and weighs it. It falls short, so he cuts and adds more of his own flesh. But the pigeon's weight keeps on increasing. Ushinara finally has to weigh his whole body to equal that of the pigeon - when he does so, the hawk reappears as deity Indra and the pigeon reappears as deity Agni. They restore Ushinara, praise his virtue and compassion. Other stories include king Janaka's sacrifice, king Somaka and his liberation from hell, how Bhagiratha brought Ganges river to earth from heaven, the births of Ashtavakra, Mandhata and Rishyasringa, the journey of Bhima for celestial lotuses.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether the {{category}} representation of natural kinds differed in age or development and sociocultural background. Fifth graders and colledge students in China and Japan were required to rate the category typicality of 75 instances by the use of 7 -point scales. Fifteen instances belonged to each category of animal, fruit, vehicle, vegitable, and bird. (a) Comparisons of mean rating scores: Separate nation by age analyses of variances were performed for each instance. The main effect of nation was significant in 68 instances, which showed that Japanese rated the instances as more typical than Chinese except Panda, Monkey, Bear, and Watermelon. The main effect of age was significant in 39 instances, which showed that adults rated the instances as more typical than children except Monkey, Rabbit, Apricot, Swing, and Kidney bean. The interaction was significant in 31 instances. The age differences were found in 24 instances for Chinese and in 9 instances for Japanese, which suggested that developmental changes in the category representation were more evident for Chinese than for Japanese. (b) Comparisons of more typical instances within each category : More typical instances of animal were Lion, Tiger, Elephant, Monkey, and Panda for Chinese children, and Lion, Tiger, Wolf, Bear, and Wild boar for Chinese adults. Those instanes were Lion, Tiger, Elephant, Horse, and Dog for Japanese children and adults. The findings suggested that the category representation of animal differed in China and Japan, and that the age differences in category representation were found only in China. More typical instances of fruit were Apple, Orange, Grapes, Pear, and Peach for all groups. Those instances of vehicle were Car, Train, Airplane, and Bus for all groups. Those instances of bird were Sparrow, Swallow, <b>Hawk,</b> <b>Pigeon,</b> and Gull for allgroups. These findings suggested that the category representation of fruit, vehicle, and bird was similar regardless of the nation and age. More typical instances of vegetable were Chinese cabbage, Cucumber, Celery, Leek, and Eggplant for Chinese children and adults, and Chinese cabbage, Cucumber, Cabbage, Japanese radish, and Carrot for Japanese children and adults. The findings suggested that the category representation of vegetable differed in China and Japan...|$|R
