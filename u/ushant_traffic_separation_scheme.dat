40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} address the issue of ambient noise {{monitoring}} under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, a global anthropogenic noise prediction system called Quonops© has been designed similarly to meteorological forecasting systems. Quonops© combines real-time environmental data and real-time human information and assimilates real-time acoustic measurements to produce the resulting 3 D ocean noise fields as a function of time. The system has been thought to cover most basins and activities. The French Hydrographic Office and ENSTA Bretagne have conducted a monitoring experiment in the West-end of the British Channel in the vicinity of the <b>Ushant</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>separation</b> <b>scheme.</b> Two hydrophones were deployed at about mid-depth, one at the border of the south-going route, another 10 NM off the same route. It has been observed that even with high noise levels, the measure is likely to be affected by local events, inducing up to 30 dB dynamics at the scale of hours. Quonops© has been implemented to now-cast the low frequency noise in the same area. The comparison at the hydrophone locations of the prediction and measurement has shown good agreement, predicting in particular the statistical and stochastic content of the ambient noise in such a high pressure area...|$|E

40|$|In 2007 six blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) {{were found}} dead in the Southern California Bight with four of the deaths {{resulting}} from vessel strikes. To reduce the spatial overlap of vessels and whales, the United States Coast Guard proposed shifting the southern Santa Barbara Channel shipping lane north by one nmi. We used sighting rate predictions from generalized additive models to assess potential vessel-whale encounters in the current and proposed <b>traffic</b> <b>separation</b> <b>schemes.</b> Sightings were collected during coastal-based photo-identiﬁcation surveys between June - November from 2001 to 2009. In total, 11, 037 km of track-line was searched, yielding 602 sightings of 393 uniquely identiﬁed blue whales. Whales were strongly associated with spatial covariates and bathymetric features, with the highest sighting rates predicted {{in close proximity to}} the shelf edge on steep south facing slopes and shallow northeast facing slopes.
