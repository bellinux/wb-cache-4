40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} views of {{employees}} from unionized companies and trade union leaders on the barriers to trade union activities in Malaysia through reference to survey data. These barriers are political, social and economic. The system of Malaysian industrial relations is not necessarily anti-union – in theory – but the article points {{to a range of}} structural barriers and challenges facing unions. However, the evidence presented also shows that there are major gaps and barriers within trade unions in terms of strategic renewal and organizational change. There are also major issues of <b>union</b> <b>visibility</b> within the workplace and the community. These are partly explained by the lack of systematic support offered by the legal system and employer; yet, there is a real perception gap as far as workers are concerned. Notably, the trade unions have little influence in decision-making processes across a range of human resource management practices and workplace issues. In addition, there are indications that trade unions have not really thought about or developed direct and more imaginative forms of communication in relation to the changing nature of the workforce and the economic context. As a result, internal barriers to change have been shaped by external ones, and this must be considered in any debate on Malaysian industrial relations...|$|E

They {{are responsible for}} advising EPA on air pollution transport issues and for developing and implementing regional solutions to the ground-level ozone problem in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. OTC has no regulatory authority, but assists its members in developing model regulations for implementation at the state level. OTC also manages a regional planning organization MANE-VU (Mid-Atlantic Northeast <b>Visibility</b> <b>Union),</b> which is charged with regional multi-pollutant air quality planning.|$|R
40|$|Transport {{safety is}} a major goal in the European <b>Union.</b> Low <b>visibility</b> conditions, {{especially}} due to fog, {{increase the risk of}} major accidents (chain collision). Innovative products have been developed by the automotive industry, including equipment manufacturers, to increase the level of safety of car passengers and drivers. Testing of these products requires the simulation or artificial reproduction of low visibility (fog) conditions with good stability and reproducibility characteristics. We report on the results of the European Union funded FOG project to improve road transport safety through fog production in an experimental test chamber located at the Clermont-Ferrand laboratory for research on road safety and visibility. The project developed a prototype of a small-scale climatic chamber, an improved fog production spraying device, a laser-based visibility measurement device, a reduced scale transmissometer, and a combined indoor climate-fog production simulation software. The ability of the fog chamber to test for driver reaction was also investigated. Recent developments include a device able to produce stable visibility levels and homogeneous fog, representative of various types of natural water droplet distribution. The fog characteristics were determined and compared to natural fog. Results are presented for a selection of conditions including stabilized visibility levels for dense fog and two kinds of droplet distributions...|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the problem of guarding simple orthogonal polygons with the minimum number of r -guards. The interior point p belongs an orthogonal polygon P is visible from r -guard g, if the minimum area rectangle contained p and q lies within P. A set of point guards in polygon P is named guard set (as denoted G) if the <b>union</b> of <b>visibility</b> areas of these point guards be equal to polygon P i. e. every point in P be visible from at least one point guards in G. For an orthogonal polygon, if dual graph of vertical decomposition is a path, it is named path polygon. In this paper, we show that the problem of finding the minimum number of r -guards (minimum guard set) becomes linear-time solvable in orthogonal path polygons. The path polygon may have dent edges in every four orientations. For this class of orthogonal polygon, the problem has been considered by Worman and Keil who described an algorithm running in O(n^ 17 poly n) -time where n is the size of the input polygon. The problem of finding minimum number of guards for simple polygon with general visibility is NP-hard, even if polygon be orthogonal. Our algorithm is purely geometric and presents a new strategy for r -guarding orthogonal polygons and guards can be placed everywhere in the interior and boundary of polygon.

40|$|Institutions {{of higher}} {{education}} collectively constitute a major economic concentration that ranks—by whatever measure: resources, budgets, endowments, employees, constituencies— among the major industries in the United States. The unionized academic U. S. workforce ranks sixth among organized labor (Hurd, 2007) with 432, 897 faculty and graduate student employees (Savarese, Berry & Boris, 2012). Yet, {{when compared to the}} top-tier manufacturing industries of steel or automobile or to national unions such as the UAW or the Teamsters, both the public institutions {{of higher education}} and their academic <b>unions</b> lack national <b>visibility,</b> lack influence on national debates, and, most tellingly, lack major successes in the quest for public monies. Health care, the environment, energy policies, and the current global economic crisis drive both state and national discourse. At a time when many other countries invest in higher education because they recognize how critical intellectual capital is in the competitive and troubled global economy, American public higher education is the caboose of the train of public commitment (except to make declining public monies contingent on producing more graduates in less time with fewer resources) (Seligman, 2008) ...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Union {{organizing}} among non-teaching {{white collar}} employees {{of colleges and}} universities persists. To the discomfort of many university administrators, high <b>visibility</b> <b>union</b> successes at Yale, Columbia, Harvard, the University of Cincinnati, and the University of Illinois were not isolated instances but part of a trend. Professional, technical, and clerical employees 2 ̆ 7 desire for a more effective voice, has combined with the economic insecurity associated with stubborn budgetary pressures, to encourage these workers to pursue union representation. Unions have responded to this opportunity with enthusiasm, experimenting with innovative organizing and bargaining strategies in the relatively open environment offered by institutions of higher education. This chapter presents a sympathetic summary of this phenomenon. It touches on employee motivation to unionize, models of university white collar organizing, responses to unionization by university administrators, and the range of possible bargaining relationships. The concluding section suggests a management position towards organizing and bargaining consistent with the highest standards of the academy. To set the stage, the essay begins with a descriptive review of the extent of unionization...|$|R
40|$|The Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) Air Quality Monitoring and Planning Program {{deployed}} a new air monitoring site in 2004 {{to track}} the impact of interstate pollutant transport on air quality in Maryland. Currently Maryland {{does not meet the}} EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for annual PM 2. 5, 8 -hour ozone, and 1 -hour ozone. Consequently, the monitoring focus will be on PM 2. 5, ozone, and their respective precursors and constituent species. Column monitoring of meteorology and air quality will also take place via remote sensing by a wind profiling radar system and via in-situ measurements by aircraft and balloons. The new site, called “Piney Run”, will provide a continuous time series of highly time resolved data. The location is unique for measuring regional background pollutant loads because it is a high elevation, western boundary location in rural Maryland. Piney Run will also focus on haze-related measurements as part of the Rural Aerosol Intensive Network (RAIN) deployed in Spring 2004 by state agencies in the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast <b>Visibility</b> <b>Union</b> (MANE-VU) regional planning organization. In addition, the site is part of several national monitoring networks including the Interagency Monitorin...|$|R
40|$|Emissions Inventory Improvement Program (EIIP) {{suggests}} using {{a survey}} as the preferred method for gathering residential {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) burning and yard waste burning activity information. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of using a survey to gather open burning activity information for use in developing emission inventories for MSW burning and yard waste burning, including both brush waste and leaf waste. E. H. Pechan and Associates, Inc. (Pechan) conducted MSW and yard waste burning surveys for the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast <b>Visibility</b> <b>Union</b> (MANE-VU). Two separate surveys were performed. One survey was designed to gather information on local control programs that were in place for open burning (e. g. burn bans). As part of the control survey, a rule effectiveness (RE) survey was conducted to estimate controlled emissions. The second survey was designed to gather activity information in areas where burning is allowed. The survey did not find statistically-significant differences in MSW activity among urban, suburban, and rural areas. In areas allowing both brush and leaf waste burning, survey respondents could not provide separate estimates {{for the number of}} households burning each of these types of yard waste. Municipal yard waste burning results showed a higher percentage of households that burn yard waste in areas that have a municipal collection program, than in other areas, so there may be factors involved that lead to a higher incidence of both residential and municipal burning for an area. As a result of this project, there will be significant changes from the National Emission Inventory (NEI) estimates...|$|R
