In practical terms it <b>usually</b> <b>means</b> lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily. The result of lack of sanitation is usually open defecation (and open urination but this is of less concern) with associated serious public health issues.

25|$|They {{will not}} be paid ESA if they are {{entitled}} to Statutory Sick Pay (this <b>usually</b> <b>means</b> 'if they have a job', but there are exceptions) and {{it is not possible to}} receive ESA at the same time as the other main out-of-work benefits i.e. Jobseekers Allowance - received by 536,000 people - or Income Support, given to 666,000 people, nowadays mainly lone parents. Universal Credit, which is received by more than 400,000 people nationally, can contain a component analogous to ESA.|$|E
25|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss an {{action on the}} ground of FNC. Invoking this doctrine <b>usually</b> <b>means</b> that the plaintiff properly invoked the jurisdiction of the court, but it is inconvenient for the court and the defendant to have a trial in the original jurisdiction. The court must balance convenience against the plaintiff’s choice of forum.

If a transfer would simply shift the inconvenience from one party to the other, the plaintiff’s choice of forum should not be disturbed.|$|E

5000|$|Manufacturers' {{new orders}} for {{consumer}} goods/materials — This component {{is considered a}} leading indicator because increases in new orders for consumer goods and materials <b>usually</b> <b>mean</b> positive changes in actual production. The new orders decrease inventory and contribute to unfilled orders, a precursor to future revenue.|$|R
25|$|Cold cathode lamps are {{generally}} less efficient than thermionic emission lamps because the cathode fall voltage is much higher. The increased fall voltage results in more power dissipation at tube ends, {{which does not}} contribute to light output. However, this is less significant with longer tubes. The increased power dissipation at tube ends also <b>usually</b> <b>means</b> cold cathode tubes have to be run at a lower loading than their thermionic emission equivalents. Given the higher tube voltage required anyway, these tubes can easily be made long, and even run as series strings. They are better suited for bending into special shapes for lettering and signage, and can also be instantly switched on or off.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{professional}} guidelines classified {{the severity of}} CKD in five stages, with stage 1 being the mildest and usually causing few symptoms and stage 5 being a severe illness with poor life expectancy if untreated. Stage 5 CKD is often called end-stage kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, or end-stage kidney failure, and is largely synonymous with the now outdated terms chronic renal failure or chronic kidney failure; and <b>usually</b> <b>means</b> the patient requires renal replacement therapy, which may involve a form of dialysis, but ideally constitutes a kidney transplant. Recent international guidelines reclassified CKD based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category (G1, G2, G3a, G3b, G4 and G5), and albuminuria category (A1, A2, A3).|$|E
25|$|Cohort studies select {{subjects}} {{based on}} their exposure status. The study subjects should be at risk of the outcome under investigation {{at the beginning of}} the cohort study; this <b>usually</b> <b>means</b> that they should be disease free when the cohort study starts. The cohort is followed through time to assess their later outcome status. An example of a cohort study would be the investigation of a cohort of smokers and non-smokers over time to estimate the incidence of lung cancer. The same 2×2 table is constructed as with the case control study. However, the point estimate generated is the relative risk (RR), which is the probability of disease for a person in the exposed group, Pe=A/(A+B) over the probability of disease for a person in the unexposed group, P'u=C/(C+D), i.e. RR=Pe/Pu.|$|E
5000|$|Manufacturers' {{new orders}} for non-defense capital goods — As stated above, new orders lead the {{business}} cycle because increases in orders <b>usually</b> <b>mean</b> positive changes in actual production and perhaps rising demand. This measure is the producer's counterpart of new orders for consumer goods/materials component (#3).|$|R
25|$|In Portuguese, one {{may or may}} {{not include}} the {{definite}} article before a possessive pronoun (meu livro or o meu livro, for instance). The variants of use in each dialect of Portuguese are mostly a matter of preference: it does not <b>usually</b> <b>mean</b> a dialect completely abandoned either form.|$|R
50|$|For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate (MDP) can be {{preferentially}} {{taken up}} by bone. By chemically attaching technetium-99m to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as a fracture in the bone, will <b>usually</b> <b>mean</b> increased concentration of the tracer.|$|R
