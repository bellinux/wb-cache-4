25|$|A dock {{can allow}} some laptop {{computers}} {{to become a}} substitute for a desktop computer, without sacrificing the mobile computing functionality of the machine. Portable computers can dock and <b>undock</b> hot, cold or standby, depending on {{the capabilities of the}} system. In a cold dock or <b>undock,</b> one completely shuts the computer down before docking/undocking. In a hot dock or <b>undock,</b> the computer remains running when docked/undocked. Standby docking or undocking, an intermediate style used in some designs, allows the computer to be docked/undocked while powered on, but requires that it be placed into a sleep mode prior to docking/undocking.|$|E
25|$|UHF {{radio is}} used by astronauts and cosmonauts {{conducting}} EVAs. UHF {{is used by}} other spacecraft that dock to or <b>undock</b> from the station, such as Soyuz, Progress, HTV, ATV and the Space Shuttle (except the shuttle also makes use of the S band and Ku band systems via TDRSS), to receive commands from Mission Control and ISS crewmembers. Automated spacecraft are fitted with their own communications equipment; the ATV uses a laser attached to the spacecraft and equipment attached to Zvezda, known as the Proximity Communications Equipment, to accurately dock to the station.|$|E
50|$|The shuttle hatch {{was closed}} {{the night before}} it <b>undocked</b> from the ISS. After <b>undocking,</b> the shuttle flew around the station to take photos.|$|R

2500|$|Critics {{point out}} that kennel clubs with breed {{standards}} that do not make allowance for uncropped or <b>undocked</b> dogs put pressure on owners and breeders to continue the practice. Although the American Kennel Club (AKC) says {{that it has no}} rules that require docking or that make <b>undocked</b> animals ineligible for the show ring, standards for many breeds put <b>undocked</b> animals at a disadvantage for the conformation show ring. The American breed standard for boxers, for example, recommends that an <b>undocked</b> tail be [...] "severely penalized." ...|$|R
25|$|After {{a two-day}} orbital chase, the Orion spacecraft, having jettisoned {{much of the}} initial stack during takeoff, would meet with the International Space Station. After getting the go ahead from Houston, Orion would then dock with the ISS. The six-man crew (at a maximum) would then enter the station in order to perform {{numerous}} tasks and activities {{for the duration of}} their flight, usually lasting six months, but possibly shortened to four or lengthened to eight, depending upon NASA's goals for that particular mission. Once completed, the crew would then reenter the Orion, seal itself off from the ISS, and then <b>undock</b> from the station.|$|E
25|$|Once in lunar orbit, {{the crew}} would refine the {{trajectory}} and configure the Orion CSM for unmanned flight, allowing all four crew members {{to transfer to}} the Altair vehicle and land on the Moon, while the Orion waits for their return. Upon receiving clearance from Mission Control, the Altair would <b>undock</b> from the Orion and perform an inspection maneuver, allowing ground controllers to inspect the spacecraft via live TV mounted on Orion for any visible problems that would prevent landing (on Apollo this {{was done by the}} Command Module Pilot). After receiving approval from ground controllers, the two craft would separate to a safe distance and the Altair's descent engines would fire again for powered descent to a pre-determined landing spot previously selected by unmanned spacecraft.|$|E
500|$|During his Increment, Linenger {{became the}} first American to conduct a spacewalk from a foreign space station {{and the first to}} test the Russian-built Orlan-M {{spacesuit}} alongside Russian cosmonaut Vasili Tsibliyev. All three crewmembers of expedition EO-23 performed a [...] "fly-around" [...] in the Soyuz spacecraft, first undocking from one docking port of the station, then manually flying to and redocking the capsule at a different location. This made Linenger the first American to <b>undock</b> from a space station aboard two different spacecraft (Space Shuttle and Soyuz).|$|E
50|$|Progress M-04M <b>undocked</b> {{from the}} ISS on 10 May 2010. On 7 May 2010 Russian Space Agency's Mission Control {{announced}} that the ISS crew had loaded Progress M-04M with garbage and readied the spacecraft for <b>undocking.</b> The command for <b>undocking</b> was issued at 11:13 UTC, and three minutes later Progress M-04M separated from the Zvezda module. Cosmonauts Skvortsov and Kornienko monitored the <b>undocking</b> with photo and video cameras focusing on the Progress docking mechanism to confirm {{that there were no}} missing or damaged O-ring seals on the docking interface.|$|R
50|$|Progress M-19M <b>undocked</b> from Zvezda module of the ISS on June 11, 2013. The <b>undocking</b> {{paved the}} way for European Space Agency's ATV-4 Albert Einstein to {{subsequently}} dock with the ISS.|$|R
50|$|On 22 July 2012, Progress M-15M <b>undocked</b> {{from the}} Pirs Docking Compartment {{and tried to}} perform a re-rendezvous two days later to test the new Kurs-NA {{navigation}} antenna. The <b>undocking</b> from the space station's Pirs compartment occurred around 20:27 GMT. The <b>undocking</b> occurred 255 miles over eastern Mongolia. The redocking was scheduled for 01:57 GMT on 24 July. However it was aborted after equipment aboard the Progress spacecraft failed a self-test.|$|R

50|$|Expedition 42 was the 42nd {{expedition}} to the International Space Station. It began on 10 November 2014 with the <b>undocking</b> of Soyuz TMA-13M, returning the crew of Expedition 41 to Earth and ended with the <b>undocking</b> of Soyuz TMA-14M in March 2015.|$|R
25|$|After a crew {{farewell}} Endeavour <b>undocked</b> {{from the}} ISS at 17:26 UTC. Unlike most other launches, hatch closure, which happened at 15:08 UTC, and <b>undocking</b> {{happened on the}} same day due to the extended delay in launching and the arrival of the Progress 34 cargo craft. After <b>undocking</b> Hurley began a fly around of the station giving the shuttle crew an opportunity to photograph the station's current configuration in all directions. Then a final separation burn was completed at 3:09pm EDT.|$|R
5000|$|The {{spacecraft}} <b>undocked</b> on 4 July, {{following a}} farewell ceremony, with the Mir hatch closing at 3:32 pm EDT. 3 July and hatch on Orbiter Docking System shut 16 minutes later. Gibson compared separation sequence to a [...] "cosmic" [...] ballet: Prior to the Mir-Atlantis <b>undocking,</b> the Mir 19 crew temporarily abandoned station, flying {{away from it}} in their Soyuz spacecraft so they could record images of Atlantis and Mir separating. Soyuz unlatched at 6:55 am EDT, and Gibson <b>undocked</b> Atlantis from Mir at 7:10 am EDT.|$|R
50|$|The ATV was {{initially}} planned to <b>undock</b> from the ISS on 25 September 2012. However, a command program error during the undocking procedure delayed the release, and Edoardo Amaldi {{did not actually}} <b>undock</b> until 21:44 GMT on 28 September. The spacecraft finally deorbited and performed a destructive re-entry over the Pacific Ocean on 4 October 2012, taking with it a payload of station waste.|$|E
50|$|Armstrong {{reported}} that the OAMS fuel had dropped to 30%, indicating that the problem could be on their own spacecraft. With concern that the high yaw rate might damage one or both spacecraft or even cause the propellant-heavy Agena to rupture or explode, the crew decided to <b>undock</b> from the Agena so they could analyze the situation. Scott switched the Agena control back to ground command, while Armstrong struggled to stabilize the combined vehicle enough to permit undocking. Scott then hit the <b>undock</b> button, and Armstrong fired a long burst of translation thrusters {{to back away from}} the Agena.|$|E
50|$|The cosmonauts boarded Soyuz 21 but as Volynov {{tried to}} <b>undock</b> from the station, the docking latches failed to release properly. As he fired the jets {{to move the}} {{spacecraft}} away, the docking mechanism jammed, resulting in the Soyuz being undocked but still linked to Salyut. As the two spacecraft moved {{out of range of}} ground communications, the cosmonauts received only the first set of emergency procedures. Volynov tried a second time to <b>undock</b> but only managed slightly to loosen the latches. The situation persisted for an entire orbit, 90 minutes, when the final set of emergency procedures were received and the crew finally disengaged the latches.|$|E

50|$|The Soyuz {{spacecraft}} {{was launched}} on 10 December 1977, and docked {{with the space}} station the next day. Soyuz 27 arrived at the station in January 1978, and its two-person crew transferred into the Soyuz 26 spacecraft to <b>undock</b> and land a few days later.|$|E
5000|$|Salyut 5, {{launched}} on June 22, 1976, {{was equipped with}} an improved radio system. On July 6, 1976, Soyuz 21 had problems undocking automatically, but was able to <b>undock</b> manually. Soyuz 23 failed to dock, ran out of fuel to manual dock, and returned to Earth.|$|E
50|$|During the L3 complex's {{journey to}} the Moon, {{there would be no}} need to <b>undock</b> and re-dock the orbital and landing craft as was done in Apollo, because the {{cosmonaut}} would transfer from the LOK to LK by a 'spacewalk'. On the Apollo missions, the transfer was done using an internal passage.|$|E
25|$|Shuttle {{crew members}} were awakened at 06:29 UTC. <b>Undocking</b> {{operations}} began {{about an hour}} before the separation of the shuttle and the Space Station. The two spacecraft <b>undocked</b> at 09:53 UTC. The total docked time was 6 days, 17 hours and 2 minutes. After <b>undocking,</b> Wilmore piloted Atlantis to a point about 450 feet ahead of the station, then, began a flyaround. Once the flyaround was completed, Atlantis performed separation burns to increase the distance between the shuttle and the ISS and left the Space Station complex area at about 10:36 UTC.|$|R
50|$|Progress M-05M {{remained}} docked {{with the}} space station until 25 October 2010. The spacecraft <b>undocked</b> from the Pirs docking compartment at 14:25 UTC on 25 October. Expedition 25 Flight Engineer Fyodor Yurchikhin closed and performed leak checks on the hatch between the space station and Progress M-05M on 22 October, completing preparations for the spacecraft’s <b>undocking.</b> The <b>undocking</b> of Progress M-05M {{cleared the way for}} the launch of the Progress M-08M spacecraft on 27 October from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.
