25|$|Shoelaces are {{typically}} tied {{off at the}} top of the shoe using a simple bow knot. Besides securing the shoe, this also takes up the length of shoelace exposed after tightening. The common bow consists of two half-knots tied one on top of the other, with the second half-knot looped in order to allow quick <b>untying.</b> When required, the knot can be readily loosened by pulling one or both of the loose ends.|$|E

Incredibly intelligent, Tarzan performed these stunts in response to word commands from Maynard.|$|E

40|$|Evaluate the biomechanical {{behavior}} of four variants of the transosseous-equivalent/suture bridge (TOE/SB) repair. Four suture bridge (SB) constructs were created using 24 sheep infraspinatus tendon-humerus constructs (n = 6 per technique). The groups were (1) Knotted Standard Suture Bridge (Standard SB) -suture bridge with two medial mattress stitches, (2) Knotted Double Suture Bridge (Double SB) -four medial mattress stitches, (3) <b>Untied</b> Suture Bridge with Medial FT Anchors (<b>Untied</b> SB with FT) -two medial mattress stitches without knots, and (4) <b>Untied</b> Suture Bridge with PushLocks (<b>Untied</b> SB with Pushlocks) -two medial mattress stitches without knots. The contact area footprint {{was measured with}} an electronic pressure film prior to dynamic mechanical testing for gapping and testing to failure. The Double SB produced the greatest contact area footprint {{compared to the other}} techniques, which did not differ. The Double SB repair with a mean failure load of 456. 9 N was significantly stronger than the <b>Untied</b> SB with Pushlocks repair at 300 N (P = 0. 023), the standard SB repair at 295 N (P = 0. 019), and lastly the <b>Untied</b> SB with FT repair at 284 N (P = 0. 011). No differences were detected between the two mattress stitch standard SB repair with knots and the knotless two mattress stitch repairs (<b>Untied</b> SB with FT and <b>Untied</b> SB with Pushlocks). Gaps developed during cyclic loading in all repairs apart from the Double SB repair. The transosseous-equivalent/suture bridge repair with 4 stitches tied in the medial row and maximal lateral suture strand utilization (Double SB) outperformed all other repairs in terms of failure load, tendon-bone contact, and gapping characteristics. The presence of knots in the medial row did not change tendon fixation with respect to failure load, contact area or gapping characteristics. 6 page(s...|$|R

2500|$|Cinxia {{functions}} {{within the}} belt (cingulum) that the bride wears to symbolize {{that her husband}} is [...] "belted and bound" [...] (cinctus vinctusque) to her. It was tied with the knot of Hercules, intended to be intricate and difficult to untie. Augustine calls this goddess Virginiensis (virgo, [...] "virgin"), indicating that the <b>untying</b> is the symbolic loss of virginity. Cinxia may have been felt as present during a ritual meant to ease labor. The man who fathered the child removes his own belt (cinctus), binds it (cinxerit) around the laboring woman, then releases it with a prayer that {{the one who has}} bound her in labor should likewise release her: [...] "he should then leave."

Such stunts included <b>untying</b> Mix’s hands, opening gates,jumping over high fences, getting tangled in ropes, loosening his reins, rescuing Mix from fire, jumping from one cliff to another, and running after trains. In the 1926 film The Great K & A Train Robbery (Fox Film Corporation), Mix jumps Tony through a glass window into a building and rides him alongside a speeding train.

Third, does causality proceed in both directions simultaneously?
