The objective is to contribute to the international efforts of improving market value estimates and the guidelines on how international direct investment activity should be measured. Moreover, this study explores the impacts that market approximation has on Finnish FDI figures and international investment position during 2005 - 2011. This study is carried out by first analyzing how different valuation methods perform in an international context. Valuation models are tested with data taken from all listed companies of 27 European Union member states during 2005 - 2011. Finally, the models that are applicable in FDI valuation context and lead to lowest valuation errors are applied to the valuation of unlisted FDI in Finland. The results suggest that when developing models for valuing <b>unlisted</b> direct investment <b>equity,</b> focus should be laid on price-to-book value methods. The results indicate as well that the current valuation practice, which is based on the book values of equity, generates lower direct investment positions when compared to market value approximations.

40|$|While {{excessive}} {{regulation is}} {{an obstacle to}} the development of financial markets, we argue that lack of basic rules or poorly enforced regulation may explain the relative importance across countries of banking and security markets in financing firms. A selective or arbitrary enforcement transforms legal rules into an exclusionary good; arm's length market exchanges become unreliable. As a result, transactions tend to become intermediated through institutions or concentrated among agents bound by some form of private enforcement. Provision of funding shifts from risk capital to debt, and from markets to institutions with long term relations. Securities, as standardized arm's length contractual relationships, are most vulnerable to poor enforcement. We show that when small investors rights are poorly protected, the ability of firms to raise equity capital is impaired, and as a result, profitable new ventures will be forsaken. This suggests a conflict of interest over regulatory standards between the controlling shareholders in listed firms and new entrepreneurs. More generally, fewer firms will be financed with outside equity, resulting in a low capitalization relative to GNP and a predominance of internal (<b>unlisted)</b> <b>equity</b> and bank lending over traded securities.

Approximately half of the investments we document occur after June 2005, reflecting a recent surge of SWF activity. We document large SWF investments in listed and <b>unlisted</b> <b>equity,</b> real estate, and private equity funds, with the bulk of investments being targeted in cross-border acquisitions of sizeable but non-controlling stakes in operating companies and commercial properties. The average (median) SWF investment is a $ 441 million ($ 55 million) acquisition of a 42. 3 % (26. 2 %) stake in an unlisted company; the most active SWFs originate from Singapore or the United Arab Emirates. Almost one-third (30. 9 %) of the number, and {{over half of the}} value (54. 6 %) of SWF investments are directed toward financial firms. The vast majority of SWF investments involve privately-negotiated purchases of ownership stakes in underperforming firms. We perform event study analysis using a sample of 235 SWF acquisitions of equity stakes in publicly traded companies around the world, and document a significantly positive mean abnormal return of about 0. 9 % around the announcement date. However, one-year matched-firm abnormal returns of SWFs average - 15. 49 %, suggesting equity acquisitions by SWFs are followed by deteriorating firm performance.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2012. Asset {{restrictions}} are prudential regulations applied by regulators around the globe. In essence, they prescribe asset restrictions as a risk-control measure to establish appropriate capital requirements for regulated institutions. The aim of prudential regulations and standards {{is to protect}} consumers who acquire the products and services offered by these institutions. Pension funds in Namibia must comply with Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, 1956. Regulation 28 is the prudential regulation that governs investment limits for pension funds. The regulation prescribes maximum investment limits for all asset classes. In 2009, the government made a policy decision to amend Regulation 28 to prescribe a minimum investment in <b>unlisted</b> shares (private <b>equity)</b> that would be applicable to pension funds, long-term insurance companies and unit trusts. The objective of government is to use Regulation 28 as a macroeconomic tool to control capital flows and channel capital to domestic companies. The regulation will stimulate economic activities, local ownership, create employment and reduce poverty, which will eventually facilitate economic development. In addition, this objective {{has the potential to}} assist the development of the private equity sector in Namibia. The implication of this development is that retirement savings will be utilised to achieve macroeconomic objectives and develop an industry sector. Private equity has shown tremendous growth in developed economies and is beginning to grow in Africa as well. Private equity is a sector that has the potential to realise excellent returns for pension funds, provided the risks are adequately controlled and managed. The study proposes a regulatory framework for <b>unlisted</b> investments (private <b>equity)</b> by pension funds. The framework considers risks and proposes how to best manage and control them. The conclusion is to abolish a prescribed minimum and to increase the domestic asset requirement. Ultimately, regulators exist to protect consumers while the development of markets is a secondary priority...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of modern Swedish wealth taxation from its introduction in** 1911 until it was abolished in 2007. The rules concerning valuation of assets, deductions/exemptions and tax schedules to characterize effective wealth tax schedules are described. These rules and schedules are used to calculate marginal and average wealth tax rates for three differently endowed owners of family firms and individual fortunes corresponding to a large, medium-sized and small firm. The overall trend in the direct wealth tax was rising until 1971 for owners of large and medium-sized firms and for individuals of equally-sized wealth consisting of non-corporate assets. Average direct wealth tax rates were low until 1934, except for 1913 when a progressive defense tax was levied. There were three major tax hikes: in 1934, when the wealth tax was more than doubled, in 1948 when tax rates were doubled again and in 1971 for owners of large firms and similarly sized non-corporate fortunes.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the cash holdings of publicly unlisted {{real estate investment}} trusts (REITs). Unlisted REITs have an organizational structure characterized by high equity issuance fees, weak governance mechanisms, finite life and distinctive periods during which there is access to public equity. All of these features have important implications for their corporate liquidity management. Using quarterly data from a sample of U. S. equity REITs spanning 1991 to 2013, the evidence provided in this dissertation reveals that unlisted REITs save a significant portion of equity offering proceeds to increase cash holdings and that these cash reserves are consistent with the precautionary motive for cash holdings. Specifically, it is estimated that for each additional dollar of new equity raised, 25 cents is accumulated as cash. The estimated amount of withholding for cash reserves is similar in magnitude even after empirically controlling for other sources of liquidity such as leverage, FFO and bank credit lines. Comparing unlisted REITs to each other, cash holdings are significantly higher during periods of equity access than when the offering period has expired. In fact, <b>unlisted</b> REITs with <b>equity</b> access hold cash balances that are 43 % higher (relative to total assets) than cash balances after the offering period has closed. This finding is explained {{by the nature of the}} offering period for unlisted REITs wherein opportunities for cash accumulation are greater due to ongoing equity access and since FFO is less predictable during early stage operations. Further analysis reveals that early-stage cash accumulations are subsequently used to support investment activity. Extending the comparison to include a sample of propensity score-matched listed REITs reveals that unlisted REITs, on average, hoard between 9 % to 22 % more cash (depending on post-offering vs. equity access) than their exchange-listed counterparts. Utilization of bank credit lines by unlisted REITs is 28 % lower than utilization by listed REITs. The difference in cash holdings and credit line utilization between listed and unlisted REITs is related to lower quality corporate governance mechanisms and the lack of operational transparency at unlisted REITs. Findings from this research should be useful to academics, policy-makers and investors who seek to understand the dynamics of liquidity management in firms that raise capital under finite-life organizational structure yet function as asset management intermediaries. Overall, the results imply that the increased operational risk in the unlisted REIT sector makes them more inclined to hold excess liquidity reserves, which consist primarily of cash. Cash provides unlisted REITs with self-managed insurance against liquidity shocks and offers greater financial flexibility when compared to banker-managed credit lines. In theory, unlisted REITs can also rely on internally-generated future cash flow to fund liquidity needs but its anticipated flow is rather unpredictable for an early-stage “blind pool” fund...|$|R
