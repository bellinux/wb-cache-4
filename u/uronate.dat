A large number of possible cation-diuronate complexes, with one and two GG or MM disaccharide units and with or without water molecules in the inner coordination shells have been considered. The computed bond distances, cation interaction energies, and molecular orbital composition analysis revealed that the complexation of the transition metal (TM) ions to the disaccharides occurs via the formation of strong coordination-covalent bonds. On the contrary, the alkaline earth cations form ionic bonds with the <b>uronates.</b> The unidentate binding {{is found to be}} the most favored one in the TM hydrated and water-free complexes.

For the production of glucaric acid in E. coil, toxicity of this organic acid as well as the uptake efficiency of glucose, the starting substrate, when in the presence of glucaric acid was assessed. Furthermore, a benchmark pathway for glucaric acid production that utilizes known reaction steps from different source organisms was designed. The design and expression of this pathway will be compared to the retro-biosynthetic pathway. The ease of design and expression will be analyzed in order to confirm the validity of retro-biosynthesis. Toxicity results showed that glucaric acid concentrations, up to 40 mM, do not affect growth of E. coli DH 1 OB cells. Furthermore, cells take up equal amounts of glucose even when glucaric acid is available, indicating that glucose is preferentially utilized by cells and that glucaric acid, once produced by cells, would not affect further production. (cont.) Finally, efforts have been made in order to express the benchmark pathway in E. coli. The entire pathway requires expression of three enzymes. The final reaction step requires <b>uronate</b> dehydrogenase in order to convert glucuronic acid to the desired product, glucaric acid. Although the function and approximate molecular weight of <b>uronate</b> dehydrogenase is known, its DNA sequence is not.

(1) All of the <b>uronate</b> residues in the tetrasaccharides (and in larger oligosaccharides) are unsulphated, and hence sulphated iduronate [IdUA(2 SO 3) ] must occur exclusively within -GlcNSO 3 -IdUA(2 SO 3) -GlcNSO 3 - sequences (where GlcNSO 3 represents N-sulpho-glucosamine) in the parent polymers.

The role of ATP in the reaction has been probed by positional isotope exchange (PIX). The results confirm the presence of phosphorylated intermediate species in the reactions catalyzed by cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide synthetase and cobyric acid synthetase from S. typhimurium. Cobyric acid synthetase catalyzes the amidation of carboxylate groups b, d, e, and g of adenosyl-cobyrinic acid a,c-diamide in the biosynthetic pathway for coenzyme B 12. Analysis of the reaction time courses demonstrate the appearance of three unique intermediate species which are released from the active site after each amidation reaction.

Hydrolyses of all substrates proceeded in a regiospecific manner at C- 6. No acyl migration was observed for all hydrolysed products. The hydrolysis has been optimised with special focus {{on the effect of}} co-solvent, temperature and reaction components. Preparative useful reactions were identified for hydrolyses of methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl-α-D-glucopyranoside (1 a), methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl- α-D-galactopyranoside (2 a), methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra- O-benzoyl-ß-D-galactopyranoside (5 a), methyl 2, 3, 6 -tri-O-benzoyl-α-Dgalactopyranoside (6 a) and methyl 2, 3, 6 -tri-O-benzoyl- 4 -deoxy- 4 -fluoro-α-Dglucopyranoside (7 a). For hydrolyses of the methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl-α-Dmannopyranoside (3 a) and methyl 2, 3, 4, 6 -tetra-O-benzoyl-ß-D-glucopyranoside (4 a) low yields were experienced (< 10 %). DAST and bis(2 -methoxyethyl) aminosulfur trifluoride (Deoxo-FluorTM) have been employed in the fluorination of the benzoylated and non-benzoylated methyl pyranosides. Their reactivity was evaluated, eight new fluorinated carbohydrates were prepared and characterised by high-field NMR spectroscopy. Performed investigations demonstrated Deoxo-FluorTM as a good and safer alternative to the DAST. The use of Deoxo-FluorTM found to be especially useful in the preparation of C- 6 fluorinated methyl 2, 3, 4 -tri-O-benzoyl- 6 -deoxy- 6 -fluoro-ß-D-glucopyranoside (4 c), avoiding a regioselective C 1 →C 6 migration of the anomeric methoxy group experienced with DAST-mediated fluorination. In the fluorination of unprotected methyl α-Dmannopyranoside (23 a), the methyl 4, 6 -dideoxy- 4, 6 -difluoro-α-D-talopyranoside 2, 3 - cyclic sulfite (3 e) was isolated using both fluorinating agents. The chemical synthesis of the main metabolite of antiepileptic drug Lamotrigine, Lamotrigine-N 2 -glucuronide, has been developed using commercially available methyl (2, 3, 4 -tri-O-acetyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide) <b>uronate</b> (12 a) as a glycosyl donor. Characterization and full 1 H and 13 C NMR assignments of the synthesised LTG-N 2 -glucuronide (13 a) have been performed by extensive NMRexperiments. As alternatives to the glycosyl bromide 12 a, fluorinated and non fluorinated benzoyl uronic acid derivatives have been prepared. Their usefulness in the glycosylation with Lamotrigine has been investigated. Glycosylation of Lamotrigine using the methyl (2, 3, 4 -tri-O-benzoyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide) <b>uronate</b> (14 c) gave the desired Lamotrigine-N 2 -glycoside 20 a in moderate yield. However, methyl (2, 3 -di- O-benzoyl- 4 -deoxy- 4 -fluoro-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide) <b>uronate</b> (16 c) proved to be unstable under refluxing conditions, and along with expected fluorinated Lamotrigine- N 2 -glycoside 18 a, the elimination of the fluorine was obtained.

The kinetic {{properties of the}} two enzymes were investigated. The isomerase {{was found to be}} inhibited by EDTA and to be stimulated by Zn(2 +), Co(2 +), and Mn(2 +), but not by Mg(2 +) or Ca(2 +). Both enzymes were used to develop a sensitive spectrophotometric assay, in which D-glucuronate is converted to D-mannonate with concomitant oxidation of NADH to NAD(+). The sensitivity of this assay permits the detection of less than 1 nmol D-glucuronate.
