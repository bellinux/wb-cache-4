5|$|In {{the opening}} scene of the episode, the Griffin family is seen {{watching}} the Channel 5 News, with Tricia Takanawa then beginning an interview with Stephen Hawking. Hawking, who is paralyzed due to neuro-muscular dystrophy, is seen sitting in his wheelchair. After the camera cuts, Hawking then jumps <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> and admits it is just an act, before deciding to go surfing at the nearby beach.|$|E
5|$|In Skinner's office, Krycek gets <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{and starts}} leaving out the doorway. Skinner goes after him, then {{turns around and}} sees Miles {{approaching}} behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek (who was purposely closing the elevator doors on Skinner), but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two {{set out to find}} out how trustworthy Rohrer really is. Meanwhile, at Doggett's abandoned hometown where Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows whoever it is. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but don't understand how/what for. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that Rohrer has an accomplice: Agent Crane.|$|E
25|$|While in the garden, the {{children}} are surprised to see Ben Weatherstaff looking over the wall on a ladder. Startled and angry to find {{the children}} in the secret garden, he admits that he believed Colin to be a cripple. Colin stands <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and finds that his legs are fine, though weak from long disuse. Colin soon spends every day in the garden, sometimes with Dickon as company. The children conspire to keep Colin's recovering health a secret, so as to surprise his father, who is travelling abroad. As Colin's health improves, his father sees a coinciding increase in spirits, culminating in a dream where his late wife calls to him from inside the garden. When he receives a letter from Mrs Sowerby, he takes the opportunity finally to return home. He walks the outer garden wall in his wife's memory, but hears voices inside, finds the door unlocked, and is shocked to see the garden in full bloom, and his son healthy. The servants watch, stunned, as Mr Craven and Colin walk back to the manor together.|$|E

60|$|The others deemed {{this good}} advice, {{and in a}} moment more they left Stockbridge at a rate of speed which made the {{storekeeper}} leap <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> comfortable <b>chair</b> to gaze after them in amazement.|$|R

25|$|There {{were then}} {{questions}} about Pinochet's allegedly fragile health. After medical tests, Home Secretary Jack Straw ruled in January 2000 {{that he should}} not be extradited. This triggered protests from human rights NGOs, and led in January 2000 the Belgian government, along with six human rights groups (including Amnesty International), to depose a complaint against Straw's decision before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Belgium, as well as France and Switzerland, had deposed extradition requests in the wake of Spain's demand. Despite the protests of legal and medical experts from several countries, Straw finally ruled, in March 2000, to set free Pinochet and authorize his free return to Chile. On 3 March 2000 Pinochet returned to Chile. His first act when landing in Santiago de Chile's airport was to triumphally stand <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> to acclaim his supporters. He was first greeted by his successor as head of the Chilean Armed Forces, General Ricardo Izurieta. President Ricardo Lagos, who had just sworn in on 11 March, said the retired general's televised arrival had damaged the image of Chile, while thousands demonstrated against him.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'd sooner pay double than {{be talked}} {{to in this}} way," [...] said the squire, angrily, and, as he spoke, he got <b>up</b> hurriedly <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> thrust <b>his</b> hands into his trousers-pockets, walked quickly to the window, and {{immediately}} walking back again, threw himself once more into <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|R
60|$|Vane, {{failing in}} {{another attempt to}} shake her resolution, dropped the subject, and soon {{afterward}} he and Carroll took their departure. They were sitting in their hotel, waiting for dinner, when Carroll looked <b>up</b> lazily <b>from</b> <b>his</b> luxurious <b>chair.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Marshal Stoudenmire {{heard the}} shot. Jumping <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> dining <b>chair</b> at the Globe Restaurant and pulling out his pistols, {{he ran out}} into the street. While running, Stoudenmire fired once, wildly, killing Ochoa, an {{innocent}} Mexican bystander, who was running for cover, but the first bullet struck its first target. [...] As the first gunfire shook ground, John Hale sobered up quickly and jumping behind a thick adobe pillar, but as he quickly peered out from behind it, Stoudenmire's aim was deadly accurate that the second bullet smashed right through between Hale's eyes, dropping and killing him instantly.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Spriggs bounced <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{and stood}} over {{him with his}} fists clinched. Mr. Price glared defiance.|$|E

60|$|Mr Jones let out {{an exclamation}} of dismay, and looked about {{as if the}} walls around him and the whole house had been {{infected}} with plague. Then he became very angry, and swore violently at Schomberg for daring to bring up such subjects. The hotel-keeper was too much surprised to get <b>up.</b> He gazed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> at Mr. Jones's anger, which had nothing spectral in it but was not the more comprehensible for that.|$|R
60|$|She {{came out}} quickly, almost startling him, {{so much did}} she appear {{as though she had}} surged up through the floor, {{on the other side of}} the table. The lamp was between them, and Almayer moved it aside, looking <b>up</b> at her <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair.</b> She was crying. She was crying gently, silently, in a ceaseless welling up of tears that did not fall in drops, but seemed to {{overflow}} in a clear sheet from under her eyelids--seemed to flow at once all over her face, her cheeks, and over her chin that glistened with moisture in the light. Her breast and her shoulders were shaken repeatedly by a convulsive and noiseless catching in her breath, and after every spasmodic sob her sorrowful little head, tied up in a red kerchief, trembled on her long neck, round which her bony hand gathered and clasped the disarranged dress.|$|R
60|$|Monkhouse Lee sprang <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> in {{uncontrollable}} excitement.|$|R
