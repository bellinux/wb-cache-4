Since USMs {{suffer from a}} lack of applicable mathematical model while their speed characteristics are heavily nonlinear and time varying, it used to be difficult to apply them for servo application. This paper presents a fuzzy neural network controller for servo position control of an USM. It combines both the knowledge-based fuzzy logic and the learning-incorporated neural network. As a result, it compensates the nonlinear behavior of the motor and optimizes its performance on-line. To further improve the motor performance, both of their control inputs, namely the driving frequency and phase difference of the 2 -phase inverter waveforms, arc employed. Experiments are then performed for various reference inputs. The results demonstrate superiority of the controller in terms of tracking and steady-state performance.

USM exhibit merits such as simple structure, quick response, quiet operation, self-locking when power off, nonelectromagnetic radiation and higher position accuracy. Principal Findings: A cylindrical type traveling wave <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>motor</b> using cantilever type composite transducer was proposed in this paper. There are two cantilevers on the outside surface of cylinder, four longitudinal PZT ceramics are set between the cantilevers, and four bending PZT ceramics are set on each outside surface of cantilevers. Two degenerate flexural vibration modes spatially and temporally orthogonal {{to each other in the}} cylinder are excited by the composite transducer. In this new design, a single transducer can excite a flexural traveling wave in the cylinder. Thus, elliptical motions are achieved on the teeth. The actuating mechanism of proposed motor was analyzed. The stator was designed with FEM. The two vibration modes of stator were degenerated. Transient analysis was developed to gain the vibration characteristic of stator, and results indicate the motion trajectories of nodes on the teeth are nearly ellipses. Conclusions: The study results verify the feasibility of the proposed design. The wave excited in the cylinder isn’t an ideal traveling wave, and the vibration amplitudes are inconsistent.

The drive circuit consists of a switch-mode power converter driving the USM via a step-up planar transformer. Compensation and resonant elements are added to improve the power efficiency. While the peak efficiency of this circuit is 45 %, in practice the equivalent impedance of the USM changes with mechanical load and temperature, resulting in an average efficiency of 16 %.
