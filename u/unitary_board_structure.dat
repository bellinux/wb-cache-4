We examine board structure choice in France where for 45 years firms have been free to choose between a unitary board and a dual board structure. Our evidence indicates that dual boards are more monitoring intensive and that firms with greater asymmetric information adopt unitary boards, while those with a high potential for private benefit extraction adopt dual boards.

40|$|In South Africa, {{there is}} no doubt that the duties of company {{directors}} and managers are issues, which are attracting much attention at present. With rapidly developing and changing labour legislation in South Africa, it is essential to consider the extent to which South Africa should reassess its traditional principles of company law and corporate governance policies in order that it may take into account the participatory roles of employees in the workplace. It is considered that employee participation in decisionmaking in the corporation improves productivity standards and product quality. It has been shown in some countries, such as in the United Kingdom, that where workplacebased institutions for worker representation did not supplement adversarial labour relations, labour and management relations were exceedingly poor. This ultimately affected the efficiency and performance of the enterprise system as a whole. South Africa’s company law is largely based upon the <b>unitary</b> <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> created in England. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a new corporate governance model for South Africa, which would be advantageous to all of its corporate stakeholders. The current <b>unitary</b> <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> operating in South Africa is unacceptable, as it does not provide employees with rights enabling them to engage in the decision-making processes of the corporation with their employers at an adequate level. If South Africa hopes to successfully improve corporate productivity levels with its re-entry into international markets, it is proposed that a new two-tier German-based system of corporate governance be adopted, which would assist in improving management and labour relations and ultimately the productivity of the corporation...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the association between board size and firm value using the setting of a developing economy that adopts a two-tier board system. Hence, the present study extends the existing literature which heavily focuses on economies adopting <b>unitary</b> <b>board</b> <b>structure.</b> Employing a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX), we perform regression analyses separately for the supervisory board and the management board. Using return on assets (ROA) and Tobin sQas measures of firm value, our results support the proposition that board size and firm value are positively associated. Across different models and estimation techniques, the relationship of board size to Tobin's Q is more robust than that to ROA. Our further analysis also reveals that larger board size is more likely to be employed by larger firms, which benefit from having larger boards. It is suggested that listed companies need to carefully arrange their board structure in their efforts to maximize firm value...|$|E
40|$|Student Number : 8601897 T - PhD Thesis - School of Law - Faculty of Commerce, Law and ManagementTraditionally, {{company law}} {{assumes that the}} directors’ role is to run the company {{for the benefit of}} its {{shareholders}} alone and to maximise profits for them. It can be argued, however, that this view is too narrow and outdated; that is, company directors should have regard to the rights and interests of a broader range of corporate stakeholders. Hence, the question is whether we should change our perception of the company or corporation from one run by directors dedicated exclusively to serving the interests of shareholders to that of a corporation whose main purpose is to bring benefit not only to its owners and creditors, but also to its employees, the community and the environment. Given that reforms of directors’ duties in light of the above considerations have found their way into legislation across the globe, this thesis examines how and to what extent legal rules and policies should develop in South Africa to place directors under a positive duty to take account of the interests of bodies other than shareholders. Current South African company law does not contain clear rules regarding corporate governance issues and the duties and liabilities of directors. These matters have been left to the common law and Codes of Corporate Practice. Thus, there is no extensive statutory scheme in South Africa, which covers the duties, obligations and accountability of directors. The focus in this thesis is on the rights and interests of employees and the premise that is defended is that it is valuable to corporations to provide employees with an institutionalised voice at board level. It is argued that there is global evidence that where employees participate in the decision-making processes of the company, performance is generally enhanced. This, in turn, directly impacts upon and improves economic productivity, generating a ‘win-win’ situation. The question of the duties of company directors and managers is attracting much attention in South Africa. With rapidly developing and changing labour legislation in South Africa, it is essential to consider {{the extent to which the}} country should reassess its traditional principles of company law and corporate governance policies in order to encourage participatory roles for employees in the workplace. It is argued that if South Africa is to improve corporate productivity levels with its re-entry into international markets, management and labour must find improved ways of dealing with one another. The main purpose of this thesis, therefore, is to propose and formulate a workable corporate governance model for South Africa – one that would be advantageous to all stakeholders, especially the employees. This is achieved by comparing and contrasting international models of corporate governance and by applying the best features of each to the unique South African corporate system of values, structures and traditions. It is suggested that the current <b>unitary</b> <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> operating in South Africa has become outdated and does not provide employees with rights enabling them to engage in the decision-making processes of the corporation with their employees at an adequate level. In its place, a two-tier board system of corporate governance is proposed. The economic success of a company will bring about social benefits to many stakeholder constituencies. This will not happen if the company is a financial failure. The issue of obliging directors to act primarily for the benefit of shareholders alone is questioned. Corporate governance reforms were undertaken in many parts of the world in the late 1980 ’s and early 1990 ’s. This reform process questioned whether the interests of the company should be managed for the shareholders alone or for the other corporate stakeholders as well. There are many views that strongly support the idea that corporate governance should be seen as a system by which corporations are to be governed for the benefits of all stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, creditors, suppliers and the community. In this way, companies should be run as communities in partnerships with all their stakeholders. Thus, this thesis proposes that the success of a company is inextricably intertwined with a consideration of the rights and interests of its employees and other stakeholders...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to test the {{hypothesis}} that <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> and its impact on value is a function of firm’s growth opportunities. Consistent with this hypothesis, the results show that, while low growth firms are less likely to have an independent board, i. e., to split the roles of the chairman and CEO, to have a high proportion of non-executive directors and to appoint a nonexecutive as a chairman, their value is positively related to these <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> variables. In contrast, for high growth firms, the relationship between <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> and firm value is weak, suggesting that <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> does not always mitigate the agency conflicts.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the trends and determinants of <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> {{for a large}} sample of UK firms from 1981 to 2002. We extend the predominantly US based literature {{in a number of}} important ways. Firstly, a comparative analysis of the UK and US legal and institutional settings leads us to hypothesize that UK boards will play a weaker monitoring role and hence <b>board</b> <b>structures</b> will not be determined by monitoring related factors. Our evidence supports this conjecture, showing that <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> determinants differ in predictable ways across different institutional settings. Secondly, in contrast to recent US mandatory reforms, UK reforms have been voluntary. As such they provide an interesting comparison, being arguably more effective than a mandatory approach by allowing firms to choose <b>board</b> <b>structures</b> most appropriate for their own needs. Our results support this point of view. Although the UK reforms do {{have a significant impact on}} <b>board</b> <b>structures,</b> a large number of firms choose not to comply, and those that do appear to do so for strong economic reasons. The reforms also appear to reduce the ability of well performing CEOs to influence <b>board</b> <b>structures.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} is a flat governance structure where each director has an equal vote in determining the collective actions taken by the group. Yet, some boards choose to delegate authority for specific tasks to numerous committees, while others choose to create relatively few subcommittees of the board. We investigate the determinants of subordinate <b>board</b> <b>structures,</b> exploring both their benefits and costs. Using {{a sample of the}} S&P 1500 we find that subordinate <b>board</b> <b>structures</b> are positively related to board size and the proportion of outside directors, even after controlling firm characteristics such as complexity and ownership structure. Further tests indicate that these <b>board</b> <b>structures</b> can offset the negative associations that board size and the proportion of outsiders can have with firm performance. Yet, in firms with relatively small or insider oriented boards, we find that subordinate <b>board</b> <b>structures</b> are negatively related to firm performance. Categorizing committees as either monitoring or advisory, we find that both types of committees appear related to firm performance. Taken as whole, these results are consistent with the idea that subordinate <b>board</b> <b>structures</b> can be a costly remedy to alleviate problems that arise with larger, more outsider dominated boards...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{empirical}} research that examines the relationship between corporate <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> and performance.

The findings suggest many directors and boards do not receive the development they require {{to be more effective}} in their roles. Trainers and developers interested in addressing their requirements need to understand the development role of the chairman of the board, the distinct nature of director development, obstacles to development at board level, the learning preferences of directors and formal and informal learning options that are available and ask key questions to assess the development context. The surveys examined have mainly involved UK directors and <b>unitary</b> <b>boards.</b> The situation might be different in other countries.

40|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} is considered pivotal in a company's corporate governance architecture. However, the board {{is just one of}} several governance mechanisms. External shareholders may be more concerned with the overall monitoring of management provided by the market for corporate control, ownership structure, the regulatory environment and <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> than each individual control mechanism. Thus, from their perspective, there may be a substitution effect between monitoring by the board and by other forms of governance. The overall governance of the company could be optimised by very different <b>board</b> <b>structures.</b> On the other hand, management will always be motivated to create a board that is an extension of itself rather than independent. It may have the opportunity to so do if it has sufficient ownership. In this scenario the <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> is the outcome of a bargain struck between the CEO and the outside owners and may therefore complement ownership structure. We examine the relation between ownership and <b>board</b> <b>structure</b> in Irish plcs. We test the substitution and bargaining hypotheses regarding effects of ownership on <b>board</b> <b>structure.</b> We find that the percentage of share capital owned by executives is negatively related to the percentage of the board comprised of non-executive directors and the likelihood of having a non-executive as chairman. We interpret this as evidence in favour of the bargaining hypotheses. Further indirect evidence in favour of this hypothesis is provided by a strong negative relation between the monitoring capacity of a board and company size. In contrast the evidence we report in favour of the substitution hypothesis is weak. Corporate governance <b>Board</b> <b>structure</b> Ownership structure...|$|R
