60|$|And {{the thought}} {{impressed}} itself upon me while I lingered in that peaceful spot, {{that there was}} far more {{to be said for}} the simple pleasures of sense than northern folk would have us believe. The English have still much of that ancient puritanism which finds a vague sinfulness in the <b>uncostly</b> delights of sunshine, and colour, and ease of mind. It is well occasionally to leave the eager turmoil of great cities for such a place as this, where one may learn that there are other, more natural ways of living, that it is possible still to spend long days, undisturbed by restless passion, without regret or longing, content in the various show that nature offers, asking only that the sun should shine and the happy seasons run their course.|$|E
60|$|They are {{beautiful}} things, those diamonds, {{in their native}} state. They are of various shapes; they have flat surfaces, rounded borders, and never a sharp edge. They are of all colors and shades of color, from dewdrop white to actual black; and their smooth and rounded surfaces and contours, variety of color, and transparent limpidity make them look like piles of assorted candies. A very light straw color is their commonest tint. It {{seemed to me that}} these uncut gems must be more beautiful than any cut ones could be; but when a collection of cut ones was brought out, I saw my mistake. Nothing is so beautiful as a rose diamond with the light playing through it, except that <b>uncostly</b> thing which is just like it--wavy sea-water with the sunlight playing through it and striking a white-sand bottom.|$|E
6000|$|A Venetian who enters or leaves {{any place}} of public resort touches his hat to the company, {{and one day}} at the {{restaurant}} some ladies, who had been dining there, said [...] "Complimenti!" [...] on going out, with a grace that went near to make the beefsteak tender. It is this <b>uncostly</b> gentleness of bearing which gives a winning impression of the whole people, whatever selfishness or real discourtesy lie beneath it. At home it sometimes seems {{that we are in}} such haste to live and be done with it, we have no time to be polite. Or is popular politeness merely a vice of servile peoples? And is it altogether better to be rude? I wish it were not. If you are lost in his city (and you are pretty sure to be lost there, continually), a Venetian will go with you wherever you wish. And he will do this amiable little service out of what one may say old civilization has established in place of goodness of heart, but which is perhaps not so different from it.|$|E
6000|$|For {{here not}} long is {{solitude}} secure, Nor Fantasy left vacant to her spell. Here, sometimes, in this paradise of shade, Rippled with western winds, the dusty Tramp, Seeing the treeless causey burn beyond, Halts to unroll his bundle of strange food [...] 210 And munch an unearned meal. I cannot help Liking this creature, lavish Summer's bedesman, Who from the almshouse steals when nights grow warm, Himself his large estate and only charge, To be {{the guest of}} haystack or of hedge, Nobly superior to the household gear That forfeits us our privilege of nature. I bait him with my match-box and my pouch, Nor grudge the <b>uncostly</b> sympathy of smoke, His equal now, divinely unemployed. [...] 220 Some smack of Robin Hood is in the man, Some secret league with wild wood-wandering things; He is our ragged Duke, our barefoot Earl, By right of birth exonerate from toil, Who levies rent from us his tenants all, And serves the state by merely being. Here The Scissors-grinder, pausing, doffs his hat, And lets the kind breeze, with its delicate fan, Winnow the heat from out his dank gray hair,-- A grimy Ulysses, a much-wandered man, [...] 230 Whose feet are known to all the populous ways, And many men and manners he hath seen, Not without fruit of solitary thought. He, as the habit is of lonely men,-- Unused to try the temper of their mind In fence with others,--positive and shy, Yet knows to put an edge upon his speech, Pithily Saxon in unwilling talk. Him I entrap with my long-suffering knife, And, while its poor blade hums away in sparks, [...] 240 Sharpen my wit upon his gritty mind, In motion set obsequious to his wheel, And in its quality not much unlike.|$|E
6000|$|The Venetian does not, {{like the}} Spaniard, place his house at your disposition, and, having {{extended}} this splendid invitation, consider {{the duties of}} hospitality fulfilled; he {{does not appear to}} think you want to make use of his house for social purposes, preferring himself the caffè, and finding home and comfort there, rather than under his own roof. [...] "What caffè do you frequent? Ah! so do I. We shall meet often there." [...] This is frequently your new acquaintance's promise of friendship. And one may even learn to like the social footing on which people meet at the caffè, {{as well as that of}} the parlor or drawing-room. I could not help thinking one evening at Padua, while we sat talking with some pleasant Paduans in one of the magnificent saloons of the Caffè Pedrocchi, that I should like to go there for society, if I could always find it there, much better than to private houses. There is far greater ease and freedom, more elegance and luxury, and not the slightest weight of obligation laid upon you for the gratification your friend's company has given you. One has not to be a debtor in the sum of a friend's outlay for house, servants, refreshments, and the like. Nowhere in Europe is the senseless and wasteful American custom of treating known; and nothing could be more especially foreign to the frugal instincts and habits of the Italians. So, when a party of friends at a caffè eat or drink, each one pays for what he takes, and pecuniarily, the enjoyment of the evening is <b>uncostly</b> or not, according as each prefers. Of course no one sits down in such a place without calling for something; but I have frequently seen people respond to this demand of custom by ordering a glass of water with anise, at the expense of two soldi. A cup of black coffee, for five soldi, secures a chair, a table, and as many journals as you like, for as long time as you like.|$|E

5000|$|Abduction (or retroduction). Guessing, {{inference}} to explanatory hypotheses for {{selection of}} those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, {{on the basis}} of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicative phenomenon. Oftenest, even a well-prepared mind guesses wrong. But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of sheer luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense, said Peirce, of the [...] "facile and natural", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from [...] "logical simplicity". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and, without it, there is no hope of sufficiently expediting inquiry (often multi-generational) toward new truths. Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself. Peirce calls his pragmatism [...] "the logic of abduction". His pragmatic maxim is: [...] "Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object". His pragmatism is a method of reducing conceptual confusions fruitfully by equating the meaning of any conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects - a method of experimentational mental reflection hospitable to forming hypotheses and conducive to testing them. It favors efficiency. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if <b>uncostly</b> to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctive plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, and incomplexity. One can hope to discover only that which time would reveal through a learner's sufficient experience anyway, so the point is to expedite it; the economy of research is what demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.Deduction. Two stages:Explication. Unclearly premissed, but deductive, analysis of the hypothesis in order to render its parts as clear as possible.Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, Euclidean in procedure. Explicit deduction of hypothesis's consequences as predictions, for induction to test, about evidence to be found. Corollarial or, if needed, theorematic.Induction. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real is only the object of the final opinion to which adequate investigation would lead; anything to which no such process would ever lead would not be real. Induction involving ongoing tests or observations follows a method which, sufficiently persisted in, will diminish its error below any predesignate degree. Three stages:Classification. Unclearly premissed, but inductive, classing of objects of experience under general ideas.Probation: direct inductive argumentation. Crude (the enumeration of instances) or gradual (new estimate of proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test). Gradual induction is qualitative or quantitative; if qualitative, then dependent on weightings of qualities or characters; if quantitative, then dependent on measurements, or on statistics, or on countings.Sentential Induction. [...] "...which, by inductive reasonings, appraises the different probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a model for assessing the risk of erosion, exploring the potential of DEMs from SRTM, ASTER, ALOS PALSAR and one made with interpolation of a 1 : 25, 000 contour map to calculate the variables of the relief that have greater impact on erosion. Several geomorphometric parameters, such as slope, aspect, profile and plan curvature, topographic wetness index, stream power index, and sediment transport capacity were computed from the DEM´s elevation, some fuzzy logic functions proposed to evaluate the incidence of each parameter on erosion risk in a mountainous area of Colombia. The results showed that the use of DEM data is a relatively easy, <b>uncostly</b> method to identify, in a qualitative way, the risk of erosion and contribute to the enhancement of erosion information that is obtained with conventional general soil surveys...|$|E
