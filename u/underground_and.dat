40|$|Key words: {{combined}} surface <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mining; counter-tilt slope; failure mode; slope stability; limit {{equilibrium method}} Abstract. How {{to demonstrate the}} deformation and failure mode of the slope under combine surface <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mining <b>and</b> evaluate its stability scientifically {{is one of the}} problems that need urgent solutions in mining engineering. First, the deformation and failure mode of the slope under simple surface mining, the deformation and failure mechanism of the overlying strata affected by <b>underground</b> mining <b>and</b> deformation mechanism of the slope under combined surface <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mining were analyzed, then the failure mode and the stability calculation method of the slope under combined surface <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mining was studied. The results show that the failure modes of the slope under combined surface <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mining involve three patterns: slipping failure, subsiding failure and slipping-subsiding combined failure, that the failure modes and the stability of the slope under combined surface <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mining be significantly affected by the <b>underground</b> mining positions <b>and</b> the influence be mainly controlled by the length of the latent slide plane of the slope and the weakening degree of the rock masses in the subsidence range. Finally, a limit equilibrium method to calculate the slope stability under combined surface <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> mining was put forward...|$|R

5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats <b>underground</b> <b>and</b> hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs and lays its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E

40|$|Information Service. Zx Abstract. After a {{comprehensive}} review on the exploitation of information technology in geotechnical engineering <b>and</b> <b>underground</b> engineering, a concept of digital <b>underground</b> space <b>and</b> engineering (DUSE) is proposed.

DUSE is also a digital museum of the <b>underground</b> space <b>and</b> engineering. By employing the concept, the method and the techniques provided in DUSE, a more realistic <b>and</b> transparent <b>underground</b> space <b>and</b> engineering could be built; huge amount of data could be easily managed and effectively visualized. Therefore, useful information of these data can be processed, improving working efficiency and promoting the implementation of intelligent decision about the engineering project.

5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, gay {{relationships}} were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in <b>underground</b> <b>and</b> alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} long-term expansion {{proposals were}} put forward between 1964 and 1991 which all proposed adding numerous {{lines to the}} network as well as extending the existing ones.

One additional proposal put forward in 1973 saw the unification of the city's commuter rail lines through underground tunnels and incorporated into the Buenos Aires <b>Underground,</b> <b>and</b> while this was also shelved, it has been adapted into the current Red de Expresos Regionales proposal.|$|E
