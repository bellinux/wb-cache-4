5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl {{is used as}} an additive in <b>unleaded</b> gasoline {{to boost}} octane rating and reduce engine knocking. The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.|$|E
5|$|The Swedish-made Koenigsegg CCXR, {{a limited}} edition and {{version of the}} CCX, is {{currently}} the fastest and most powerful flexible fuel vehicle with its twin-supercharged V8 producing 1018hp when running on biofuel, as compared to 806hp on 91 octane US <b>unleaded</b> gasoline.|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on dual-fuel systems that supply both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are <b>unleaded</b> gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|E
5|$|The E85 blend {{is used in}} {{gasoline}} engines modified to accept such higher concentrations of ethanol, and the fuel injection is regulated through a dedicated sensor, which automatically detects the amount of ethanol in the fuel, allowing to adjust both fuel injection and spark timing accordingly to the actual blend available in the vehicle's tank. Because ethanol contains close to 34% less energy per unit volume than gasoline, E85 FFVs have a lower mileage per gallon than gasoline. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles was 25.56% lower than <b>unleaded</b> gasoline.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, Holden {{introduced}} the VK Commodore, with significant styling changes {{from the previous}} VH. The Commodore was next updated in 1986 as the VL, which had new front and rear styling. Controversially, the VL was powered by the 3.0-litre Nissan RB30 six-cylinder engine and had a Nissan-built, electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Holden even went to court in 1984 to stop local motoring magazine Wheels from reporting on the matter. The engine change was necessitated by the legal requirement that all new cars sold in Australia after 1986 had to consume <b>unleaded</b> petrol. Because it was unfeasible to convert the existing six-cylinder engine to run on <b>unleaded</b> fuel, the Nissan engine {{was chosen as the}} best engine available. However, changing exchange rates doubled the cost of the engine and transmission {{over the life of the}} VL. The decision to opt for a Japanese-made transmission led to the closure of the Woodville, South Australia assembly plant. Confident by the apparent sign of turnaround, GM paid off Holden's mounted losses of A$780million on 19 December 1986. At GM headquarters' request, Holden was then reorganised and recapitalised, separating the engine and car manufacturing divisions in the process. This involved the splitting of Holden into Holden's Motor Company (HMC) and Holden's Engine Company (HEC). For the most part, car bodies were now manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, with engines as before, confined to the Fishermans Bend plant in Port Melbourne, Victoria. The engine manufacturing business was successful, building four-cylinder Family II engines for use in cars built overseas. The final phase of the Commodore's recovery strategy involved the 1988 VN, a significantly wider model powered by the American-designed, Australian-assembled 3.8-litre Buick V6 engine.|$|E
5|$|The main {{agricultural}} products of Malawi include tobacco, sugarcane, cotton, tea, corn, potatoes, sorghum, cattle and goats. The main industries are tobacco, tea and sugar processing, sawmill products, cement and consumer goods. The industrial production growth rate {{is estimated at}} 10% (2009). The country makes no significant use of natural gas. , Malawi does not import or export any electricity, but does import all its petroleum, with no production in country. Beginning in 2006, the country began mixing <b>unleaded</b> petrol with 10% ethanol, produced in-country at two plants, to reduce dependence on imported fuel. In 2008, Malawi began testing cars that ran solely on ethanol, and initial results are promising, {{and the country is}} continuing to increase its use of ethanol.|$|E
5|$|Various {{causes for}} the {{dramatic}} decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks; electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones; and diseases. A shortage of nesting sites caused {{by changes in}} urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows. A primary cause of the decline {{seems to be an}} insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows. Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy use of pesticides, the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas, and possibly the introduction of <b>unleaded</b> petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl nitrite.|$|E
5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independence—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of <b>unleaded</b> petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase of GHG emissions is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.|$|E
5|$|HSV E Series 3 or E3 {{commenced}} {{sales in}} 2011. Model {{changes for the}} E series 3 include an option for LPI system (for an extra $5990) allowing the vehicle to run on LPG and <b>unleaded</b> petrol; the LPI system is not available on the ClubSport R8 Tourer. Cosmetic changes include a new spoiler and revised exhaust tips. HSV E Series 3 models reach 0-100kmp in 5.8 seconds. The HSV E Series 3 introduced the new HSV Enhanced Driver Interface; {{it has the same}} interface as the Holden IQ (found in VE Series II Commodores) but with added function. The system allows users to access the car's computer and monitor fuel consumption, stability, g-force and vehicle dynamics. Other functions include data logging options, digital gauge displays, stopwatch, driver and racing options, along with controls for the Grange's Bi-Modal exhaust and Side Blind-Zone Alert. The HSV Enhanced Driver Interface and satellite navigation is standard across the E series 3 range.|$|E
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for <b>unleaded</b> gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage exhaust valves. The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
5|$|In Trinidad and Tobago, the {{government}} set up shelters and sent home non-essential oil workers. Officials canceled flights {{and shut the}} ports as a precaution. Stores and business closed early after locals had stocked up on life supplies. Army troops were deployed in Port of Spain to avert looting. The threat of the storm caused a rise in <b>unleaded</b> oil prices. In Venezuela, boats were ordered to remain at port, while flights were canceled to Isla Margarita and Puerto la Cruz. Rescue workers were mobilized {{in the capital city}} of Caracas to prepare in the event of landslides. Ahead of the storm, the head of Sucre state declared a state of emergency, and later Caracas was placed under the same state once the rains began. According to the governor of Venezuela's capital district, local weather media expected the storm to only brush Caracas and surrounding areas; as a result, not all precautions were made. On August7, weather officials stated that the brunt of the storm had passed and that the storm was weakening; this was before the onslaught of the flooding rains. In neighboring Colombia, officials issued a wind and heavy rain warning in response to the storm. Towns shut off electricity along the coast and canceled flights. Later, about 1,000people evacuated from eastern Costa Rica, and another 40,000evacuated from portions of Nicaragua, Flights in the country were canceled due to the storm.|$|E
25|$|The {{octane rating}} of typical commercially {{available}} gasoline varies by country. In Finland, Sweden, and Norway, 95 RON {{is the standard}} for regular <b>unleaded</b> gasoline and 98 RON is also available as a more expensive option. In the UK, ordinary regular <b>unleaded</b> gasoline is 95 RON (commonly available), premium <b>unleaded</b> gasoline is always 97 RON, and super <b>unleaded</b> is usually 97–98 RON. However, both Shell and BP produce fuel at 102 RON for cars with high-performance engines and in 2006 the supermarket chain Tesco began to sell super <b>unleaded</b> gasoline rated at 99 RON. In the US, octane ratings in <b>unleaded</b> fuels can vary between 85 and 87 AKI (91–92 RON) for regular, through 89–90 AKI (94–95 RON) for mid-grade (equivalent to European regular), up to 90–94 AKI (95–99 RON) for premium (European premium).|$|E
25|$|LRP was marketed {{during and}} after the phaseout of leaded motor fuels in the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and some other countries. Consumer {{confusion}} led to widespread mistaken preference for LRP rather than <b>unleaded,</b> and LRP was phased out 8 to 10 years after the introduction of <b>unleaded.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lead Replacement Petrol (LRP) was {{developed}} for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuel and incompatible with <b>unleaded.</b> Rather than tetraethyl lead it contains other metal such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); these are purported to buffer soft exhaust valves and seats {{so that they do}} not suffer recession due to the use of <b>unleaded</b> fuel.|$|E
25|$|The engines runs on a 50:1 pre-mix of <b>unleaded</b> 93 octane auto {{fuel and}} oil.|$|E
25|$|Trans Am Series racecars carry enough fuel to run {{the entire}} race non-stop, making each race a 100-mile sprint that is a test of driver skill and competitiveness. Current rules allow for TA class cars to use leaded (112 Octane) or <b>unleaded</b> (98 Octane) gasoline. All other classes must use <b>unleaded</b> gas. (All fuel is {{supplied}} exclusively by VP Racing Fuels, Inc.) Fuel and refueling on pit lane, or on the grid is strictly prohibited. Fueling / refueling is only permitted in the team's paddock space.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, {{the three}} {{national}} NASCAR stock car series mandated a switch from gasoline to E15, {{a blend of}} Sunoco GTX <b>unleaded</b> racing fuel and 15% ethanol.|$|E
25|$|In the United States all {{motor vehicle}} {{gasoline}} is <b>unleaded</b> {{and is available}} in several grades with different octane rating; 87 (Regular), 89 (Mid-Grade), and 93 (Premium) are typical grades. The maximum octane rating in California is generally 91. At high altitudes in the Mountain States and the Black Hills of South Dakota, regular <b>unleaded</b> can be as low as 85 octane; this practice is now increasingly controversial, since it was instituted when most cars had carburetors instead of the fuel injection and electronic engine controls standard in recent decades.|$|E
25|$|In the UK {{the most}} common {{gasoline}} grade (and lowest octane generally available) is 'Premium' 95 RON <b>unleaded.</b> 'Super' is widely available at 97 RON (for example Shell V-Power, BP Ultimate). Leaded fuel is no longer available.|$|E
25|$|Legislation {{requires}} {{retailers to}} label fuels containing ethanol on the dispenser, and limits ethanol use to 10% of gasoline in Australia. Such gasoline is commonly called E10 by major brands, {{and it is}} cheaper than regular <b>unleaded</b> gasoline.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, petrol is <b>unleaded,</b> and {{available}} in 91 (normally {{with up to}} 10% ethanol), 95, 98 and 100 octane (names of various petrols differ from brand to brand). Fuel additives for use in cars designed for leaded fuel are available at most servos.|$|E
25|$|A revised grille {{with fewer}} {{vertical}} bars and revised taillight lenses marked the 1975 Grand Prix. Changes included {{the addition of}} GM's High Energy electronic ignition and a catalytic converter that mandated the use of <b>unleaded</b> gasoline. Radial tires became standard on all models.|$|E
25|$|A {{variant of}} the UK market V6 model - detuned to run on 91 rather than 95 octane <b>unleaded</b> petrol - was {{launched}} in New Zealand in 1991. These Japanese-built models were replaced with an Australian-made line, with unique New Zealand specification, in 1993 {{at which point the}} 2.2-liter I4 was offered as well.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, {{gasoline}} is <b>unleaded,</b> and most commonly available in 91 RON ("Regular") and 95 RON ("Premium"). 98 RON {{is available at}} selected BP ("Ultimate") and Mobil ("Synergy 8000") service stations instead of the standard 95 RON. 96 RON was replaced by 95 RON, and subsequently abolished in 2006. Leaded fuel was abolished in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The {{wholesale}} price of Mogas 95 <b>unleaded</b> petrol is the regional benchmark, including the benchmark price for Australia. This {{is a result}} of Singapore having a large refining capacity. In 2005, Australia imported 29% of its petrol and diesel needs, of which 80% came from Singapore. The retail price of Australian petrol is thus influenced by the {{wholesale price}} of petrol in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Almost all {{countries}} in the world have phased out automotive leaded fuel. In 2011 six countries were still using leaded gasoline: Afghanistan, Myanmar, North Korea, Algeria, Iraq and Yemen. It was expected {{that by the end of}} 2013 those countries would ban leaded gasoline, but it has not occurred. Algeria will replace leaded with <b>unleaded</b> automotive fuel only in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Ferrocene and its {{derivatives}} are antiknock agents used in {{the fuel}} for petrol engines; they are safer than tetraethyllead, previously used. Petrol additive solutions containing ferrocene {{can be added to}} <b>unleaded</b> petrol to enable its use in vintage cars designed to run on leaded petrol. The iron-containing deposits formed from ferrocene can form a conductive coating on the spark plug surfaces.|$|E
25|$|In the US, diesel is {{recommended}} {{to be stored}} in a yellow container to differentiate it from kerosene and gasoline, which are typically kept in blue and red containers, respectively. In the UK, diesel is normally stored in a black container, to differentiate it from <b>unleaded</b> petrol (which is commonly stored in a green container) and leaded petrol (which is stored in a red container).|$|E
25|$|The IO-233 was {{announced}} by the company at AirVenture on 28 July 2008 as a new engine for light sport aircraft. The engine was conceived as a lightened version of the Lycoming O-235 by company engineers who were building their own kit LSAs and {{found that there was}} no powerplant that met their requirements for power output and weight, with the ability to burn either 100LL avgas or <b>unleaded</b> automotive fuel.|$|E
25|$|Engine offerings again {{included}} 350 and 455-cubic-inch Rocket V8s {{ranging from}} 250 to 340 gross horsepower, {{all of which}} featured lowered compression ratios beginning in 1971 to enable use of lower octane regular leaded 91 RON octane, low-lead or <b>unleaded</b> gasoline. Vented power front disc brakes and variable-ratio power steering were now standard equipment on all 88 models. During the 1971 model year the Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission {{was added to the}} standard equipment list.|$|E
25|$|Compared with {{conventional}} <b>unleaded</b> gasoline, ethanol is a particulate-free burning fuel source that combusts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, water and aldehydes. The Clean Air Act requires {{the addition of}} oxygenates to reduce carbon monoxide emissions in the United States. The additive MTBE is currently being phased out due to ground water contamination, hence ethanol becomes an attractive alternative additive. Current production methods include air pollution from the manufacturer of macronutrient fertilizers such as ammonia.|$|E
25|$|Biofuels {{produced}} from food crops have become controversial as food prices increased significantly in mid-2008, leading to increased concerns about food vs fuel. Ethanol fuel in Australia can be {{produced from}} sugarcane or grains and there are currently three commercial producers of fuel ethanol in Australia, all on the east coast. Legislation imposes a 10% cap on the concentration of fuel ethanol blends. Blends of 90% <b>unleaded</b> petrol and 10% fuel ethanol are {{commonly referred to as}} E10, which is mainly available through service stations operating under the BP, Caltex, Shell, and United brands. In partnership with the Queensland Government, the Canegrowers organisation launched a regional billboard campaign in March 2007 to promote the renewable fuels industry. Over 100million litres of the new BP <b>Unleaded</b> with renewable ethanol has now been sold to Queensland motorists. Biodiesel produced from oilseed crops or recycled cooking oil may be a better prospect than ethanol, given the nation's heavy reliance on road transport, and the growing popularity of fuel-efficient diesel cars. Australian cities {{are some of the most}} car-dependent cities in the world, and legislations involving vehicle pollution within the country are considered relatively lax.|$|E
25|$|The safety {{data sheet}} for <b>unleaded</b> {{gasoline}} shows at least 15 hazardous chemicals occurring in various amounts, including benzene (up to 5% by volume), toluene (up to 35% by volume), naphthalene (up to 1% by volume), trimethylbenzene (up to 7% by volume), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (up to 18% by volume, in some states) and about ten others. Hydrocarbons in gasoline generally exhibit low acute toxicities, with LD50 of 700–2700mg/kg for simple aromatic compounds. Benzene and many antiknocking additives are carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|Swedish carmakers have {{developed}} ethanol-only capable engines {{for the new}} Saab Aero X BioPower 100 Concept E100, with a V6 engine which is fuelled entirely by E100 bioethanol, and the limited edition of the Koenigsegg CCXR, {{a version of the}} CCX converted to use E85 or E100, as well as standard 98-octane gasoline, and currently the fastest and most powerful flex-fuel vehicle with its twin-supercharged V8 producing 1018hp when running on biofuel, as compared to 806hp on 91-octane <b>unleaded</b> gasoline.|$|E
25|$|IOC Barauni in the Bihar {{state of}} India {{was built in}} {{collaboration}} with the Soviet Union at a cost of Rs.49.4 crores and went on stream in July, 1964. The initial capacity of 2 MMTPA was expanded to 3 MMTPA by 1969. The present capacity of this refinery is 6.00 MMTPA. A Catalytic Reformer Unit (CRU) was also added to the refinery in 1997 for production of <b>unleaded</b> motor spirit. Projects are also planned for meeting future fuel quality requirements.|$|E
25|$|Leaded petrol was {{withdrawn}} from sale in Britain after 31 December 1999, {{seven years after}} EEC regulations signalled the end of production for cars using leaded petrol in member states. At this stage, {{a large percentage of}} cars from the 1980s and early 1990s which ran on leaded petrol were still in use, along with cars which could run on <b>unleaded</b> fuel. However, the declining number of such cars on British roads saw many petrol stations withdrawing LRP from sale by 2003.|$|E
