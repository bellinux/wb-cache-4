5|$|At George Washington University, a {{group of}} artists sketch a nude male model. However, one of the artists, John Mostow (Levani Outchaneichvili), draws a demonic {{creature}} in the model's place; while using a <b>utility</b> <b>knife</b> to sharpen his pencil he cuts his hand trying and smears the blood on his drawing. When the model reaches his car after the session, he is attacked and killed by an obscured assailant. The following morning, Mostow is arrested in his apartment by an FBI task force led by Agent Bill Patterson (Kurtwood Smith), who finds the <b>utility</b> <b>knife</b> used in the murder covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|A {{glassblower}} is {{attacked and}} hospitalized. Nemhauser (Greg Thirloway), another agent on the case, tells Scully that Patterson {{was responsible for}} getting Mulder assigned to the case and may admire him after all. Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a <b>utility</b> <b>knife.</b> Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from doing what he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow will not tell him {{how to find the}} creature that attacked him.|$|E
5|$|Scully finds a {{disassembled}} <b>utility</b> <b>knife</b> at {{the latest}} crime scene with Mulder's prints on it and discovers that the murder weapon is missing from the evidence room. She meets with Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who is also worried about Mulder's behavior. Mulder has a nightmare about being attacked by a gargoyle that is really himself. He wakes up and goes to Mostow's studio again, finding a severed arm. Scully gets a message to call Nemhauser, but his phone is answered by Mulder, who denies taking the knife. Mulder searches Mostow's studio and finds Nemhauser's body inside a new sculpture. Mulder is then confronted by Patterson, who is unaware of how {{he arrived at the}} studio. Mulder then deduces that Patterson is the killer, based on his three-year obsession with Mostow and his request for Mulder to investigate the case. Mulder confronts him, but Patterson flees when Scully arrives. Mulder pursues him and they fight; Patterson is shot and apprehended.|$|E
50|$|Large fixed-blade <b>utility</b> <b>knives</b> {{are most}} often {{employed}} in an outdoors context, such as fishing, camping, or hunting.

500|$|The episode {{marked the}} final regular {{performances}} of actors David Costabile and Jeremiah Bitsui as Gale and Victor. Gilligan considered changing the episode based on audience {{responses to the}} third-season finale, [...] "Full Measure", on whether Gale would be killed or not, but ultimately decided against it. During a twist scene in [...] "Box Cutter", Gus slices his loyal henchman Victor's throat with a <b>utility</b> <b>knife</b> right before Walt and Jesse's eyes. Esposito said {{he was concerned about}} filming the scene [...] "without really hurting my spirit and my soul", and he concentrated so hard that he remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to others on set. The scene was so bloody it made Cranston's daughter faint during a screening.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>utility</b> <b>knives</b> are {{not well}} suited to use as {{offensive}} weapons, {{with the exception of}} some outdoor-type <b>utility</b> <b>knives</b> employing longer blades. However, even small razor-blade type <b>utility</b> <b>knives</b> may sometimes find use as slashing weapons. The 9-11 commission report stated passengers in cell phone calls reported knives or [...] "box-cutters" [...] were used as weapons, (also Mace or a bomb), in hi-jacking airplanes in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States, though the exact design of the knives used is unknown. Two of the hijackers were known to have purchased Leatherman knives, which feature a 4" [...] locking blade which were not prohibited on U.S. flights at the time. Those knives were not found in the possessions the two hijackers left behind. Similar cutters, including paper cutters, have also been known {{to be used as a}} lethal weapon.|$|R

Angela initially refuses, but gives in when Dwight begins describing her ailments in grotesque detail. At the house, Angela is horrified by Dwight's treatment of his Aunt: he consistently speaks {{to her in a}} condescending tone, proposes to cut off her worn-out clothing with a <b>utility</b> <b>knife,</b> and [...] "bathes" [...] her by spraying her with a high-pressure water hose like a cow. After subduing Dwight by spraying him with the hose, Angela insists on washing and grooming Shirley in a more dignified manner. Through the process, Dwight and Angela recall their feelings for each other. At the end of the day, they begin kissing, but Angela reminds Dwight that she is married and says she will not leave her husband even though he does not care for her. Dwight admits that he would want that same blind loyalty from her if she were his wife.|$|E

A large tool selection is the signature of the Swiss Army Knife. These knives are produced by Victorinox and Wenger and issued to military services and sold to the public. [...] Similar to the Swiss Army knife is the German Army knife, with two blades opening from each side and featuring hard plastic grips and aluminum liners. [...] The U.S. Military <b>utility</b> <b>knife</b> (MIL-K-818), issued by the United States Army, Navy, and Marine Corps, was made for many years by the Camillus Cutlery Company and Imperial Schrade as well as many other companies. [...] It was originally produced with carbon steel blades and brass liners (both vulnerable to corrosion), but with the onset of the Vietnam War was modified to incorporate all-stainless steel construction.

2500|$|A sliding knife is a knife {{that can}} be opened by sliding the knife blade out {{the front of the}} handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the gravity knife). Another form is an O-T-F (out-the-front) switchblade, which only {{requires}} the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed. [...] A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding <b>utility</b> <b>knife</b> (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).|$|E

A famous anecdote from this incident occurred when Park was hospitalized after the attack.

[...] After this, the candidate from the Grand National Party won the election for mayor of the city of Daejeon despite having trailed by more than 20 percentage points in opinion polls up to the point of the attack. In addition, during her term as the GNP chairwoman between 2004 and 2006, the party won all 40 reelections and by-elections held, which was largely credited to her influence and efforts. This feat gave Park a nickname [...] "Queen of Elections".|$|E

There are currently 3 different models out, in chronological order they are the regular, classic, and current 21 model. The major difference is between the regular and classic/21 model. The regular has scalloping and a smaller lock bar access cut out. The classic is very similar to the 21 (being its predecessor), with the main difference being the classic stamp on the lock side of the knife as well as having a rounded lock bar. They offer inlays ranging from micarta to wood to even ivory on the classic and 21 models.

Some bayonets can also be used as <b>utility</b> <b>knives,</b> bottle openers or throwing knives.
