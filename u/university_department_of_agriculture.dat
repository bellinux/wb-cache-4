40|$|The Region Sardinia has {{relatively}} recently {{adopted a}} district level approach to develop forest management. The first experimental {{implementation of this}} approach has been conducted in the Arci-Grighine district (Oristano province), with an initial effort between 2009 and 2010 and finally concluded in 2013 - 2016, in cooperation with NuoroForestrySchool study center of Sassari <b>University</b> (<b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture).</b> The doctoral thesis research has been developed {{as part of this}} work. The research has confirmed that district level planning is a very appropriate context to approach territorial forest planning and management operational aspects in a systemic perspective, connecting all interacting actors: private owners, public administrations and ‘commoners’ (common rights community members). Different specific methodologies have been developed and tested with success, from Public Participation GIS to the ‘sub-systems’ strategy developed as operational planning tool. Personal and collective responsibility play an essential role in the implementation of a systemic perspective.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Agricultural Science) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2013 The study {{examined}} collaboration among research-extension-and farmers for agricultural innovation in North West Province, South Africa. The study {{was based on}} the need for agricultural production to be more responsive to demand through effective collaboration and strengthened linkage activities among researchers, extension officers and farmers. A simple random sampling technique was used to select 50 researchers, 50 extension officers and 50 farmers from the Agricultural Research Council and North West <b>University,</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> and Rural Development, National African Farmers' Union and African Farmers Association of South Africa respectively. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data was analyzed with SPSS version 21 using frequency count percentages, mean and standard deviations. The results indicate that there is weak linkage between researchers, extension agents and farmers. Actor linkage is affected by personal characteristics, attitude towards collaboration, knowledge of Agricultural Innovation Systems and institutional constraints among others. To make the value chain more effective, this paper recommends operative linkage among researchers-extension agents and farmers. Master...|$|E

The data was collected from a number of sources:Yamagata universlty, inquiry of National federation of University co-operative associations in Japan, government figure, and Yamagata Prefecture figure. Second, the author carried out a questionnaire survey of 143 students of Yamagata <b>University</b> <b>department</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> from 2003 to 2007. According to the result of statistical analysis and the questionnaire survey, the house rent made up nearly 50 % of the expenditure of the young people. As for the situation of the student apartments, the living area and the sound insulation of the room were particularly inferior. The residence areas were much inferior to the minimum housing standards that a country established. For the improvement of the residential qualifications of young people, governments and local governments should change the existing public housing policy. The local governments in particular should permit students to enter public housing. The education policy also has to support the students residence. Adequate residential qualifications should be guaranteed for the independence of the young people. This issue is strongly related with the housing problems in Japan now and the solutions for the future.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the online evaluation system by collecting various forms of data from Extension Agents who used the system. For this study, data collection was divided into two phases. Phase I included a census of all County Extension Agents and Extension Specialists who had accessed the Texas Online Evaluation System between August 1, 2001 and September 8, 2001. The questions were derived from a pilot test that was conducted in cooperation with several components of Texas Cooperative Extension including the Texas 4 ?H & Youth Development Program and the Texas A&M <b>University</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture,</b> Education Extension Education Unit. The data from Phase I was coded for confidentiality and managed using Microsoft Excel. Only aggregated data has been reported for this study. Phase II was administered through a telephone interview, and was designed to gather a richer, more qualitative pool of data. Of the 29 selected for participation, only 15 were contacted. Like Phase I, Phase II was coded for confidentiality and was managed using Corel WordPerfect. The majority of respondents for this study were male Extension Agents in primarily rural counties. On average, the respondents have been employeed as Extension Agents for 8. 7 years. Phase I and Phase II indicated an overall satisfaction in the system with some concern in the areas of data entry and readability of the instrument. It can be concluded that the system is being adopted, although some changes need to be made in order to better fit the needs of the agents...|$|E

Information is still lacking and. it is dangerous to draw a conclusion from the data of this survey that was made at a time point and is not in a time sequence, but the following provisional conclusion may be drawn from the present study. 1) The normal trees show a good linear height growth up to the measuring time point. The estimated height of normal, trees in 10 years after planting is 250 cm - 300 cm, and it is expected that the growth will be ranked about the middle between the 2 nd class and the 3 rd class plots in the yield table for larch forest in Karukawa District in Hokkaido, 2) The standard deviation and the coefficient of variance of the height of normal trees are linearly related with the age of the forest, $ sigma $ being 60 cm and C. V. 35 - 40 % approximately at 5 years of forest age. 3) The height growth of damaged trees are considerably inferior to that of normal trees. 4) Especially, the height growth is retarded markedly in sickle-damaged trees. 5) Among various kinds of damages, dead trees due to wood-mice damage show the highest damage rate. 6) The height growth after the trees are damaged seems to depend on the location and the time of damage. The general conclusion on the height growth and damages of young larch forest will be drawn after the permanent plot is established in the future...|$|E

40|$|Background: Immunoregulatory probiotics (immunobiotics) {{have been}} {{proposed}} to improve piglets? immune system to avoid intestinal infections and reduce unproductive inflammation after weaning. Previously, it was demonstrated that Lactobacillus jensenii TL 2937 (LjTL 2937) attenuated the inflammatory response triggered by activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR- 4) in porcine intestinal epithelial (PIE) cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) from porcine Peyer?s patches (PP). 							Objective: In view of the critical importance of PIE-APCs interactions in the regulation of intestinal immune responses, we aimed to {{examine the effect of}} LjTL 2937 on activation patterns of APCs from swine PPs in co-cultures with PIE cells. In addition, we investigated whether LjTL 2937 was able to beneficially modulate intestinal immunity of piglets after weaning to improve immune-health status. 							Results: Stimulation of PIE-APCs co-cultures with LjTL 2937 increased the expression of MHC-II, CD 80 / 86, IL- 10, and Bcl- 3 in CD 172 a+CD 11 R 1 ␣ and CD 172 a+CD 11 R 1 high APCs. In addition, the TL 2937 strain caused the upregulation of three negative regulators of TLR 4 in PIE cells: MKP- 1, Bcl- 3 and A 20. These changes significantly reduced the inflammatory response triggered by TLR 4 activation in PIE-APCs co-cultures. The in vivo experiments using castrated male piglets (crossbreeding (LWD) with Landrace (L), Large Yorkshire (W) and Duroc (D)) of 3 weeks of age demonstrated that feeding with LjTL 2937 significantly reduced blood complement activity and C reactive protein concentrations while no changes were observed in blood leukocytes, ratio of granulocytes to lymphocyte numbers, macrophages? activity and antibody levels. In addition, treatment with LjTL 2937 significantly improved growth performance and productivity, and increased carcass quality. 							Conclusions: We demonstrated that the use of immunobiotics strains like LjTL 2937, as supplemental additives for piglets feedings, {{could be used as a}} strategy to maintain and improve intestinal homeostasis; that is important for the development of the pig and for health and performance throughout the productive life of the animal.
