Actor Alexis Denisof comments that Wesley and Giles come from very similar backgrounds, but have gone in different directions [...] "with the tools that they had"; he was conceived as a [...] "nemesis" [...] for Giles and Buffy. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, who wrote Wesley's first episode [...] "Bad Girls", explains, [...] "The way Faith is a reflection of Buffy, Wesley takes up a lot of the space that Giles traditionally occupies." [...] He elaborates that, because Giles is usually the [...] "stuffy guy from England who tells you to sit <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> obey the rules", introducing Wesley, who embodies those traits [...] "to the nth degree", allows Giles to become [...] "subversive" [...] and [...] "cool". Writer Jane Espenson claims that the character was intended for viewers to have antipathy towards, since he was trying to undermine Giles.|$|E

60|$|When {{they reached}} the patch of tender, sweet, young clover, Johnny Chuck would sit <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> still, {{watching}} as sharp as he knew how for the least sign of danger. When the three little stomachs were full of sweet, tender, young clover, he would proudly lead the way home again, and then as before he would sit <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> watch for danger, while the three baby Chucks sprawledout on the doorstep for a sun-nap.|$|R
60|$|Now Peter didn't {{want to hear}} it {{any more}} than Seek-Seek wanted to tell it, so while Peter squatted down comfortably, Seek-Seek sat <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> began the story.|$|R
6000|$|The girl sat <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> {{tilted her}} chin in the air. [...] "I would not wed with a walking diamond-mine," [...] she said. [...] "I {{will not have}} him." ...|$|R

50|$|The initial {{direction}} of a minimum-delta-v trajectory points halfway between <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>straight</b> toward the destination point (which is below the horizon). Again, {{this is the case}} if we ignore the earth's rotation. It is not exactly true for a rotating planet unless the launch takes place at a pole.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will do it,' {{replied the}} king; and he listened {{with all his}} might, till he judged that the white-faced horse was close to him. Then he sat <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> made ready.|$|R
60|$|It was {{tantamount}} to an avowal. Luke never flinched; he even contrived to smile. Louisa sat <b>up</b> very <b>straight,</b> <b>and</b> with an instinctive movement gave the sofa cushions a nervy shake up. But {{her eyes were}} fastened on Luke.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you help?" [...] he asked, {{stopping}} suddenly with a {{look that}} made her stand <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> strong as she answered with an eager voice: [...] "I will." ...|$|E
6000|$|So Dot set the {{hurdy-gurdy}} <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> {{turned the}} crank, {{when it began}} playing in a jerky and wheezy manner a tune called [...] "Silver Threads Among the Gold." ...|$|E

6000|$|To this {{question}} Mrs. Lecks made no answer, but sat <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> stiff, {{with her back}} square upon the speaker. For some time she and Mr. Enderton had been [...] "out," [...] and she {{made no effort to}} conceal the fact.|$|R

60|$|They {{were close}} {{to the line of}} surf now; they had passed it, indeed, a little on the left, and the boat was drifting. She stood <b>up,</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> stern, and her face, as she looked towards the land, was lit with the fire of the prophetess.|$|E
6000|$|... "To what {{experience}} do you allude, Beth?" [...] asked Uncle John, sitting <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> glancing {{from one}} to another of his two nieces.

6000|$|... "Look here," [...] she said, [...] "Lenora's {{crazy with}} the idea that Craig has done these jobs--Craig, the Professor's servant, you know.

60|$|I believe 'e {{told his}} 'ands wot I said; anyway, two bits o' coke missed me by 'arf an inch next evening, {{and for some}} weeks not one of 'em spoke a word to me. When they see me coming they just used to stand <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> twist their nose.|$|E
60|$|Peter sat <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> <b>and</b> anxiously looked {{this way}} and that way. Jimmy Skunk {{was nowhere to be seen}} and Peter gave a little sigh of relief.
