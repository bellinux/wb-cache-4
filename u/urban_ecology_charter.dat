40|$|This paper {{discusses}} some central {{theoretical and}} methodological constructs {{in the field}} of <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies,</b> identifies research gaps in the field, and uses the Victoria Laboratory of <b>Urban</b> <b>Ecologies</b> (VALUE) as a case study illustrating possible directions of future <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> research. It begins by tracing the theoretical roots of <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> before reviewing contemporary <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> studies throughout the world. Two critical gaps in <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> research are identified, suggesting opportunities for future studies. The paper then introduces the research teams and projects of VALUE – a research centre hosted by the School of Architecture and Building at Deakin University. The paper concludes that the research activities in VALUE are at the edge of <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> research due to the interdisciplinary nature of collaboration in and between project teams, which have thus been able to address gaps in <b>urban</b> <b>ecologies</b> research and make important contributions to the field...|$|R

40|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>ecology</b> has {{quickly become}} {{established}} as {{a central part of}} ecological thinking. As cities continue to grow in size and number, two questions serve to unify this broad and multidisciplinary research landscape: (1) how can <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> contribute to the science of ecology, and (2) how can <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> be applied to make cities more livable and sustainable? In spite of the advances made thus far, there are many unexplored ways of integrating the science and application of <b>urban</b> <b>ecology.</b> Although scientists assess and make predictions regarding the connections between environmental and socioeconomic processes, practitioners involved in real-world application deal with urban planning and with designing ecosystem services to improve living conditions for all urban inhabitants and to make cities more sustainable. Research in urban ecosystems can be developed from many different perspectives, and we suggest that each perspective has something to offer both society and the science of ecology. We present several research perspectives and describe how these can integrate conceptual and applied aspects to bridge the figurative gaps between trees, buildings, and people...|$|R

40|$|Citizen {{science has}} gained {{widespread}} currency {{as a tool}} for ecological research over the past decade. However, in the discipline of <b>urban</b> <b>ecology,</b> the existing contributions and future potential of citizen science engagement, specifically in terms of knowledge gain, have not yet been comprehensively explored. Here, we present a systematic review of published work on the <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> of birds and butterflies in relation to their use of citizen science data between 2005 and 2014. We compared the number of studies that used citizen science data to the number of studies that could potentially have employed data derived from citizen science. The take-up rates of citizen science data were 21 % and 26 % for birds and butterflies respectively. Most studies that employed citizen science used volunteer-derived data as primary data, and adopted Collegial, Collaborative and Contributional engagement modes to the exclusion of Contractual and Co-created arrangements. There was no evidence that citizen science studies investigated a different organismal scale (community vs. species) compared to the <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> literature. For both taxa, citizen science contributions were lower than expected compared to their representation in the <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> literature for studies on species-environment relationships at landscape and micro-environment scales, as well as behavioural ecology in general. Other research topics that could benefit from further citizen science involvement include breeding studies and guild analyses for birds, and multi-taxa studies for butterflies. Promising models of citizen science engagement for <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> are highlighted in relation to their thematic foci and methodological detail, and a number of research questions that could be productively addressed using citizen science are identified. The dynamics of contemporary engagement between citizen science and <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> described by this review could inform the design and refinement of urban ecology-citizen science programmes in order to optimise their scientific contributions...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> as a semi-bounded and permeable way of conceptualizing cities that encompasses the symbolic, material, and embodied while embracing vibrancy and affectiveness.

50|$|<b>Urban</b> <b>ecology</b> is {{a recent}} field of study {{compared}} to ecology as a whole. The methods and studies of <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> are similar to and comprise a subset of ecology. The study of <b>urban</b> <b>ecology</b> carries increasing importance because more than 50% of the world's population today lives in urban areas. At the same time, {{it is estimated that}} within the next forty years, two-thirds of the world's population will be living in expanding urban centers. The ecological processes in the urban environment are comparable to those outside the urban context. However, the types of urban habitats and the species that inhabit them are poorly documented. Often, explanations for phenomena examined in the urban setting as well as predicting changes because of urbanization are the center for scientific research.|$|R
