25|$|The Coast Guard is now {{developing}} an {{unmanned aerial vehicle}} (UAV) program that will utilize the MQ-9 Reaper platform for homeland security and search/rescue operations. To support this endeavor, the Coast Guard has partnered with the Navy and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to study existing/emerging <b>unmanned</b> <b>aerial</b> <b>system</b> (UAS) capabilities within their respective organizations. As these systems mature, research and operational experience gleaned from this joint effort will enable the Coast Guard to develop its own cutter and land-based UAS capabilities.|$|E
