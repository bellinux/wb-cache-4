The overspreading potency in utilizing the transfer funds from the central government {{is more likely to be}} higher if the regional budget is not designed effectively and efficiently to support the acceleration of regional economic activities. This study aimed at investigating the influence of <b>unconditional</b> <b>grant,</b> regional revenue, gross regional domestic product, and population density towards the regional budget in East Java Province during the implementation of fiscal decentralization.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} of a unionized economy to analyze the impact of unconditional basic income schemes on unemployment. Starting from a given level of the unemployment benefits, two reforms are envisaged : one where these benefits are replaced by a higher <b>unconditional</b> <b>grant</b> (the full basic income) and another where the income of the unemployed remains unchanged (the partial basic income). Assuming a proportional tax on earnings and a balanced budget of the State, it is shown that the equilibrium unemployment rate decreases if a partial basic income is implemented. The same conclusion holds for a sufficiently small full basic income. Basic income; unconditional grant; wage bargaining; unemployment...|$|E

A {{number of important}} officials and capitalists were granted large areas of land as reward for service; James Stirling, Charles Fremantle and Thomas Peel were all recipients of such grants. In addition, military personnel were permitted to claim land in lieu of pay, and these grants did not have conditions attached.

40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, income {{transfers}} to underprivileged groups have long been part of social welfare programmes. However, the conditionality of such grants has recently been challenged on a global scale, arguing that income grants should serve as a mechanism to redistribute national resources rather than filling the social gap, and be conceded to all members of the population. The only country that tested this kind of social policy is Namibia with its Basic Income Grant project (BIG). Ever since its launch in 2007, there has been a heated nation- and even worldwide debate concerning {{the pros and cons of}} an <b>unconditional</b> <b>grant.</b> This paper presents the results of an anthropological research, showing that in discussion on poverty reduction and the “rightful share” for the needy, the cultural factors governing decision making on the micro level have so far been neglected...|$|E
40|$|Estonian {{municipalities}} have {{to perform}} a broad range, while their fiscal resources are often limited in comparison to functions and large disparities in fiscal capacity prevail among them. Moreover, the power to regulate fiscal affairs is mostly {{in the hands of}} the central government. Municipalities do not possess satisfactory development planning perspectives. In particular municipalities in the North-East region and South Estonia have experienced considerable fiscal stress. We discuss how a strict application of the connexity principle can protect municipalities from the fiscal bottleneck. We also recommend the introduction of the principle of parallelism and investigate its effects on the down-flow grant system in Estonia. The procedure of determining the total sum of block grants needs to be changed. In most cases a high degree of parallelism applied when providing the <b>unconditional</b> <b>grant</b> via the equalization fund improves the fiscal stability and predictability of Estonian municipalities...|$|E

30|$|A {{quick note}} is to {{differentiate}} the citizens’ income idea from reforms currently underway in the MENA region. At {{the time of}} writing, Saudi Arabia was about to roll out a household cash grant system to compensate citizens for future energy price increases. 22 Different from the citizens’ income, these cash grants will a) be mean-tested and b) not be tied to public employment or other labor market reforms. While mean-testing can in principle make compensation schemes fiscally cheaper, they are administratively complex, especially in countries without an established income tax system. Mean-tested grants also create incentives against work and skill acquisition, as such benefits are lost as other sources of income improve. More generally, mean-tested benefits are less secure for individuals than an <b>unconditional</b> <b>grant</b> providing a guaranteed share in national wealth. Unconditional grants will arguably make other distributional reforms, such as public employment reforms, more widely acceptable among citizens. While conditional compensation grants are a step forward, they remain only a partial fix for the broader distortions created by HRC wealth sharing. Universal grants provide a more comprehensive reform option.|$|E
40|$|Aims - Characteristics of {{patients}} living in residential care facilities {{and the availability}} of mental hospital- and residential beds in Italy and The Netherlands were compared to assess whether differences in the process of deinstitutionalisation have influenced the composition of their residential patient populations. Methods - Data from the Dutch UTOPIA-study (UTilization & Outcome of Patients In the Association of Dutch residential care providers) and the Italian PROGRES-study were used. Results - Dutch residents were more likely to suffer from substance or alcohol abuse than Italian residents. The latter were more likely to suffer from schizophrenia or a related disorder, less likely to have experienced mental hospital admissions and showed an overall shorter duration of stay in residential care facilities. Contrary to our expectations Dutch residents, who still have good access to long stay beds in mental hospitals, are not less disabled than Italian residents. Finally, the number of beds in residential care facilities per 10, 000 inhabitants in the Netherlands is twice (6) as high as in Italy (3). Conclusions - The Italian and Dutch deinstitutionalisation processes have resulted in a different availability in the number of residential beds. However, it did not influence the overall level of functioning of both residential populations. Declaration of interest: An <b>unconditional</b> <b>grant</b> was received from the Alliance of the 22 Dutch independent residential care providers...|$|E
30|$|A second form of cash {{transfer}} program with an explicit work focus comes from grants made to potential or existing small business owners, {{with the goal}} of getting individuals to start firms, or to invest in growing their firms to earn higher profits and increase survival. 15 Fafchamps et al. (2014) and McKenzie (2017 b) note that an <b>unconditional</b> <b>grant</b> given to a firm owner facing no liquidity constraints would be predicted to have no effect on these business outcomes, only make the owner richer. Yet, in practice, one-time {{cash transfer}}s of $ 100 to $ 200 given to existing firms have led to higher firm profits in Mexico (McKenzie and Woodruff 2008), Sri Lanka (de Mel et al. 2008), Ghana (Fafchamps et al. 2014), and India (Hussam et al. 2017) with returns to capital of 5 % per month or more. 16 There is some evidence that conditionality matters: in Ghana the impact on firm profits is larger when transfers are given conditional on investing in the firm than when they are unconditional grants. The impacts also vary with gender, being strongly positive for males, and no average impact seen on businesses run by females. 17 These grants also result in the owners working more hours in these firms, in part because the firms are more likely to survive over time due to an insurance role played by the grants (De Mel et al. 2012). Grants averaging $ 382 to youth in Uganda to start-up firms, conditional on them forming groups and putting together a business plan, resulted in a 17 % increase in work hours and 38 % increase in earnings (Blattman et al. 2014).|$|E
