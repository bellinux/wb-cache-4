40|$|Results of the {{toxicological}} studies of working conditions, general and professional morbidity, and complex examinations {{carried out on}} workers engaged {{in the production of}} polyamides, polyacrylonitrile fibers, polyester fibers and poly (vinyl chloride) resin, <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>glue,</b> glass fibre materials and polyurethane resins are given. An extremely high occupational hazard for workers in the production of poly (vinyl chloride) resin and porous materials from polyurethane resins and <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>glue</b> has been established. Cases of vinyl chloride disease, poisoning from formaldehyde, isocyanates, and styrene were noted. Prophylactic measures were taken in Bulgaria to lessen the occupational hazard in the productions as set forth included limitation of the work day to 6 hr, free food, additional bonus and leave, and annual physical examinations of workers...|$|E
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>glue</b> and veneered bolstering on technological operation veneering on quantity of emission VOCs (volatile organic compounds). The so-called Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) are among the largest pollution sources of both {{the internal and external}} environments. VOC is defined as emission of any organic compound or a mixture thereof, with the exception of methane, whereby the compound exerts the pressure of 0. 01 kPa or more at the temperature of 20 °C (293. 15 K) and reaches the corresponding volatility under the specific conditions of its use and can undergo photochemical reactions with nitrogen oxides when exposed to solar radiation. The effects of VOC upon environment can be described by equation:VOC + NOx + UV radiation + heat = tropospheric ozone (O 3). In this work there were tested background working environment in various parts of multi-storeyed press, next was judged emissive charge of veneered device and used glue. We used surface material such as chipboard. We used <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>glue</b> KRONOCOL U 300 on technological operation veneering. The VOC emissions from the wooden surfaces with or without finishing were tested in the Equipment for VOC Measuring with a small-space chamber. This equipment was installed in and made available by the Institute of Furniture, Design and Habitation. The small-space chamber is suitable for testing small parts of wood products. The device equipped with small-chamber satisfies all conditions mandated in the standard ENV 13 419 DIN -V-ENV 13 419 ”Determination of the emissions of Volatile organic compounds”. The VOC emissions were collected in columns with sorbent Tenax TA. We analyzed the columns with the VOC emissions by: the gas chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometer and Direct Thermal Desorption...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} demands concerning formaldehyde content in/emission from parti-cleboards force search after alternative {{bonding agents}}. One of such bonding agents can be polivinyloacetate (PVAc) glue. Unfortunately its high viscosity {{makes it difficult}} to apply the glue using methods for <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>glues.</b> The viscosity change as dry mass decreases can be the reason for low strength of particleboards produced with such glue. The results show that bending strength and internal bond strength of particleboards produced with the use of PVAc glue is lower than for panels produced with the use of UF resin...|$|R
50|$|Controversy exists over {{agricultural}} and manufacturing {{issues related to}} the production of bamboo floors, including the environmental effects of deforestation in order to plant bamboo and the use of carcinogenic chemicals such as <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> in the <b>glues</b> used for lamination in some products.|$|R
40|$|<b>Urea-formaldehyde</b> (UF) <b>glue</b> resins {{were the}} most {{important}} type of adhesives in the wood industry last 60 years, especially for the production of wood based panels. More convenient spray dried UF powders went into use last two decades. Small and medium private wood processing plants in Serbia prefer to use such powder adhesives, since they are more convenient for small capacity production. There is no production of UF powder resin in Serbia so necessary quantities are imported from abroad including producers from Asia. However, their characteristics are variable, dependent on syntheses steps and not well known among users. Objective of this research was to determine conveniences and lacks in application of two imported UF powder resins in comparison to domestic UF emulsion...|$|R
40|$|What is {{formaldehyde}} {{and where}} is it found? Formaldehyde is a chemical that is used widely across many products in our environment. It {{would be difficult to}} list all the possible sources of formaldehyde; the table below shows some of the more common sources of formaldehyde exposure. Sources of formaldehyde Fabrics treated with formaldehyde resins and in which some free formaldehyde remains. Formaldehyde resins provide the unique qualities of the following fabrics: Permanent press Anti-cling, anti-static, anti-wrinkle and anti-shrink finishes Chlorine-resistant finishes Stiffening on lightweight nylon knits Waterproof finishes Perspiration proof finishes Moth proof and mildew resistant finishes Suede and chamois Cosmetics and toiletries including fingernail polishers and hardeners, antiperspirants, makeup, bubble bath, bath oils, shampoos, creams, mouthwashes and deodorants. In many cases formaldehyde is used as a preservative. Household cleansers, disinfectants and polishes Paper products — formaldehyde is used to improve the water resistance, grease resistance, shrink resistance and other characteristics of paper Building materials — <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>glue</b> or adhesive is used in pressed wood products such as particle board, plywood and MDF Medications including wart remedies, anhidrotics, medicated creams, orthopaedic casts and root canal preparation disinfectant Paints, primers and paint-stripping agents Embalming fluid and as a preservative for laboratory specimens Formaldehyde is released in the smoke from burning wood, coal, charcoal, cigarettes, natural gas and kerosene What are the reactions to formaldehyde allergy? Reactions to formaldehyde depend on the type of exposure that has occurred. Formaldehyde is not only a sensitiser but also a potent primary irritant. Exposure to formaldehyde gas may cause burning sensations in the eye, nose and throat, skin rashes, tightness of the chest and wheezing, fatigue and headaches. These symptoms may be a result of a primary irritant effect or an allergic sensitisation to formaldehyde...|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the term}} MDF {{has become a}} generic name for any dry process fibre board. MDF is {{typically}} made up of 82% wood fibre, 9% <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> resin <b>glue,</b> 8% water and 1% paraffin wax. and the density is typically between 500 kg/m3 (31 lb/ft3) and 1,000 kg/m3 (62 lb/ft3). The range of density and classification as light, standard, or high density board is a misnomer and confusing. The density of the board, when evaluated {{in relation to the}} density of the fibre that goes into making the panel, is important. A thick MDF panel at a density of 700-720 kg/m3 may be considered as high density in the case of softwood fibre panels, whereas a panel of the same density made of hard wood fibres is not regarded as so. The evolution of the various types of MDF has been driven by differing need for specific applications.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} thermophilic, {{able to grow}} at high {{temperatures}} as high as 50-60 °C. It can withstand brief exposures of up to 15 min at 80-100 °C. Accordingly, it typically causes spoilage of food products following pasteurization or other heat-treatments (e.g., curry sauces, fruit juices). It also has been reported as a contaminant in salami and margarine. The fungus is known {{from a number of}} non-food items including compost, rubber, <b>glue,</b> <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> foam insulation and creosote-treated wooden poles. The combination of its ability to survive significant heat stress and its ability to break-down aromatic hydrocarbons has led to interest in P. variotii as a potential candidate organism to assist in bioremediation.|$|R
40|$|This {{publication}} covers experimental investigations {{made at the}} Division of Forest Products, Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Melbourne, {{during the}} period December, 1940, to January, 1946, {{to determine the effect}} of temperature on the strength of wood, plywood and glued joints. The investigations deal with reversible changes in_ strength, elasticity, and the like which may accompany variations in the temperature of the material. Results show that all properties investigated are affected by temperature at some moisture content, in many instances {{to such an extent that}} serious error is introduced in mechanical testing and in design where this factor is not taken into account. Temperature coefficients may exceed one per cent of the value at 20 ° C. per degree centigrade. Relations are given from which the effect of temperature on certain properties of a species can be estimated quantitatively with considerable confidence for a wide range of temperatures and moisture contents. PART I. deals with compression, bending, and toughness tests on Sitka spruce and five Australian species at nominal moisture contents of 8, 12, and 20 per cent. in the range - 20 to + 60 ° C. Compression tests on these species were extended to zero moisture content and near saturation, in respective ranges of - 20 to + 90 ° C. and - 20 to + 60 ° C. In addition, two low density species were included in the compression tests. Two species were also examined in bending at zero moisture content from - 20 to + 80 ° C. PART II. covers tests made at 15 per cent. nominal moisture content on standard size hoop pine specimens in compression and shear from zero to 40 ° C. and in bending at 20 and 40 ° C., also on 2 in. X 3 / 4 in. X 3 / 4 in. specimens of the same species in compression from - 20 to + 60 ° C. PART III. describes tests on hoop pine plywood. At nominal moisture contents of 8, 12, and 20 per cent., tensile and crushing strengths were examined from - 20 to + 80 ° C. Investigation of crushing strength was extended to include zero moisture content. Modulus of elasticity was examined at all the above moisture contents, but only from - 20 to + 60 ° C. PART IV. discusses tests on casein, pheno-formaldehyde and <b>urea-formaldehyde</b> <b>glued</b> joints at temperatures from - 15 to + 60 ° C. in the range 8 to 20 per cent moisture content. PART V. summarizes the more important features of the investigations in general terms and gives results of independent confirmatory tests...|$|R
