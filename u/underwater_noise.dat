5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. They can cause injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. <b>Underwater</b> <b>noise</b> is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
5|$|<b>Underwater</b> <b>noise</b> from shipping, drilling, {{and other}} human {{activities}} is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress the whales and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur seals and brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are {{near the top of}} food chains and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and <b>underwater</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|E

The main task of proposed solution is to classify the objects which made the <b>underwater</b> <b>noises.</b> From the technique of neural network the Kohonen networks which belongs to group of self organizing networks where chosen to solve the research problem.

25|$|In October 2017, it was {{reported}} that <b>underwater</b> <b>noise</b> pollution can affect oysters as they close their shells when exposed to low frequencies of sounds in experimental conditions. Oysters rely on hearing waves and currents to regulate their circadian rhythms, and perception of weather events—such as rain—may induce spawning. Cargo ships, pile drivers, and explosions conducted underwater produce low frequencies that may be detected by oysters.|$|E
25|$|Noise from {{ships and}} human {{activity}} can damage Cnidarians and Ctenophora, {{which are very}} important organisms in the marine ecosystem. They promote high diversity and they are used as models for ecology and biology because of their simple structures. When there is <b>underwater</b> <b>noise,</b> the vibrations in the water damage the cilia hairs in the Coelenterates. In a study, the organisms were exposed to sound waves for different numbers of times and {{the results showed that}} damaged hair cells were extruded or missing or presented bent, flaccid or missed kinocilia and stereocilia.|$|E

Next, taking the pulsant source as the radiant source, the <b>underwater</b> radiated <b>noise</b> of the waterjet was numerically predicted by the one-step boundary element method.

40|$|A {{major source}} of the <b>underwater</b> {{radiated}} <b>noise</b> from ships is represented by propulsion systems and by propellers in particular. The main noise-generating mechanism within ship propellers is cavitation, associated to the growing and collapse of vapour bubbles resulting from the unsteady hydrodynamic pressure field generated on the blades. The control of propeller <b>underwater</b> radiated <b>noise</b> is therefore strictly related to the control of cavitation phenomena, which are responsible for a larger part of the radiation. The activity within work package 2 of the collaborative project AQUO (Achieve QUiter Oceans by shipping noise footprint reduction, www. aquo. eu) of the 7 th FP of the EU focuses on this aspect, which is analysed both from the experimental and numerical viewpoint.
