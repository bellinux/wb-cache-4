25|$|Delays in the 1954 {{interceptor}} project led to {{demands for}} an interim interceptor aircraft design, {{a role that}} was eventually won by the B model of the Voodoo. This required extensive modifications to add a large radar to {{the nose of the}} aircraft, a second crewmember to operate it, and a new weapons bay using a rotating door that kept its four AIM-4 Falcon missiles or two AIR-2 Genie rockets hidden within the airframe <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to be fired. The F-101B entered service with Air Defense Command in 1959 and the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1961. US examples were handed off to the Air National Guard where they served until 1982. Canadian examples remained in service until 1984.|$|E

[...] They met at a private dinner held at the home of their mutual friend the artist Brett-Livingstone Strong. Knowing that Presley had been looking for help within the music industry, Strong had her play tapes for Jackson, who was impressed with Presley's voice. The pair talked {{for the remainder of the}} night, <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for Jackson to leave. At this point, according to Strong, the entertainer gave Presley, who was still married at the time, a penetrating look and said in a conspiratorial voice, [...] "You and me, we could get into a lot of trouble. Think about that, girl." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{moving to}} Washington, the Hobarts {{established}} {{themselves at the}} Arlington Hotel, which was the Washington home to many political men of the era, including Hanna. Soon, however, Pennsylvania Senator Don Cameron offered them the lease of the house he owned at 21 Madison Place, diagonally across Pennsylvania Avenue from the Executive Mansion (as the White House was still formally known). The asking price was $10,000 per year; the Vice President bargained Cameron down to $8,000 (equal to the vice presidential salary) by suggesting that the public might assume he stole the excess. Among the frequent visitors at {{what came to be}} known as the [...] "Cream White House" [...] was Hanna, by then a senator, who would come by for breakfast and talk with the Vice President <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for both to go to the Senate.|$|E

500|$|On January 28, 1970, a {{third and}} final Band of Gypsys {{appearance}} took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the [...] "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: [...] " [...] came in with his head down, {{sat on the couch}} alone, and put his head in his hands... He didn't move <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for the show." [...] Minutes after taking the stage he snapped a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for [...] "Foxy Lady". He then began playing [...] "Earth Blues" [...] before telling the audience: [...] "That's what happens when earth fucks with space". Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.|$|E
500|$|Bilinda Butcher's vocals {{have been}} {{referred}} to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine's sound, alongside Shields' guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn't Anything and Loveless, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said [...] "influenced [...] sound" [...] by making them [...] "more dreamy and sleepy". The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine's recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument. Critics have often described an androgynous sound to the band's vocals. My Bloody Valentine's lyrics are mostly written by Shields. However, Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both Isn't Anything and Loveless, but has referred {{to a lot of the}} lyrics as [...] "plain nonsense." [...] According to Butcher, she [...] "didn't have a plan and never thought about lyrics <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> to write them. I just used whatever was in my head for the moment." [...] Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to interpret rough versions of songs Shields had recorded. Butcher has said: [...] "He [...] never sang any words on the cassettes I got but I tried to make his sounds into words." [...] Butcher and Shields would often spend eight to ten hours a night writing lyrics, even though few changes actually resulted, as Shields believed [...] "there's nothing worse than bad lyrics." [...] Spin writer Simon Reynolds has noted that the band's lyrics often contain sexual themes, which are [...] "a paradoxical blend of force and tenderness".|$|E
2500|$|Wittgenstein {{wanted to}} study with Frege, but Frege {{suggested}} he attend the University of Cambridge to study under Russell, so on 18 October 1911 Wittgenstein arrived unannounced at Russell's rooms in Trinity College. Russell was having tea with C. K. Ogden, when, according to Russell, [...] "an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but refusing to speak German. He {{turned out to be}} a man who had learned engineering at Charlottenburg, but during this course had acquired, by himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics & has now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me." [...] He was soon not only attending Russell's lectures, but dominating them. The lectures were poorly attended and Russell often found himself lecturing only to C. D. Broad, E. H. Neville, and H. T. J. Norton. Wittgenstein started following him after lectures back to his rooms to discuss more philosophy, <b>until</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>time</b> for the evening meal in Hall. Russell grew irritated; he wrote to his lover Lady Ottoline Morrell: [...] "My German friend threatens to be an infliction." ...|$|E
