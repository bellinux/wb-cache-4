5000|$|Overturning the {{scholarly}} conventional wisdom, however, the current preponderant power seems to render inoperative the counterbalancing long central to research in international relations. By {{the preponderance of}} American power {{and the absence of}} balance of power William Wohlforth explains the peacefulness and stability of the present world order. No distribution of power rules out war. [...] "The greater the preponderance of power, however, the more extreme the values of other variables must be to produce war ..." [...] Campbell Craig believes that [...] "Power Preponderance theory" [...] will become one of the dominant American IR schools of the post-Cold War era: ...Power Preponderance is going to replace balance-of-power neorealism and become the dominant brand of American Realism for the foreseeable future. Unipolarity is too central of a problem for neorealism to finesse, especially as confident predictions of its early demise have been proven wrong and the gap between the US and other rivals continues to grow. [...] Expecting anti-American balancing, Waltz drew a much-cited analogy: [...] "As nature abhors vacuum, so international politics abhors unbalanced power." [...] Craig paraphrased: Theory abhors an explanatory vacuum, and Power Preponderance is filling it. The essence of Power Preponderance is its claim that would-be rivals have strong incentives to accept the status quo of American primacy rather than to attempt to overturn the unipolar order… The argument … distinguishes itself from deterministic claims made by some structural realists that a balance of power is certain to recur...

40|$|Master data {{refers to}} core {{business}} entities a company <b>uses</b> <b>repeatedly</b> across many business processes and systems (such as lists or hierarchies of customers, suppliers, accounts, products, or organizational units). Product information {{is the most}} important kind of master data and product information management (PIM) is becoming critical for modern enterprises because it provides a rich business context for various applications. Existing PIM systems are less flexible and scalable for on-demand business, as well as too weak to completely capture and use the semantics of master data. This paper explores how to use semantic web technologies to enhance a collaborative PIM system by simplifying modeling and representation while preserving enough dynamic flexibility. Furthermore, we build a semantic PIM system using one of the state-of-art ontology repositories and summarize the challenges we encountered based on our experimental results, especially on performance and scalability. We believe that our study and experiences are valuable for both semantic web community and master data management community...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Taking {{customer}} data as an example, {{the paper}} presents {{an approach to}} enhance the management of enterprise data by using Semantic Web technologies. Customer data {{is the most important}} kind of core business entity a company <b>uses</b> <b>repeatedly</b> across many business processes and systems, and customer data management (CDM) is becoming critical for enterprises because it keeps a single, complete and accurate record of customers across the enterprise. Existing CDM systems focus on integrating customer data from all customer-facing channels and front and back office systems through multiple interfaces, as well as publishing customer data to different applications. To make the effective use of the CDM system, this paper investigates semantic query and analysis over the integrated and centralized customer data, enabling automatic classification and relationship discovery. We have implemented these features over IBM Websphere Customer Center, and shown the prototype to our clients. We believe that our study and experiences are valuable for both Semantic Web community and data management community...|$|E

Currently, {{there is no}} valid alternative to CD 4 count testing for monitoring immunologic responses to treatment, but laboratory cost and capacity limit access to CD 4 testing in resource-constrained settings. Thus, methods to prioritize patients for CD 4 count testing could improve treatment monitoring by optimizing resource allocation. Methods and Findings: Using a prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients (n = 1, 956) monitored upon antiretroviral therapy initiation in seven clinical sites with distinct geographical and socio-economic settings, we retrospectively apply a novel prediction-based classification (PBC) modeling method. The model <b>uses</b> <b>repeatedly</b> measured biomarkers (white blood cell count and lymphocyte percent) to predict CD 4 + T cell outcome through first-stage modeling and subsequent classification based on clinically relevant thresholds (CD 4 + T cell count of 200 or 350 cells/ml). The algorithm correctly classified 90 % (cross-validation estimate = 91. 5 %, standard deviation [SD] = 4. 5 %) of CD 4 count measurements, 200 cells/ml {{in the first year}} of follow-up; if laboratory testing is applied only to patients predicted to be below the 200 -cells/ml threshold...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of the ontological position on which Hans-Georg Gadamer’s views rely, and of {{its relationship to the}} views of Heidegger, Plato and Hegel. I argue that Gadamer’s notion of being appeals to a structure he <b>uses</b> <b>repeatedly</b> in other areas of his philosophy in which the communal participation of many finite individuals creates an essential entity that surpasses the sum of their input and is then regulative of their participation in it. I demonstrate first that he advocates something more than an empiricism based on our finite faculties, then that his account of textuality involves an appeal to an ideal ‘text itself’ that is beyond our reach, and finally that this structure is extended to language and this this extension is seen as the basis of all being. His idea of a reality that can guide our conversations towards truth is embodied in what he calls the ‘one word’ or ‘logos’: I argue that this takes the place of Hegel’s ‘Absolute Spirit’, but is mixed with the later Heidegger’s ideas about a clearing in being {{in such a way that}} it no longer completely transcends intersubjective dialogue. Gadamer preserves the metaphysical edifices that Plato and Hegel associated with ‘dialectic’, but denies that they require an ontological commitment to anything beyond Heidegger’s being-in-the-world. Thus being in the world itself must ultimately depend on our participating in dialogue and in society, and will alter as different numbers of people develop cultivated practical rationality. I argue that this resting of ontology on an ethical requirement demonstrates that the original extension of the structure Gadamer detects in language and textuality to being itself is highly implausible, and that this casts many doubts on his use of the same structure in other areas. I conclude by looking at the way in which this same structure he detects in language allows him conveniently to side-step criticism, but maintain that it nonetheless contains valuable insights into the workings of language that are missing from other accounts...|$|E

Using a prospective cohort of HIV-infected patients (n= 1, 956) monitored upon antiretroviral therapy initiation in seven clinical sites with distinct geographical and socio-economic settings, we retrospectively apply a novel prediction-based classification (PBC) modeling method. The model <b>uses</b> <b>repeatedly</b> measured biomarkers (white blood cell count and lymphocyte percent) to predict CD 4 (+) T cell outcome through first-stage modeling and subsequent classification based on clinically relevant thresholds (CD 4 (+) T cell count of 200 or 350 cells/µl). The algorithm correctly classified 90 % (cross-validation estimate= 91. 5 %, standard deviation [SD]= 4. 5 %) of CD 4 count measurements < 200 cells/µl {{in the first year}} of follow-up; if laboratory testing is applied only to patients predicted to be below the 200 -cells/µl threshold, we estimate a potential savings of 54. 3 % (SD= 4. 2 %) in CD 4 testing capacity. A capacity savings of 34 % (SD= 3. 9 %) is predicted using a CD 4 threshold of 350 cells/µl. Similar results were obtained over the 3 y of follow-up available (n= 619). Limitations include a need for future economic healthcare outcome analysis, a need for assessment of extensibility beyond the 3 -y observation time, and the need to assign a false positive threshold. Our results support the use of PBC modeling as a triage point at the laboratory, lessening the need for laboratory-based CD 4 (+) T cell count testing; implementation of this tool could help optimize the use of laboratory resources, directing CD 4 testing towards higher-risk patients. However, further prospective studies and economic analyses are needed to demonstrate that the PBC model can be effectively applied in clinical settings.
