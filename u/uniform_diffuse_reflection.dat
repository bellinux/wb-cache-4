The model {{is based on}} physical optics and describes specular, directional diffuse, and <b>uniform</b> <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> by a surface. The reflected light pattern depends on wavelength, incidence angle, two surface roughness parameters. and surface refractive index. The formulation is self consistent in terms of polarization, surface roughness, maskin@hadowing, and energy. The model applies {{to a wide range}} of materials and surface finishes and provides a smooth transition from diffuse-like to specular reflection as the wavelength and incidence angle are increased or the surface roughness is decreased. The model is analytic and suitable for Computer Graphics applications. Predicted reflectance distributions compare favorably with experiment. The model is applied to metallic, nonmetallic, and plastic materials, with smooth and rough surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Let s be {{a source}} point and t be a {{destination}} point inside an n-vertex simple polygon P. Euclidean shortest paths and minimum-link paths between s and t inside P have been well studied. Both these kinds of paths are simple and piecewise-convex. However, computing optimal paths {{in the context of}} <b>diffuse</b> or specular <b>reflections</b> {{does not seem to be}} an easy task. A path from a light source s to t inside P is called a <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path if the turning points of the path lie in the interiors of the boundary edges of P. A <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path is said to be optimal if it has the minimum number of turning points amongst all <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths between s and t. The minimum <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path may not be simple. The problem of computing the minimum <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path in low degree polynomial time has remained open. In our quest for understanding the geometric structure of the minimum <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths vis-a-vis shortest paths and minimum link paths, we define a new kind of <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path called a constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path where (i) the path is simple, (ii) it intersects only the eaves of the Euclidean shortest path between s and t, and (iii) it intersects each eave exactly once. For computing a minimum constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path from s to t, we present an O(n(n+β)) time algorithm, where β =Θ (n^ 2) in the worst case. Here, β depends on the shape of the polygon. We also establish some properties relating minimum constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths and minimum <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths. Constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths introduced in this paper provide new geometric insights into the hitherto unknown structures and shapes of optimal reflection paths...|$|R
50|$|Reflected {{light can}} be divided into two sub-types, {{specular}} <b>reflection</b> and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> Specular reflection reflects all light which arrives from a given direction at the same angle, whereas <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> reflects that light in a broad range of directions. An example of the distinction between specular and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> would be glossy and matte paints. Matte paints have almost exclusively <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection,</b> while glossy paints have both specular and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> A surface built from a non-absorbing powder, such as plaster, can be a nearly perfect diffuser, whereas polished metallic objects can specularly reflect light very efficiently. The reflecting material of mirrors is usually aluminum or silver.|$|R
40|$|Let s be a {{point source}} of light inside a simple polygon P of n vertices. A path from s to some point t inside P is called a <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path if the turning points of the path lie in the {{interiors}} of the boundary edges of P. A <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path {{is said to be}} optimal if it has the minimum number of turning points amongst all <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths between s and t. A <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path between s and t inside P is said to be constrained if the path is simple and it intersects only the eaves of the Euclidean shortest path between s and t. For computing a constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path from s to t having the minimum number of turns amongst all such paths, we present an O(n 22 e) time algorithm, where e ≥ 0 is the number of eaves. The exponential factor in the running time can be removed by computing a longer path that may require two more additional turns per eave. The constrained <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path computed by our algorithm has at most c times the number of turns in the optimal <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path, where 2 ≤ c ≤ 4. ...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> - Generally, when light {{strikes the}} surface of a (non-metallic and non-glassy) solid material, it bounces off in all {{directions}} due to multiple reflections by the microscopic irregularities inside the material (e.g., the grain boundaries of a polycrystalline material, or the cell or fiber boundaries of an organic material), and by its surface, if it is rough. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> is typically characterized by omni-directional reflection angles.

25|$|Reflections can {{be divided}} into two types: {{specular}} <b>reflection</b> and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b> Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, which reflect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for production of reflected images that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location in space. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exact distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed from any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection.</b>|$|R

A {{polygonal}} path from s to some point t inside P is called a <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path if the turning points of the path lie on polygonal edges of P. We present three different algorithms for computing <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> paths from s to t inside P. For constructing such a path, the first algorithm uses a greedy method, the second algorithm uses a transformation of a minimum link path, and the third algorithm uses the edge-edge visibility graph of P. The first two algorithms are for polygons without holes, and they run in O(n + k log n) time, where k denotes the number of reflections in the path. The third algorithm is for both polygons with or without holes, and it runs in O(n 2) time. The number of reflections in the path produced by this algorithm can be at most 3 times that of an optimal <b>diffuse</b> <b>reflection</b> path.
