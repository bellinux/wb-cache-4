5|$|In {{addition}} to the explanation by the women {{that they had been}} caught <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> is now called a time slip and had observed ghosts from the past, a non-supernatural explanation of the events was proposed by Philippe Jullian in his 1965 biography of the aristocratic decadent French poet Robert de Montesquiou. At the time of Moberly and Jourdain's excursion to Versailles, Montesquiou lived nearby and reportedly gave parties in the grounds where his friends dressed in period costume and performed tableaux vivants as part of the party entertainments. Moberly and Jourdain may have inadvertently gatecrashed a gay fancy dress party. The Marie-Antoinette figure could have been a society lady or a cross-dresser, the pockmarked man Montesquiou himself. It was suggested that a gathering of the French decadent avant-garde of the time could have made a sinister impression on the two middle-class Edwardian spinsters who would have been little used to such company.|$|E
5|$|In season three, George's father, Harold O'Malley (George Dzundza), is {{diagnosed}} with cancer and dies, with his wife Louise (Debra Monk) and George's brothers Jerry (Greg Pitts) and Ronny (Tim Griffin) by his side. Louise goes on to appear occasionally, and was last seen in season eight. A ferryboat accident brings along Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), who is initially introduced as a pregnant Jane Doe victim, suffering from amnesia. Pope eventually embarks on a relationship with Karev, until she {{is diagnosed}} with a personality disorder in season four, and makes her final departure. Amidst {{the crisis of the}} ferryboat crash, Meredith falls into the water at the disaster site. Although rescued, she goes into cardiac arrest, waking <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> appears to be limbo. Within the limbo, Meredith is entertained by deceased acquaintances Duquette and Dylan Young (Kyle Chandler), who was killed during a bomb crisis in the second season, until eventually being resuscitated. Seeking a cure to her depression, Meredith undergoes therapy sessions with the hospital psychiatrist, Dr. Katharine Wyatt (Amy Madigan), who in addition, serves as a psychiatrist to Hunt.|$|E

Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family away into The Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E

25|$|Compton {{was born}} and brought <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> was then the urban {{district}} of Hendon, which later became part of Greater London. He was the second son and youngest child of Henry Ernest Compton and Jessie Anne Duthie; he had one older brother, Leslie Harry (born 1912) and one older sister, Hilda (born 1913). He was educated at Bell Lane Primary School and joined the MCC ground staff at Lord's Cricket Ground {{at the age of}} 15. The previous summer he had begun {{to make a name for}} himself when, at that same venue, he scored 114 as captain of an Elementary Schools XI, impressing Test selector Sir Pelham Warner. By the late 1930s, Compton was one of England's finest batsmen, and remained at the top of his profession for some twenty years. His dashing approach to batting and the sheer enjoyment he exuded endeared him to a generation of cricket lovers. As an all-rounder Compton was a right-hand bat and a slow left-arm Chinaman bowler.|$|E

His father was a lawyer, and his maternal grandfather was Peleg Wadsworth, a general in the American Revolutionary War and a Member of Congress. He was named after his mother's brother Henry Wadsworth, a Navy lieutenant who had died three years earlier at the Battle of Tripoli. He was the second of eight children; his siblings were Stephen (1805), Elizabeth (1808), Anne (1810), Alexander (1814), Mary (1816), Ellen (1818), and Samuel (1819).|$|E

500|$|The Earth and its Moon are {{one example}} of this configuration. Today, the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth; one of its {{revolutions}} around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually. In about 50billion years, if they survive the Sun's expansion, the Earth and Moon will become tidally locked to each other; each will be caught <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> is called a [...] "spin–orbit resonance" [...] in which the Moon will circle the Earth in about 47 days and both Moon and Earth will rotate around their axes in the same time, each only visible from one hemisphere of the other. Other examples are the Galilean moons of Jupiter (as well as many of Jupiter's smaller moons) {{and most of the}} larger moons of Saturn.|$|E
500|$|Despite the band's {{annoyance}} {{at having}} {{so little time}} to prepare, the Kingsmen walked into the recording studio on April 6 at 10:00am. In order {{to sound like a}} live performance, the group's equipment was arranged such that Ely was forced to lean back and sing into a boom microphone suspended high above the floor. [...] "It was more yelling than singing," [...] Ely said, [...] "'cause I was trying to be heard over all the instruments." [...] In addition, he was wearing braces {{at the time of the}} performance, further compounding his infamously slurred words. Ely sang the beginning of the third verse a few bars too early, but realized his mistake and waited for the rest of the band to catch <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> <b>what</b> was thought to be a warm-up, the song was recorded in its first and only take. The Kingsmen were not proud of the version, but their manager liked the rawness of their cover. The B-side was [...] "Haunted Castle", composed by Ely and Don Gallucci, the new keyboardist. However, credit was given to Lynn Easton on both the Jerden and Wand labels. [...] The entire session cost $50, and the band split the difference.|$|E
500|$|As an {{only child}} growing <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> were, in all but name, palaces, her {{childhood}} {{appears to have been}} quite lonely. She was a companion to her hypochondriac mother and, in later life, a hostess with her father during her mother's long periods of indisposition. She was indulged by both parents and her formal education was neglected in favour of music and singing lessons, subjects in which she was accomplished. Her parents were very protective of her, attempting to ensure that she was never exposed to the risk of sickness or even the sight of poverty. As a result, she was never allowed to enter the cottages on the Rothschilds' estates. A cousin, who seems to have disliked her, claims that Hannah was so sheltered that the phrase [...] "the poor" [...] was just a meaningless euphemism to her. This is likely to be an exaggeration, as from her teens onwards she used much of her fortune to improve the lot of the poor, in housing and education. Whatever the faults of her education, she possessed great confidence, impressing her Rothschild relations, who noted her poise and competence when she hosted a large house party at Mentmore for the Prince of Wales while only 17 years of age.|$|E

500|$|At {{this point}} the King's own {{position}} {{in relation to the}} law, and his authority to decide this matter, was brought <b>up,</b> <b>in</b> <b>what</b> became known as the Case of Prohibitions. James stated that [...] "In cases where there is not express authority in law, the King may himself decide in his royal person; the Judges are but delegates of the King". Coke challenged this, saying [...] "the King in his own person cannot adjudge any case, either criminal - as treason, felony etc, or betwixt party and party; but this ought to be determined and adjudged in some court of justice, according to the Law and Custom of England". Coke further stated that [...] "The common law protecteth the King", to which James replied [...] "The King protecteth the law, and not the law the King! The King maketh judges and bishops. If the judges interpret the laws themselves and suffer none else to interpret, they may easily make, of the laws, shipmen's hose!". Coke rejected this, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he had no right to interpret it; he pointed out that such knowledge [...] "demanded mastery of an artificial reason... which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the cognizance of it". Victorious, Coke freely left, and continued to issue writs of prohibition against the High Commission.|$|E
