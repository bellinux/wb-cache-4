5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work. This work was intended {{merely as a}} preview of his three-volume Das Kapital (English title: Capital: Critique of Political Economy), which he intended to publish at a later date. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between <b>use</b> <b>value</b> and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between <b>use</b> <b>value</b> and value. The reasoning Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between <b>use</b> <b>value</b> and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E

25|$|In Marx's {{critique}} of political economy, any labor-product has a value and a <b>use</b> <b>value,</b> {{and if it}} is traded as a commodity in markets, it additionally has an exchange value, most often expressed as a money-price. Marx acknowledges that commodities being traded also have a general utility, implied by the fact that people want them, but he argues that this by itself tells us nothing about the specific character of the economy in which they are produced and sold.|$|E

However, when the difference between total and <b>use</b> <b>values</b> calculated from willingness-to-pay measures is compared to the {{point allocation}}s, there {{does not appear to}} be a consistent relationship between use and nonuse values; that is, option value cannot clearly be defined as either use or nonuse...|$|R

2500|$|Money is {{historically}} an emergent market phenomenon establishing a commodity money, but nearly all contemporary money systems {{are based on}} fiat money.

2500|$|In {{a number}} of texts, {{beginning}} in the early 1980s, Barber has considered the potential for performance work to avoid its ossification into a genre category. [...] Clearly, the type of conceptual performance art that was common in the late sixties and early seventies had run its course. [...] While emerging forms of postmodern performance were appropriating mainstream forms of entertainment, their critical function was often weakened or altogether abandoned. [...] Performance could possibly withstand becoming affirmative culture (Herbert Marcuse) by rediscovering its sources in avant-garde theatre. [...] Bertolt Brecht, for instance, echoed Karl Marx's critique of philosophy when he wrote: [...] "The theatre became an affair for philosophers, but only for those philosophers as wished not just to explain the world, but also to change it." [...] Brecht coined the term umfunctionierung (functional transformation) to enable theatre to become an instrument to serve the interests of class struggle. [...] And in his famous essay, [...] "The Author as Producer," [...] Walter Benjamin extolled the virtues of the [...] "operative" [...] artist, providing as his example the communist author Sergei Tretyakov, who thought of his work not merely as descriptive reporting on reality, but an active intervention. [...] Benjamin believed that cultural practice should refuse modish commerce and should give work a revolutionary <b>use</b> <b>value.</b> [...] This meant the avoidance of the impulse to aestheticize and the ordination of critical agency as a post-aesthetic strategy, one that can contain values that are nominally subsumed under several progressive political/aesthetic ideologies. [...] In an implicit effort to politicize advanced forms of performance, Barber placed the term performance under erasure with the formulation of [...]|$|E
