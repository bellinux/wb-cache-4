5|$|The recent strong {{economic}} growth and lower <b>unemployment</b> <b>in</b> the Telford area {{has been attributed to}} the construction of the motorway: <b>unemployment</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s was over 20%, but by 2004 this figure had fallen to 3.3%.

Moses soon prepared extensive plans to reconstruct the city's parks, renovate existing facilities and create new swimming pools, zoos, playgrounds and parks.

Business in the town is centred at the Poulton Industrial Estate. Agriculture is still important locally; in 2001 2.6% of workers in Wyre were employed in agriculture, hunting or forestry (compared to 1.2% in the North West and 1.5% in England).|$|E
5|$|As the Great Depression {{resulted}} in massive <b>unemployment</b> <b>in</b> the late 1920s and 1930s, more Japanese and Okinawans migrated to Palau. Immigrants brought along {{their families and}} sought employment in various professions. The Japanese immigrants held administrative posts, while the Okinawans and a few Koreans worked as labourers in the agricultural, fishery and mining industries. By 1935, the Japanese constituted at least 60% of Palau's population and were concentrated in urban areas such as Angaur and Koror. Some Japanese settlers took Palauan wives or mistresses, {{and there was a}} sizeable minority of mixed Japanese-Palauan children towards the later years of the Japanese administration.|$|E

The setting {{up of the}} corporation {{was intended to be}} only a temporary measure, terminating on 31March 1997, but it was extended for a further year until March 1998 when responsibility for Trafford Park's development passed to Trafford Council. The park is once again a major centre of employment in Trafford, and its regeneration has led to a high start-up rate for businesses and low rates of <b>unemployment</b> <b>in</b> the area. As of 2008, there were 1,400 companies within the park employing an estimated 35,000 people.|$|E
5|$|Built {{on a site}} long {{favored by}} pre-Columbian peoples, Lock Haven began in 1833 as a timber town and a haven for loggers, boatmen, and other {{travelers}} on the river or the West Branch Canal. Resource extraction and efficient transportation financed much of the city's growth {{through the end of}} the 19thcentury. In the 20thcentury, a light-aircraft factory, a college, and a paper mill, along with many smaller enterprises, drove the economy. Frequent floods, especially in 1972, damaged local industry and led to a high rate of <b>unemployment</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of <b>unemployment</b> <b>in</b> the long-run.|$|E

The phrase grew in usage in the 1960s during the Cold War. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics.
