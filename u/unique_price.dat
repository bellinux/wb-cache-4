40|$|The {{contract}} is described and market examples given. Essential theoretical developments are introduced and cited chronologically. The principles and techniques of hedging and <b>unique</b> <b>pricing</b> are illustrated {{for the two}} simplest nontrivial examples: the classical Black-Scholes/Merton/Margrabe exchange option model brought somewhat uptodate from its form three decades ago, and a lesser exponential Poisson analogue to illustrate jumps. Beyond these, a simplified Markovian SDE/PDE line is sketched in an arbitrage-free semimartingale setting. Focus is maintained on construction of a hedge using Itˆo’s formula and on <b>unique</b> <b>pricing,</b> now for general homogenous payoff functions. Clarity is primed as the multivariate log-Gaussian and exponential Poisson cases are worked out. Numeraire invariance is emphasized as the primary means to reduce dimensionality by one to the projective space where the SDE dynamics are specified and the PDEs solved (or expectations explicitly calculated). Predictable representation of a homogenous payoff with deltas (hedge ratios) as partial derivatives or partial differences of the option price function is highlighted. Equivalent martingale measures are utilized to show <b>unique</b> <b>pricing</b> with bounded deltas (and in the nondegenerate case unique hedging) and to exhibit the PDE or closed-form solutions as numeraire-deflated conditional expectations in the usual way. Homogeneity, change of numeraire, and extension to dividends are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|... (I) Unlike the EMH, {{the model}} {{developed}} by Caginalp and collaborators since 1990 involves ingredients that were marginalized by the classical efficient market hypothesis: while price change depends on {{supply and demand}} for the asset (e.g., stock) the latter can depend {{on a variety of}} motivations and strategies, such as the recent price trend. Unlike the classical theories, there is no assumption of infinite arbitrage, which says that any small deviation from the true value (that is universally accepted since all participants have the same information) is quickly exploited by an (essentially) infinite capital managed by [...] "informed" [...] investors. Among the consequences of this theory is that equilibrium is not a <b>unique</b> <b>price,</b> but depends on the price history and strategies of the traders.|$|E

Alternatively, you can ‘force’ the uniform rate of profit in the equations to be equal to r, but then the price-profit equations do not balance: you get one ‘price of production’ for a given type of commodity when it is bought as input, and a different ‘price of production’ for the very same type of commodity when it is sold as output. In my opinion, this makes the notion of price of production quite arbitrary and devoid of explanatory power." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss the}} pricing and risk {{management}} problems of standard European-style options in a Markovian regime-switching binomial model.

We examine numerically the performance of a simple hedging strategy by investigating the terminal distribution of hedging errors and the associated risk measures such as Value at Risk and Expected Shortfall.
