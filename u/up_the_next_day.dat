5|$|Sawyer wakes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> October 1, 2004, {{with his}} arm bandaged up, while Kate looks on. She tells Sawyer that she knows {{the letter was written}} when Sawyer was a kid, and also works out that the letter wasn't written to Sawyer, but by him. He tells Kate that his real name isn't Sawyer and that the letter was written to the real Sawyer, a con man, who ruined his family. He ended up {{becoming}} a con man himself, so he took the name Sawyer as an alias. He snatches the letter from Kate and tells her not to feel sorry for him and to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{month of}} June 1950 began 44 years of {{constant}} activity at Limestone. On the 10th, the 7 officers and 78 airmen of the Limestone Detachment arrived, as the tenant unit during construction. Two days later, an aircraft from Oklahoma arrived. On the 15th, limited operations began at Limestone, as Cold War tensions began to heat <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> a B-36 Peacemaker arrived and later departed. 1 July brought the re-designation of the Limestone Detachment as the 4215th Base Service Squadron. After the Korean War broke out, {{the decision was}} made to increase the squadron's size to 28 officers, 340 airmen, and 20 civilians. August brought the first permanently assigned aircraft, a C-47 Skytrain, and more aircraft using the base as a stopover between the States and Europe.|$|E
5|$|They {{set out on}} {{the road}} with little money in a yellow 1973 Buick Skylark {{convertible}} with a guy named Ben (Anson Mount). Lucy, however, leaves without the permission of her overbearing father Pete (Dan Aykroyd), who wakes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> to find his daughter is gone. Shortly into their journey, the car breaks down. They realise that they don't have enough money between them for the travel or the repair costs. Mimi then suggests that she sing karaoke at a local bar, where good singers are tipped well by the customers. While at the bar, the girls dress up and go the stage to perform. However, when the song starts Mimi develops stage fright, being unable to sing. Seeing that they needed the money, Lucy takes her place, and quickly becomes a hit with the crowd. They make enough money to fix the car and continue on their way.|$|E
50|$|When {{the series}} aired on WGN-TV in Chicago, viewers {{were not given}} the {{solution}} to the crime. Instead they were told to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day's</b> Chicago Tribune to find out {{the solution to the}} mystery. WGN-TV was owned by the Tribune.|$|R
50|$|Activity {{calmed down}} on March 10 with little severe weather reported, but picked <b>up</b> again <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sylvester wakes <b>up</b> late <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> Dawn {{is already}} gone. He can hardly {{concentrate}} at work {{as he tries}} in vain to contact her.|$|R
5|$|During {{the day the}} Fusiliers again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted {{to work their way}} around the eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers {{at the top of their}} objective. Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture their objective. It seemed that the only way to finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> to conduct the assault.|$|E
25|$|The same day, Hill {{petitioned the}} U.S. Supreme Court for certiorari and {{requested}} a stay of execution. Justice Kennedy granted a temporary stay, which was followed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> by a granting of certiorari {{from the entire}} Court and a full stay of execution.|$|E
25|$|As {{the crowds}} were {{breaking}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> on 14 October, many students found themselves unable {{to leave because}} the police blocked the southern route to Rajavithi Road. Cornered and overwhelmed by the hostile crowd, the police responded with teargas and gunfire.|$|E
60|$|It was not General Lawton's {{intention}} to quarter at Angat {{for any length}} of time, and, having entered the town in the morning, he left it in the afternoon, to begin an advance <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> striking San Rafael on the right bank and Muronco on the left bank.|$|R
50|$|Jack goes to {{town and}} gets {{captured}} intentionally. He is put into the jail with Sarah. Using some chemicals {{given to him by}} Walter, he breaks out of his cell and he and Sarah take off. They hide in a large crate in the shipping office. Walter picks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> crate <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> and gets them back to the ranch.|$|R
50|$|Annie wakes <b>up</b> early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> and discovers {{her father}} sitting {{outside in the}} {{freezing}} cold weather. He pleads for her forgiveness, even though he believes he does not deserve it. Annie starts to cry and then embraces him.|$|R
25|$|On 11 October, Cromwell and Fairfax {{together}} won {{a brilliant}} cavalry {{action at the}} Battle of Winceby, driving the Royalist horse in confusion before them to Newark. On the same day, Newcastle's army around Hull, which had suffered terribly from the hardships of continuous siege work, was attacked by the garrison. They were so severely handled that the siege was given <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> Later, Manchester retook Lincoln and Gainsborough. Thus Lincolnshire, which had been almost entirely in Newcastle's hands before he was compelled to undertake the siege of Hull, was added, in fact {{as well as in}} name, to the Eastern Association.|$|E
25|$|Once he is alone, Rudolph {{reads the}} letter and learns about the plot to blow him up. Ludwig arrives, intent on denouncing the plot to him. Before he can do so, Rudolph {{declares}} that he would give anything to avoid being blown <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> and Ludwig sees a way out. He feigns patriotism and suggests that the two engage in a statutory duel. He explains that they will hide cards up their sleeves, guaranteeing victory to Ludwig. When the plot unfolds, Ludwig will {{bear the brunt of}} it. The next day, when the Act authorizing statutory duels expires, Rudolph can come back to life unharmed. Although Rudolph is sceptical, he accepts Ludwig's proposal.|$|E
25|$|Bud Norris {{allowed only}} two runs in seven innings, out dueling Tampa Bay Rays starter Chris Archer in a 3–2 win at Dodger Stadium on July 26. A two-run homer by Evan Longoria {{was the key}} blow as the Rays, behind Matt Moore won the next game, 3–1. The Dodgers got into a wild game with the Diamondbacks on July 29, giving up seven runs {{in the top of}} the seventh inning and then {{answering}} back with five in the bottom of the inning, led by two-run homers by Joc Pederson and Chase Utley. They wound up winning 9–7. The offense did not show <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> and the Diamondbacks won 4–2. Despite losing starter Bud Norris to an injury two batters into the next game, the Dodgers, thanks to homers by Grandal, Seager and Pederson, beat the Diamondbacks 14–3 to end the month of July.|$|E
50|$|Under {{contract}} law, bar bets {{may or may}} not {{be legally}} binding, and the winning party may have difficulty having a court enforce the bet.A written contract, drawn <b>up</b> soberly <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> and signed by both parties, can avoid doubt.|$|R
50|$|The corpses of Maceo and Panchito {{were picked}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>days</b> by Colonel Aranguren, from Havana, who ran {{immediately}} to the battle scene after hearing the news. They were later buried in secret in the farm of two brothers who swore to keep the burial place in secrecy until Cuba would be free and independent and the correspondent military honors could {{be given to the}} hero. Nowadays, the remains of Antonio Maceo y Grajales and Francisco Gómez Toro lie in the Monumento El Cacahual south of Havana, close to the limits of the former farm of San Pedro, and the site is one of pilgrimage by Cuban people. Scholars say that Maceo's death was as traumatic to Cuban patriots as Marti's.|$|R
60|$|They four {{had walked}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} after breakfast from Kandersteg, bringing their bags {{for a couple}} of nights, the boys being anxious to go <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Altels <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> as their time was nearly over and they were to be in school in ten days' time again. After luncheon and a good rest on the wooden bench outside the door, they began to stroll towards the Daubensee, along a path between desolate boulders, without vegetation, except a small kind of monkshood.|$|R
25|$|The two {{accused in}} the case were already in police custody while the {{skeletal}} remains of the young children were being unearthed from behind {{and in front of}} Pandher's residence. An FIR had been filed on 7 October 2006. Investigations revealed that Payal's cellphone was being used although the SIM card she owned remained inactive. Through digital surveillance, the investigators were able to track down a number of people and could finally reach the man who sold the phone. The rickshaw cart puller affirmed that the phone belonged to someone from the Pandher residence. After the affirmation of the facts by the witness, Moninder Singh was called for interrogation, which subsequently revealed nothing. His aide and servant, Surinder Koli was picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> and he confessed killing the woman and dumping her body behind the house. The police started digging and henceforth recovered the skeletal remains of the missing children instead of Payal.|$|E
500|$|Reporters showed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> (only {{their second}} {{appearance}} at the field since May the previous year), but the brothers declined to fly. The long flights convinced the Wrights they had achieved their goal of creating a flying machine of [...] "practical utility" [...] which they could offer to sell.|$|E
500|$|He {{then had}} a brief {{relationship}} with Thelma Pickles, who had previously dated Lennon. She later married Liverpool poet Roger McGough, but remembered McCartney as growing from a [...] "plump young schoolboy into someone very much his own person" [...] during their time together. McCartney also had a fiery [...] "on-off" [...] relationship with Iris Caldwell, the younger sister of singer Rory Storm, who refused to bow to McCartney's demands. After one argument, Caldwell poured a bowl of sugar over his head, but when McCartney turned <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> she had to phone her new boyfriend, George Harrison, to cancel their date.|$|E
50|$|Bernstein {{obtained}} his B.A. from Columbia University in 1924. Among {{many other}} responsibilities in the 1950s and 1960s, {{it fell to}} Bernstein and his colleague, Lewis Jordan, to make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day's</b> {{front page of the}} Times. His colleagues often saved his drafts on particularly newsworthy days. During the run-up to the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco in 1961, the two settled on a four-column lead headline that put the invasion into dramatic perspective. However, under pressure from President John F. Kennedy, publisher Orvil Dryfoos ordered that the story be toned down, and the headline reduced to one column. Bernstein and Jordan were both infuriated, even after Dryfoos personally explained his decision to them. The story is told in detail in Without Fear or Favor by former Times editor Harrison Salisbury.|$|R
50|$|In the quarter-final {{match against}} Ireland, Formenoij scored at seventh minute, Ireland equalized, and Formenoij scored again in extra time, {{bringing}} the Dutch {{team to the}} bronze medal match against Sweden. The match ended in a 1:1 draw, and a replay was set <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b> <b>The</b> Netherlands lost 1:3 with Formenoij scoring its only goal.|$|R
50|$|The {{skirmish}} {{lasted for}} some 90 minutes, after which Russians retreated northwards. Their commandant, Major Chuti, {{did not give}} <b>up</b> and on <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> attacked <b>the</b> insurgents at Jurkowice.|$|R
500|$|On November 1, Montgomery sent a truce flag, {{carried by}} a {{prisoner}} captured during Carleton's aborted relief attempt, into the fort. The man delivered a letter, in which Montgomery, {{pointing out that}} relief was unlikely to come, offered to negotiate a surrender. Preston, not entirely trusting the man's report, sent out one of his captains to confer with Montgomery. [...] The counteroffer, which Montgomery rejected, owing to the lateness of the season, was to hold a truce for four days, after which the garrison would surrender if no relief came. [...] Montgomery let the captain examine another prisoner from Carleton's expedition, who confirmed what the first one had reported. Montgomery then repeated his demand for an immediate surrender, terms for which were drawn <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
500|$|While {{working on}} Heavy Traffic, Bakshi {{received}} a call from Krantz, who questioned him about Harlem Nights. Bakshi told Krantz: [...] "I can't talk about that" [...] and hung <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> Krantz locked Bakshi out of the studio, reportedly tapping Bakshi's phone because he was wary of his loyalty as an employee. After Krantz fired Bakshi, he began to seek a replacement director for Heavy Traffic, calling several directors, including Chuck Jones. Arkoff threatened to pull the film's budget unless Krantz rehired Bakshi, who returned a week later. During the film's production, Krantz attempted to maintain some level of control by issuing memos to Bakshi and other artists requesting various changes. John Sparey remembers being issued a memo asking Sparey to stop posting caricatures of Krantz on the middle of his door.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in the United States, {{a late-night}} disc jockey at WBZ-FM in Boston played [...] "The Sound of Silence", {{where it was}} popular with a college audience. It was picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> along the East Coast of the United States, down to Cocoa Beach, Florida. Wilson, {{inspired}} by the folk rock sound of the Byrds' cover of [...] "Turn! Turn! Turn!" [...] and Dylan's [...] "Like a Rolling Stone", created a rock remix of the song using studio musicians. The remix of [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] was issued in September 1965, where it reached the Billboard Hot 100. Wilson had not informed the duo of his intention to remix the track; as such, Simon was [...] "horrified" [...] when he first heard it. Garfunkel graduated in 1965, returning to Columbia University to do a master's degree in mathematics.|$|E
50|$|In other words, {{it may be}} the Sound, not the battle, {{that was}} 6 leagues to the south. This {{explains}} <b>the</b> bodies washing <b>up</b> on Faial <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> as Horner describes.|$|R
25|$|In 1965, {{the road}} to Montgomery was four lanes wide going east from Selma, then narrowed to two lanes through Lowndes County, and widened to four lanes again at the Montgomery county border. Under the terms of Judge Johnson's order, the march was limited {{to no more than}} 300 {{participants}} for the two days they were on the two-lane portion of Highway-80. At {{the end of the first}} day, most of the marchers returned to Selma by bus and car, leaving 300 to camp overnight and take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> journey <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day.</b>|$|R

500|$|A {{few years}} after the hall's {{completion}} in 1636, Civil War broke out. Like most of the legal families of Cheshire, the Crewe family was parliamentarian, and the hall {{was used as a}} garrison. In December 1643, royalist forces under the command of Lord Byron occupied the area as they surrounded Nantwich, a major parliamentarian stronghold early in the First Civil War which lay some [...] to the south west. A contemporary diarist, Edward Burghall, vicar of nearby Acton, described the subsequent action: [...] "The royalists laid siege to Crewe Hall, where they within the house slew sixty, and wounded many, on St. John's Day; but wanting victuals and ammunition, they were forced to yield it <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> and themselves, a hundred and thirty-six, became prisoners, stout and valiant soldiers, having quarter for life granted them." [...] On 4 February 1644, shortly after the decisive parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Nantwich, the hall was retaken by Sir Thomas Fairfax's forces.|$|E
500|$|At an August {{debate in}} Owensboro, Farmer {{proposed}} the cross-promotion of Kentucky agricultural products {{and the state}} park system, awarding points for buying Kentucky produced groceries that could be redeemed for souvenirs and perks during stays at state parks. On October 21, The Kentucky Post gave Baesler its endorsement, contrasting her experience running a farm and her involvement with the agriculture department to Farmer's lack of agriculture experience and frequent absence at campaign events. Later that week, the Lexington Herald-Leader also endorsed Baesler, and followed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> with an article noting that, as of October 3, nearly one-third of the $87,825.20 Farmer had spent during the campaign went to relatives [...] including his parents, brother, sister, and in-laws [...] for salaries and campaign-related reimbursements. Interviewed by phone, Farmer responded, [...] " [...] probably worked 60, 70, 80 hours a week campaigning for me {{trying to get me}} elected. I don't think we have done anything wrong." [...] Richard Beliles, chairman of campaign finance watchdog Common Cause of Kentucky, said Farmer's actions were not illegal but were [...] "rather odd". Farmer overcame the bad press, however, to take the election by a vote of 575,049 to 466,321.|$|E
500|$|In May 1996, Starr and McCartney {{were working}} on a track that McCartney had started a decade previously, [...] "Beautiful Night", which {{featured}} vocals from Starr. Lynne showed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> and the trio, with McCartney on bass, Starr on drums, and Lynne on guitar, jammed, with the finished results being the track [...] "Really Love You", the first track credited to McCartney–Starkey. McCartney and Starr also recorded the B-side [...] "Looking for You" [...] and an untitled song. [...] "Heaven on a Sunday", which was written while McCartney was in the US sailing on holiday, was recorded on 16 September 1996, and features backing vocals by both Linda and James. Martin added orchestration to [...] "Beautiful Night", on 14 February 1997 at Abbey Road Studios. An unreleased song recorded with Lynne producing, titled [...] "Cello in the Ruins", had its copyright registered in 1994, despite work on the song only getting started a year later, in May 1995. The track was nearly issued as a single for War Child's The Help Album in 1995, but ultimately shelved. This album was the last McCartney studio album to feature vocals and participation from Linda, who {{died of breast cancer}} in 1998.|$|E
60|$|After much {{deliberation}} it {{was decided}} that they should paddle <b>up</b> <b>the</b> river <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day,</b> leaving two of their number {{at the edge of the}} forest to keep a look-out for the ship.|$|R

2500|$|The {{coalition}} {{responded by}} arresting one of al-Sadr's closest aides, leading to al-Sadr calling on {{his followers to}} rise <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>days</b> fighting erupted in many cities in southern Iraq, including Karbala, Kut, Nassiriya and Basra. The CPA announced {{the existence of a}} three-month-old arrest warrant, issued by an Iraqi judge, on al-Sadr, claiming that he was responsible for the killing of Coalition-aligned cleric Abdul Majid al-Khoei. The warrant itself inspired further opposition, as Khoei's own followers blamed Ba'athists for the murder, the Coalition-appointed Iraqi Minister of Justice stated that he had no knowledge of the warrant, and the Iraqi Jurists Association declared the warrant [...] "illegal". Al-Sadr, who had previously created his own parallel government and a militia called the al-Mahdi Army, instructed his followers to no longer follow along with the occupation, and suggested that they attack Coalition soldiers, and his followers took control of several southern cities, often with the support of local authorities and police.|$|R
