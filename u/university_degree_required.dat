40|$|Do {{students}} know the education {{required to achieve}} their career objectives? Is this information related to their education pathways? To address these questions, the Youth in Transition Survey (YITS), Cohort A is used to compare high school students' perceptions {{of the level of}} education they will require for the job they intend to hold at age 30, with the level required according to professional job analysts at Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (HRSDC). The focus is on students intending to work in a job which <b>requires</b> a <b>university</b> <b>degree,</b> and examine the correlation between the knowledge of educational requirements and subsequent university enrolment. The results suggest that about three out of four students intending to work in a job <b>requiring</b> a <b>university</b> <b>degree</b> are aware of the education they will require. Evidence suggests that knowledge of educational requirements is related to academic performance and socio-economic background. Differences by intended occupation are quite small. Moreover, students who know that a <b>university</b> <b>degree</b> is <b>required</b> are more likely to attend university, even after accounting for differences in academic performance, sex, and socioeconomic background. In fact, the knowledge of educational requirements is as strongly related to university attendance as other well-documented correlates such as sex, academic performance and parental education. Finally, higher university attendance rates are observed when students learn earlier (rather than later), that a <b>university</b> <b>degree</b> is <b>required</b> for their intended job.

40|$|Mathematics expresses itself everywhere, {{in almost}} every facet of life - in nature all around us, and in the {{technologies}} in our hands. Mathematics {{is the language of}} science and engineering - describing our understanding of all that we observe. In fact, Galileo said that Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe. Aristotle defined mathematics as "the science of quantity", i. e., “the science of the things that can be counted”. Now you can think that counting has a vital role in our daily life; just imagine that there were no mathematics at all, how would it be possible for us to count days, months and years? Unfortunately, people usually ignore the connection between mathematics and the daily life. Most of <b>university</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>require</b> mathematics. Students who choose not to take seriously mathematics or to ignore it in high school, find several difficulties when they come up against them at the university. This study explores the perceptions of how mathematics influences our daily life among our students and how teachers can use this information in order to improve the academic performance.

In this paper we locate and examine the tensions that exist between the political agenda of {{the university and the}} development of professionalism of pre-service teachers and nurses. It questions how well university policies support and reflect the professional standards and requirements of both teaching and nursing in their teacher and nurse education programs.
