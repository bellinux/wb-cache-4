5|$|Raëlian {{cosmology}} {{as proposed}} in 1973 by Raël {{states that the}} observable <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> no creator and is infinite in time and finite in size and surrounded by infinite space.|$|E
5|$|The more matter {{there is}} in the Universe, the {{stronger}} the mutual gravitational pull of the matter. If the Universe were too dense then it would re-collapse into a gravitational singularity. However, if the Universe contained too little matter then the expansion would accelerate too rapidly for planets and planetary systems to form. Since the Big Bang, the <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> expanded monotonically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, our <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> just the right mass density of about 5 protons per cubic meter which has allowed it to expand for the last 13.8 billion years, giving time to form the universe as observed today.|$|E
5|$|The Universe is {{composed}} almost completely of dark energy, dark matter, and ordinary matter. Other contents are electromagnetic radiation (estimated {{to be from}} 0.005% to close to 0.01%) and antimatter. The total amount of electromagnetic radiation generated within the <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> decreased by 1/2 in the past 2 billion years.|$|E
50|$|Craig {{defends the}} second premise, that the <b>Universe</b> <b>had</b> a {{beginning}} starting with Al-Ghazali's proof that an actual infinite is impossible. However, If the <b>universe</b> never <b>had</b> a beginning then there indeed {{would be an}} actual infinite, an infinite amount {{of cause and effect}} events. Hence, the <b>Universe</b> <b>had</b> a beginning.|$|R
25|$|In medieval philosophy, {{there was}} much debate over whether the <b>universe</b> <b>had</b> a finite or {{infinite}} past (see Temporal finitism). The philosophy of Aristotle held that the <b>universe</b> <b>had</b> an infinite past, which caused problems for medieval Jewish and Islamic philosophers who were unable to reconcile the Aristotelian conception of the eternal with the Abrahamic view of creation. As a result, a variety of logical arguments for the <b>universe</b> <b>having</b> a finite past were developed by John Philoponus, Al-Kindi, Saadia Gaon, Al-Ghazali and Immanuel Kant, among others.|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to ancient Greek philosophers {{who believed that}} the <b>universe</b> <b>had</b> an infinite past with no beginning, medieval philosophers and theologians developed {{the concept of the}} <b>universe</b> <b>having</b> a finite past with a beginning. This view was inspired by the creation myth shared by the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.|$|R
5|$|Third, the {{curvature}} index k determines {{the sign of}} the mean spatial curvature of spacetime averaged over sufficiently large length scales (greater than about a billion light years). If k=1, {{the curvature}} is positive and the <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a three-dimensional sphere embedded in a four-dimensional space. Conversely, if k is zero or negative, the <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> infinite volume. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense Universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when R=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when k does not equal 1. By analogy, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a torus is finite in both. A toroidal Universe could behave like a normal Universe with periodic boundary conditions.|$|E
5|$|Unlike our universe, {{which is}} now known to be {{expanding}} at an accelerating rate, anti-de Sitter space is neither expanding nor contracting. Instead it looks the same at all times. In more technical language, one says that anti-de Sitter space corresponds to a universe with a negative cosmological constant, whereas the real <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> a small positive cosmological constant.|$|E
5|$|While it {{was long}} {{believed}} that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, recent observations of the redshift-distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> begun to accelerate.|$|E

2500|$|Lee Smolin {{has offered}} a theory {{designed}} to improve {{on the lack of}} imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his fecund universes theory, which assumes <b>universes</b> <b>have</b> [...] "offspring" [...] through the creation of black holes whose offspring <b>universes</b> <b>have</b> values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.|$|R
5|$|Chrysippus {{regarded}} bodies, surfaces, lines, places, {{the void}} and time as all being infinitely divisible. He determined {{one of the}} principal features of the infinite set: since a man and a finger have an infinite number of parts as do the universe and a man, it cannot be said that a man has more parts than his finger, nor that the <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> more parts than a man.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, matter {{itself is}} {{expected}} to come {{under the influence of}} radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles. Current data suggest that the <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> a flat geometry (or very close to flat), and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time, and the infinite future allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of Boltzmann brains.|$|E
5|$|Further {{observational}} improvements led to {{the realization}} that our Solar System is located in the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the Universe. It is assumed that galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning that the <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> neither an edge nor a center. Discoveries in the early 20th century have suggested that the Universe had a beginning and that it is expanding at an increasing rate. The majority of mass in the Universe appears to exist in an unknown form called dark matter.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} view {{to extend}} the Big Bang model, suggesting the <b>universe</b> <b>had</b> no beginning or singularity {{and the age of}} the <b>universe</b> is infinite, <b>has</b> been presented.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to ancient Greek philosophers {{who believed that}} the <b>universe</b> <b>had</b> an infinite past with no beginning, medieval philosophers and theologians developed {{the concept of the}} <b>universe</b> <b>having</b> a finite past with a beginning.This view is shared by Abrahamic faiths as they believe time started by creation, therefore the only thing being infinite is God and everything else, including time, is finite.|$|R

5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle {{can be derived}} from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10−5 via observations of the CMB. The <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.|$|E
5|$|On the average, {{space is}} {{observed}} {{to be very}} nearly flat (close to zero curvature), meaning that Euclidean geometry is empirically true with high accuracy {{throughout most of the}} Universe. Spacetime also appears to have a simply connected topology, in analogy with a sphere, at least on the length-scale of the observable Universe. However, present observations cannot exclude the possibilities that the <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> more dimensions and that its spacetime may have a multiply connected global topology, in analogy with the cylindrical or toroidal topologies of two-dimensional spaces.|$|E

Five endings are available. Gameplay takes place in two parts: a framing, first-person psychotherapy session, and an over-the-shoulder perspective of Harry's journey through Silent Hill, which is periodically interrupted by the occurrence of a shift to an alternate dimension. Answers given to the psychological tests in the therapy session affect various gameplay elements in Harry's journey.|$|E

The Doctor offers Hila a lift to any other place in history and concludes {{that she is a}} direct descendant of Emma and Palmer. He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her. While contemplating the bonds that love can create, the Doctor suddenly realises that there is another creature within Caliburn House. Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped in the pocket <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> been trying to reunite with its mate. The Doctor asks Emma for a favour and they use Emma and the TARDIS to retrieve the other creature from the pocket universe.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012 miniseries Spider-Men, the {{mainstream}} Marvel Universe Peter Parker briefly visits the Ultimate Marvel universe and meets Miles Morales. When Parker {{returns to his}} home universe, he uses a Google search to see if his <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> a version of Miles Morales, and is shocked by what he finds, but {{the exact nature of}} what he finds is left unrevealed to the reader. This is followed up in the 2017 sequel miniseries Spider-Men II, in which the Earth-616 version of Miles Morales makes his first appearance, and is revealed to be a fully-grown adult with a face covered by several thin scars, who is allied with Taskmaster, and later revealed to have become close friends with the crime boss Kingpin when the two served time together prison.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that {{when the universe was}} young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.|$|E

50|$|The {{religious}} practises of Ayyavazhi largely {{differ from}} traditional Hinduism. Akilam says that previous practices were not wrong, {{but that they}} were distorted because of the abnormal, cruel nature of Kaliyan and his boons, which the <b>Universe</b> <b>had</b> experienced before. Akilattirattu Ammanai says that the whole acts and rules of the <b>Universe</b> <b>had</b> changed by the advent of Kaliyan. Thiru Nadana Ula, a part of Akilam eight discusses this change in detail.|$|R
5|$|The initial hot, dense {{state is}} called the Planck epoch, a brief period {{extending}} from time zero to one Planck time unit of approximately 10−43 seconds. During the Planck epoch, all types of matter and all types of energy were concentrated into a dense state, where gravitation {{is believed to have}} been as strong as the other fundamental forces, and all the forces may have been unified. Since the Planck epoch, the <b>Universe</b> <b>has</b> been expanding to its present form, possibly with a very brief period of cosmic inflation which caused the Universe to reach a much larger size in less than 10−32 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem is}} that any small {{departure}} from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the Planck time, 10−43 seconds, {{the fact that the}} <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> reached neither a heat death nor a Big Crunch after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 1014 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.|$|E
5|$|The Einstein field {{equations}} are nonlinear {{and very}} difficult to solve. Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric. This solution {{laid the groundwork for}} the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the Reissner–Nordström solution, now associated with electrically charged black holes. In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption. By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our <b>universe</b> <b>has</b> evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state. Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.|$|E
