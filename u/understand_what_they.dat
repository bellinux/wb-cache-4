5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E
5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing in order to better <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> thought of him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited {{for them on}} the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When they were in range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although he did not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may}} not have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{division}} of labour inherent in prescriptive technologies is usually associated with the industrial revolution, Franklin points out that such production methods have been used since ancient times.

Franklin writes that when she studied Chinese bronze casting as a metallurgist, [...] "the extraordinary social meaning of prescriptive technologies dawned on me. I began to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> meant, not just in terms of casting bronze but in terms of discipline and planning, of organization and command." ...|$|E

He stated {{in an interview that he}} wanted to show that [...] "these folks didn't completely <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing...

500|$|Until now, Cardinale's {{own voice}} {{had not been}} used in her Italian films, as it was {{considered}} too hoarse, and owing to [...] her French accent, insufficiently Italian.

500|$|The most {{commonly}} given {{answer is that}} we attribute consciousness to other people because we see that they resemble us in appearance and behavior; we reason that if they look like us and act like us, they must be like us in other ways, including having experiences {{of the sort that}} we do. [...] There are, however, a variety of problems with that explanation. [...] For one thing, it seems to violate the principle of parsimony, by postulating an invisible entity that is not necessary to explain what we observe. [...] Some philosophers, such as Daniel Dennett in an essay titled The Unimagined Preposterousness of Zombies, argue that people who give this explanation do not really <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are saying. [...] More broadly, philosophers who do not accept the possibility of zombies generally believe that consciousness is reflected in behavior (including verbal behavior), and that we attribute consciousness on the basis of behavior. [...] A more straightforward way of saying this is that we attribute experiences to people because of what they can do, including the fact that they can tell us about their experiences.|$|E
500|$|Raven {{wanted the}} game to provide a nostalgic {{experience}} for fans of the original, while introducing it to newcomers by connecting them to a world that {{they were used to}} in recent Call of Duty games, albeit one that mirrored reality. [...] Pellas noted that the risk of negative fan reactions resulting from any small changes made to the original and the desire to meet high expectations was daunting for Raven, saying [...] "There was a realization that this is freaking terrifying, because it's not just important to us". To assist in their decision-making, he recalled that they reviewed a large number of internet forums where active players of Modern Warfare could be found in order to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would want from a re-release of the game. Raven were encouraged by their principle of keeping the core gameplay unchanged, a decision that remained consistent throughout the process as respecting the experience of the original was essential. Subtle improvements were made to both the controls and timing of existing animations, such as the transition between aiming a sniper rifle and the scope overlay appearing, but were designed to be as close to identical as possible.|$|E

Roshan had reservations about the role but agreed to the project after reading the film's story. To understand his role better, he interacted with paraplegic patients. In his own words, [...] "I used to spend six hours with the patients, initially once a week and then once a month. I used to go to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> go through, what they think, what their needs are. They have taught me a lot of things." [...] He also trained with a Ukrainian magician to perform the film's magic stunts, and put on weight to look the part. The film failed at the box office, though it and Roshan's performance were positively received by critics. A writer for Zee News praised the chemistry between Roshan and Rai, adding that they [...] "break the Bollywood mould of stereotypes". Roshan received the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor (Critics) and nominations for Filmfare, IIFA and Zee Cine Award for Best Actor.|$|E
500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not expect much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the Dark. In the books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her is that she is an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter is Delicious, she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E
