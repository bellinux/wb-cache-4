Taking Wanzhou section {{as a case}} study, the characteristics of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> and spatial distribution in riparian vegetation restored by different methods in the Three Gorges Reservoir area were uncovered by field investigation and chemical analysis of soil samples collected from the artificial and natural restoration plots, respectively. Results showed that restoration method had significant effect on <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients.</b> The content of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> in the artificial restoration plot was generally higher than that in the natural recovery plot indicating that artificial restoration promoted accumulation of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> in vegetation. Under {{the influence of the}} reverse seasonal water-level fluctuation, a special spatial distribution pattern that the riparian <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> increased and then decreased with the increasing latitude appeared on the artificial restoration plot.

Moreover, sexually different responses happened also in organelle ultrastructure. Our results showed that: (1) females suffered greater negative effects and exhibited lower defense capacities than did males under HUVB radiation, low <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status and their combination; (2) low <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status reduced plant's sensitivity to HUVB radiation by increasing allocation to defense and decreasing allocation to growth compared with high <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status.

40|$|Maize is the worldâs {{third most}} {{important}} cereal after wheat and rice. It {{serves as a}} staple food to more than 1. 2 billion of the world population. However, its production is threatened by declining soil fertility; mainly due to low inputs of fertilizers containing major elements to replenish lost <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and unsustainable <b>soil</b> tillage practices linked to mono-cropping. To examine the influence of N, P and K and residual compost on maize growth and yield, an experiment was carried out at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria. Utilizing the long-term maize trial, controls (0 and W), seven inorganic fertilizer treatments (N, P, K, NP, NK, PK & NPK) and seven organic + inorganic fertilizer treatments (WN, WP, WK, WNP, WNK, WPK & WNPK) were used. The influence of these fertilizer and residual compost treatments on maize seed viability (germination), plant growth, reproductive development, pollen performance, grain yield parameters, yield and grain yield water-use efficiency was investigated. Higher seed viability was associated with balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status (WNPK & NPK), whilst deficient <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status (0, N, P & K) resulted in lower seed viability. Plant growth (plant height, total dry mass and LAI) and reproductive development (tassel length, ear length, and days to tasseling and silking) were positively influenced by a balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status and residual compost. Deficiencies in <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> restricted maize plant growth and delayed reproductive development. This highlighted {{the importance of a}} balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status in attaining a vigorous crop and good reproductive development. <b>Soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> deficiencies (0, P & K treatments) enhanced the production of pollen (mass per plant), but resulted in low pollen quality (viability and germination). Balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status (WNPK & NPK) resulted in the production of high quality pollen (viability and germinability), which however had a low mass. In both 2012 / 2013 and 2013 / 2014 seasons, maize grain components; cob length, number of kernel rows per cob, number of kernels per row, mass per kernel and mass of 100 kernels were positively influenced by balanced <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status.

Methods A 100 m Ã 100 m forest plot was established on a hillside in a karst area in Maolan National Nature Reserve, Guizhou Province, Southwest China. All woody species with a diameter at breast height â¥ 1 cm were identified and surveyed. Surface soil samples (0 â 10 cm) were collected from a grid of 10 m Ã 10 m for the analysis of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients.</b> The spatial variability of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and its impact on distributions of tree species were analyzed by using geo-statistic methods (semivariogram and Kriging interpolation) and ordination (canonical correspondence analysis, CCA). Important findings The coefficient of variation for <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> ranges from 10 % to 80 %, and can be considered relatively moderate. Total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), total magnesium (TMg) and pH show strong spatial autocorrelation, while organic matter (OM), total calcium (TCa), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) show moderate spatial autocorrelation. The variation range of soil TCa is the smallest (56. 2 m) and those of OM, TP and AK are larger. Spatial distribution of TP, TK, TCa, TMg, AP and pH decreases with increasing elevation and decreasing cover of bare rock, while OM increases with increasing elevation, which indicated that the spatial distributions and variability of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> were mainly affected by topographic factors and habitat characteristics (especially elevation, slope, slope aspect, slope location and cover of bare rock). CCA indicated that the spatial distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> especially TK, TMg, pH, TCa and OM, has an important impact on tree species composition and distribution, and thus showed a prevalence of soil resource-based niche differentiation among tree species.

Then analyzed soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK). The results showed that the spatial heterogeneity of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> was existed in C. intermedia plantation on sand dunes. (1) Depth was the most important impact factor, <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> were decreased with greater soil depth. One of the possible reasons is that windblown fine materials and litters were accumulated on surface soil, when they were decomposed, more nutrients were aggregated on surface soil. (2) Topography also affected the distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> more <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> distributed on windward slopes. The herbaceous coverage were higher and C. intermedia ground diameter were larger on windward slopes, both of them probably related to the high <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> level for windward slopes.

Our results indicated that there are canonical correlations among <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> microbial amount and enzyme activity. The correlation between <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and <b>soil</b> microbial biomass was mainly attributed to total nitrogen, organic matter, total phosphate of nutrient factors, and amount of actinomycetes, carbon and phosphate content in microbe. The correlation between <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and <b>soil</b> enzyme activity was due to organic carbon, available potassium in soil and soil enzyme activities such as catalase activity and phosphatase activity.

The watershed is 1. 3 km 2 with a complex land management system including agriculture and forestry. Surface soil samples (0 Â¿ 20 cm) from 48 sites within the watershed were collected in the spring of 1999 and analysed for chemical properties.

Integrative {{indicators of the}} current status of the agricultural production capacity of land and their change over time are needed for promoting land management practices to maintain or improve land productivity and a sustainable use of natural resources. It is argued that such land quality indicators should be obtained with a holistic systems-oriented approach. Two land quality indicators are elaborated that deal with (1) yield gaps, i. e. the difference of actual yield and yield obtained under optimum management practices, or yields determined by the land-based natural resources, and (2) a <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> balance, i. e. the rate with which soil fertility is changing. The yield gap is based on the calculation of land-based cereal productivity at three different levels in terms of potential, water limited, and nutrient limited production, considering weather, soil and crop characteristics. These modelled production levels do not incorporate socio-economic aspects, which may impede agricultural management in its effort to release stress because of inadequate soil fertility, water availability and/or occurrence of pests and diseases. Therefore, location specific actual yield levels are also considered. Besides an evaluation of the actual status of the land, {{it is important to consider}} the rate of change.

This study determined the effect of various soil water treatments applied to the test crop on the status of postharvest residual <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> pools in an arid environment. Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was grown as test crop under conditions of full- (as control), high-, moderate-, and low-water conditions during jointing, booting-heading, and grain filling stages, in 2003 and 2004. Compared to the control, grain yield and water use efficiency (WUE) were significantly increased by subjecting the wheat crop to moderate-water conditions during various growth stages, and low-water conditions at jointing stage in both years. Soil C at harvest decreased linearly with increased grain yield of the test crop. Moderate- to high-water conditions during jointing stage resulted in 12 - 24 % greater soil C in the top 40 cm depth in 2003, with a marginal difference in 2004. Water treatments impacted the status of residual <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> in 2003; <b>soil</b> total N and available soil P in the top 40 cm depth were significantly higher in low- to moderate-water treatments compared to the control, while in 2004 significantly higher total N and P, available N, P and K were found only in the top 20 cm depth. Increased yield of wheat test crop with moderate-water resulted in increased postharvest residual <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> whereas the ratios of C/N, C/P, and C/K were largely influenced by years and were less related to water treatments.

The total nutrient is stable relatively while the available nutrient is affected by the fertilization and tillage easily; the correlation of soil organic matter content reached to very significant level compared with the <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> except the total potassium.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the interaction between herbivory and <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> availability drives habitat association of tree species in Peruvian Amazonia. Nevertheless, there is no empirical evidence that this interaction holds across other Amazonian regions. Aims: We address this knowledge gap by testing whether the interaction between herbivory and <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> contributes to habitat association of tree species in white-sand and terra-firme forests in the upper Rio Negro, Brazil. Methods: We conducted a reciprocal transplanting field experiment in which we controlled {{for the presence of}} herbivores. We tested for differences in tree-seedling growth and herbivory among seven white-sand and seven terra-firme habitat-specialist species. Additionally, we assessed whether tree seedlings differed in their functional traits. Results: We found no empirical evidence that an interaction between herbivory and <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> shapes habitat association in white-sand and terra-firme forests of the upper Rio Negro. Tree seedlings showed higher mortality when growing in their non-typical habitat. Growth and herbivory were similar regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} herbivore protection and type of soil. Conclusions: We suggest that the overall differences in <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status between white-sand and terra-firme forests in the upper Rio Negro are insufficient to trigger an interaction between herbivory and <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> availability...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale {{heterogeneity}} of abiotic and biotic factors {{is expected to}} {{play a crucial role}} in species coexistence. It is known that plants are able to concentrate their root biomass into areas with high nutrient content and also acquire nutrients via symbiotic microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. At the same time, little is known about the small-scale distribution of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> microbes and plant biomass occurring in the same area. We examined small-scale temporal and spatial variation as well as covariation of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> microbial biomass (using soil fatty acid biomarker content) and above- and belowground biomass of herbaceous plants in a natural herb-rich boreonemoral spruce forest. The abundance of AM fungi and bacteria decreased during the plant growing season while <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> content rather increased. The abundance of all microbes studied also varied in space and was affected by <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> content. In particular, the abundance of AM fungi was negatively related to soil phosphorus and positively influenced by soil nitrogen content. Neither shoot nor root biomass of herbaceous plants showed any significant relationship with variation in <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> content or the abundance of soil microbes. Our study suggests that plants can compensate for low soil phosphorus concentration via interactions with soil microbes, most probably due to a more efficient symbiosis with AM fungi. This compensation results in relatively constant plant biomass despite variation in soil phosphorous content and in the abundance of AM fungi. Hence, it is crucial to consider both <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> content and the abundance of soil microbes whe...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} explore the {{selection}} of the best auxiliary variables (BAVs) when using the Cokriging method for soil attribute interpolation, this paper investigated the selection of BAVs from terrain parameters, soil trace elements, and <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> attributes when applying Cokriging interpolation to <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> (organic matter, total N, available P, and available K). In total, 670 soil samples were collected in Fuyang, and the nutrient and trace element attributes of the soil samples were determined. Based on the spatial autocorrelation of soil attributes, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data for Fuyang was combined {{to explore the}} coordinate relationship among terrain parameters, trace elements, and <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> attributes. Variables with a high correlation to <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> attributes were selected as BAVs for Cokriging interpolation of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> and variables with poor correlation were selected as poor auxiliary variables (PAVs). The results of Cokriging interpolations using BAVs and PAVs were then compared. The results indicated that Cokriging interpolation with BAVs yielded more accurate results than Cokriging interpolation with PAVs (the mean absolute error of BAV interpolation results for organic matter, total N, available P, and available K were 0. 020, 0. 002, 7. 616, and 12. 4702, respectively, and the mean absolute error of PAV interpolation results were 0. 052, 0. 037, 15. 619, and 0. 037, respectively). The results indicated that Cokriging interpolation with BAVs can significantly improve the accuracy of Cokriging interpolation for <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> attributes. This study provides meaningful guidance and reference for the selection of auxiliary parameters for th...|$|R
40|$|Although genetic, environmental, and G x E {{effects on}} {{aboveground}} phytochemistry {{have been well}} documented in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides), little work {{has focused on the}} same factors affecting tissues underground. Belowground plant defenses are likely important mediators of root-feeding herbivores that can strongly influence plant fitness. We used a common garden of potted aspen trees to explore the individual and interactive effects of <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> availability, foliar damage, genotype, and their interactions, on concentrations of phytochemicals in aspen roots. Our common garden experiment employed 12 aspen genotypes that were planted into either low- or high-nutrient soil environments. Half of the trees were subjected to defoliation for two successive years, while the others were protected from damage. At the end of the growing season after the second defoliation, we harvested the trees to obtain root samples for which we assessed levels of phenolic glycosides, condensed tannins, nitrogen, and starch. Phenolic glycosides were most affected by genotype, while the other root phytochemicals were most responsive to <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> conditions. The effects of defoliation were observed in interaction with <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> environment and/or genotype. Interestingly, the effect of defoliation on phenolic glycosides was mediated by <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> whereas the effect of defoliation on condensed tannins was observed in concert with effects of both <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients</b> and genotype. Comparison of data from this study with an earlier, related study revealed that concentrations of phenolic glycosides and condensed tannins are lower in roots than leaves, and less responsive to defoliation. That <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> environment affects root phytochemical concentrations is not unexpected given the intimate association of roots and soil, but the complex interactions between <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> aboveground damage, and genotype, and their effects on root phytochemistry, are intriguing. Variation in root chemistry could have wide-reaching effects on <b>soil</b> microbial communities, <b>nutrient</b> cycling, and herbivores. Additionally, the response of phytochemicals to damage across organs can link different, spatially separated herbivores as they use different parts of the same plant resource...|$|R
30|$|Clearly, {{the same}} {{conclusions}} and recommendations about phosphorus {{can also be}} made about the other <b>soil</b> <b>nutrients,</b> nitrogen, potassium, sulphur, etc.; {{it is simply a}} matter of how hot the soil is heated (Figure 1). Consequently, the key to minimizing the impacts on <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status of slash-pile burns for certain, and possibly prescribed burns as well, is to minimize the soil temperatures during the burn. This suggests that empirical studies should be made of the soil heating associated with different geometrical arrangements and amounts of fuels in order to find an optimum amount and geometric arrangement of the fuel loading that will minimize the soil heating. Such studies should include investigations of post-burn <b>soil</b> <b>nutrient</b> status as well.|$|R
