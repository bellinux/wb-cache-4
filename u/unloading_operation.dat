40|$|This paper {{presents}} mathematical {{models that}} optimize {{the size of}} transportation fleet (cranes and trucks) for <b>unloading</b> <b>operations</b> at container terminals. A cyclic queue model is used to study the steady-state port throughput, which then yields the optimum fleet size for long-term operations. This model allows for stochastic operations such as exponentially distributed crane service times. In order to allow for generally distributed crane service times and truck travel times, an approach based on Markovian decision process is also proposed. This model provides dynamic operational policies for fleet management. Both models are implemented and examined with empirical data from the Port of Balboa, Panama. These models are also extended to <b>unloading</b> <b>operations</b> that involve multiple berths. ...|$|R

50|$|He {{recommended}} that freight services should mainly be for minerals and coal, {{and that the}} freight system made use of new containerised handling systems rather than less efficient and slower wagon-load traffic. This was eventually adopted with Freightliner. The coal-handling operations of BR were to be significantly modernised; the report recommended the adoption of merry-go round trains, with automated loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>operation</b> while on the move, for bulk industrial coal traffic and the thousands of coal sidings at individual stations for serving domestic coal demand being closed and consolidated into 292 new House Coal Concentration Depots, with mechanised coal handling equipment and supplied by more efficient block trains. Both these policies were successfully implemented. Beeching also recommended further electrification of the West Coast Main Line from Crewe to Glasgow in 1974. Staff terms and conditions were to be improved over time.|$|E

5000|$|Class leader EC 7 {{along with}} EO 3 was {{donated to the}} Tramway Historical Society upon withdrawal. Stored in the Linwood {{locomotive}} depot, the locomotive was transported to Ferrymead by road in 1972, where it nearly ran away during the <b>unloading</b> <b>operation.</b> The two electric locomotives were stored by the tramway section until 1977 when the THS handed the two locomotives over to the Ferrymead Railway-based Electric Traction Group. Both locomotives were shifted onto the railway tracks using electrical leads off the 600V DC tramway overhead and several tracksets, which were moved with the locomotives to the railway. In 1978, part of the Ferrymead line at Moorhouse station was fitted with overhead catenary and in 1980, some test runs were done with EC 7 at 600V using the tramway power supply. This led to the acquisition of three mercury-arc rectifiers to power the railway, {{as well as the}} trams and trolley-buses.|$|E
50|$|The dock {{landing ship}} {{returned}} to Saipan {{for a second}} load of LCMs that afternoon and made the trip back to Tinian the following morning. Although mortar fire from shore forced her to retire seaward, Belle Grove resumed unloading cargo late on the 25th. She went to Saipan again in the evening, loaded a third cargo of LCMs, and returned to Tinian the next morning. During the ensuing <b>unloading</b> <b>operation,</b> rough seas caused a water surge in the well deck that slammed several landing craft against the cargo deck. The aftermost LCMs dropped their ramps and filled with water, sinking in the well deck. Salvage work quickly restored the craft to service, however, and the unloading continued without incident. Later that afternoon, DUKWs from the beach came alongside to receive tank ammunition and water, then the ship returned to Saipan. On 28 July, after Belle Grove delivered another cargo of water and ammunition to Tinian, she formed up with TransDiv 7 and began the voyage to Hawaii.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 July, after a rough transit {{which had}} taken her through the {{developing}} Typhoon [...] "Ora", the cargo ship returned to Vietnam at Cam Ranh Bay. The next day, she embarked men and equipment of the Army's 572rd Light Equipment Company for transportation north to Tuy Hòa. She anchored there the same day and began unloading. That operation lasted two days and proved difficult and hazardous due to the soft sand beach, large numbers of fishing craft and equipment crowding the area, and large amounts of debris. On the 29th, she headed north from Tuy Hòa to evacuate a South Vietnamese unit from Qui Nhơn. That reverse amphibious operation saved the unit the heavy casualties it would have sustained fighting its way south along routes held by strong insurgent forces. Winston departed Qui Nhơn on 31 July and delivered the South Vietnamese troops to Tuy Hòa that same day. Over {{the next three days}} and nights, she completed another difficult <b>unloading</b> <b>operation</b> complicated by the proximity of the enemy and the possibility of hostile fishing craft. She departed the Vietnamese coast on 3 August and, after a stop at Okinawa, arrived at Yokosuka on the 11th. A week later, she headed home, stopped at Pearl Harbor from 27 to 29 August, arrived back in San Diego on 5 September, and resumed local operations along the southern California coast.|$|E

5000|$|One recent {{proposal}} to bring cargo tramways back into wider use {{was the plan}} by City Cargo Amsterdam to reintroduce them into the city of Amsterdam. In the spring of 2007 the city piloted this cargo tram operation, which among its aims aimed to reduce particulate pollution in the city by 20% by halving the number of lorries (5,000) unloading {{in the inner city}} during the permitted timeframe from 07:00 till 10:30. The pilot involved two cargo trams, operating from a distribution centre and delivering to a [...] "hub" [...] where special electric trucks delivered the trams' small containers to their final destination. The trial was successful, releasing an intended investment of €100 million in a fleet of 52 cargo trams distributing from four peripheral [...] "cross docks" [...] to 15 inner-city hubs by 2012. These specially built vehicles would be 30 ft long with 12 axles and a payload of 30 t. On weekdays, trams are planned to make 4 deliveries per hour between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m. and two per hour between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. With each <b>unloading</b> <b>operation</b> taking on average 10 minutes, this means that each site would be active for 40 minutes out of each hour during the morning rush hour. In early 2009 the scheme was suspended owing to the financial crisis impeding fund-raising.|$|E
