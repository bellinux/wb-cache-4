5|$|As time passed, {{specific}} {{laws were}} introduced to deal with particular situations as they were judged to require intervention, most particularly alongside the rise of mechanisation and <b>urbanisation</b> during the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Didsbury {{was largely}} rural until the mid-19th century, when it {{underwent}} development and <b>urbanisation</b> during the Industrial Revolution. It {{became part of}} Manchester in 1904.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's <b>urbanisation</b> and {{expansion}} largely coincided with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era. A late 19th century factory-building boom transformed Chadderton from a rural township {{into a major}} mill town—one of several in its region—and the second most populous urban district in the United Kingdom. More than 50cotton mills had been built in Chadderton by 1914.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th century, <b>urbanisation</b> {{affected}} Hale Barns, {{turning the}} place from an agricultural village into the commuter settlement it is today, focused around 'The Square'– a shopping precinct. Its main A538 road– Hale Road– {{runs through the}} centre of Hale Barns and leads towards Manchester Airport and Wilmslow.|$|E
5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester began {{to show signs of}} <b>urbanisation,</b> and {{it is likely that the}} {{sequence}} of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.|$|E
5|$|Haphazard {{industrial}} planning, increased <b>urbanisation,</b> {{poverty and}} lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major Nigerian cities. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute waterways and groundwater.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{suffering}} badly from <b>urbanisation,</b> housing development, mining development, {{and expansion of}} agricultural lands. Habitats are also being destroyed by large herbivores trampling the grass and overgrowth, making camouflage difficult. Forest fires and weeds also contribute to habitat destruction.|$|E
5|$|The Bridgewater Canal {{reached the}} town in 1765, {{stimulating}} Sale's <b>urbanisation.</b> The arrival of the railway in 1849 triggered Sale's growth as a commuter town for Manchester, leading to an influx of middle class residents; {{by the end of}} the 19th century the town's population had more than tripled. Agriculture gradually declined as service industries boomed.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} {{is listed as}} Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Major threats to the jungle cat include habitat loss such as the {{destruction}} of wetlands, dam construction, environmental pollution, industrialisation and <b>urbanisation.</b> Illegal hunting is a threat in Turkey and Iran. Its rarity in Southeast Asia is possibly due {{to high levels of}} hunting.|$|E
5|$|The mallard is {{considered}} an invasive species in New Zealand, where it competes with the local New Zealand grey duck, which was overhunted in the past. There, and elsewhere, mallards are spreading with increasing <b>urbanisation</b> and hybridising with local relatives.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{world was}} a much less urban society than either the Roman Empire or the modern world. The fall of the Roman Empire had caused a catastrophic de-population of the towns and cities that had existed within the Empire. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, however, {{a revival of the}} European city occurred, with an {{increase}} in the <b>urbanisation</b> of society.|$|E
5|$|A common {{preference}} is {{to include the}} modern borough of Tower Hamlets, and the former parish and borough of Shoreditch (this includes Hoxton and Haggerston {{and is now the}} southern part of the modern London Borough of Hackney). This version makes the East End conterminous with the Tower Division of Middlesex under the borders that area had in the 19th century when the East End completed the process of <b>urbanisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{recorded}} in small numbers sporadically throughout twentieth century {{it was not}} until the 1980s that Grey-headed flying foxes routinely visited Melbourne. Since the 1990s their permanent colony in Melbourne has been postulated as possibly due to habitat loss in their northern range, greater supply of reliable food by native eucalypt plantings and backyard fruit trees, climate change, and increase <b>urbanisation</b> leading to warmer temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{has several}} British-style public schools, which attract pupils {{from all over}} India and a few {{neighbouring}} countries. The varied culture of the town reflects its diverse demographic milieu comprising indigenous Bengali, Nepali, Lepcha, Bhutia, Tibetan, and other mainland Indian ethno-linguistic groups. Darjeeling, alongside its neighbouring town of Kalimpong, was {{the centre of the}} Gorkhaland movement in the 1980s. The town's fragile ecology has been threatened by a rising demand for environmental resources, stemming from growing tourist traffic and poorly planned <b>urbanisation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Britain, {{political}} attitudes favoured {{free trade}} and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise. During the 19th Century, Britain's population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid <b>urbanisation,</b> which caused significant social and economic stresses. To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Benjamin Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the modern}} era, Cluj's {{population}} experienced two phases of rapid growth, {{the first in}} the late 19th century, when the city grew in importance and size, and the second during the Communist period, when a massive <b>urbanisation</b> campaign was launched and many people migrated from rural areas and from beyond the Carpathians to the county's capital. About two-thirds of the population growth during this era was based on net migration inflows; after 1966, the date of Ceaușescu's ban on abortion and contraception, natural increase was also significant, being responsible for the remaining third.|$|E
5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} {{is threatened}} by <b>urbanisation</b> and development in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates the Industrial Revolution, and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution {{had a profound effect on}} both on population and <b>urbanisation,</b> as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures {{during summer}} {{generally}} reach {{a maximum of}} 40°C and a minimum of 26.3°C, although temperatures up to 42°C are not uncommon. Winter temperatures range between 29.6°C and 18°C. A study based on the data available with the Indian Meteorological Department on Madurai {{over a period of}} 62 years indicate rising trend in atmospheric temperature over Madurai city, attributed to <b>urbanisation,</b> growth of vehicles and industrial activity. The maximum temperature of 42°C for the decade of 2001 – 2010 was recorded in 2004 and in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{species are}} native to meadows and woods in {{southern}} Europe and North Africa with {{a center of}} diversity in the Western Mediterranean, particularly the Iberian peninsula. Both wild and cultivated plants have naturalised widely, and were introduced into the Far East prior to the tenth century. Narcissi tend to be long-lived bulbs, which propagate by division, but are also insect-pollinated. Known pests, diseases and disorders include viruses, fungi, the larvae of flies, mites and nematodes. Some Narcissus species have become extinct, while others are threatened by increasing <b>urbanisation</b> and tourism.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} trishaw {{services}} although this service is dying fast {{and is not}} as extensive as {{the ones in the}} states of Malacca and Penang. In Kuala Terengganu, pedestrian-pulled rickshaws were gradually replaced by trishaws (beca in Malay). Trishaws were ubiquitous up to the 1970s in cities. Since then, rapid <b>urbanisation</b> has increased demand for more efficient public transport, resulting in dwindling trishaw numbers. Today, trishaws are operated mostly as a tourist attraction in Kuala Terengganu. The city's only taxi rank stands nearby to the city's bus terminal.|$|E
5|$|Though the <b>urbanisation</b> of Gateshead {{around it}} has detracted from the {{panoramic}} views of western Gateshead {{that were once}} enjoyed by residents, at elevated positions views of Lobley Hill, Team Valley and Dunston Hill can be glimpsed. Although now a suburb of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, the openness and greenspace prevalent in Low Fell means that the suburb continues to enjoy a rural feel, which is an unusual trait in the modern Gatshead conurbation.|$|E
5|$|With <b>urbanisation,</b> {{distinctive}} urban accents {{have arisen}} which often differ greatly from the historical accents {{of the surrounding}} rural areas and sometimes share features with Southern English accents. Northern English dialects remain {{an important part of}} the culture of the region, and the desire of speakers to assert their local identity has led to accents such as Scouse and Geordie becoming more distinctive and spreading into surrounding areas.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, Gaudí was working on numerous projects simultaneously. They reflected his shift to a more personal style inspired by nature. In 1900, he received an award for the best building of the year from the Barcelona City Council for his Casa Calvet. During {{the first decade of the}} century Gaudí dedicated himself to projects like the Casa Figueras (Figueras house, better known as Bellesguard), the Park Güell, an unsuccessful <b>urbanisation</b> project, and the restoration of the Cathedral of Palma de Mallorca, for which he visited Majorca several times. Between 1904 and 1910 he constructed the Casa Batlló (Batlló house) and the Casa Milà (Milá house), two of his most emblematic works.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{being the}} capital city, Kota Kinabalu {{is also the}} main {{industrial}} and commercial centre for Sabah. The economy {{is dominated by the}} primary sector of industry. Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid <b>urbanisation</b> and economic development, this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E
5|$|Chadderton's modern {{commercial}} centre lies {{close to}} the boundary with Oldham; the expansion of Oldham in the mid-19th century caused <b>urbanisation</b> along the eastern boundary of Chadderton, which spread outwards {{into the rest of}} the township. Continued growth in the late-19th and early-20th centuries gave rise to a densely populated, industrial landscape of factories and rows of terraced housing, typical of mill towns in Northern England. There is a mixture of high-density urban areas, suburbs and semi-rural locations in Chadderton, but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The soils of Chadderton are sand based, with subsoils of clay and gravel.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{overwhelmingly}} {{controlled by}} Protestant and Catholic missions, which were {{also responsible for}} providing limited medical and welfare support to the rural Congolese. Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government. One {{of the consequences of}} the Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, particularly for the black population, was significant <b>urbanisation.</b> Just 9% of the indigenous population lived in cities in 1938; by 1950, the figure stood at close to 20%. The colonial authorities arrested enemy aliens in the Congo and confiscated their property in 1940.|$|E
5|$|Industrialisation, <b>urbanisation</b> and the Disruption of 1843 all {{undermined}} {{the tradition of}} parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards. The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing {{the educational needs of}} youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class. The University of St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} stems {{largely from the}} habitat loss and fragmentation produced by the human appropriation of land for development, forestry and agriculture as natural capital is progressively converted to man-made capital. Land use change is fundamental to {{the operations of the}} biosphere because alterations in the relative proportions of land dedicated to <b>urbanisation,</b> agriculture, forest, woodland, grassland and pasture have a marked effect on the global water, carbon and nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and this can impact negatively on both natural and human systems. At the local human scale, major sustainability benefits accrue from sustainable parks and gardens and green cities.|$|E
5|$|Malvern's rapid <b>urbanisation</b> {{during the}} latter half of the 19th century spread eastwards and northwards from Great Malvern, the {{traditional}} town centre on the steep flank of the Worcestershire Beacon, and engulfed the manors and farms in the immediate area. It was often the farms, such as Pickersleigh (now known as Pickersleigh Court and previously known as Pickersleigh House), near Great Malvern, and the Howsells in Malvern Link which merged with Great Malvern in 1900 that gave their names to many of the new neighbourhoods. The urban agglomeration continued to spread, and by the middle of the 20th century had reached the suburban parishes of West Malvern, Malvern Wells, Newland, Madresfield, and Guarlford.|$|E
5|$|Northern England or the North of England, {{also known}} simply as the North, is the {{northern}} part of England, considered as a single cultural area. It extends from the Scottish border in the north to near the River Trent in the south, although precise definitions of its southern extent vary. Northern England approximately comprises three statistical regions: the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber. These have a combined population of around 14.9 million as of the 2011 Census and an area of 37,331km2 (14,414 sq mi). Northern England contains much of England's national parkland but also has large areas of <b>urbanisation,</b> including the conurbations of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Teesside, Tyneside, Wearside, South and West Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Royton has the {{distinction}} of being the first town where a powered cotton mill was built; at Thorp in 1764, {{and is one of the}} first localities in the world to have adopted the factory system. The introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution facilitated a process of unplanned <b>urbanisation</b> in the area, and by the mid-19th century Royton had emerged as a mill town. At its zenith, there were 40cotton mills—some of the largest in the United Kingdom—employing 80% of the local population. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in Royton's textile industry during the mid-20th century, and its last mill closed in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the early}} modern period the food of England has {{historically}} been characterised by its simplicity of approach and a reliance on the high quality of natural produce. During the Middle Ages and through the Renaissance period, English cuisine enjoyed an excellent reputation, though a decline began during the Industrial Revolution with the {{move away from the}} land and increasing <b>urbanisation</b> of the populace. The cuisine of England has, however, recently undergone a revival, which has been recognised by the food critics with some good ratings in Restaurants best restaurant in the world charts. An early book of English recipes is the Forme of Cury from the royal court of Richard II.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} sparsely {{populated}} {{until after the}} Second World War, though excavations have revealed evidence of Paleolithic and Iron Age activity in Southcote, as well as Roman and Saxon habitation. By the time William the Conqueror undertook the Domesday Survey in 1086, Southcote was sufficiently established to warrant a Lord of the Manor, who {{at that time was}} William de Braose. From the 16th century onwards, Southcote Manor was owned by the Blagrave family, who sold the manor house in the 1920s. The area was subsequently developed into housing: much of the land changed from agricultural to residential. A large proportion of the land in Southcote not used for housing is classified as flood-meadow, providing flood plains between <b>urbanisation</b> and the River Kennet.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution initiated {{a process of}} rapid and unplanned <b>urbanisation.</b> A building boom began in Crompton during the mid-19th century, when suitable land for factories in Oldham was becoming scarce. By the late 19th century Crompton had emerged as a densely populated mill town. Forty-eight cotton mills—some {{of the largest in}} the United Kingdom—have been recorded as existing in the area. At its spinning zenith, {{as a result of an}} interwar economic boom associated with the textile industry, Shaw and Crompton was reported to have had more millionaires per capita than any other town in the world. Imports of foreign cotton goods began the decline in the region's textile industry during the mid-20th century; Shaw and Crompton's last mill closed in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, immigration, <b>urbanisation</b> and {{industrialisation}} {{transformed the}} territories, destroying the old frontier way of life. Three million immigrants arrived in Canada between 1910 and 1914, many of them from eastern Europe, and over half of them settled in the territories. The urban population grew significantly as new towns were established across the Prairies. Many of the immigrants were employed by the growing industries of the region, especially the large mining and manufacturing centres enabled by the Canadian Pacific Railway. As society changed, there were fears of immigrants and criminals exploiting the new rail network.|$|E
