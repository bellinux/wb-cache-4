5|$|A {{thorough}} technical investigation {{including a}} pigment analysis of Las Meninas was conducted around 1981 in Museo Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the baroque period frequently used by Vel√°zquez {{in his other}} paintings. The main pigments <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> painting were lead white, azurite (for the skirt of the kneeling menina), vermilion and red lake, ochres and carbon blacks.|$|E
5|$|Crushed shells {{are added}} as a {{calcareous}} {{supplement to the}} diet of laying poultry. Oyster shell and cockle shell are often <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose and are obtained as a by-product from other industries.|$|E

5|$|Home {{propagation}} is best {{performed by}} using offset bulbils. Commercially, only cultivars that produce {{at least three}} bulbils on the mother bulb are <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> form of propagation. Plants grown from this method take {{three to four years}} to bloom.|$|E
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{americium}} {{is obtained}} by reduction from its compounds. Americium(III) fluoride was first <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose. The reaction was conducted using elemental barium as reducing agent in a water- and oxygen-free environment inside an apparatus made of tantalum and tungsten.|$|E

5|$|Metallic curium is {{obtained}} {{by reduction of}} its compounds. Initially, curium(III) fluoride was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose.

5|$|Rhenium in {{the form}} of rhenium-platinum alloy is used as {{catalyst}} for catalytic reforming, which is a chemical process to convert petroleum refinery naphthas with low octane ratings into high-octane liquid products. Worldwide, 30% of catalysts <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> process contain rhenium. The olefin metathesis is the other reaction for which rhenium is used as catalyst. Normally Re2O7 on alumina is <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> process. Rhenium catalysts are very resistant to chemical poisoning from nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus, and so are used in certain kinds of hydrogenation reactions.|$|E
5|$|Strontium {{chloride}} {{is sometimes}} used in toothpastes for sensitive teeth. One popular brand includes 10% total {{strontium chloride hexahydrate}} by weight. Small amounts {{are used in the}} refining of zinc to remove small amounts of lead impurities. The metal itself has a limited use as a getter, to remove unwanted gases in vacuums by reacting with them, although barium may also be <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose.|$|E
50|$|The most {{suitable}} indicator to <b>use</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> type of titration is one, like Methyl orange, that changes color at low pH.|$|R

5|$|The Clark family {{mansion and}} its estate {{at the edge}} of the village are now owned by Millfield School. The company, through the Society of Friends, also had its own small {{sanatorium}} and convalescent home on Ivythorn Hill overlooking the town. In 1931, the chalet-style building was leased to the Youth Hostel Association and became the first youth hostel in Somerset. It is still <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose.|$|E
5|$|The name Amanita inaurata, {{given by}} Swiss mycologist Louis Secretan in 1833, {{has also been}} <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> species. In 1978, the name was {{declared}} nomenclaturally incorrect {{according to the rules}} of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Other synonyms are Agaricus ceciliae, Amanitopsis inaurata and Amanitopsis ceciliae. The present name, Amanita ceciliae, was given by Cornelis Bas, a Dutch mycologist, in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The same {{material}} also functions in newer alkaline batteries (usually battery cells), which {{use the same}} basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000tons of manganese dioxide was <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose.|$|E

5|$|A key {{development}} of the testing program was a miss-distance indicator system, which independently measured {{the distance between the}} Zeus and the target at the instant the computers initiated the detonation of the warhead. There were concerns that if the Zeus' own radars were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> ranging measure, any systematic error in ranging would also be present in the test data, and thus would be hidden. The solution was the use of a separate UHF-frequency transmitter in the warhead reentry vehicle, and a receiver in the Zeus. The received signal was retransmitted to the ground, where its Doppler shift was examined to extract the range information. These instruments eventually demonstrated that the Zeus' own tracking information was accurate. For visual tracking, a small conventional warhead was used, which provided a flash that could be seen on long exposure photographs of the interceptions.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively {{pig iron}} {{may be made}} into steel (with up to about 2% carbon) or wrought iron (commercially pure iron). Various {{processes}} have been <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> including finery forges, puddling furnaces, Bessemer converters, open hearth furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, and electric arc furnaces. In all cases, {{the objective is to}} oxidize {{some or all of the}} carbon, together with other impurities. On the other hand, other metals may be added to make alloy steels.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a shuttle service. In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
5|$|American Airlines Flight 191 was a {{regularly}} scheduled passenger flight operated by American Airlines from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago to Los Angeles International Airport. A McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> flight on May 25, 1979, crashed moments after takeoff from Chicago. All 258 passengers and 13 crew on board were killed, {{along with two}} people on the ground. It is the deadliest aviation accident to {{have occurred in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is <b>used</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays. The average values for the glass mixture determined for a recycling study in 2005 is 8.5% strontium oxide and 10% barium oxide.|$|E
