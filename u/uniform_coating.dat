25|$|Screening the fibre {{involves}} using a mesh {{made from}} non-corroding and inert material, such as aluminium, which is stretched {{in a wooden}} frame {{similar to that of}} a window. The size of the paper is governed {{by the size of the}} frame. This tool is then completely submerged in the solution vertically and drawn out horizontally to ensure a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> of the wire mesh. Excess water is then removed and the wet mat of fibre laid on top of a damp cloth. The process is repeated for the required number of sheets. This stack of wet mats is then pressed in a hydraulic press very gently to ensure the fibre does not squeeze out. The fairly damp fibre is then dried using a variety of methods, such as vacuum drying or simply air drying. Sometimes, the individual sheet is rolled to flatten, harden, and refine the surface. Finally, the paper is then cut to the desired shape or the standard shape (A4, letter, legal, etc.) and packed.|$|E

50|$|Rotational molding {{machines}} {{are made in}} a wide range of sizes. They normally consist of molds, an oven, a cooling chamber, and mold spindles. The spindles are mounted on a rotating axis, which provides a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> of the plastic inside each mold.|$|E
50|$|Solvent - this is {{the bulk}} of the paint, it is used to keep the paint {{workable}} when it is wet. After paint is applied to a surface the solvent evaporates, the pigment and binder will coalesce together to form a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating.</b> The solvent is water for water-based paints, and an oil for oil-based paints.|$|E
50|$|In {{conventional}} {{black and}} white (B&W) televisions, the CRT screen has a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> of phosphor that emits white light when struck by electrons. The beam from an electron gun {{at the back of}} the tube is deflected (most commonly) by the varying fields from magnetic coils so it may be directed at any point on the screen. Electronic circuits known as time base generators pull the beam across the tube and down, creating the scanning pattern used in television signals.|$|E

50|$|It {{is common}} to place a drop of the test {{solution}} on a metal disk which is then dried out to give a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> on the disk. This is then used as the test sample. If {{the thickness of the}} layer formed on the disk is too thick then the lines of the spectrum are broadened to lower energies. This is because some of the energy of the alpha particles is lost during their movement through the layer of active material.|$|E
50|$|There {{actually}} is no chemical bond between paint and an underlying surface. Paint adheres simply through physical forces like Van der Waals. When paint is first {{applied to a}} surface it goes on as a thick wet coating. As the solvent is allowed to evaporate out, the pigment plates which are attracted to one another stack up to form layers. The binder polymerizes essentially locking the pigment plates together. What you are left with is a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> of binder and pigment. Anti-graffiti coatings make paints unable {{to adhere to the}} surface.|$|E

50|$|In a {{color display}} the <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> of white {{phosphor}} {{is replaced by}} dots or lines of three colored phosphors, producing red, green or blue light (RGB color model) when excited. When excited {{in the same fashion}} as a B&W tube, the three phosphors give off different amount of these primary colors, which mix in the human eye to produce a single apparent color. In order to produce the same resolution as the B&W display, a color screen needs to have three times the resolution. This presents a problem for conventional electron guns, which cannot be focused or positioned accurately enough to hit these much smaller individual patterns.|$|E
50|$|The penetron was {{original}} {{designed by}} Koller and Williams {{while working at}} General Electric (GE). It was initially developed as a novel way to build a single-gun color television with the simplicity of a conventional B&W set. Like the B&W tube, it used a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> of phosphor on the display with a single electron gun at the rear. However, the phosphor coating is applied in layers of different colors, red on the inside closest to the gun, and blue on the outside closest to the front face of the tube. Colors were selected by increasing {{the power of the}} electron beam, which allowed the electrons to flow through any lower layers to reach the proper color.|$|E

In 1935 Tishler visited Winter in Cleveland and was introduced to Winter’s enameling method, where the metal is dipped into liquid enamel leading to a more <b>uniform</b> <b>coating.</b> Tishler moved with his wife Sadye to Florida in 1969.

50|$|Although {{anodizing}} {{produces a}} very regular and <b>uniform</b> <b>coating,</b> microscopic fissures in the coating {{can lead to}} corrosion. Further, the coating is susceptible to chemical dissolution {{in the presence of}} high- and low-pH chemistry, which results in stripping the coating and corrosion of the substrate. To combat this, various techniques have been developed either {{to reduce the number of}} fissures, to insert more chemically stable compounds into the oxide, or both. For instance, sulfuric-anodized articles are normally sealed, either through hydro-thermal sealing or precipitating sealing, to reduce porosity and interstitial pathways that allow corrosive ion exchange between the surface and the substrate. Precipitating seals enhance chemical stability but are less effective in eliminating ion exchange pathways. Most recently, new techniques to partially convert the amorphous oxide coating into more stable micro-crystalline compounds have been developed that have shown significant improvement based on shorter bond lengths.|$|E

30|$|This {{technique}} has excellent adherence, <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> thickness and typical coating thickness of 3 – 5  µm. The various applications are cutting tools, forming tools, components, medical devices and decorative items. In this process, {{there is no}} environmentally harmful material, emissions and no toxic reaction materials [103]. There are great varieties of coatings which can be produced. The coating temperature lies below the final heat treatment temperature {{of most of the}} steels. It produces small, precisely reproducible coating thickness. This process has low friction coefficient and high wear resistance. Slots, bore holes, etc. can only be coated down to a depth equal to the width or diameter of the opening. To attain a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> thickness, the parts to be coated should be rotated uniformly during processing [104].|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} time {{evolution}} of a thin liquid film coating the outer surface of a sphere {{in the presence of}} gravity, surface tension and thermal gradients. We derive the fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation that models the thin film dynamics, including Marangoni terms arising from the dependence of surface tension on temperature. We consider two different imposed temperature distributions with axial or radial thermal gradients. We analyze the stability of a <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> under small perturbations and carry out numerical simulations in COMSOL for a range of parameter values. In the case of an axial temperature gradient, we find steady states with either uniform film thickness, or with the fluid accumulating at the bottom or {{near the top of the}} sphere, depending on the total volume of liquid in the film, dictating whether gravity or Marangoni effects dominate. In the case of a radial temperature gradient, a stability analysis reveals the most unstable non-axisymmetric modes on an initially <b>uniform</b> <b>coating</b> film...|$|E
