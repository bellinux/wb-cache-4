In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) takes some of the office staff on a field trip to Gettysburg for inspiration. Meanwhile, the rest of the office, under orders from Robert California (James Spader), are tasked with coming <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> business idea for Dunder Mifflin. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) proposes several vending machine ideas that capture California's imagination.|$|E
5|$|During this {{conflict}} and others during the 1880s, Carte and Helen Lenoir frequently worked to smooth over the partners' differences using {{a mixture of}} friendship and business acumen. Sullivan asked {{to be released from}} the partnership on several occasions. Nevertheless, Carte was able to coax eight comic operas out of his partners in the 1880s. When Princess Ida closed after a comparatively short run of nine months, {{for the first time in}} the partnership's history, the next opera was not ready. Gilbert first suggested a plot in which people fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge – a scenario that Sullivan had previously rejected. Gilbert eventually came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> idea and began work in May 1884.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{assumed that}} the arsenic used to poison the victims had come from rat poison, but when common adulterants used in rat poison {{failed to show up}} in autopsies, they were forced to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> theory. It was unlikely that the illiterate sisters {{would have been able to}} acquire arsenic through the usual method of visiting a chemist, a route more open to doctors than spinsters. Eventually it was discovered that common flypaper at the time contained arsenic, and that by soaking the flypaper in water, a solution substantially identical – including the same adulterants – to that found in a bottle at the Higgins residence could be obtained.|$|E
5|$|Now {{without the}} Hot Band or a {{recording}} contract, Sylvester set himself <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> band, The Four As, {{and a new}} set of backing singers, two black drag queens named Jerry Kirby and Lady Bianca. With this new entourage, he continued to perform at a number of local venues including Jewel's Catch One, a predominantly black gay dance club on West Pico Avenue in Los Angeles, but reviewers were unimpressed with the new line-up, most of whom abandoned Sylvester in December 1974. After a brief sojourn in England, Sylvester returned to San Francisco and assembled three young drag queens to be backing singers: Arnold Elzie, Leroy Davis, and Gerry Kirby. Nevertheless, although he performed at such events as the 1975 Castro Street Fair, success continued to elude him, and he eventually fired Elzie, Davis, and Kirby.|$|E

He guaranteed that if a hunter employed his service and paid his fee, he would get the big game animal desired or Knievel would refund his fee. Business was very good until game wardens realized that Knievel was taking his clients into Yellowstone National Park to find prey. The Park Service ordered Knievel to cease this poaching.|$|E

25|$|The road to {{the airport}} was {{frequently}} closed and in 1978 a dorm was built to allow the employees to overnight should they get caught by a blizzard. A new fire station {{was built in the}} early 1980s. This allowed Widerøe to introduce the de Havilland Canada Dash 7 on the route from Florø and Sogndal to Oslo Airport, Fornebu in September 1983. This was followed <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> and larger terminal and the renovation of the tower in 1985.

In 1922, when Disney began his Laugh-O-Gram cartoon series, Iwerks joined him as chief animator. The studio went bankrupt, however, and in 1923 Iwerks followed Disney's move to Los Angeles to work on a new series of cartoons known as “the Alice Comedies” which had live action mixed with animation. After the end of this series, Disney asked Iwerks to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> character. The first Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was animated entirely by Iwerks. Following the first cartoon, Oswald was redesigned on the insistence of Universal, who agreed to distribute the new series of cartoons in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Overwatch {{came about}} in the {{aftermath}} of Blizzard's decision to cancel the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Titan in 2013, a project that had been in development for about seven years. While most others assigned to the project were transferred to other departments within Blizzard, a small team of about 40 people, led by director Jeff Kaplan, were tasked to come <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> concept for a game in a few months. After some brainstorming, they came onto the idea of a hero team-based shooter, building upon the success of games like Team Fortress 2 and multiplayer online battle arenas. They started with assets developed for Titan to demonstrate the proof-of-concept, and were greenlit to build out the full game, the first new intellectual property that Blizzard had developed since StarCraft.|$|E
25|$|However, the War Office {{judged the}} Tett turret {{to be too}} cramped and not {{bulletproof}} against heavy fire, its isolated nature did not allow adequate command and control and the open top was vulnerable to a well-thrown grenade. The most striking feature was {{that the only way}} in and out was through the top – {{there was no way to}} escape without being exposed to enemy fire – it was to be a fight to the death. Burbridge went back to the drawing board and came <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> version that instead of being positioned over a pipe was placed on a concrete slab over an underground chamber of brick or concrete slabs. This allowed access from a tunnel or slit trench to the rear. The company's brochure shows a wooden seat suspended from the turret by a metal frame.|$|E
