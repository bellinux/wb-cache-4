5|$|Days {{after the}} 2011 {{parliamentary}} elections in early December 2011, {{it was suggested}} by Vesna Pusić– already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs– that the referendum should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll. The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that the referendum be postponed until mid-February or later; its request was also supported by five major trade unions. GONG's request was made {{because of what they}} stated to be: poor information provided to citizens; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter's permanent residence; unclear directions for voting abroad; no legal provisions specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan, non-partisan and foreign monitors; no legal provisions regarding referendum funding (since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses); no legal provisions funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself; and the lack of restrictions against campaigning {{on the day of the}} referendum. The <b>union</b> <b>support</b> for this request was due to the government's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum (altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures), which they had earlier agreed to do. Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government, demanding that the referendum be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) returned the final verdict in the case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač. They cited concerns over EU support for the ICTY, which they describe as biased; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others.|$|E
5|$|In August 1990 several leading {{officials}} {{tried to}} persuade Gorbachev to force Ryzhkov to resign from his post. Gorbachev did not bow to this pressure, fearing that Ryzhkov's removal would lead to increased activity by many of his pro-republican first secretaries and Politburo members. Ryzhkov's numerous supporters were not concerned about policy issues; they backed him simply because he opposed some of Gorbachev's economic and political reforms. In July 1990, as the Politburo underwent restructuring at the 28th Party Congress, all government officials except Gorbachev and Vladimir Ivashko, the Deputy General Secretary, were excluded with Ryzhkov losing his Politburo seat by default. Nevertheless, Ryzhkov, along with many others, was elected {{a member of the}} Presidential Council. On 19 October 1990 the Russian Supreme Soviet, by a vote of 164 to 1 with 16 abstentions, forced the resignation of Ryzhkov and his cabinet and the implementation of the 500 Days Programme. In stark contrast, Supreme Soviet of the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>support</b> for Ryzhkov's economic reform plan increased. Ryzhkov's economic reform plan was passed by an overwhelming majority, with 1,532 deputies in favour, 419 against and 44 deputies abstaining. The parliamentary Interregional Group's vote of no confidence in Ryzhkov's government also failed, with 199 members in favour of Ryzhkov and his cabinet's resignation, 1,685 against and 99 abstaining. As the result of a propaganda war launched against Ryzhkov by Gorbachev supporters, several leading members of the Council of Ministers and its Presidium urged Ryzhkov to resign so that the Soviet Government could reach a compromise with the Russian Government. To make matters worse, the Russian Government which was headed by Ivan Silayev, stopped following Ryzhkov's orders, and Silayev refused to visit the Moscow Kremlin.|$|E
25|$|A poll {{conducted}} by Angus Reid in July 2010 showed that 78% of people supported either same-sex marriage or civil union for same-sex couples, with 41% opting for same-sex marriage and 37% opting for civil <b>union.</b> <b>Support</b> for no legal unions for same-sex couples decreased by 3% from August 2009.|$|E

Nixon general counsel Charles Colson, in charge of developing a strategy to win <b>union</b> <b>support</b> for Nixon in the 1972 presidential election, identified Brennan as a friendly labor leader due to his role in organizing the counter-protests of May 8, 16, and 20. Brennan later met privately with Nixon on Labor Day.|$|E
25|$|Harkin ran for President in 1992 as {{a populist}} with labor <b>union</b> <b>support.</b> He criticized George H. W. Bush for {{being out of}} touch with working-class Americans. Harkin was an early {{favorite}} in a small field of five candidates. Harkin won the Iowa caucus and those in Idaho and Minnesota (with help from Senator Paul Wellstone), but he ran poorly in New Hampshire and other primaries and ultimately lost the Democratic Party nomination to Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Harkin was the first Democratic primary contender to drop out and throw his support behind Clinton — a favor that led to a close relationship throughout the Clinton presidency.|$|E

25|$|Although Kim's early successes led him {{to predict}} he would end the war {{by the end of}} August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic. To counter a {{possible}} U.S. deployment, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet <b>Union</b> <b>support</b> Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang. Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea. Lei concluded that MacArthur would most likely attempt a landing at Incheon. After conferring with Mao that this would be MacArthur's most likely strategy, Zhou briefed Soviet and North Korean advisers of Lei's findings, and issued orders to Chinese army commanders deployed on the Korean border to prepare for U.S. naval activity in the Korea Strait.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Senator Tom Harkin (Iowa) ran as {{a populist}} liberal with labor <b>union</b> <b>support.</b> Former U.S. Senator Paul Tsongas (Massachusetts) {{highlighted}} his political independence and fiscal conservatism. Former California Governor Jerry Brown, {{who had run}} for the Democratic nomination in 1976 and 1980 {{while he was still}} Governor, declared a significant reform agenda, including Congressional term limits, campaign finance reform, and the adoption of a flat income tax. Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey was an attractive candidate based on his business and military background, but made several gaffes on the campaign trail. Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton positioned himself as a centrist, or New Democrat. He was still relatively unknown nationally before the primary season. That quickly changed however, when a woman named Gennifer Flowers appeared in the press to reveal allegations of an affair. Clinton rebutted the story by appearing on 60 Minutes with his wife, Hillary Clinton.|$|E
500|$|As [...] fascism and militarism {{advanced}} in Europe, Lansbury's pacifist stance drew {{criticism from the}} trades union elements of his party—who controlled the majority of party conference votes. Walter Citrine, the TUC general secretary, commented that Lansbury [...] "thinks the country should be without defence of any kind... it certainly isn't our policy." [...] The party's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, {{under the shadow of}} Italy's impending invasion of Abyssinia. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, [...] which Lansbury opposed [...] as a form of economic warfare. His speech—a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism—was well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers' Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a [...] policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression, and accused him of [...] "hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be told what to do with it". <b>Union</b> <b>support</b> ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later.|$|E

500|$|Both {{candidates}} {{started the}} campaign well-funded. Sestak {{had more than}} $3 million available from his House fund to use toward starting a Senate campaign, and raised an additional $1 million by June 30, 2009, which brought his total to about $4.2 million. Sestak called it the largest campaign war-chest of any Senate challenger. Specter, however, was ahead with $6.7 million in campaign funding as of March 31. Sestak also faced challenges arising from his low name recognition and Specter's support among high-profile members of the Democratic establishment, like Obama and Biden. Specter spent {{the early months of}} his campaign trying to reestablish and strengthen his Democratic credentials, seeking <b>union</b> <b>support</b> and making speeches highlighting his support of positions supported by the party, such as the economic stimulus package, reforming health care, increasing the minimum wage, protecting abortion rights and supporting stem cell research. In a June 2009 speech to Pennsylvania Democratic Committee members in Pittsburgh, Specter said, [...] "I'm again a Democrat and I'm pleased and proud to be a Democrat." [...] Commentators observed that Sestak's involvement in the race would test Specter's loyalty to the Democratic party and likely force him to make more liberal votes in the Senate.|$|E
500|$|In the State Senate, Solis {{authored}} 17bills {{to prevent}} {{domestic violence and}} championed labor, education, and health care issues. She described herself as [...] "a big believer that government, if done right, {{can do a lot}} {{to improve the quality of}} people's lives". In 1995 she sponsored a bill to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75; it was strongly opposed by business organizations and the restaurant industry. When Governor Pete Wilson vetoed it, she organized a successful drive to make the issue into a ballot initiative the next year, using $50,000 of her own campaign funds and rallying <b>union</b> <b>support.</b> The initiative's passing garnered her a statewide reputation and other states followed with similar initiatives. She chaired the labor committee and established herself as loyal to labor interests, but made a point of establishing relationships with Republicans on the committee. Solis held high-profile hearings on labor law enforcement following a summer 1995 sweatshop raid in El Monte that discovered more than 70 Thai workers existing in slave-like conditions. She called garment manufacturers to explain themselves and pushed for tougher enforcement of anti-sweatshop laws. Republican State Senator Ray Haynes later said that Solis was [...] "a committed liberal in the pockets of labor", but Republican State Senate Leader Rob Hurtt said of her, [...] "We obviously didn't see eye to eye. But she was respectful. I'll give her credit; she was a very hard worker and she knew her stuff." ...|$|E

2500|$|Labor {{peace was}} the public {{purpose of the}} Philadelphia meeting. [...] But Gompers and the meeting convenors planned to use the meeting to swing <b>union</b> <b>support</b> toward an entirely new labor federation. [...] Gompers {{believed}} that the Knights were threatening {{the very existence of}} craft unionism, and their radical attitudes were likely to bring the wrath of governmental authority down on the labor movement {{in the wake of the}} Haymarket Riot.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{corporations}} {{have sought to}} learn of union activities by employing informants, {{the same way that}} unions employ salts to infiltrate a non union organization to gather propaganda and sow discord to gain <b>union</b> <b>support.</b> [...] A plant or salt can be used to disrupt meetings, question the legitimacy and motives of either the union or management, and report the results of the meetings to their superiors.

2500|$|The East Tennessee Convention was an {{assembly}} of pro-Union delegates primarily from East Tennessee that met on three occasions during the U.S. Civil War. [...] The Convention most notably declared the secessionist {{actions taken by}} the Tennessee state government {{on the eve of}} the war unconstitutional, and requested that East Tennessee, where <b>Union</b> <b>support</b> remained strong, be allowed to form a separate state that would remain part of the United States. [...] The state legislature denied this request, and the Confederate Army occupied the region in late 1861.|$|E

2500|$|Rutledge {{would also}} have found the statute unconstitutional under the majority's {{interpretation}} {{of the meaning of}} [...] "expenditure." [...] The majority twists itself into knots to distinguish between general <b>union</b> <b>support</b> for a publication and advertising- or subscription-supported support. However, that, too, runs afoul of the Constitution, Rutledge concluded. [...] "I know of nothing in the Amendment's policy or history which turns or permits turning the applicability of its protections upon the difference between regular and merely casual or occasional distributions.... Neither freedom of speech and the press nor the right of peaceable assembly is restricted to persons who can and do pay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Just {{three months}} later, Rieve led his {{division}} in approving yet another large organizing drive.
