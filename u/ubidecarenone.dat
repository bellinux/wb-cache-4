It is a 1,4-benzoquinone, where Q refers to the quinone chemical group and 10 refers {{to the number of}} isoprenyl chemical subunits in its tail.|$|E
40|$|<b>Ubidecarenone</b> (coenzyme Q) is a lipidsoluble quinone with anti-oxidative properties, which exerts a {{scavenger}} {{effect on}} oxygen free radicals. The effectiveness of <b>ubidecarenone</b> in modifying cutaneous reaction to light was evaluated in 7 patients with solar urticaria and 8 with polymorphic light eruption. The diagnosis {{was made for}} each patient by inducing lesions through phototests. <b>Ubidecarenone</b> was administered per os at a daily dose of 100 mg for 2 months. At {{the end of the}} treatment the phototests indicated the absence or reduction of skin photosensitivity in the majority of patients. These results suggest that <b>ubidecarenone</b> may be useful for the treatment of idiopathic photodermatitis...|$|E
40|$|A reverse phase high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method {{was developed for}} the simultaneous estimation of atorvastatin calcium and <b>ubidecarenone</b> in tablet formulation. The separation was achieved by 250 x 4. 6 mm, 5 µ, L- 7 pack (peerless C- 8) column and Methanol: Acetonitrile (80 : 20) as mobile phase, at a flow rate of 1. 5 ml/min. The objective of this validation of an analytical procedure is {{to demonstrate that the}} drug Atorvastatin calcium and <b>Ubidecarenone</b> is suitable for its intended purpose. Developed method was found to be accurate, precise, selective, economical and rapid for simultaneous estimation of atorvastatin calcium and <b>ubidecarenone</b> in tablets. INTRODUCTION: Atorvastatin ([R-(R*-R*) ]- 2 -(4 fluorophenyl) -β, δ – dihydroxy- 5 - (1 -methylethyl) - 3 phenyl- 4 (phenylamino) carbonyl) - 1 H- pyrrole- 1 -heptanoic acid) is a selective, competitive inhibitor o...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} usefulness of <b>ubidecarenone</b> in pulmonary rehabilitation in exercise training programs {{in the management of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The subjects were 20 patients with COPD who had been participating in an exercise training program for at least four weeks. The patients were randomly assigned either to receive 50 mg of oral <b>ubidecarenone</b> daily or to enter a control group during the program. Oxygen consumption, expired volume, and heart rate were measured during exercise tests before and after training. Maximum oxygen consumption increased 13...|$|E
40|$|Deficiency of <b>ubidecarenone</b> (coenzyme Q) {{has been}} {{described}} based on failure of biosynthesis caused by gene mutation, inhibition of biosynthesis by HMG coA reductase inhibitors or for unknown reasons in ageing and cancer. The amount of coenzyme Q in the diet {{is not sufficient to}} increase serum coenzyme Q significantly; thus, a pharmaceutical therapy is needed in these pathologies. <b>Ubidecarenone</b> has a very slightly water solubility so much so that its dissolution rate from oral solid dosage form is very low in the human gastric pH. This behavior causes variable gastrointestinal absorption strictly dependent on the formulation and several months may be necessary before therapeutical effect appears. The present work rises from the need of ASL Napoli 3 South Pharmaceutical Service, to produce a new galenic formulation of <b>ubidecarenone</b> in high oral dose (capsules, 250 mg for unit) for patients affect by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Preformulative studies were carried out to set up the process parameters (excipients, formulation, production technique) useful to improve the drug dissolution rate and bulking properties of the powders...|$|E
40|$|The nanoemulsified {{composite}} (NEC(TM)) {{delivery system}} is a patented technology based on the incorporation of a double microemulsion into microporous carrier. This approach was applied on the very water insoluble <b>ubidecarenone</b> drug. The resulting composite powder showed good technological properties such as flowability; also good stability was evidentiated, with size of the nano-droplets released from the systems maintained equal to the starting size also after a long storage. Furthermore very good biopharmaceutical properties were originated, with water solubility concentrations up to 50 -fold higher than pure <b>ubidecarenone</b> and oral absorption in rats up to three-fold greater than standard commercial products in terms of plasma levels and AUC.

40|$|Drugs as cobamamid and <b>ubidecarenone</b> {{have been}} used by {{different}} sportsmen as a treatment to gain fast muscular mass. Literature shows modulation of haematopoietic toxicity associated with these drugs. An evaluation of the results obtained in an in vivo study to assess the effectiveness of cobamamid and <b>ubidecarenone</b> administered to normal mice is discussed in this paper. The sample was compared with controls that received distilled water or cyclophosphamide. The haematopoietic toxicity was evaluated by MN(micronucleus) test in bone marrow cells. Statistical analysis with ANOVA and paired Student “t”and Tuckey “T” tests were used to determine the significance of MN polychromatic erythrocytis (PE) and normochromatic erythrocytes (NE) in different groups. Both isolated and associated drug administration revealed mutagenesis index effect as may be seen in the data table and those results require special caution for further studies...|$|E

40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} {{cerebellar ataxia}} 2 (ARCA 2) is a recently identified recessive ataxia due to ubiquinone deficiency and biallelic mutations in the ADCK 3 gene.

We report here the clinical and molecular data of 10 newly diagnosed patients from seven families and update the disease history of four additional patients reported in previous articles to delineate the clinical spectrum of ARCA 2 phenotype and to provide a guide to the molecular diagnosis. First signs occurred before adulthood in all 14 patients. Cerebellar atrophy appeared in all instances. The progressivity and severity of ataxia varied greatly, but no patients had the typical inexorable ataxic course that characterizes other childhood-onset recessive ataxias. The ataxia was frequently associated with other neurological signs. Importantly, stroke-like episodes contributed to significant deterioration of the neurological status in two patients. <b>Ubidecarenone</b> therapy markedly improved the movement disorders, including ataxia, in two other patients. The 7 novel ADCK 3 mutations found in the 10 new patients were two missense and five truncating mutations. There was no apparent correlation between the genotype and the phenotype.

Our series reveals that the clinical spectrum of ARCA 2 encompasses a range of ataxic phenotypes. On one end, it may manifest as a pure ataxia with very slow progressivity and, on the other end, as a severe infantile encephalopathy with cerebellar atrophy. The phenotype of most patients, however, lies in between. It is characterized by a very slowly progressive or apparently stable ataxia associated with other signs of central nervous system involvement. We suggest undergoing the molecular analysis of ADCK 3 in patients with this phenotype and in those with cerebellar atrophy and a stroke-like episode. The diagnosis of patients with a severe ARCA 2 phenotype may also be performed on the basis of biological data, i. e. low ubiquinone level or functional evidence of ubiquinone deficiency. This diagnosis is crucial since the neurological status of some patients may be improved by ubiquinone therapy...|$|E
