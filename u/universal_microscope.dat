40|$|The {{basic concept}} of {{optoelectronic}} near-field probes for nanoscale investigations is described and this idea has been realized {{on the basis}} of silicon cantilever probes in a simultaneous SNOM (scanning near-field optoelectronic microscopy) and SFM (scanning force microscopy) microscope. The microsensor system performs the conversion of the optical irradiance into an electric measuring signal directly in the probe tip. Application of this probe in a scanning force microscope allows the simultaneous registration of the surface topography and of the local optical properties with a lateral resolution of < 100 nm. In order to use the optoelectronic probe also in an <b>universal</b> <b>microscope</b> setup with transmission and reflection illumination an optoelectronic aperture probe has been developed. Structuring methods applied for the realization of the aperture probe use focussed ion beams for local removal of the metal layer at the probe tip.

40|$|Abstract only availableTo {{identify}} all maize chromosomes, (2 n= 20) a multicolor fluorescence in situ {{hybridization procedure}} was developed. The procedure utilizes tandemly repeated DNA sequences to generate a distinctive banding pattern for each of the 10 chromosomes. Several different probes were used as a mixture for hybridization to root-tip chromosomes. All of the 10 chromosomes were identified by the banding and color patterns. Another chromosome, called the B chromosome, also shows up in some lines of maize. While its actual purpose is unknown, it undergoes nondisjunction. Nondisjunction is the failure of paired chromosomes to disjoin (separate) during cell division so that both chromosomes go to one daughter cell and none to the other. This nondisjunction plays a role in the dosage affect and how it manipulates gene expression. Previously, translocation was recovered between the B chromosome and the long arm of chromosome 10. Using this B-A translocation, it was crossed with A-A translocated chromosomes to achieve B-A-A translocations. The overall goal of these research projects is to use FISH to identify these translocations. Once spreads are identified using an oil lens and a triple band-pass filter of a <b>Universal</b> <b>microscope</b> and the images are taken using an Optronics MagnaFire charge-coupled device (CCD), the images can be superimposed and edited in Photoshop 7. 0. Each individual chromosome can be labeled, and the translocations can be found. This research shows the benefits of FISH for rapid genetic mapping and allows for an easy means of identifying chromosomes. Life Sciences Undergraduate Research Opportunity Progra...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. There are errors {{during the}} {{manufacturing}} and assembling of horizontal driving machine (HDM). So the exceptional knocking noise is generated during some products running. The failure rate of product quality is rising as well. The forward and reverse driving noise of HDM was tested and analyzed. Pictures was collected by <b>universal</b> tool <b>microscope.</b> The {{results show that}} hot runner is not smooth enough to reduce transferring pressure and increase the shrinkage of worm pouring gate. The situation leads to slight conical degree of product and pitch deviation at worm pouring gate. As the pitch makes worm inset slightly worm gear when clockwise rotating, the noise and vibration was produced consequently in this direction. The proposals were given, such as strengthening the maintenance of hot runners, controlling and inspecting product conical degree, and optimizing HDM mould and increasing its accuracy, and so on...|$|R

Portable applications are computer programs that can be carried generally on USB flash drives, but also in any other portable device, and used on any (Windows) computer without installation. Besides when unplugging the device, none of personal data is left behind. We selected open-source applications, and based the pathology image transmission to VLC Media Player due to its functionality as streaming server, portability and ease of use and configuration. Audio transmission was usually done through normal phone lines. We also employed alternative videoconferencing software, SightSpeed for bi-directional image transmission from microscopes, and conventional cameras allowing visual communication and also image transmit from gross pathology specimens. All these elements allowed us to install and use a telepathology system in a few minutes, fully prepared for real time image broadcast. </p...|$|E
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM. Screw {{loosening}} {{has been}} a common complication and still reported frequently. PURPOSE. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate abrasion of the implant fixture and TiN coated abutment screw after repeated delivery and removal with <b>universal</b> measuring <b>microscope.</b> MATERIAL AND METHODS. Implant systems used for this study were Osstem and 3 i. Seven pairs of implant fixtures, abutments and abutment screws for each system were selected and all the fixtures were perpendicularly mounted in liquid unsaturated polyesther with dental surveyor. After 20 times of repeated closing and opening test, the evaluation for the change of inner surface of implant and TiN-coated abutment screw, and weight loss were measured. Mann-Whitney test with SPSS statistical software for Window was applied to analyze the measurement of weight loss. RESULTS. TiN-coated abutment screws of Osstem and 3 i showed lesser loss of weight than noncoated those of Osstem and 3 i (P <. 05, Mann-Whitney test). CONCLUSION. Conclusively, TiN coating of abutment screw showed better resistance to abrasion than titanium abutment screw. It was concluded that TiN coating of abutment screw would reduce the loss of preload with good abrasion resistance and low coefficient of friction, and help to maintain screw joint stability.

40|$|Aim and objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} cumulative reconditioning on standard stainless steel edgewise brackets of original slot dimensions of 0. 022 " × 0. 028 ", bracket base thickness of 0. 4 mm 2 and base surface area of 11. 702 mm 2. Materials and methods: The sample for this study consists of thirty new maxillary central incisor brackets. Brackets were divided into one control group (Group A, unrecycled) and two experimental groups (Groups B and C). Each group comprised of ten samples. Experimental groups were subjected to specific reconditioning methods (modified BigJane methods and Buchman methods) for three consecutive times, subsequent to which dimensional changes were measured and recorded. The bracket slot dimensions and bracket base thickness were measured by <b>universal</b> measuring <b>microscope</b> and base surface area by digital vernier caliper. Statistical analysis: The statistical analysis done were Kruskal- Wallis test (H), Wilcoxon rank test, Wilcoxon rank signed test. Results: There was change in the slot dimensions in both the reconditioning methods, but the Big-Jane method showed a greater increase in width {{as compared to the}} Buchman method. The changes in the slot depth, bracket base thickness and bracket base surface area in both the reconditioning methods showed clinically insignificant changes during first reconditioning. Conclusion: The result of this study shows that single reconditioning of bracket is advisable. Clinical significance: During first reconditioning of the bracket statistically significant changes do occurs in slot width but clinically least significance alteration occurs in other dimensions of the brackets so, there will be clinically insignificant play occurs, thus torque value will not change...|$|R
40|$|Abstact. This paper explores {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} behavior after low temperature thermochemical hybrid treatments in conventional tube furnace which introduce nitrogen and carbon simultaneously {{to form a}} dual layer structure and to achieve much enhanced surface properties of AISI 316 L and Duplex 2205. The expected layer is a structure termed expanded austenite which is supersaturated with nitrogen and carbon. This structure is responsible to the higher hardness without impairing its corrosion resistance. Characterization of this expanded austenite layers were performed by FESEM (Field Emission Scanning Electron <b>Microscope)</b> and USPM (<b>Universal</b> Scanning Probe <b>Microscope)</b> which were used to reveal the characters of the produced thin layers. These treatments give rise to alloyed layers with a common feature of being precipitation-free and supersaturated with nitrogen, or carbon or both in the austenite lattice which is known as S Phase or expanded austenite. Unfortunately, {{there is not a}} uniform layer thickness in all specimen and we could get an effective layer after duration of 9 h treatment. The result of the hybrid treatment for 316 L gives a thicker layer than 2205. EDS line scan in the cross-section treated layers reveal a decrease of Fe and corresponding slight increase of N and C at the compound layer, which suggests the existence of iron nitrides/carbides in the compound layer. Such distributions of nitrogen and carbon in the surface layer are likely to produce some beneficial influences upon the properties of hybrid treated layers on 316 L and 2205...|$|R
40|$|Glass, Billy P. Martin, Ronald E. There {{is minimal}} {{physical}} evidence {{in only a}} few of the ??? 17 Precambrian spherule layers to support an impact origin. A search was done for shock-metamorphosed grains in the following spherule layers: Carawine, Jeerinah, and Bee Gorge (formerly Wittenoom) in Western Australia, Monteville in South Africa, and Gr??nses?? in South-West Greenland. Samples went through acid digestion, and the residues were wet sieved. The 63 - 125 ??m (?? 125 - 250 ??m) size fractions went through heavy liquid separation. For most samples, the heavy mineral assemblages consist predominantly of anatase, rutile, tourmaline, and zircon (?? chrome spinel) grains. Using micro-Raman spectroscopy, the high-pressure, ??-PbO 2 -structured polymorph of TiO 2 (TiO 2 II) was identified in 27 buff rutile grains from the Carawine, Jeerinah, Bee Gorge, and Monteville spherule layers. For three of the layers, rutile + TiO 2 II grains were found only in their upper parts. For a sample or stratigraphic subdivision within a sample, rutile + TiO 2 II grains comprise ??? 1 - 5 % of the rutile population. The TiO 2 II polymorph is interpreted as a shock-induced phase that is syngenetic with respect to its host spherule layer. The rutile + TiO 2 II grains provide physical evidence to support an impact origin for these four spherule layers. Using a <b>universal</b> stage <b>microscope,</b> measurements of the crystallographic orientations of planar microstructures in three quartz grains from the Carawine spherule layer support the interpretation that the microstructures are shock-induced planar deformation features. No unequivocal evidence of shock metamorphism was found in the white opaque zircon grains; instead, these grains appear to have varying degrees of metamictization. The physical properties of the chrome spinel, rutile, and zircon grains support the previously proposed hypothesis that the Carawine, Jeerinah, and Monteville spherule layers are parts of a single spherule layer that is older than the Bee Gorge spherule layer. This study has documented, apparently for the first time, a shock-induced, high-pressure polymorph (TiO 2 II) from Archean terrestrial rocks. The Gr??nses?? spherule layer (??? 145 cm thick) is a dolomixtite that predominantly contains spherules and mm-to-dm-sized chert and carbonate intraclasts in a dolomitic matrix, and it records a singular debris flow within a low-energy marine environment.
