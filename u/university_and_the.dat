5|$|A {{radiocarbon}} dating {{analysis of the}} papyrus by the Arizona Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory in 2013 dated the papyrus to between 404 and 209 BC. However, the cleaning protocol had to be interrupted during processing to preserve the fragment. A second analysis was performed by Harvard <b>University</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution found a mean date of AD 741. A Raman spectroscopy analysis at Columbia University found that the ink was consistent with those in manuscripts from 400 BC to AD 700–800. These analyses suggest that the fragment as a material artifact is probably medieval and not modern.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, Skopje greatly {{benefited from}} Socialist Yugoslav {{policies}} which encouraged {{industry and the}} development of Macedonian cultural institutions.

However, its post-war development was altered by the 1963 earthquake which occurred 26 July. Although relatively weak in magnitude, it caused enormous damage in the city and can be compared to the 1960 Agadir earthquake. The disaster killed 1,070 people, injuring 3,300 others. 16,000 people were buried alive in ruins and 70% of the population lost their home. Many educational facilities, factories and historical buildings were destroyed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{critically}} reviews <b>the</b> structure <b>and</b> {{function of}} regional knowledge networks {{and modes of}} engagement between <b>universities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> business community. It is argued that while networks between <b>universities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> business community are growing, {{it is often difficult}} to ascribe improved regional competitiveness to developments in knowledge-based infrastructure. It is also argued that <b>the</b> engagement between <b>universities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> business community must be based on an understanding of the role of both network and market-based knowledge interactions. It is concluded that the onus placed on universities to become bases of commercializable knowledge in many regions is probably too heavy. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
