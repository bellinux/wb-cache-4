5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which <b>until</b> <b>that</b> moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident.

I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by illuminating insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E

At {{the end of the}} two days the Egyptians resumed their bombing of royalist positions. The conference planned for November 23 was postponed to the 30th, then indefinitely.
