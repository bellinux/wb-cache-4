30|$|The {{comprehensive}} view {{of governance}} enables a {{move from a}} state-centric approach to building capacity. An aptitude {{at the national level}} to sufficiently integrate the globalized system is key for capacity building. Capacity does not need to reside in government itself, but can exist in the larger community, in an <b>umbrella</b> <b>arrangement</b> with the country, regional, or international bodies.|$|E
40|$|In its April 2008 Review of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s Consumer Policy Framework, the Productivity Commission {{identified}} {{problems with}} {{the coverage of the}} various schemes for handling consumer complaints about communications services. It raised a number of longer-term possibilities, including 2 ̆ 7 a single consumer entry point for communications services complaints 2 ̆ 7, or an 2 ̆ 7 <b>umbrella</b> <b>arrangement</b> encompassing all individual dispute resolution services in this area 2 ̆ 7. Drawing on a study of future broadcasting consumers for the newly-established Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, ACCAN, this paper explores the issues that might be addressed by such a 2 ̆ 7 one-stop shop 2 ̆ 7...|$|E
40|$|The NMR {{spectra of}} 57 Fe in Pr :YIG, Nd : YIG and Yb :YIG were {{measured}} on polycrystalline samples at 4. 2 K in the zero external field. In the NMR spectra of both tetrahedral and octahedral sites the resolved satellite structure appears. This structure {{is caused by}} the change of the hyperfine field on the nuclei of those Fe 3 + ions, which are the nearest or next nearest neighbours of the substituted Re 3 + ion. The change of the hyperfine field is given by the change of dipole and transferred contribution. Both contributions are sensitive to the kind of Re 3 + ion and to the value and direction of its magnetic moment. The satellite structure of NMR spectra provides sufficient amount of information (splitting) to find unknown parameters of the non-collinear (<b>umbrella)</b> <b>arrangement</b> of Re 3 + magnetic moments...|$|E
500|$|The {{terms of}} the Treaty have been {{interpreted}} in various ways. According to Paul Magdalino and Ralph-Johannes Lilie, [...] "the Treaty as reproduced by Anna Komnene shows an astonishing familiarity with western feudal custom; whether it was drafted by a Greek or by a Latin in imperial service, it had a sensitive regard for the western view {{of the status quo}} in the East Mediterranean." [...] So too did the diplomatic initiatives Alexios undertook, in order to enforce the Treaty on Tancred (such as the treaty he concluded with Pisa in 1110–1111, and the negotiations for Church union with Pascal II in 1112). In contrast, Asbridge has recently argued that the Treaty derived from Greek as well as western precedents, and that Alexios wished to regard Antioch as falling under the <b>umbrella</b> of pronoia <b>arrangements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{future of}} {{television}} broadcasts in Hawaii took a major {{turn down the}} road on August 18, 2009, when KGMB's owner, MGC Capital Corporation, and Raycom Media, owners of KHNL and KFVE, announced a shared services agreement under which Raycom merged the three stations' operations. KGMB relocated their operations to the building that houses the KHNL/KFVE operations, and the stations' news operations were consolidated under one <b>umbrella.</b> Non-news programming <b>arrangements</b> remained in place, though KGMB and KFVE would see their channel positions in Honolulu swapped—with KFVE and its programming moving to channel 9 (under MCG ownership) and KGMB and its CBS programming moving to channel 5 (under Raycom ownership). [...] The change took place on October 26, 2009, with all three stations' newscasts merged into one major broadcast under the banner [...] "Hawaii News Now." [...] In addition, all three stations' logos were retired as well. This combination allowed the Hawaii News Now group to control 45% of the market.|$|R
5000|$|The {{appearance}} {{for both}} varieties is similar with both sharing {{many of the}} same features. Resembling the trunk of the tree, the stems are elongated and narrow growing between 2-9 cm in length. They are black or brown in colour and covered in trichome hairs and small leaves. The stem reaches up to a green <b>umbrella</b> shaped <b>arrangement</b> of fronds at the top. The horizontally spreading fronds are shaped umbellate to pinnate and grow up to 5 cm in diameter. Each spreading frond forms many small branches each reaching 2-5 mm in length. This gives the umbrella shape a clumpy, palm-like look. The branch leaves are triangular-ovate and yellow-green in colour. The costa is green or brown and margins are serrate toward the tip. [...] The sporophyte arises from the centre of the female gametophyte and forms a long seta on which a capsule is borne. H. comosum bares anywhere between 4-12 sporophytes. The seta is long and thin and reaches between 2-4 cm in length. The capsule is orange or brown in colour and reaches around 2-5 mm in length. They are cylindrical in shape. The operculum is the cap or covering to the spores, and once this falls off, the spores are passively dispersed via the peristome.While both species are similar, Hypnodendron comosum var. comosum is unique in that it is the smaller, more compact of the two. Most commonly located in Tasmania, its branches are compactly arranged, making this variety seem clumped and tightly packed. Located on mainland Australia, Hypnodendron comosum var. siberi is taller in form and the branches are much more loosely arranged.|$|R
