50|$|Departing Bentley {{from the}} Bordon bay {{platform}} (created by extending the down platform then {{separated from the}} main line platform by iron railings), services would proceed on the main down line {{in the direction of}} Alton for 17 chains before reaching the junction for Bordon at which stood the Bentley signal box. The line to Bordon branched off to the south here, climbing up towards Kingsley of 1 in 156. After 1 mile 10 chains it reached Blacknest Road level crossing, an ungated crossing which was protected by <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b> The line then gradually dropped towards Kingsley Halt (2 miles 57 chains from Bentley), proceeding again over Blacknest Road level crossing, another <b>ungated</b> crossing with <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show how a {{seemingly}} unremarkable object – a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> – {{has come to}} presence climate change in partial and contingent ways on the Lizard Peninsula, Cornwall, UK. We identify the <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> as an ‘anticipatory object’ through which conservation organisations seek to manage the future and adapt to climate change, but which {{at the same time}} presences that unthought-of future for others in the landscape. We explore {{the ways in which the}} <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> acts to presence something that is not only absent – climate change – but has uncertain imminence. We investigate the ways in which the <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> make climate relevant as an embodied and experiential process, a physical and intellectual artefact, and the means to imagine climate and the ways it might change. Drawing upon interpretative approaches informed by theorisations of materiality, presence and absence to understand climate change as a social phenomenon, we go beyond a consideration of this ordinary object defined by its function to consider how the object is experienced, the processes and practices through which people relate to it, and the ways in which social meaning accumulates around it. The empirical basis for this argument is provided by in-depth interviews with local representatives of Natural England, residents and farmers...|$|R
50|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>grids</b> {{are usually}} {{installed}} on roads where they cross a fenceline, often at a boundary {{between public and}} private lands. They are an alternative to the erection of gates that would need to be opened and closed when a vehicle passed, and are common where roads cross open moorland, rangeland or common land maintained by grazing, but where segregation of fields is impractical. <b>Cattle</b> <b>grids</b> are also used when otherwise unfenced railways cross a fenceline. <b>Cattle</b> <b>grids</b> are seen throughout the world and are quite common in places such as Australia, the Scottish Highlands, or the National Parks of England and Wales. They are also common throughout the Western United States and Canada. In the United States, they are often used on BLM and Forest Service land, but are also used on paved roads and exit ramps of the Interstate Highway System in rural areas.|$|R

40|$|During {{the period}} of 2007 to 2010, every two days we visited the three <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> {{on the road to}} the Cap of Cavalleria, where it was {{possible}} to observe the fauna that fell into the <b>grids.</b> The first <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> is the closest to es Mercadal, the second <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> is 300 meters from the first, and the third is a further 700 meters and is closest to the lighthouse of Cavalleria. Therefore, the distance between the first and the third is one kilometer. During this four year period we recovered 118 hedgehogs (106 alive and 12 dead), two turtles, a rabbit, a stone curlew and a snake that otherwise would have died of thirst or drowned when the grids filled with water following rain. The chance to periodically visit an area where hedgehogs are relatively abundant allowed for an accurate estimation of the density of the population in the area and to take notes of their behavior...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in West Yorkshire, England allegedly found a way to get over <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> by rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.|$|R
50|$|The {{only other}} {{entrance}} is off Anzac Avenue {{and is more}} subdued, with one large double gate flanked by thick timber posts and also possessing a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid.</b> The gates are of the same style and construction as those found at the South Street entrance.|$|R
5000|$|After the summit, {{the road}} drops steeply by Bwlch Gwynt to another <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> and the {{intersection}} with the B4313 at Greenway, {{also known as}} New Inn, which in the 19th century sustained northbound travellers before [...] "the arduous task of winding up the painful ascent of Bwlch Gwynt".|$|R
50|$|A further {{system is}} to use a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> style system. All {{pedestrian}} exits have specially designed flooring tiles which, along with specially designed wheels on the cart, will immobilize the cart as they roll onto them. Like the magnetic systems, this can easily be overcome by lifting the cart over the tiles.|$|R
50|$|The {{village is}} {{surrounded}} by the open heathland of the New Forest, containing a complex of woodland, heathland and acid grassland, shrub and valley bog, supporting a richness and diversity of wildlife.Burley Fire Station {{is thought to be}} the only fire station in the country with a <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> at the entrance.|$|R
50|$|Box lies at {{the edge}} of Minchinhampton Common, {{designated}} as a SSSI. The common is well known for its cows, which often cause traffic delays as there are no fences on the common. Since there is no <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> {{at the entrance to the}} village, cattle are also often found wandering through its streets.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Worcestershire County Council {{was awarded}} £770,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund for {{restoration}} work {{and preservation of}} the area by fitting <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> to roads across the Hills and encouraging local landowners to allow sheep to wander across their land. As part of the Malvern Heritage Project nine water features within the AONB were also renovated.|$|R

40|$|The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act (MPR) of 1999 was {{implemented}} in April 2001. Empirical evidence indicates {{a significant change}} in intra-week price dispersion associated with publicly reported fed <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> premiums and discounts occurring after MPR implementation. The research objective is to evaluate the effect of increased market transparency resulting from implementation of MPR, on grid intra-week premium and discount dispersion levels. Empirical results suggest that increased transparency is compatible with intra-week dispersion levels increasing. Increased dispersion suggests that during the pre-MPR period weekly premium and discount data may have been drawn from a non-representative sample. From the empirical evidence, it is concluded that reform of the livestock price-reporting system appears to have been necessary in the case of publically reported grid premiums and discounts. fed <b>cattle,</b> <b>grid</b> pricing, market transparency, price dispersion, price volatility, mandatory livestock price reporting, Agricultural and Food Policy, Demand and Price Analysis, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

50|$|As a common, {{historically}} it was grazed by livestock {{owned by}} local people; {{as with other}} heathlands it was this grazing which created and maintained the open habitat. Grazing ceased in the mid-20th century, leading to long-term deterioration in the structure and composition of the habitat. Plans {{are under way to}} install <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> on the minor roads crossing the heath, and then to begin grazing again.|$|R
50|$|One major road, the A478, {{crosses the}} eastern end of the range, {{reaching}} a height of 248 m. Two B-class roads, intersecting at New Inn, cross the hills: the B4313 NW-SE, reaching 278 m and the B4329 NE-SW, reaching 404 m. These, {{and a number of other}} minor roads and lanes, provide scenic routes popular with motoring, cycling and walking tourists. Some grazing areas are protected by <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b>|$|R
50|$|The A4117 {{runs through}} the village {{and there is a}} <b>cattle</b> <b>grid</b> {{stretching}} over this major thoroughfare due to the road running across common land. The road reaches an elevation of 381 metres as it passes Titterstone Clee Hill just to the east of the village, and is often affected by snow in winter. The B4214 road to Tenbury Wells starts at a junction with the A4117 in the village.|$|R
40|$|<b>Cattle</b> <b>grids</b> {{are used}} on roads and tracks to prevent grazing animals from leaving an open space without fencing onto a more {{controlled}} area where {{access to the}} road from surrounded land is more limited. They are widely used in the UK at the entrances to common and moorland areas where animals are free to roam, but also on private drive entrances. Typically, they consist {{of a series of}} metal bars across the road that are spaced so that an animal’s legs would fall through the gaps if it attempted to cross. Below the grid is a shallow pit that is intended to further deter livestock from using that particular crossing point. The sound produced as vehicles cross these devices is a characteristic low frequency “brrrr” where the dominant frequencies relates to the bar passage frequency under the tyres. The sound can be disturbing to riders and their horses and walkers and residents living close by as evidenced by press reports and the need to consider noise aspects in planning for new installations. For this reason and {{due to the lack of}} available information on the size and nature of the problem measurements and recordings have been made at a number of sites in Yorkshire in the UK. In addition, questionnaire surveys of residents living close by and façade measurements have also been used to gauge impact. Results show that there is a wide variation in the maximum noise level produced by <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> of apparently similar design. This can be related to impact noise produced by the movement of all or part of the grid as the frame comes under impulsive loading as the vehicle crosses. It was further established that some residents living close to the <b>cattle</b> <b>grids</b> were disturbed by the noise, and in some cases vibration, and wanted them removed or suitably modified...|$|R

50|$|From 1999 to July 2001 South Gloucestershire Council {{built a new}} {{section of}} the A4174 Avon ring road along part of the path. While the work was being {{undertaken}} the path was diverted away from the old railway line and a new section was added around the ring road, increasing the length by 200 yards. The new section includes two bridges, several tight corners, a hill (South Gloucestershire Council describes it as a 'barely perceptible gradient'), and two <b>cattle</b> <b>grids.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cwm Craig-ddu Quarry is a disused quarry that is {{now much}} {{overgrown}} with plants and bushes.
