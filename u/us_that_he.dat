25|$|Wilfrid {{met with}} his own teacher and patron, Agilbert, a {{spokesman}} for the Roman side at Whitby, who had been made bishop of Paris.

25|$|In {{spite of}} his stature as a historian, modern historians know {{relatively}} little about Thucydides's life. The most reliable information comes from his own History of the Peloponnesian War, which expounds his nationality, paternity and native locality. Thucydides informs <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> fought in the war, contracted the plague and was exiled by the democracy. He may have also been involved in quelling the Samian Revolt.|$|E
25|$|GIULIANI: That's {{really an}} {{extraordinary}} statement. That's an extraordinary statement, {{as someone who}} lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th. And I would ask the congressman to withdraw that comment and tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> didn't really mean that.|$|E

25|$|In 682 Benedict {{appointed}} Eosterwine as his coadjutor and the King was so delighted at {{the success}} of St Peter's, he gave him more land in Jarrow and urged him to build a second monastery. Benedict erected a sister foundation (St Paul) at Jarrow. He appointed Ceolfrid as the superior, who left Wearmouth with 20 monks to start the foundation in Jarrow. Bede, one of Benedict's pupils, tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> brought builders and glass-workers from Francia to erect the buildings in stone.|$|E
25|$|Traditional biographies, {{including}} the Vita Iuvenalis, {{give us the}} writer's full name and also tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was either the son, or adopted son, of a rich freedman. He {{is supposed to have}} been a pupil of Quintilian, and to have practised rhetoric until he was middle-aged, both as amusement and for legal purposes. The Satires do make frequent and accurate references to the operation of the Roman legal system. His career as a satirist is supposed to have begun at a fairly late stage in his life.|$|E
25|$|First {{asserting that}} his own {{experience}} of God is continuous, Meher Baba explains that the upliftment produced by drugs is only temporary and thus not a true realization of Divinity; in the end, drugs lead only to madness, delusion, and hypocrisy. After one more disillusioning scene in Millbrook, Louis closes the door on drugs. He tells <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> stopped using LSD after it became illegal, but adds that {{had it not been}} for LSD, he would surely have taken his own life, just as his mother and grandfather did.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, Morinobu Endo of CNRS {{observed}} hollow {{tubes of}} rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique. The first specimens observed would later {{come to be}} known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core. This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber. The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo. In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents.|$|E

Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and we saw the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E

He has acquired a correct knowledge of their manner of living, and speaks their language fluently. He has rose (sic?) to be quite a considerable character, or chief, in their village; at least he assumes all the dignities of a chief, for he has four wives, with whom he lives alternately.|$|E

25|$|Montoya's Formula One career {{effectively}} {{came to an}} end on July 9 when {{he announced}} in a public press conference from the <b>US</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had signed a contract to run in the NASCAR series from 2007. On July 11, 2006, McLaren announced that Montoya would stop racing for the team with immediate effect. This ultimately confirmed Montoya's exit from F1. However, in the press conference on July 14 at the French Grand Prix, Ron Dennis stated that Montoya was still under contract with McLaren and he would remain in contract with the team until the expiration of the deal. Following further speculation that he could start racing in the NASCAR series as early as 2006, Dennis publicly offered Montoya an early exit from his contract with McLaren, provided that he resigned from receiving any payout to terminate his contract. Overall, he finished the season in 8th position in the Drivers' Championship.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, {{after the}} end of the First World War, Sassoon {{returned}} to Baghdad from Istanbul and was appointed Minister of Finance in the first Iraqi government, a new provisional government under the premiership of Abd Al-Rahman Al-Naqib. The importance of his role was what was to make or break the new constitution of Iraq. The details of this were highlighted by Gertrude Bell when she recounted the circumstances regarding the establishment of Iraq’s new government. Dated 1 November 1920, Bell wrote:“On Wednesday morning all seemed to be going well. In the afternoon Major Yetts and I went out sightseeing in Baghdad and on our way home dropped in to tea with the Tods. Mr Tod sprung upon <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had called on Sasun Eff to congratulate him on his becoming Minister of Finance and found him with Hamdi Pasha Baban (who had been offered a seat in the Cabinet without portfolio,) both in the act of refusing. Mr Tod had done his best to persuade them but had heard in the afternoon that they had refused, the real, though not the expressed reason, being that they would not join a Cabinet which contained Saiyid Talib.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the social}} {{position}} and the personal history of Rav we were not informed. That he was rich seems probable; for {{he appears to have}} occupied himself for a time with commerce and afterward with agriculture (Hullin 105a). He {{is referred to as the}} son of noblemen (Shabbat 29a) but it is not clear if this is an affectionate term or a true description of his status. Rashi does tell <b>us</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is being described as the son of great men. That he was highly respected by the Gentiles as well as by the Jews of Babylonia is proved by the friendship which existed between him and the last Parthian king, Artaban (Avodah Zarah 10b). He was deeply affected by the death of Artaban (226) and the downfall of the Arsacid dynasty, and does not appear to have sought the friendship of Ardeshir, founder of the Sassanian dynasty, although Samuel of Nehardea probably did so. Rav became closely related, through the marriage of one of his daughters, to the family of the exilarch. Her sons, Mar Ukba and Nehemiah, were considered types of the highest aristocracy. Rav had many sons, several of whom are mentioned in the Talmud, the most distinguished being the eldest, Chiyya. The latter did not, however, succeed his father as head of the academy: this post fell to Rav's disciple Rav Huna. Two of his grandsons occupied in succession the office of exilarch (resh galuta) (Hullin 92a).|$|E
