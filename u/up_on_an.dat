5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the castle evolved from the {{practice}} of fortifying a lordly home. The greatest threat to a lord's home or hall was fire as it was usually a wooden structure. To protect against this, and keep other threats at bay, there were several courses of action available: create encircling earthworks to keep an enemy at a distance; build the hall in stone; or raise it <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> artificial mound, known as a motte, to present an obstacle to attackers. While the concept of ditches, ramparts, and stone walls as defensive measures is ancient, raising a motte is a medieval innovation.|$|E
5|$|Security {{measures}} included Turkish war {{ships and}} Turkish commandos in rubber boats patrolling the Bosporus, AWACS surveillance planes and F-16 warplanes circling {{above the city}} in order to monitor a no-fly zone over the city, and the assignment of 23,000 to 24,000 police officers, supported by police helicopters and armoured vehicles. The Bosphorus Strait was also closed to oil tankers, the underground rail system was suspended and whole city districts were sealed off. Nevertheless, a small bomb or explosive devise blew <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> empty Turkish Airlines plane on June 29 as workers were cleaning it at the main Istanbul airport. Three of the workers were slightly injured.|$|E

5|$|On the eastern-most beach, Fox Green, {{elements}} of five different companies had become entangled, {{and the situation}} was little improved by the equally disorganized landings of the second wave. Two more companies of the 3rd Battalion joined the melee, and, having drifted east in the first wave, I/16 finally made their traumatic landing on Fox Green, at 08:00. Two of their six boats were swamped on their detour to the east, and as they came in under fire, {{three of the four}} remaining boats were damaged by artillery or mines, and the fourth was hung <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> obstacle. A captain from this company found himself senior officer, and in charge of the badly out of shape 3rd Battalion.|$|E
5|$|Schenn {{played his}} first NHL game on November 26, 2009, against the Vancouver Canucks after being called <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> {{emergency}} basis and signed to an amateur, one-game try-out contract. At {{the time of}} his debut, Schenn was the third youngest player of all-time to skate for the team. On March 3, 2010, he was signed to a three-year contract with the Kings. After training camp for the 2010â€“11 season, Schenn made the Kings roster but saw limited playing time. He appeared in nine games with the Kings, and spent time with the Manchester Monarchs of the American Hockey League (AHL) for conditioning purposes. On December 3, 2010, the Kings returned Schenn to the Brandon Wheat Kings. Following the Saskatoon Blades' exit from the 2011 WHL Playoffs, he was assigned by the Kings back to the Monarchs on April 17, 2011.|$|E
5|$|She later joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), {{where she}} was a member of the Dangerous Alliance, a group of wrestlers managed by Paul E. Dangerously. In 1993, she joined the rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the name Alundra Blayze. In the WWF, she feuded with Bull Nakano and Bertha Faye, while holding the WWF Women's Championship three times. Two years after joining the WWF, Miceli {{returned}} to WCW, showing <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> episode of Monday Nitro to throw the WWF Women's Championship belt into a trash can; she was blacklisted by the WWF (later WWE) for the next 20 years as a result. In her second WCW run, Miceli feuded with Bull Nakano and Oklahoma, and became the first woman to hold the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. After training wrestlers such as Torrie Wilson, Stacy Keibler, and Nora Greenwald (Molly Holly) at the WCW Power Plant, she left the company in 2001. On March 28, 2015, she was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, under the Alundra Blayze moniker.|$|E

5|$|The third era {{deviates}} {{from the}} original plot considerably. When Lara was young she travelled with her parents on many of their archaeological expeditions which helped to shape the woman she was becoming. It was {{on one of these}} expeditions that her mother vanished and was presumed dead and a few years later her father presumably took his own life, she was then left in the care of Conrad Roth. Even though she was left with a vast fortune, giving her the means to attend Cambridge with ease, Lara chose to study at University College London. This decision required her to pay her tuition and rent by working many jobs. Though this was a much tougher choice, it helped her become more grounded and level-headed than she might otherwise have been. She also ended up meeting her best friend, Samantha Nishimura, during her time at UCL. It was because of Sam's free spirit and wild streak that Lara was able to experience much more of London than just the universities and museums that she loved so much. After travelling the world, both Lara and Sam end <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> expedition to the Dragon's Triangle off the Japanese coast in search of the lost civilisation of Yamatai. It is on this expedition that Lara is stranded on a remote island full of natural, human and supernatural dangers, which enables her to develop from a vulnerable girl to a survivor. And after experiencing the supernatural powers of the ancient world, she comes to realise her father was right about his theories and her hunger for adventure awakens.|$|E

25|$|An {{example from}} Irish {{literature}} {{occurs in the}} Echtrae Airt meic Cuinn (Echtra, or adventure in the Otherworld, of Art mac Cuinn). Recorded in the 14th century but likely taken from an older oral tradition, Echtrae Airt meic Cuinn is nominally about Art, though the adventures of his father Conn of the Hundred Battles take up {{the first part of}} the narrative. Conn is High King of Ireland, but his land turns to waste when he marries the wicked BÃ© Chuma, an unacceptable action for the king. He searches for a way to restore his country by sailing towards the mystical western lands, and eventually washes <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> island inhabited by the niece of the sea god Manannan and her husband. He attends an otherworldly banquet, and when he returns his wife is banished, presumably lifting the curse.|$|E
25|$|On December 21, 1866, Crazy Horse and {{six other}} warriors, both Lakota and Cheyenne, decoyed Capt. William Fetterman's 53 {{infantry}}men and 27 cavalry troopers under Lt. Grummond into an ambush. They had been sent out from Fort Phil Kearny to follow <b>up</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> earlier attack on a wood train. Crazy Horse lured Fetterman's infantry up a hill. Grummond's cavalry followed the other six decoys along Peno Head Ridge and down toward Peno Creek, where several Cheyenne women taunted the soldiers. Meanwhile, Cheyenne leader Little Wolf and his warriors, who had been hiding {{on the opposite side}} of Peno Head Ridge, blocked the return route to the fort. The Lakota warriors swept over the hill and attacked the infantry. Additional Cheyenne and Lakota hiding in the buckbrush along Peno Creek effectively surrounded the soldiers. Seeing that they were surrounded, Grummond headed his cavalry back to Fetterman.|$|E
