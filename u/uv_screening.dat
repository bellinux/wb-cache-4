40|$|Ongoing {{changes in}} Earth’s climate are {{shifting}} the elevation ranges of many plant species with non-native species often experiencing greater expansion into higher elevations than native species. These climate change-induced shifts in distributions inevitably expose plants to novel biotic and abiotic environments, including altered solar ultraviolet (UV) -B (280 – 315 nm) radiation regimes. Do the greater migration potentials of non-native species into higher elevations imply {{that they have}} more effective UV-protective mechanisms than native species? In this study, we surveyed leaf epidermal UV-A transmittance (TUV A) in a diversity of plant species representing different growth forms to test whether native and non-native species growing above 2800 m elevation on Mauna Kea, Hawaii differed in their <b>UV</b> <b>screening</b> capabilities. We further compared {{the degree to which}} TUV A varied along an elevation gradient in the native shrub Vaccinium reticulatum and the introduced forb Verbascum thapsus to evaluate whether these species differed in their abilities to adjust their levels of <b>UV</b> <b>screening</b> in response to elevation changes in UV-B. For plants growing in the Mauna Kea alpine/upper subalpine, we found that adaxial TUV A, measured with a UVA-PAM fluorometer, varied significantly among species but did not differ between native (mean = 6. 0 %; n = 8) and non-native (mean = 5. 8 %; n = 11) species. When data were pooled across native and non-native taxa, we also found no significant effect of growth form on TUV A, though woody plants (shrubs and trees) were represented solely by native species whereas herbaceous growth forms (grasses and forbs) were dominated by non-native species. Along an elevation gradient spanning 2600 – 3800 m, TUV A was variable (mean range = 6. 0 – 11. 2 %) and strongly correlated with elevation and relative biologically effective UV-B in the exotic V. thapsus; however, TUV A was consistently low (3 %) and did not vary with elevation in the native V. reticulatum. Results indicate that high levels of UV protection occur in both native and non-native species in this high UV-B tropical alpine environment, and that flexibility in <b>UV</b> <b>screening</b> is a mechanism employed by some, but not all species to cope with varying solar UV-B exposures along elevation gradients...|$|E

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} a major health problem and {{exposure}} to oestrogen is a main risk factor. Many environmental chemicals with oestrogenic activity are known to enter the human breast from exposure through diet, the domestic environment and personal care products. In this study, six chemicals, used to absorb ultraviolet light (<b>UV</b> <b>screens)</b> in consumer products and known to be detectable in human milk, have been studied for their effects on proliferation and migration of MCF- 7, T- 47 -D and MDA-MB- 231 human breast cancer cells. The six chemicals were benzophenone- 1 (Bp 1), benzophenone- 2 (Bp 2), benzophenone- 3 (Bp 3), octylmethoxycinnamate (OMC), 3 -(4 -methylbenzilidene) camphor (4 MBC) and homosalate (HS). All six of these <b>UV</b> <b>screens</b> at 10 - 5 M could induce luciferase activity from an ERELUC reporter gene stably transfected into MCF- 7 cells. Dose-response experiments on proliferation of oestrogen-responsive MCF- 7 and T- 47 -D cells showed increased proliferation following the exposure to the <b>UV</b> <b>screens</b> but not OMC, which {{had no effect on}} proliferation of MCF- 7 cells except when cells are seeded on a laminin matrix. No effect on MDA-MB- 231 cell proliferation was recorded. Although the oestrogenic activity of these chemicals has been shown to influence proliferation, this {{is only one of the}} hallmarks of cancer cells. Another important hallmark is activation of invasion and metastasis which is relevant for breast cancer where mortality arises not from growth of the primary tumour but from metastatic tumour spread. Effects of these <b>UV</b> <b>screens</b> have therefore been studied on migration and invasion of MCF- 7, T- 47 -D and MDA-MB- 231 cells following prior (2 weeks) or (up to 30 weeks) exposure using a wound healing assay, time-lapse microscopy or xCELLigence technology. 2 weeks of exposure to 10 - 5 M OMC, 4 MBC and HS increased the motility of MCF- 7 cells as determined by xCELLigence technology or time-lapse microscopy. 21 weeks of exposure to 10 - 5 M Bp 1, Bp 3, to 10 - 7 M concentrations of OMC, 4 MBC and HS increased the motility of MCF- 7 cells. Results using western immunoblotting suggest a decrease in E-cadherin mRNA levels by 10 - 5 M Bp 1, Bp 3, OMC, 4 MBS and HS and protein levels of cells exposed to 10 - 5 M Bp 1 and HS. 10 - 5 M Bp 1 also increased the secretion of MMP- 9 as measured by zymography and the protein levels of pro-MMP- 14 as measured by western immunoblotting. β-catenin protein was reduced in MCF- 7 cells following the exposure to 10 - 5 M OMC, which also reduced the mRNA levels of other two molecular markers of motility (PIK 3 R 1 and BMP 7). T- 47 -D cells exposed to 10 - 5 M of the <b>UV</b> <b>screens</b> have shown an increase in motility as determined by xCELLigence but only Bp 1 increased the migration as determined by wound healing. MDA-MB- 231 cells showed no increase in motility following 2 weeks of exposure to the <b>UV</b> <b>screens.</b> However, 8 weeks of exposure to 10 - 7 M Bp 2, Bp 3, 4 MBC and HS increased the cells motility as determined by the xCELLigence and 15 weeks of exposure to 10 - 7 M of the <b>UV</b> <b>screens</b> increased the motility of MDA-MB- 231 cell as measured by the time-lapse microscopy. OMC and 4 MBC increased the secretion of MMP- 2 by MDA-MB- 231 cells.

40|$|International audiencePhotolysis {{may be a}} {{significant}} route of pesticide dissipation on crops, leading to an increase of pesticide use. Spraying strong absorbing compounds (photoprotector) along with pesticide is an attractive strategy to prevent the photodegradation phenomenon. The {{aim of this study}} is to get a better understanding of the parameters governing the photoprotection efficiency. Experiments were conducted using formulated sulcotrione as a pesticide and a grape wine extract as a photoprotector. These compounds were irradiated using simulated solar light as dried deposits on carnauba wax films or on disks of tobacco leaves and analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet (UV), spectroscopy, and microscopy. It is shown that photolysis is faster on leaves than on carnauba wax and that the photoprotection effect of grape wine extract is more efficient on leaves than on wax. Images recorded by microscopy bring evidence that deposits are very different on the two supports both in the absence and in the presence of the photoprotector. The grape wine extract plays a double role; it is antioxidant and <b>UV</b> <b>screen.</b> Photoprotection by the grape wine extract is a complex mixing of <b>UV</b> <b>screen</b> and antioxidant effects.

40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{is the primary}} energy source for surface planetary life, so that pigments are fundamental components of any surface-dwelling organism. They may therefore have evolved in some form on Mars as they did on Earth. Photosynthetic microbes are major primary producers on Earth, but are concurrently vulnerable to ultraviolet (UV) damage. Using non-intrusive laser Raman spectroscopy to recognize the component parts of biomolecules, we have shown not only the abundance of microbial photosynthetic and photoprotective pigments in situ, but also their spatial distribution within their microhabitat. This essential aspect of their screening or avoidance survival strategies is lost on extraction with solvents. This precise approach is eminently suited to analysis of epilithic (surface) and endolithic (within rocks) communities in Antarctic desert habitats, which are putative analogues of early Mars. Raman spectra for key biomolecules (e. g. the <b>UV</b> <b>screen</b> parietin and the antioxidant β-carotene in epilithic lichens) enable not only the detection of organics in light-stratified habitats, but also the characterization of unknown pigments.

40|$|Red macroalgae produce <b>UV</b> <b>screen</b> photoprotectors (Mycosporine like amino acids, MAAs) in {{response}} to increased UV radiation. They are low-molecular weight water-soluble nitrogen enriched molecules, absorbing UV radiation in the wavelength range 310 - 365 nm due to their cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine chromophores. MAAs were quantified by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The photoprotection capacity in the macroalgae has been inferred by their accumulation under increased UV radiation (spatial and temporal changes), by the correlation with reduced photoinhibition and decreased photodamage and by the increase of antioxidant activity in the cells. Despite the fact MAAs are nitrogen compounds, only few studies on nitrogen enrichment have been conducted. In this study, the influence of inorganic nitrogen on the accumulation of MAAs both under artificial and solar UVR in several macroalgae is presented. Both MAAs and biliproteins contents of several species increased in ammonium enriched seawater. Algae with high internal N content presented a higher photoprotection capacity, estimated as in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, than those growing under N depletion conditions. The relative composition of MAAs changed both under high irradiance and blue light, increasing the content of palythine and asterina- 330 in relation to porphyra- 334 and shinorine. In bifactorial experiments of UVR and nitrate, a positive synergic response of both variables on the production of MAAs was found. MAA content also increased under ammonium enrichment, obtained from fishpond effluents. The highest MAA-productivity was observed in outdoor-grown algae, indicating a positive effect of increased PAR and UVR on MAA accumulation. In conclusion, the accumulation of MAAs is favoured by inorganic nitrogen enrichment {{in the presence of}} UVR. MAAs can protect the algae against increased UV radiation through a double function: (1) <b>UV</b> <b>screen</b> capacity in both UVA and UVB radiation and (2) Antioxidant capacity of both oxo- and imino-MAAs. The use of MAAs as photoprotective sunscreens in cosmetic products is discussed. Universidad de Málaga, Campus de Excelencia Internacional Andalucía Tec...|$|R
