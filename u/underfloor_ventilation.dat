40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a series of}} experiments, which investigated the performances of the <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems in thermal comfort and indoor air quality aspects. Both the floor return (FR) and the top return (TR) types were tested. An additional set of experiments were conducted on the traditional ceiling-based system for comparison. Results reveal that the underfloor systems created significant overcooling in the nearby area of the floor supply terminals and temperature stratifications in the room. The underfloor systems achieved some level of improvements in ventilation performance. The FR system exhibited a more localized ventilation characteristic {{than that of the}} TR system. With the support from the experimental results, some design considerations were suggested for the <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Utilizing {{raised floor}} system to {{facilitate}} cable management becomes {{a trend in}} modern intelligent buildings. <b>Underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems, which {{make use of the}} sub-floor plenum below the raised floor for conditioned air distribution, are also gaining popularity. The ductless operating principle of the <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> system enhances space flexibility. Supplying conditioned air from the floor level also inherents advantages in improving indoor air quality and energy saving. Two types of the <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems are commonly found including the top-level return type (TR) and the floor-level return type (FR). Thermal comfort and indoor air quality aspects of both the TR and the FR. underfloor systems were experimentally investigated in the present study. The most commonly used straight vane type floor supply diffusers were used in the experiments. The performance of traditional ceiling-based system with widely adopted 4 -way spread type supply diffusers was also determined under the same conditions for comparison purpose. A controlled experimental room was developed to facilitate the experiments. High risk of draught was observed near the supply outlet of the <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems. However, draught discomfort can be reduced by the underfloor system compared to the ceiling based system. Similar to the traditional ceiling based system, vertical temperature differences in the occupied region were lower than 3 °C under all the tested conditions for the TR system. Temperature variations higher than the international comfort standards were observed with the FR system when Archimedes number (Ar) was higher than 0. 03. Lower Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values were resulted with both types of <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems compared to the ceiling-based one. Lower cooling effect should be provided when using the underfloor systems to avoid overcooling to the occupants. The age of air experiments showed that the ceiling-based system maintained a uniform distribution of ventilation in the space. Compared to the ceiling-based system, improvements in ventilation were achieved with the use of TR or FR system in regions near the floor supply outlet. In spaces that were far away from the floor supply outlet, the ventilation performance of the FR system deteriorated. The performance of the TR system was found similar to the ceiling based system at far distance. The TR system was the most efficient one in removing smoke particles inside the whole room. The FR system removed particles in {{the lower part of the}} room better than the ceiling-based system. Improvements in particle concentration in the sitting person breathing level were achieved by the FR system...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the effects of evaporation and condensation on the underfloor space of Japanese detached houses. In this <b>underfloor</b> space, natural <b>ventilation</b> is applied. A typical Japanese wooden detached house is raised 0. 3 – 0. 5 m over an underfloor space made of concrete. The bottom of the underfloor space is usually paved with concrete, and the ceiling which is directly underneath the indoor occupant zone is made of wood. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is applied to calculate the rates of the evaporation and condensation generated inside the underfloor under two conditions, namely, a constant (fixed) outdoor environmental condition and a fluctuating environmental condition. In the constant condition, we verified the effects of the outdoor humidity, ventilation rate, and ratio of wetted surface (RWS, ω) on the evaporation and condensation inside the underfloor space. In this condition, the rate of evaporation and condensation was quantified considering the varying outdoor humidity between 0 to 100 %, and the RWS (ω = 1 or 0). In addition, the influence of the different ventilation rates at 1. 0 m/s for normal and 0. 05 m/s for stagnant wind velocities were confirmed. Under fluctuating environmental conditions, the outdoor conditions change for 24 h, so the RWS varies. Therefore, the rate of evaporation and condensation, the amount of the condensed water, and the area of condensation were confirmed. The results were as follows: with a high airflow rate on the underfloor space, the evaporation and condensation phenomenon occurs continuously and is easily affected by outdoor humidity, while under low airflow rate conditions, only the condensation appeared steadily. If the wind velocity is strong, the convective mass transfer on a surface becomes large. In a condition of the outdoor humidity and the airflow rate on underfloor are high, condensation mainly occurs in a corner of the underfloor space due to high evaporation by convection in the mainstream of the airflow. By contrast, when the airflow rate is low, condensation occurs along the air stream. Accordingly, this information could be employed as design considerations for the underfloor space at the architectural design stage...|$|R
40|$|Ventilation {{performance}} and pollutant distribution {{in a traditional}} ceiling-type ventilation system, a top-return (TR) -type and a floor-return (FR) -type <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems were performed in a controlled experimental room. Tracer gas method was utilized to determine the age of air and the contaminant removal effectiveness. Tobacco smoke was also introduced to study the particle-phase pollutant distribution. The TR system delivered conditioned air more efficiently in the occupied zone and exhibited higher gaseous contaminant removal effectiveness. It also showed the lowest smoke particle concentration compared {{with the other two}} systems. The FR system showed better ventilation performance over the mixing system at the space that was close to the floor supply outlet and at the lower height level. The FR system was less effective than the TR system in removing buoyant tobacco smoke particles at {{the upper part of the}} room indicating its highly localized characteristics. Differences in experimental conditions between the present and the previous studies and their effects on the experimental results are discussed. In general, the experimental data suggested that both types of the <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems have the potential of improving air quality at the breathing zone over the ceiling-based mixing system with suitable designs. © Indoor Air (2004) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} some of the most recent tests {{involving}} a number of studies in an unoccupied radon test house. The house has a suspended timber floor and naturally elevated indoor radon levels, peaking at times above 6000 Bqm 3. Various sensors monitor how different ventilation strategies affect indoor radon levels and the building environment Data from five different scenarios is presented. Initially the house was monitored as purchased with poor natural <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation.</b> This was followed by testing whole house pressurisation, improved natural undcrfloor ventilation, and two types of mechanical <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The results from these and future studies may be used to make a more informed choice of remedy, based on a whole number of aspects, not only radon reduction as is frequently the case.

40|$|Measurements {{were carried}} out in an office-type {{experimental}} room ventilated by a floor return-type <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> system to investigate the distributions of airflow velocity and air temperature. A fan-powered floor air unit (FAU) with rectangular supply and return air outlets covered by straight-profile linear bar-type air diffusers was installed to deliver the conditioned air in the experimental room. Turbulence intensity and draught rate distributions inside the room were also calculated by using the measured data. From the experimental results, {{it is found that}} undesirable high air velocities and high draught rates were created within a small region near the supply outlet of the FAU. Temperature differences between different height levels were maintained within an acceptable comfort level under the tested supply air conditions and heat loads. The results indicated that the temperature stratification could be maintained at an acceptable comfort level by designing the supply air conditions properly. A clearance zone is suggested as a design consideration for locating the FAUs and occupants to avoid undesirable draught discomfort to the occupants. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Airflow and {{temperature}} distributions {{in an enclosure}} with heat sources ventilated by floor supply jets with floor or ceiling air exit vents were investigated using experimental and numerical approaches. These ventilation configurations represent the floor return or the top return under floor ventilation systems found in real applications. Experiments and numerical simulations were performed on a full-sized environmental chamber. The results reveal that the temperature strati. cation in the enclosure highly depended on the thermal length scale of the floor supply jets. When the thermal length scale of the supply jet was >> 1, temperature stratification was minor for all tested heat densities and air distribution methods. Significant vertical temperature gradients occurred when the jet thermal length scale was << 1. Changes in air distribution methods also became significant for temperature strati. cation at small supply jet thermal length scales. Temperature stratification also affected the terminal height of the momentum-dominant region of the vertical buoyant supply jets. The applicability of these results to <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> design was also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Frequent {{changes in}} {{arrangement}} in office {{space and the}} huge amount of cables {{brought about by the}} extensive use of computers make the implementation of raised flooring a necessity in modern office buildings. <b>Underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems that make use of the underfloor plenum for conditioned air distribution will therefore increase in popularity as they extend the flexibility of building services and take advantage of the raised floor to accommodate the HVAC system. Previous research has revealed that the top return type underfloor system saves a significant amount of energy, as the supply air temperature can be higher than that in a ceiling-based system. However, thermal discomfort due to temperature non-uniformity was also reported. This paper presents the experiment results of a laboratory study of the thermal performance for a floor return (FR) type underfloor system under different heat load densities and supply air temperatures. Vertical temperature differences and air velocities were found to be within the comfort limits stated in major international standards. The measured predicted mean vote and predicted percentage of dissatisfied values also satisfied the ISO Standard 7730. A comfortable environment was maintained by the FR type system under a dense internal heat load and with the supply air temperature set at as high as 18 degreesC. Copyright © 2002 S.

40|$|The use and {{interest}} in <b>underfloor</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems has been growing due to the systems’ energy savings and inherent flexibility. Because the air distribution openings are in the floor, there has been concern over excessive sound transfer between adjacent spaces through the floor plenum, {{which could lead to}} unacceptable levels of speech privacy and other acoustical problems. Charles M. Salter Associates was hired to provide acoustical input for room acoustics and sound isolation between spaces in an office building incorporating an underfloor air distribution system. The office spaces had differing acoustical requirements, for which five wall types were specified based on the levels of noise reduction and speech privacy required between spaces. Standard offices had walls that terminated {{at the top of the}} raised floor and the floor plenum was left open, while executive offices and conference rooms had an acoustical septum added in the floor plenum at the location of the common wall. This septum was installed to reduce the transfer of noise in the floor plenum between adjacent spaces. Finally, full-height walls were specified for adjacent spaces requiring the highest level of noise reduction. All partitions were extended to the slab above, with offset return air transfer grilles installed on the corridor or open plan side of the offices, to minimize the potential flanking sound path. After construction was completed, acoustical measurements were conducted to quantify the level of noise reduction and speech privacy between adjacent spaces. The overall level of speech privacy between all the various tested spaces met normal privacy standards. The noise reduction performance of the walls without acoustical septums was generally a few points lower than the noise reduction of the same wall as tested in a laboratory without a raised floor. The noise reduction performance of the walls with the acoustical septum was generally the same as the same wall’s performance in the laboratory. This data seems to indicate that the acoustical septum was effective in reducing noise transfer through the floor plenum, and an acoustical septum may be warranted for spaces requiring high levels of speech privacy...|$|E
