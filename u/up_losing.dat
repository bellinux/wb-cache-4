5|$|German luger Georg Hackl is {{the overall}} medal {{leader in the}} sport, having {{collected}} {{a total of five}} medals (three golds and two silvers) in the men's singles, during the six Winter Games in which he competed (1988–2006). Following his victory at the 1992 Winter Olympics, Hackl was the first male luger to successfully defend an Olympic title, in 1994. By repeating this feat in Nagano 1998, he joined two other men (Swedish figure skater Gillis Grafström and German skier Ulrich Wehling) and two women (Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie and American speed skater Bonnie Blair) who had won the same individual event in three consecutive Olympic Games. Hackl was also the first-ever Olympian to win at least one medal in five consecutive Olympics. This effort was matched by Armin Zöggeler of Italy, who won his fifth straight Olympic medal (bronze) in the men's singles at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. In 2002, Zöggeler outperformed Hackl and prevented him from reaching a unique fourth successive gold medal. Four years later, in Turin, Zöggeler became the second male luger to win back-to-back titles. Ten-time World Cup champion Markus Prock of Austria never fulfilled his success at Olympic level: in 1992 and 1994, Prock beat Georg Hackl to the World Cup title, but ended <b>up</b> <b>losing</b> the Olympic gold medal to the German.|$|E

The following day on Raw, their rematch for the tag team belts was inconclusive when the Brotherhood were attacked by Brock Lesnar. Thus, the Brotherhood received another rematch but in a steel cage; they ended <b>up</b> <b>losing</b> to the Outlaws.|$|E
