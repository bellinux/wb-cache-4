40|$|The {{commercial}} {{technology of}} rolling 5, 5 mm-diameter wire rod in Poland’s most modern rolling {{line has been}} examined within the study. The material used for the investigation was the 20 MnB 4 steel intended for subsequent cold working. From the performed analysis of the investigation results {{it has been found}} that the technology of rolling wire rod of cold <b>upsetting</b> <b>steel,</b> which is used currently in the Rolling Mill under examination, allows the production of finished products that can be deformed with a relative reduction of about 33 %. At larger plastic deformations,cracks occur in the material, which disqualifies it from further cold working...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the high-temperature plasticity characteristics of 20 MnB 4 and 30 MnB 4 with micro-additives, intended for cold <b>upsetting</b> and high-carbon <b>steels</b> C 45 and C 70 in the “solid phase-liquid” during heating and cooling. The investigation {{was conducted to}} determine the plastic formability of the examined alloy under hot plastic working conditions. Experiments were carried out on the simulator Gleeble 3800 {{with the aim of}} determining the susceptibility of 20 MnB 4, 30 MnB 4, C 45 and C 70 steels to cracking at high temperature. The nil strength (NST), nil ductility (NDT) and ductility recovery temperatures (DRT), and the fracture toughness factor and the BRT (brittleness temperature range) have been determined...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{hydrogen}} on the fracture toughness properties of upset welded Type 304 L stainless steel were measured and {{compared to those}} measured previously for as-received and as-welded steels. The {{results showed that the}} <b>upset</b> welded <b>steels</b> had good fracture toughness properties, but values were lower than the as-received material. The fracture toughness value of the base material was 6420 in-lbs/sq. in., while the welded steels averaged 3660 in-lbs/sq. in. Hydrogen exposure lowered the fracture toughness values of the as-received steel by 43 % to 3670 in-lbs/sq. in. and the welded steels by 21 % to 2890 in-lbs/sq. in. The fracture morphologies of the unexposed steels showed that ductile fracture occurred by the microvoid nucleation and growth process. The size of the microvoids on the fracture surfaces of the welded steels were much smaller and more closely spaced that those found on the base material fracture surfaces. The change in the size and spacing of the microvoids indicates that the fracture toughness properties of the welded steels were lower than the base steels because of the higher concentration of microscopic precipitates on the weld plane. The welds examined thus far have been {open_quotes}good{close_quotes} welds and the presence of these precipitates was not apparent in standard {open_quotes}low{close_quotes}-magnification metallographic sections of the weld planes. The results indicate that hydrogen did not weaken greatly the solid-state welds but that other inclusions or impurities present prior to welding did. Improvements in surface cleaning and preparation prior to welding should be explored as a way to improve the strength of solid-state welded joints...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} is significant {{on both the}} die and the workpiece in metal forming processes. But, the applications of coupling mechanical work and thermal effect are somewhat complicated. In this study we apply the dynamic finite element method coupled with thermal effect to analyze the upsetting process with different models. The proposed models, either being drawn for industry necessity or designing for research study, are simulated and compared. At first, the numerical models for the <b>upset</b> forming of <b>steel</b> billet are setup. The models consider {{the different types of}} material constitutive equations, different thermal conditions, and Coulomb friction effect. The predicted relationship between the punch load and stroke, the temperature distribution of billet, and the full history of temperature variation are discussed. The influence and usage of the material constitutive equation for the thermal analysis is also assessed. Besides, the developed models of upsetting process are validated by comparison with the published paper. Finally, the proper techniques are implemented to solve the upsetting process with aluminum material. And the temperature distribution {{on the surface of the}} billet in experiment is measured by an infrared camera. A good agreement between the numerical result and experiment data shows the availability of the proposed model. © 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
