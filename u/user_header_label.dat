In {{the last ten}} years much attention has been focused on transporting packets directly over the optical transport networks. Researches in this area range from simple electronic and optical switching/routing methods to hybrid and more complicated all-optical packet switching systems. However, major bottleneck in all these methods is designing fast, reliable and inexpensive optical routing/switching devices. In this thesis, a method for optical routing usmg fiber Bragg gratings is proposed. In this method, electronic interface is used only for routing information (routing table) update cycle while packet header extraction and switching is done in optical domain. Routing is performed optically by controlling the refractive index change in fiber gratings. Four bits of <b>header</b> (<b>label)</b> information is used for routing packets to three different output routes.

50|$|There {{is still}} no defined {{national}} language shift table for French, Greek, Russian, Bulgarian, Arabic, Hebrew and most Central European languages that need a better coverage than the default 7-bit standard character set and its default 7-bit extension character set: if ever any character is composed that cannot be represented in those default GSM 7-bit sets, the message will be automatically reencoded using UCS-2, with the effect of dividing by more than two the maximum length in characters of messages that can be sent {{at the price of}} a single SMS (when a message is split in multiple parts, a few other octets are needed in the <b>User</b> Data <b>Header</b> to indicate the sequence number of each part).|$|R
50|$|The {{messages}} in Chinese, Korean or Japanese languages must be encoded using the UTF-16 character encoding. The same was also true for other languages using non-Latin scripts like Russian, Arabic, Hebrew and various Indian languages. In 3GPP TS 23.038 8.0.0 published in 2008 a new feature, an extended National language shift table was introduced, {{which in the}} version 11.0.0 published in 2012 covers Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu languages. The mechanism replaces GSM 7 bit default alphabet code table and/or extended table with a national table(s) according to special information elements in <b>User</b> Data <b>Header.</b> The non-segmented message using national language shift table(s) may carry up to 155 (or 153) 7-bit characters.|$|R
5000|$|Larger content (concatenated SMS, {{multipart}} or segmented SMS, or [...] "long SMS") {{can be sent}} {{using multiple}} messages, in which case each message will start with a <b>User</b> Data <b>Header</b> (UDH) containing segmentation information.

The receiving handset is then responsible for reassembling the message and presenting it to the user as one long message. While the standard theoretically permits up to 255 segments, 6 to 8 segment messages are the practical maximum, and long messages are often billed as equivalent to multiple SMS messages. Some providers have offered length-oriented pricing schemes for messages, however, the phenomenon is disappearing.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{reporting of}} alcohol consumption, we manipulated the contexts of questions in ways designed to induce social desirability bias. METHOD: We undertook a two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomized trial at an Australian public university. Students were recruited by email to a web-based "Research Project on Student Health Behavior. " Respondents answered nine {{questions about their}} physical activity, diet, and smoking. They were unknowingly randomized to a group presented with either (A) three questions about their alcohol consumption or (B) seven questions about their alcohol dependence and problems (under a prominent <b>header</b> <b>labeled</b> "Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test"), followed by the same three alcohol consumption questions from (A). RESULTS: A total of 3, 594 students (mean age = 27, SD = 10) responded and were randomized: 1, 778 to Group A and 1, 816 to Group B. Outcome measures were {{the number of days}} they drank alcohol, the typical number of drinks they consumed per drinking day, and the number of days they consumed six or more drinks. The primary analysis included participants with any alcohol consumption in the preceding 4 weeks (1, 304 in Group A; 1, 340 in Group B) using between-group, two-tailed t tests. RESULTS: In Groups A and B, respectively, means (and SDs) of the number of days drinking were 5. 89 (5. 92) versus 6. 06 (6. 12), p =. 49; typical number of drinks per drinking day: 4. 02 (3. 87) versus 3. 82 (3. 76), p =. 17; and number of days consuming six or more drinks: 1. 69 (2. 94) versus 1. 67 (3. 25), p =. 56.

40|$|Short {{messaging}} service (SMS) {{is perhaps the}} most popular mobile technology prevalent among students in higher education due to its ubiquitous nature and the capability of two-way communication. However, a major limitation in two-way text messaging is sending back a part of received data with the reply message.

This article presents a two-way text messaging system that can be integrated into a learning management system (LMS) to provide an interactive learning experience to the user community. Initially, a database is integrated into the LMS that holds message information such as recipient's phone number, message body and <b>user</b> data <b>header.</b> A specific port associated with the SMS is used to conceal and exchange data of a particular course unit. Subsequently, software in the student's mobile device captures this message and sends back the reply message to the appropriate course unit allowing both teachers and students to view messages sent and replies received pertaining to a particular course.
