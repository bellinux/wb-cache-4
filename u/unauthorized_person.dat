5|$|Three {{attempts}} to sabotage the ship {{were discovered in}} 1904. On 31 March, rivets on the keel plates were found bored through. On 14 September, a 1⅜in (3.5cm) bolt was found driven into the launching way, where it protruded some 5in (11cm). Shortly after the Connecticut was launched on 29 September, a hole 1in (2.5cm) in diameter was discovered drilled through a ⅝in (1.6cm) steel keel plate. The ship's watertight compartments and pumps prevented her from sinking, and all damage was repaired. The incidents prompted the Navy to post armed guards at the shipyard, and an overnight watch was kept by a Navy tug manned by Marines who had orders to shoot to kill any <b>unauthorized</b> <b>person</b> attempting to approach the ship.|$|E
25|$|In open public spaces, {{extinguishers}} are ideally kept inside cabinets {{that have}} glass {{that must be}} broken to access the extinguisher, or which emit an alarm siren that cannot be shut off without a key, to alert people the extinguisher has been handled by an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>person</b> if a fire is not present. This also alerts maintenance to check an extinguisher for usage so {{that it may be}} replaced if it has been used.|$|E
25|$|On June 14, 2013, United States federal {{prosecutors}} filed a criminal complaint against Snowden, charging him with theft of government property, and {{two counts of}} violating the Espionage Act through unauthorized communication of national defense information and willful communication of classified communications intelligence information to an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>person.</b> Each of the three charges carries a maximum possible prison term of ten years. The charge was initially secret and was unsealed a week later.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} valid reasons that lasers are aimed into airspace. Lasers {{are used in}} {{industry}} and research, such as in atmospheric remote sensing, and as [...] "guide stars" [...] in adaptive optics astronomy. Lasers and searchlights are used in entertainment; for example, in outdoor shows such as the nightly IllumiNations show at Walt Disney World's Epcot. Laser pointers are used by the general public; sometimes they will be accidentally or deliberately aimed at or near aircraft. (Of course, no <b>unauthorized</b> <b>person</b> should deliberately aim any type of laser at or near an aircraft.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Grand Central Terminal's [...] basements {{are among}} {{the largest in the}} city. This {{includes}} M42, a [...] "secret" [...] sub-basement under the terminal that contains the AC to DC converters used to supply DC traction current to the tracks. The exact location of M42 is a closely guarded secret and does not appear on maps, though it has been shown on the History Channel program Cities of the Underworld and a National Geographic special. Two of the original rotary converters were not removed in the late 20th century when solid-state ones took over their job, and they remain as a historical record. During World War II, this facility was closely guarded because its sabotage would have impaired troop movement on the Eastern Seaboard. It is said that any <b>unauthorized</b> <b>person</b> entering the facility during the war risked being shot on sight; the rotary converters could have easily been crippled by a bucket of sand. Abwehr (a German espionage service) sent two spies to sabotage it; they were arrested by the FBI before they could strike.|$|E

60|$|He wrote a {{long letter}} to Edna--a straightforward, business-like missive, as his letters had always been, in which, in {{language}} {{which she could}} understand, but would carry no intelligible idea to any <b>unauthorized</b> <b>person</b> who might open the letter, he gave her an account {{of what he had}} done, and which was calculated to relieve all apprehensions, should it be yet a long time before he reached her. He promised to write again whenever there was an opportunity of sending her a letter, and wrote in such a friendly and encouraging manner that he felt sure there would be no reason for any disappointment or anxiety regarding him and the treasure.|$|E
60|$|Presently Kenwardine {{picked out}} an {{envelope}} with a British stamp {{from among the}} rest and turned it over before inserting a knife behind the flap, which yielded easily, as if the gum had lost its strength. Then he took out the letter and smiled with ironical amusement. If it had been read by any <b>unauthorized</b> <b>person</b> before it reached him, the reader {{would have been much}} misled, but it told him what he wanted to know. There was one word an Englishman or American would not have used, though a Teuton might have done so, but Kenwardine thought a Spaniard would not notice this, even if he knew English well. The other letters were not important, and he glanced at his daughter.|$|E

He later pleaded guilty to allowing an <b>unauthorized</b> <b>person</b> to drive and the other charges were dropped. On August 17, 2013, Lawson and his girlfriend, Ashley Pettiford, were arrested by police in Arapahoe County responding to a domestic violence call. Lawson was arrested on suspicion of committing two misdemeanors, domestic violence-related harassment and property damage. Both Lawson and Pettiford were released on $1,000 bond and charges were ultimately dropped.|$|E
