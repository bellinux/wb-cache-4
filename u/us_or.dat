5|$|As the Merlin was {{considered}} to be so important to the war effort, negotiations were soon started to establish an alternative production line outside the UK. Rolls-Royce staff visited a number of North American automobile manufacturers in order to select one to build the Merlin in the <b>U.S.</b> <b>or</b> Canada. Henry Ford rescinded an initial offer to build the engine in the U.S. in July 1940, and the Packard Motor Car Company was subsequently selected to take on the $130,000,000 Merlin order. Agreement was reached in September 1940, and the first Packard-built engine, a Merlin XX designated the V-1650-1, ran in August 1941.|$|E

5|$|Dazzle {{camouflage}}, {{also known}} as razzle dazzle (in the <b>U.S.)</b> <b>or</b> dazzle painting, was a family of ship camouflage used extensively in World War I, {{and to a lesser}} extent in World War II and afterwards. Credited to the British marine artist Norman Wilkinson, though with a rejected prior claim by the zoologist John Graham Kerr, it consisted of complex patterns of geometric shapes in contrasting colours, interrupting and intersecting each other.|$|E
5|$|Fears then arose for the engine's future, the {{speculation}} being {{that it might}} remain in the <b>US</b> <b>or</b> even be broken up. After Alan Bloom made a personal phone call to him in January 1973, William McAlpine stepped in and bought the locomotive for Â£25,000 direct from the finance company in San Francisco docks. After its return to the UK via the Panama Canal in February 1973, McAlpine paid for the locomotive's restoration at Derby Works.|$|E
5|$|Manning's first play, <b>Us</b> <b>or</b> Them, was {{initially}} produced at the Childers Street Hall in Canberra on 1 November 1977. It was then re-written and performed in 1984 at the Stables Theatre for the Griffin Theatre Company, where it marked {{a turning point}} in Griffin's history as the play's success led to the cast and creatives being paid full professional rates. The play then transferred to the Philip St Theatre and on to the Q Theatre in Penrith.|$|E

5|$|Many rivers {{originating}} in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive {{a significant portion}} of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river's flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the <b>US</b> <b>or</b> most of Iran and Afghanistan, very low flow {{for the rest of the}} year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.|$|E
5|$|Non-use of {{seat belts}} is a {{significant}} risk factor. According to Col. Tom Butler, chief of the Montana Highway Patrol, preliminary 2015 data indicated that 178 of the 224 vehicle occupant fatalities were of individuals not wearing seat belts. The fine in Montana for not wearing a seat belt in 2015 was $20. Although speed limits increased from 75mph to 80mph on rural interstates that year, the biggest statewide increase in both crashes and deaths occurred on secondary roads. Forty-three people died on Montana two-lane roads outside of towns that are neither <b>U.S.</b> <b>or</b> state highways.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April a South Vietnamese armored {{task force}} crossed the Cambodian border {{into the area}} known as the Parrot's Beak, {{northwest}} of Saigon. The following day a multi-division U.S./South Vietnamese force rolled over the border and into the area known as the Fishhook, north of Saigon and opposite Binh Long Province. With the exception of heavy fighting at the town of Snoul, PAVN/NLF resistance was light {{since most of the}} North Vietnamese had been withdrawn from the border regions for operations against FANK. In quick succession, all of the border sanctuaries were struck, to one degree or another, by <b>U.S.</b> <b>or</b> South Vietnamese forces.|$|E

No prior military service is required for admission to USUHS's medical school. Students who already hold military commissions at higher rank in the Army, Air Force and Navy are required to accept temporary administrative demotion to O-1 for medical school; officers of the U.S. Marine Corps, <b>U.S.</b> Coast Guard, <b>or</b> National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps must resign their existing commissions and accept commissions in as O-1s {{in one of the}} other three authorized services.|$|R
5|$|We {{were trying}} to avoid that whole game of who gets in first with the reviews. These days there's so much paper to fill, or digital paper to fill, that whoever writes the first few things gets cut and pasted. Whoever gets their opinion in first has all that power. Especially for a band like ours, it's totally {{the luck of the}} draw whether that person is into <b>us</b> <b>or</b> not. It just seems wildly unfair, I think.|$|E
5|$|When deployed, the E-3 {{monitors}} an assigned area of {{the battlefield}} and provides information for commanders of air operations to gain and maintain control of the battle; while as an air defense asset, E-3s can detect, identify, and track airborne enemy forces far from {{the boundaries of the}} <b>U.S.</b> <b>or</b> NATO countries and can direct fighter-interceptor aircraft to these targets. In support of air-to-ground operations, the E-3 can provide direct information needed for interdiction, reconnaissance, airlift, and close-air support for friendly ground forces.|$|E
5|$|In dressage, the Finnhorse is able {{to compete}} with warmbloods up to {{national}} levels, and in lower levels it has the upper hand because it can easily perform the required movements, and has smoother gaits that allow for ease of riding. In 2010, a Finnhorse medaled in international paraequestrian dressage competition. In higher level dressage, the breed however it is hindered by its less-flashy movement, restricted by a somewhat upright shoulder. Despite this there are successful dressage horses, {{and a number of}} Finnhorses even earn their keep with their dressage winnings, a notable achievement as competing in Finland is expensive and prize money low. Most Finnhorses used in dressage compete at the national 4th level (<b>US)</b> <b>or</b> Grade IV (GB), though some individuals have competed at the Prix de St. Georges level.|$|E

5|$|In the 1970s, the Soviet Union {{reached the}} peak of its {{political}} and strategic power {{in relation to the}} United States. The first SALT Treaty effectively established parity in nuclear weapons between the two superpowers, the Helsinki Treaty legitimised Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe, and the United States defeat in Vietnam and the Watergate scandal weakened the prestige of the United States. Brezhnev and Nixon also agreed to pass the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned both countries from designing systems that would intercept incoming missiles so that neither the <b>U.S.</b> <b>or</b> the Soviet Union would be tempted to strike the other without the fear of retaliation. The Soviet Union extended its diplomatic and political influence in the Middle East and Africa.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the <b>US</b> <b>or</b> Germany.|$|E
5|$|The California {{sea lion}} ranges {{along the western}} coast and islands of North America, from {{southeast}} Alaska to central Mexico. Mitochondrial DNA sequences in 2009 have identified five distinct California sea lion populations: the <b>U.S.</b> <b>or</b> Pacific Temperate stock, the Western Baja California or Pacific Tropical stock, and the Southern, Central, and Northern Gulf of California stocks. The U.S. stock breeds mainly in the Channel Islands, although some breeding sites may be established in northern California, and females are now commonly found there. The Western Baja California stock mainly breeds near Punta Eugenia and at Isla Santa Margarita. The above-mentioned stocks are separated by the Ensenada Front. The stocks of the Gulf of California live in the shallow waters of the north (Northern stock), the tidal islands near the center (Central stock), and {{the mouth of the}} bay (Southern stock). The stock status of the sea lions at the deep waters of the central bay has not been analyzed.|$|E
