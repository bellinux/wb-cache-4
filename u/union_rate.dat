50|$|Non {{displaced}} or minimally displaced {{waist and}} distal fractures {{have a high}} rate of union with closed cast management. The choice of short arm, short arm thumb spica or long arm cast is debated in the medical literature and no clear consensus or proof of the benefit of one type of casting or another has been shown; although it is generally accepted to use a short arm or short arm thumb spica for non displaced fractures. Non displaced or minimally displaced fracture can also be treated with percutaneous or minimal incision surgery which if performed correctly has a high <b>union</b> <b>rate,</b> low morbidity and faster return to activity than closed cast management. Percutaneous screw fixation is recommended over a wide surgical approach as this method preserves the palmar ligament complex and local vasculature, and helps avoid postoperative complications. This surgery includes screwing the scaphoid bone back together at the most perpendicular angle possible to promote quicker and stronger healing of the bone. During this procedure, slight excavation of the edge of the trapezium bone may be necessary to reach the scaphoid as 80% of this bone is covered with articular cartilage, which makes it difficult {{to gain access to the}} scaphoid.|$|E
5000|$|Princeton {{economics}} professor, Nobel laureate, and John Bates Clarke Award winner Paul Krugman {{argues that}} politics not economic conditions have made income inequality in the United States [...] "unique" [...] {{and to a}} degree that [...] "other advanced countries have not seen." [...] According to Krugman, government action can either compress or widen income inequality through tax policy and other redistributive or transfer policies. Krugman illustrates this point by describing [...] "The Great Compression" [...] and [...] "The Great Divergence." [...] He states {{that the end of the}} Great Depression to the end of World War II, from 1939-1946, saw a rapid narrowing of the spread of the income distribution in America which effectively created the middle class. Krugman calls this economic time period [...] "The Great Compression" [...] because the income distribution was compressed. He attributes this phenomenon to intrinsically equalizing economic policy such as increased tax rates on the wealthy, higher corporate tax rates, a pro-union organizing environment, minimum wage, Social Security, unemployment insurance, and [...] "extensive government controls on the economy that were used in a way that tended to equalize incomes." [...] This [...] "artificially" [...] created middle class endured due to the creation of middle class institutions, norms, and expectations that promoted income equality. Krugman believes this period ends in 1980, which he points out as being [...] "interesting" [...] because it was when [...] "Reagan came to the White House." [...] From 1980 to the present, Krugman believes income inequality was uniquely shaped by the political environment and not the global economic environment. For example, the U.S. and Canada both had approximately 30% of its workers in unions during the 1960s. However, by 2010, around 25% of Canadian workers were still unionized while 11% of American workers were unionized. Krugman blames Reagan for this rapid decline in unionization because he [...] "declared open season on unions" [...] while the global market clearly made room for unions as Canada's high <b>union</b> <b>rate</b> proves. Contrary to the arguments made by Chicago economists such as Gary Becker, Krugman points out that while the wealth gap between the college educated and non-college educated continues to grow, the largest rise in income inequality is between the well-educated-college graduates and college graduates, and not between college graduates and non-college graduates. The average high school teacher, according to Krugman, has a post-graduate degree which is a comparable level of education to a hedge fund manager whose income is several times that of the average high school teacher. In 2006, the [...] "highest paid hedge fund manager in the United States made an amount equal to the salaries of all 80,000 New York City school teachers for the next three years." [...] Accordingly, Krugman believes that education and a shifting global market are not the sole causes of increased income inequalities since the 1980s but rather that politics and the implementation of conservative ideology has aggregated wealth to the rich. Some of these political policies include the Reagan tax cuts in 1981 and 1986.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effective-ness of surgical management for acute Jones ’ fractures and Torg types I and II proximal diaphyseal stress frac-tures presenting acutely in both athletes and nonathletes.

Immediate intramedullary screw fixation of acute Jones ’ fractures and type I stress fractures resulted in a 100 % <b>union</b> <b>rate</b> with an average time to union of 6. 2 weeks. Fixation of type II stress fractures had a <b>union</b> <b>rate</b> of 100 % with a mean time to union of 8. 3 weeks. The overall complication rate was 9 %.

50|$|Ratings of 4 and 5 {{indicate}} that the credit union exhibits an unacceptably high exposure to risk.

Ratings of 4 or 5 may also indicate levels of liquidity such that the credit union cannot adequately meet demands for funds. Such a credit union should take immediate action to lower its interest-rate exposure, improve its liquidity, or otherwise improve its condition. The level of earnings and capital provide inadequate support for the degree of balance sheet risk taken by the credit union.|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to systematically review the currently available literature to formulate evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of femoral shaft nonunions for clinical practice and to establish recommendations for future research. Articles from PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Clinical Trial Register, and EMBASE, that presented data concerning treatment of nonunions of femoral shaft fractures in adult humans, were included for data extraction and analysis. The search was restricted to articles from January 1970 to March 2011 written in the English, German, or Dutch languages. Articles containing data that were thought to have been presented previously were used once. Reports on nonunion after periprosthetic fractures, review articles, expert opinions, abstracts from scientific meetings, and case reports on 5 or fewer patients were excluded. The data that were extracted from the relevant articles included: type of nonunion, type of initial and secondary treatments, follow-up, <b>union</b> <b>rate,</b> and general complications. Most studies had different inclusion criteria and outcome measures, thus prohibiting a proper meta-analysis. Therefore, only the <b>union</b> <b>rate</b> and number of complications were compared between the different treatments. Methodological quality was assessed by assigning levels of evidence as previously defined by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. This systematic review provides evidence in favour of plating if a nail is the first treatment; after failed plate fixation, nailing has a 96  % <b>union</b> <b>rate.</b> After failed nailing, augmentative plating results in a 96  % <b>union</b> <b>rate</b> compared to 73  % in the exchange nailing group.|$|E
