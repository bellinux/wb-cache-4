5|$|As was <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> California at the time, both Nixon and Voorhis cross-filed in {{the other}} party's primary, a {{practice}} Voorhis had long adopted. Winning both primaries virtually assured election. Each candidate won his own party's primary, with Voorhis garnering {{a considerable number of}} votes in the Republican primary, and outpolling Nixon by 7,000votes overall. Nixon gained momentum, however, when the newspapers pointed out that Voorhis's total percentage of the vote had decreased from 60% in 1944 to 53.5%.|$|E
5|$|As was <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> the district, the inquest {{was held}} at the Lamb Tap public house, Chiswick, by the coroner Dr Thomas Bramah Diplock, on 2 January 1889. The coroner's jury {{concluded}} that Druitt had committed suicide by drowning while in an unsound state of mind. He was buried in Wimborne cemetery the next day. At probate, his estate was valued at £2,600 (equivalent to £ today).|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata with the Thomanerchor on 2 February 1725, in the morning service in the Nikolaikirche and reprised it in the vesper service in the Thomaskirche, as was <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> Leipzig on high holidays.

30|$|Generally, the CH {{identifies}} {{whether its}} members are <b>in</b> <b>usual</b> or unusual condition. The CH may not identify the member as in unusual condition or CH may inaccurately identify the CM as <b>in</b> <b>usual</b> condition. <b>In</b> order to detect the CMs accurately as <b>in</b> <b>usual</b> condition or <b>in</b> unusual condition, the detection of CMs may be categorized into (i) true detection, (ii) false detection, and (iii) undetection. The true detection is defined as CH that accurately detects the member as unusual when that member is jammed. The false detection is defined as CH that wrongly detects the member as unusual though that member is usual. The undetection is defined as CH that wrongly detects the member as usual although the member is actually jammed.|$|R
5|$|Females {{have four}} pairs of mammae, as <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines. Like most rice rats, Transandinomys species have twelve {{thoracic}} (chest) and seven lumbar vertebrae. According {{to a study}} in Costa Rica, T.bolivaris has 58chromosomes {{and the number of}} chromosomal arms (fundamental number) is 80 (2n=58, FN=80). Studies in Ecuador and Venezuela have recorded several different karyotypes in T.talamancae, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 34 to 54 and the fundamental number from 60 to 67.|$|E

5|$|Agathaeromys is {{characterized}} {{mainly on the}} basis of features of the molar teeth. As <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> muroid rodents, there are three molars {{on both sides of the}} upper jaw (referred to as M1, M2, and M3 from front to back) and lower jaw (referred to as m1, m2, and m3). Agathaeromys is generally similar to other oryzomyines, but differs from other genera in a variety of details of the molar crowns. Agathaeromys donovani (M1 length 2.03–2.84 mm) is substantially larger than A.praeuniversitatis (M1 length 1.77–1.94 mm).|$|E
5|$|As <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both}} the last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) vertebrae, a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} vertebrae, are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal vertebrae, hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E
5|$|As <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines, the molars are pentalophodont (have the mesolophs and mesolophids, {{accessory}} crests, well developed) and bunodont, {{with the}} cusps {{higher than the}} connecting crests. The cusps on the upper molars are arranged in two longitudinal series, not three as in the black and brown rats. The front cusps of the first upper and lower molar (anterocone and anteroconid, respectively) are broad and not divided completely by an anteromedian flexus or flexid. Behind the anterocone, the anteroloph (a smaller crest) is complete and separated from the anterocone. On both {{the second and third}} lower molars, the anterolophid (a crest on the inner front corner) is present, a putative synapomorphy of the genus. The first molars have additional small roots in addition to the main ones, so that the upper first molar has four and the lower has three or four roots.|$|E

5|$|Early Scottish monarchs did not {{inherit the}} Crown directly; instead {{the custom of}} tanistry was followed, where the monarchy alternated between {{different}} branches of the House of Alpin. As a result, however, the rival dynastic lines clashed, often violently. From 942 to 1005, seven consecutive monarchs were either murdered or killed in battle. In 1005, Malcolm II ascended the throne having killed many rivals. He continued to ruthlessly eliminate opposition, and {{when he died in}} 1034 he was succeeded by his grandson, Duncan I, instead of a cousin, as had been <b>usual.</b> <b>In</b> 1040, Duncan suffered defeat in battle at the hands of Macbeth, who was killed himself in 1057 by Duncan's son Malcolm. The following year, after killing Macbeth's stepson Lulach, Malcolm ascended the throne as Malcolm III.|$|E
5|$|Hipposideros besaoka is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Hipposideros. It is known from {{numerous}} jaws and teeth, which {{were collected in}} a cave at Anjohibe in 1996 and described as a new species in 2007. The site where H.besaoka was found is at most 10,000 years old; {{other parts of the}} cave have yielded H. commersoni, a living species of Hipposideros from Madagascar, and some material that is distinct from both species. H.besaoka was larger than H.commersoni, making it the largest insectivorous bat of Madagascar, and had broader molars and a more robust lower jaw. As <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> Hipposideros, the second upper premolar is small and displaced from the toothrow, and the second lower premolar is large.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the salmon}} catch {{was smaller than}} <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> the rivers of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia, causing concern among {{commercial}} fishermen, government agencies, and tribal leaders. US government intervention, to which the states of Alaska, Idaho, and Oregon objected, included an 11-day closure of an Alaska fishery. In April 1994 the Pacific Fisheries Management Council unanimously approved the strictest regulations in 18years, banning all commercial salmon fishing for that year from Cape Falcon north to the Canada–US border. In the winter of 1994, the return of coho salmon far exceeded expectations, which was attributed {{in part to the}} fishing ban.|$|E
5|$|New York, Boston, and Philadelphia {{did their}} best to outdo each other in the {{celebrations}} honoring Lafayette. Needing a place to hold a reception for him, Philadelphia renovated the Old State House (today Independence Hall), which might otherwise have been torn down. Until that point, it had not been <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> the United States to build monuments, but Lafayette's visit set off a wave of construction, usually with Lafayette, in his capacity as Mason, laying the cornerstone. The arts benefited by his visits as well, as many cities commissioned portraits for their civic buildings, and the likenesses were seen on innumerable souvenirs. Lafayette had intended to visit only the original thirteen states during a four-month visit; the stay stretched to sixteen months as he visited all twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|Running back Michael Bush was {{predicted}} {{to return to}} form after suffering a foot injury that {{kept him out of}} two games in November. Bush ran for 121yards and three touchdowns against Connecticut, his first game back from the injury. Heading into the Gator Bowl, Bush earned a school-record 24touchdowns and led the country in scoring. He ran for 1,049yards in nine games. He was also a capable receiver, catching 20passes for 245yards and a touchdown. But with Brohm on the sidelines, it was expected the Cardinals would rely on Bush's legs more than <b>usual,</b> <b>in</b> an effort to minimize the need for the inexperienced Cantwell to pass the ball.|$|E

5|$|The {{children}} {{were put into}} {{the care of a}} nanny, as was <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> upper-class families at the time. The first nanny was dismissed for insolence and the second for abusing the children. This second woman, anxious to suggest that the children preferred her to anyone else, would pinch Edward and Albert whenever they were about to be presented to their parents so that they would start crying and be speedily returned to her. On discovery, she was replaced by her effective and much-loved assistant, Charlotte Bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is less robust than in T.bolivaris. The coronoid process (a {{process in}} the back part of the bone) is small and the capsular process, which houses {{the root of the}} lower incisor, are small. The mental foramen, located in the diastema between the lower incisor and the first molar, opens towards the side, as <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> oryzomyines. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, do not join into a single crest and extend forward to below the first molar.|$|E
5|$|The {{movements}} 1 (Magnificat), 7 (Fecit potentiam) and 12 (Gloria patri) are {{the cornerstones of}} the composition: {{they are}} in the tonic key (E major for BWV 243a, D major for BWV 243), and are the only movements that feature a five-part chorus as well as a tutti orchestra. The chorus also sings in movement 4 (Omnes generationes), accompanied by an orchestra without trumpets and timpani. Each of these four choral movements are, in the version without the Christmas hymns, followed by two movements for a vocal soloist, the second one often with richer scoring. In the movements for vocal soloists the instrumentation is as <b>usual</b> <b>in</b> Bach's cantata's: the soloists are accompanied by an obbligato instrument, only strings and/or continuo. Movement A (Vom Himmel hoch) is the only a cappella movement.|$|E
