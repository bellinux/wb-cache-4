Beef, cattle and mutton/lamb is the second largest export of the community. Although Sokolac has a small dairy factory, the milk market production is very small. Sokolac is surrounded by high quality woodlands, which have been largely cut down in last ten years.

This was usually confined to a narrow platform that circuited the village of Topo and the lower portion of Santo Antão. These were ideal conditions, with their ravines and rugged valleys, that allowed the cultivation of taro, which assumed a dominant part of the local agriculture and economy. The taro was usually cultivated along the margins of the fields that were seeded with cereal crops and provided a guaranteed source of proteins for local settlers, <b>until</b> the <b>potato</b> was introduced later in the century. The plant occupied areas with abundant sources of water and could tolerate areas of shade, and were therefore ideal in the fajãs, ravines and valleys, taking advantage of access to water and waterfalls.

40|$|Phytophthora infestans (P. infestans) is {{the causal}} agent of potato late blight, which caused the devastating Irish Potato Famine during 1845 - 1852. <b>Until</b> now, <b>potato</b> late blight {{is still the}} most serious threat to potato growth and has caused {{significant}} economic losses worldwide. Melatonin can induce plant innate immunity against pathogen infection, but the direct effects of melatonin on plant pathogens are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the direct effects of melatonin on P. infestans. Exogenous melatonin significantly attenuated the potato late blight by inhibiting mycelial growth, changing cell ultrastructure, and reducing stress tolerance of P. infestans. Notably, synergistic anti-fungal effects of melatonin with fungicides on P. infestans suggest that melatonin could reduce the dose levels and enhance the efficacy of fungicide against potato late blight. A transcriptome analysis was carried out to mine downstream genes whose expression levels were affected by melatonin. The analysis of the transcriptome suggests that 66 differentially expressed genes involved in amino acid metabolic processes were significantly affected by melatonin. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes associated with stress tolerance, fungicide resistance, and virulence were also affected. These findings contribute to a new understanding of the direct functions of the melatonin on P. infestans and provide a potential ecofriendly biocontrol approach using a melatonin-based paradigm and application to prevent potato late blight...|$|R

30|$|One of {{the main}} aims for using genetic {{modification}} when developing LBR potato varieties is to achieve resistance that is lasting over time [10]. Novel molecular technologies have advanced researchers' ability to identify and characterize genes that provide late blight resistance and transfer these genes from wild potato species to commercial ones [13]. Still, several questions remain about the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed resistance of potato plants [60 – 62]. Similarly, {{more research is needed}} to advance the understanding of the molecular and genetic mechanisms of virulence and adaptability in the P. infestans population [63]. Further research of these knowledge gaps is crucial in the search for ways to achieve durable LBR potato varieties. Still, these uncertainties are seldom acknowledged and openly discussed in public, as for instance illustrated with the lack of attention that these issue are given in a recent report written by leading European researchers involved in the development of cisgenic LBR potato [64]. Rather, the message conveyed by researcher working in this field is that GM potato will significantly contribute to a more sustainable potato production by providing the potato plant with a defence system that lasts over time [10, 20, 64 – 67]. They argue that this approach makes it easier for researchers to introduce several R genes into the same potato variety, which is expected to tip the ‘evolutionary’ balance in favour of the potato plant and against P. infestans, as it will be more difficult and time consuming for P. infestans to overcome multiple defence mechanisms at once. When this approach is presented to public, it is however largely under communicated that the durability of the cisgenic LBR GM potato can only be assessed in retrospect, meaning that it is problematic to predict how long the resistance will last <b>until</b> the <b>potato</b> is put in large-scale production and cultivated over time.|$|R
40|$|Viscoelastic {{properties}} for carrot and potato were experimentally determined by stress relaxation tests using uniaxial compressive tests of cylindrical specimens at various deformation rates (5, 10 and 20 cm/min). Stress relaxation tests were performed following conventional drying at 70 °C and 15 % humidity for various moisture contents ranging from 10 to 80 %. The tests were performed using a Zwick testing machine and the stress relaxation data were modeled using a two-term Maxwell model.

40|$|Objective of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} establishment and persistence of the entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs), Steinernema feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora in different field crops and rotation regimes. A total number of 10, 980 soil samples was collected and investigated for the presence of EPN over the period 2001 <b>until</b> 2004. In <b>potatoes</b> and pasture establishment of H. bacteriophora often failed, whereas this species established well in beans, oil seed rape, wheat and barley. It dropped considerably after tillage and during the winter. The longest persistence of H. bacteriophora was detected 23 months after release in beans followed by wheat as cover crop over red clover and pasture. In this field larvae of the pea weevil Sitona lineatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were detected in soil samples and found infected with the released nematode population. Persistence of H. bacteriophora was high in pots containing larvae of the black vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) on strawberries. Mortality of the insect surpassed 90 % although nematodes had been applied by dipping strawberry roots a months before eggs were laid into the pots. Released in November on a field infested with cabbage root fly larvae Delia radicum (Diptera: Anthonomyiidae), S. feltiae was recorded in 100 % of the soil samples in February and in 80 % of the soil samples after 9 months when the monitoring stopped. The comparison on persistence in the absence of host insects with the results obtained in the field strongly indicates that persistence is influenced by the presence of suitable host insects and indirectly by the crop. Thus the antagonistic potential of EPN populations can be preserved if host insects are provided by managing a suitable crop rotation regime...|$|R
