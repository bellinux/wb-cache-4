25|$|Crazywell Cross is {{an ancient}} cross close to Crazywell Pool in {{southern}} Dartmoor. Like the cross pattée, {{the arms of the}} cross grow wider as they move away from the centre. It probably was used as a marker for the track (Monks' Path) from Buckfast Abbey to Tavistock Abbey. The head of the cross was found close to the north-east side of the pool by William Crossing. He believed that its original site was nearer to the track and it was fitted with a new shaft and set <b>up</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> 1952 it was reported to the Dartmoor Preservation Association that the cross had been damaged again and it was repaired and the base made more secure.|$|E
25|$|Sagan wrote {{frequently}} {{about religion}} {{and the relationship between}} religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: Some people think God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.|$|E

After serving in the successive navies of the emerging German state, Thetis was stricken from the navy list on 28 November 1871.

25|$|On 30 April 1944, {{after four}} days of {{intensive}} drills, PC-1264 went up the Hudson River to Iona Island to load ammunition for her guns for the first time. After loading, Lt. Purdon expected to moor there for the night, but was not allowed due to the danger from {{the large amount of}} ammunition stored there. Looking for a berth for the night, he called the duty office of the nearby U.S. Military Academy at West Point to ask if his ship could tie up at its pier. There was some confusion, as no Navy ship had tied <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> recent history. However, PC-1264, with its mostly African-American crew was made welcome, and numerous visitors walked along the dock inspecting her. In addition, the U.S. Army provided two buses, and many of the enlisted crewmen were taken {{on a tour of the}} Academy under the guidance of knowledgeable sergeants.|$|E
25|$|Omar {{was born}} in Riyadh, growing <b>up</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> a working-class environment, to a family of Hadhrami descent from the Hadhramaut Governorate. His father Abdulrahman Ahmed was a former player, he the {{youngest}} of two sisters and three older brothers, Ahmad, Khaled and Mohammed. He began playing football {{at a very young}} age and was playing most of his time in Riyadh neighborhoods. He drew attention from scout Abdulrahman Eissa, who saw him by chance at Al Malaz yard near Prince Faisal bin Fahd Stadium and admired his talent and asked about the club that he played for. The answer was that he was not playing for any club and also did not hold Saudi nationality. After Abdulrahman Eissa began to contact him and his brother, he then began participating in tournaments and courses alongside Yahya Al-Shehri. In 2000, he went on a trial with Al Hilal who were very interested in signing him. However, as full Saudi nationality was only offered to him and not his entire family, his father rejected the offer. Then a call came to Abdulrahman Eissa's friend Ahmed Al Garoon from Honorary member of Al Ain, Nasser bin Thaloub who was searching for young talented players. Abdulrahman Eissa told him about Omar's talent and his brothers Mohammed and Khalid. He asked for their passports and they joined the external Al Ain camp in Germany. Al Ain agreed to grant citizenship to his whole family who then moved to the United Arab Emirates. Omar joined the club with two of his brothers and enrolled in the club's youth academy.|$|E
