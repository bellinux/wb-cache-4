40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether concrete that includes un-graded recycled aggregates can be manufactured to a comparable strength to concrete manufactured from virgin aggregates. Design/methodology/approach – A paired comparison test was used to evaluate the difference between concrete made with virgin aggregates (plain control) and concrete including recycled waste. Un-graded construction demolition waste and un-graded ground glass were used as aggregate replacements. With regard to concrete, compressive strength is widely used as a measure of suitability as being fit for purpose. Therefore compressive strength was mainly used to compare the different concrete batches; however density was measured across the range of samples. Findings – The findings show that a lower average compressive strength is achieved when compared to the plain control sample manufactured with virgin aggregates. Correct particle packing may not be achieved and grading of aggregates is essential prior to mix design. The recycled aggregate was highly variable in terms of the fine particle content, which affected the water demand of the concrete. Practical implications – This manufacturing practice is considered necessary because of the current trend in using waste products in concrete to replace binders and aggregates; thus reducing the impact on the environment and use of finite natural resources. The research shows the risk of mixing concrete using a simple aggregate replacement without careful aggregate grading and adjustments to the mix design. Originality/value – The paper examines 100 per cent <b>ungraded</b> <b>aggregate</b> replacement with glass and demolition waste...|$|E

For this reason the Iowa Highway Research Board has sponsored a number of research programs {{for the purpose of}} developing new and effective methods for making use of whatever materials are locally available. This need is ever more pressing today due to the decreasing availability of road funds and quality materials, and the increasing costs of energy and all types of binder materials. In the 1950 s, Professor L. H. Csanyi of Iowa State University had demonstrated both in the laboratory and in the field, in Iowa and in a number of foreign countries, the effectiveness of preparing low cost mixes by stabilizing <b>ungraded</b> local <b>aggregates</b> such as gravel, sand and loess with asphalt cements using the foamed asphalt process. In this process controlled foam was produced by introducing saturated steam at about 40 psi into heated asphalt cement at about 25 psi through a specially designed and properly adjusted nozzle. The reduced viscosity and the increased volume and surface energy in the foamed asphalt allowed intimate coating and mixing of cold, wet aggregates or soils. Through the use of asphalt cements in a foamed state, materials normally considered unsuitable could be used in the preparation of mixes for stabilized bases and surfaces for low traffic road construction. By attaching the desired number of foam nozzles, the foamed asphalt can be used in conjunction with any type of mixing plant, either stationary or mobile, batch or continuous, central plant or in-place soil stabilization...|$|R
