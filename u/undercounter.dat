Today, the U-Line Corporation manufactures several <b>undercounter</b> combinations of ice makers, refrigerators, freezers, and wine storage systems. Many of these include advanced features, such as dual-zone temperature control {{in the case of}} wine storage systems. The company has also introduced a line of refrigerated drawers.
