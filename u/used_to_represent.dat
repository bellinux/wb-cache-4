5|$|Roman Catholic {{and more}} {{traditional}} Protestant clergy wear green vestments at liturgical celebrations during Ordinary Time. In the Eastern Catholic Church, green {{is the color}} of Pentecost. Green is one of the Christmas colors as well, possibly dating back to pre-Christian times, when evergreens were worshiped for their ability to maintain their color through the winter season. Romans used green holly and evergreen as decorations for their winter solstice celebration called Saturnalia, which eventually evolved into a Christmas celebration. In Ireland and Scotland especially, green is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>represent</b> Catholics, while orange is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>represent</b> Protestantism.

Symbolic linguistic representations are different from non-symbolic representations, such as recordings, because they <b>use</b> symbols <b>to</b> <b>represent</b> linguistic information rather than measurements.|$|R

Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the value is considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E

There were, however, several establishing shots that were CG composite images; that is, an image composed of multiple images. Examples include Gotham's skyline, exterior shots of Wayne Tower, {{and some of}} the exterior monorail shots. The climactic monorail sequence mixed live action footage, model work, and CGI.|$|E

The revised 1957 and 1994 Arms of Canada are both protected official government symbols <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>represent</b> the state under the Federal Identity Program. Permanent resident cards issued from 2015 feature a holographic representation of the 1957 version of the coat of arms.|$|E

The ecological landscape of Haiti is <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>represent</b> the wreckage of the Revolution, being initially described as fertile and bountiful with the plantations, but later as worn down and bare. The powerful climate of the Caribbean is more similar to Africa than Europe, making nature an ally of the slaves. Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E

5|$|The {{birth of}} the yellow, green, and red tricolor {{occurred}} during a drive by other European republics to change their flags.

For this purpose a writing system is [...] "alphabetic" [...] if it <b>uses</b> symbols <b>to</b> <b>represent</b> individual language sounds, though the degree of correspondence between letters and sounds varies between alphabetic languages. Syllabic writing systems (such as Japanese kana) <b>use</b> a symbol <b>to</b> <b>represent</b> a single syllable, and logographic writing systems (such as Chinese) <b>use</b> a symbol <b>to</b> <b>represent</b> a morpheme.|$|R
