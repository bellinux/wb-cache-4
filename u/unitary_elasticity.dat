At one point on the demand curve PED is unitary elastic: PED equals one.

The simulation, which is parameterized by the US economy in 1990, involves a balanced trade expansion which displaces almost half of US manufacturing workers who are reemployed in the remaining manufacturing and non-trade sectors. The results show that relative wages of workers with a high school education or less would be depressed, while those with some college education would rise. However, despite the magnitude of the shock, the effects are surprisingly small. Once account is taken of productivity increases, labor force growth and export sector wage premiums, given <b>unitary</b> <b>elasticities</b> of demand and of substitution between workers with different levels of education, relative wages of workers with some college education rise by 3. 5 percent, while the real wages of workers with a high school education or less decline by 1. 3 percent.

We also examine whether forecasts respond to error correction terms. Tests are applied to both final and preliminary versions of the data. We find that the Treasury bill rate, housing starts, industrial production, inflation and their forecasts are trend stationary.

With <b>unitary</b> <b>elasticity</b> of substitution in preferences between home and foreign goods, output rises instantaneously but gradually returns to its initial value in the long run. Trade remains balanced at all times. With an elasticity of substitution above unity, there is a trade surplus in the short run and a deficit in the long run, as permanently higher net foreign assets are accumulated. Convergence to the steady state is faster, and thus output persistence is smaller. With <b>unitary</b> <b>elasticity</b> the dynamics are the same as in an equivalent closed economy, so, to the extent that an elasticity greater than one is plausible for an open economy, we conclude that openness reduces output persistence...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{deficiency in}} Harberger's (1962) model of corporate income taxation is {{its inability to}} consider both corporate and noncorporate production of the same good. This precludes analysis of within-industry substitution of noncorporate for corporate production {{in response to the}} tax. Such within-industry substitution has potentially major implications for both the excess burden and incidence of the corporate tax. In Gravelle and Kotlikoff (1988) we present a new model of the corporation income tax. The model has two key characteristics. First, corporate and noncorporate firms produce (with identical production functions) each of the model's goods both before and after corporate taxation is imposed, and second, the decision of entrepreneurs to establish unincorporated business is endogenous. Compared with the Harberger model, the new model predicts a very much larger excess burden from corporate income taxation. The incidence of the corporate tax can also differ dramatically in the two models. Several commentators on our approach suggested that while corporate and noncorporate fins produce goods that are close substitutes, they are not necessarily identical goods. Others questioned the extent to which our results hinged on the endogeneity of entrepreneurship. This paper is a response to those comments. It presents a Harberger-type model (with no entrepreneurs), but one in which each industry/sector contains corporate and noncorporate fins (with identical production functions) which produce goods that are close substitutes in demand. As in our earlier model, the scope for considerable within-industry substitution of noncorporate for corporate capital leads to a very much larger excess burden than that in the Harberger model. For example, using Harberger's original 195 ? data and assuming <b>unitary</b> substitution <b>elasticities</b> in production and in inter-sector demand, but substitution elasticities of 30 in intra-sector demand, the excess burden of the corporate income tax in the current model is 107 percent of tax revenue. This figure is quite close to the 123 percent figure reported in Cravelle and Kotlikoff (1988) for the case of <b>unitary</b> substitution <b>elasticities</b> in production and inter-industry demand. Both numbers are considerably larger than the 8 percent excess burden figure that arises in the traditional Harberger model with <b>unitary</b> substitution <b>elasticities.</b> ...|$|R

The paper adopted a case study approach, and collected primary data through questionnaires administered on twenty manufacturing companies based on multistage sampling techniques. The 110 -item questionnaire elicits secondary data on components of outbound logistics for the period of 2002 - 2006. The data were analysed using a software application that was packaged and designed for the study and incorporated Generalised Translog cost function that places no priori restriction on the elasticities of substitution between the various restrictions such as homoscedasticity, homogeneity and <b>unitary</b> <b>elasticities</b> of substitutions, as well as its flexibility for allowing testing for specific characteristics of technology, input demand elasticities, economies of scale and output cost elasticities. The findings revealed economies of scale and scope among input of outbound logistics resources indicating that logistics costs are characterized by joint distribution process, consequently concluded that resources management should be based on multiproduct distribution theory, and that explicit recognition of the economic interactions among resources should be incorporated in any regulatory process, through various categories of logistics service providers that must be encouraged in the country. The paper then recommended that group distribution by logistics service providers, as well as outsourcing be encouraged.

40|$|Exchange rate {{forecasts}} {{are generated}} using some popular monetary models of exchange rates {{in conjunction with}} several estimation techniques. We propose an alternative set of criteria for evaluating forecast rationality which entails the following requirements: the forecast and the actual series i) have the same order of integration, ii) are cointegrated, and iii) have a cointegrating vector consistent with long run <b>unitary</b> <b>elasticity</b> of expectations. When these conditions hold, we consider the forecasts to be consistent. ' We find that it is fairly easy for the generated forecasts to pass the first requirement.

At the one year ahead horizon, most series and their respective forecasts do not appear cointegrated.

Whilst maintaining the assumption of a <b>unitary</b> long-run <b>elasticity</b> of wages with respect to productivity, we demonstrate that productivity growth affects the labour share in the long run due to frictional growth (that is, the interplay of wage dynamics and productivity growth). In the light of this result, we consider a stylised labour demand equation and show that the labour share is a driving force of employment. We substantiate our analytical exposition by providing empirical models of wage setting and employment equations for France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the UK, and the US over the 1960 - 2008 period. Our findings show that the timevarying labour share of these countries has significantly influenced their employment trajectories across decades. This indicates that the evolution of the labour income share (or, equivalently, the wage-productivity gap) deserves the attention of policy makers.

A key assumption is a less than <b>unitary</b> price <b>elasticity</b> of demand for food. Our results could form a crucial link in capturing the story of labor-abundant economies which experienced structural transformation and growth through labor-intensive manufactured exports, without prior technology breakthroughs in industry.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} and estimate long-run relationships among M 1, prices, output and interest rates, with a view to determining if there is a stable relationship that can be interpreted as long-run money demand. The paper uses a maximum-likelihood multiple- equation cointegration technique, developed by Johansen, to fit a system of equations to the data. One finding is that long-run, but not short-run, <b>unitary</b> price <b>elasticity</b> is easily accepted, while the income elasticity is close to one-half. The coefficients on the deviation of money from its long-run equilibrium in the vector error-correction model imply that when M 1 is above its long-run demand, money will decrease and prices increase to restore long-run equilibrium. The effects of the deviation on output and interest rates are insignificant, pointing to the weak exogeneity of these variables. The implication of the results is that all the adjustment to return the economy to monetary equilibrium comes from fluctuations in money and prices. However, this does not preclude the possibility that changes in the stock of money may have short-run real effects. Indeed, the results suggest that changes in M 1 lead short-term changes in output. ...|$|R
