5|$|Orwell wrote six novels: Burmese Days, A Clergyman's Daughter, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, Coming <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>Air,</b> Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. Most {{of these}} were semi-autobiographical. Burmese Days was {{inspired}} by his period working as an imperial policeman and is fictionalized; A Clergyman's Daughter follows {{a young woman who}} passes out from overwork and wakes up an amnesiac, forced to wander the countryside as she finds herself, eventually losing her belief in God, despite being the daughter of a clergyman. Keep the Aspidistra Flying and Coming <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>Air</b> are examinations of the British class system. Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are his most famous novels: both are anti-totalitarian books which criticize the Soviet Union in particular.|$|E

The Orwells set out in September 1938 via Gibraltar and Tangier to avoid Spanish Morocco and arrived at Marrakech. They rented a villa {{on the road to}} Casablanca and during that time Orwell wrote Coming <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>Air.</b> They arrived back in England on 30 March 1939 and Coming <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>Air</b> was published in June. Orwell spent time in Wallington and Southwold working on a Dickens essay and it was in July 1939 that Orwell's father, Richard Blair, died.|$|E

[...] Jenee Osterheldt from The Kansas City Star said that [...] "if there’s one thing that sticks out about her character, it’s that husky and seductive voice that steals every conversation. You want to hear her speak, to cling to her words and let her paint the picture." [...] Anita Li writing for Mashable praised the character's friendship with Yusef stating [...] "despite the depressing circumstances of their meeting, the pair's chemistry is entertaining for viewers to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|The series had {{originated}} from a production deal between Syfy and CBS Paramount Network Television. Thomas Vitale, the {{senior vice president}} of programming and original movies for Syfy, described the partnership as a way to add more [...] "genre programming to our schedule". It was one of three series UPN ordered as mid-season replacements during the 2000-2001 television season; the others were Chains of Love and Special Unit 2. The network had requested six episodes of All Souls when picking it <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>air,</b> and all of them had been shot before its cancellation.

2500|$|Tom Shippey in {{his essay}} does not dispute this answer but {{identifies}} and discusses the essential differences that exists between a science fiction novel and one written outside the field. To this end, he compares George Orwell's Coming <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>Air</b> with Frederik Pohl and C.M.Kornbluth's The Space Merchants and concludes that the basic building block and distinguishing feature of a science fiction novel {{is the presence of}} the novum, a term Darko Suvin adapts from Ernst Bloch and defines as [...] "a discrete piece of information recognizable as not-true, but also as not-unlike-true, not-flatly- (and in the current state of knowledge) impossible." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coming <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>Air,</b> {{his last}} novel before World War II {{is the most}} [...] "English" [...] of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic Thames-side Edwardian {{childhood}} of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Borkenau, Orwell, Silone and Koestler: [...] "Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps {{in the old days}} who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for the fun of it... They're something quite new – something that's never been heard of before".|$|E
2500|$|In his 1946 essay [...] "Why I Write", Orwell {{explains}} that the serious works he wrote since the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) were [...] "written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism". Nineteen Eighty-Four is a cautionary tale about revolution betrayed by totalitarian defenders previously proposed in Homage to Catalonia (1938) and Animal Farm (1945), while Coming <b>Up</b> <b>for</b> <b>Air</b> (1939) celebrates the personal and political freedoms lost in Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). Biographer Michael Shelden notes Orwell's Edwardian childhood at Henley-on-Thames as the golden country; being bullied at St Cyprian's School as his empathy with victims; {{his life in the}} Indian Imperial Police in Burma and the techniques of violence and censorship in the BBC as capricious authority.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an article}} in AAAS & Science, over 8 million sea turtles have died {{over the past twenty}} years due to {{injuries}} caused by being accidentally caught by fishing boats. Fisheries often use large-scale nets and hook systems that are indiscriminate and catch whatever comes along, be it sea turtle, dolphin, or even shark. [...] What is known as “bycatch” is a large contributor to sea turtle deaths, as seen in Baja California. Longline, trawl, and gillnet fishing are three types of fishing with the most sea turtle accidents. [...] Deaths occur often because of drowning, where the sea turtle was ensnared and could not come <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> Another dangerous aspect of fishing that is common is when sea turtles inadvertently swallow sharp hooks, which can get stuck within the soft tissue of the throat and stomach, or damage vital organs and intestines.|$|E

In the back were the two girls with Dave and Roger. All were well bundled <b>up,</b> <b>for</b> the <b>air,</b> though clear, was still cold.|$|R
2500|$|Another form of {{coercion}} is male mate guarding, {{used to keep}} females from mating with other males, and often involves aggression. Guarding allows the males to assure their paternity. A classic example occurs in diving beetles, family Dytiscidae. After copulation, males continue to guard females {{for up to six}} hours. They hold them underwater, occasionally tilting them <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> [...] Guarding also occurs in water striders where, once males complete their sperm transfer, they often remain on top of the females. This guarding duration varies, lasting from several minutes to several weeks. The purpose of such long guarding periods is for the males to see the females lay their eggs and be assured that the offspring are theirs. [...] This behavior also occurs in hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas), where the leader males practice intensive mate guarding. [...] In Drosophila Montana, studies have shown that following mate guarding, the chances of a female mating with or being inseminated by another male were greatly diminished. This shows that the mate guarding tactic can be very effective.|$|E
2500|$|At 8:05pm EDT, {{the letter}} drafted {{earlier in the}} day was delivered. The message read, [...] "As I read your letter, the key {{elements}} of your proposals—which seem generally acceptable as I understand them—are as follows: 1) You would agree to remove these weapons systems from Cuba under appropriate United Nations observation and supervision; and undertake, with suitable safe-guards, to halt the further introduction of such weapon systems into Cuba. 2) We, on our part, would agree—upon the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations, to ensure the carrying out and continuation of these commitments (a) to remove promptly the quarantine measures now in effect and (b) to give assurances against the invasion of Cuba." [...] The letter was also released directly to the press to ensure it could not be [...] "delayed." [...] With the letter delivered, a deal was on the table. However, as Robert Kennedy noted, there was little expectation it would be accepted. At 9:00pm EDT, the EXCOMM met again to review the actions for the following day. Plans were drawn <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> strikes on the missile sites as well as other economic targets, notably petroleum storage. McNamara stated that they had to [...] "have two things ready: a government for Cuba, because we're going to need one; and secondly, plans for how to respond to the Soviet Union in Europe, because sure as hell they're going to do something there." ...|$|E
60|$|Jerry and Peter {{sat in the}} {{moonlight}} talking it over. Paddy had stopped bringing sticks for his wall. He had dived down out of sight, {{and he was gone}} a long time. Suddenly Jerry noticed that the water had grown very, very muddy all around Paddy's new house. He wrinkled his brows trying to think what Paddy could be doing. Presently Paddy came <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>air.</b> Then he went down again, and the water grew muddier than ever. This went on for a long time. Every little while Paddy would come <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> and a few minutes of rest. Then down he would go, and the water would grow muddier and muddier.|$|E

60|$|The {{earth was}} hard with frost when I paid {{my visit to}} the camp, and the general {{appearance}} of things around my friend's quarters was on that account cheerful enough. It was the mud which made things sad and wretched. When the frost came {{it seemed as though}} the army had overcome one of its worst enemies. Unfortunately cold weather did not last long. I have been told in Washington that they rarely have had so open a season. Soon after my departure that terrible enemy the mud came back upon them; but during my stay the ground was hard and the weather very sharp. I slept in a tent, and managed to keep my body warm by an enormous overstructure of blankets and coats; but I could not keep my head warm. Throughout the night I had to go down like a fish beneath the water for protection, and come <b>up</b> <b>for</b> <b>air</b> at intervals, half smothered. I had a stove in my tent; but the heat of that, when lighted, was more terrible than the severity of the frost.|$|E

The villains {{were only a few}} yards away, and I could hear every word they said. I heard the boat come ashore, and although I could have done no good by rushing out, I think I should have done so if I had had any weapon about me, and have tried to kill one or two of them before I went down. As it was, I waited until morning. Then I heard the rumble of the guns and the wagons, and knew that they were off. I waited for another hour to make sure, and then stepped ashore. I went to the boat lying by the bank. When I saw that Isobel and the other two ladies were not there, I knew that they must have been carried off into Cawnpore. I waited there until night, and then made my way to a peasant's house a mile out of the town. I had operated upon him for elephantiasis two years ago, and the man had shown himself grateful, and had occasionally sent me in little presents of fowls and so on. He received me well, gave me food, which I wanted horribly, stained my skin, and rigged me out in this disguise. The next morning I went into the town, and for {{the last four or five}} days have wandered about there. There was nothing I could do, and yet I felt that I could not go away, but must stay within sight of the prison where you were all confined till our column arrived. But this morning I determined to come down to join our people who are fighting their way up, little thinking that I should light upon you by the way." ...|$|E
