25|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode’s β-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review {{found that the}} efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200mg) be administered three times daily {{at the same time}} as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued <b>until</b> <b>hemoglobin</b> values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.|$|E

Surprisingly, we found transcripts of the whole gnathostome globin superfamily in RBCs. The mRNA expression levels varied among species, with Hb being by far the dominant globin. Only in stickleback, a globin previously thought to be neuron-specific, neuroglobin, had higher mRNA expression. We furthermore show that in birds transcripts of globin E, which was earlier reported to be transcribed only in the eye, are also present in RBCs. Even in anucleated RBCs of mammals, we found transcripts of myo-globin, neuroglobin, and cytoglobin. Our findings add new aspects to the cur-rent knowledge on the expression of globins in vertebrate tissues.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Iron {{deficiency}} is {{the most}} common disorder in the world, affecting approximately 25 % of the world`s population and {{the most common cause of}} anemia. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous iron sucrose (IS) in the treatment of adults with iron deficiency anemia METHODS: Eighty-six adult patients with iron deficiency anemia, who had intolerance or showed no effect with oral iron therapy, received a weekly dose of 200 mg of intravenous iron sucrose <b>until</b> the <b>hemoglobin</b> level was corrected or until receiving the total dose of intravenous iron calculated for each patient RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin and serum ferritin levels were 8. 54 g/dL and 7. 63 ng/mL (pre-treatment) and 12. 1 g/dL and 99. 0 ng/mL (post-treatment) (p-value < 0. 0001), respectively. The average increases in hemoglobin levels were 3. 29 g/dL for women and 4. 58 g/dL for men; 94 % of male and 84 % of female patients responded (hemoglobin increased by at least 2 g/dL) to intravenous iron therapy. Correction of anemia was obtained in 47 of 69 (68. 1 %) female patients and in 12 of 17 male (70. 6 %) patients. A total of 515 intravenous infusions of iron sucrose were administered and iron sucrose was generally well tolerated with no moderate or serious adverse drug reactions recorded by the investigators. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that the use of intravenous iron sucrose is a safe and effective option in the treatment of adult patients with iron deficiency anemia who lack satisfactory response to oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron sucrose is well tolerated and with a clinically manageable safety profile when using appropriate dosing and monitoring. The availability of intravenous iron sucrose would potentially improve compliance and thereby reduce morbidities from iron deficiency...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Allogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) is associated with prolonged anemia caused by defective erythropoietin (Epo) production. We enrolled 34 recipients of an allogeneic HSCT in three consecutive trials to determine the optimal utilization of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) therapy in this setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first trial (n = 7), rhEpo 1400 U/kg/week was given from day 1 <b>until</b> a <b>hemoglobin</b> (Hb) level of 10 g/dL was achieved, for a maximum of 60 days. In the second trial, rhEpo 500 U/kg/week was given to achieve Hb levels of 13 to 14 g/dL in 13 anemic patients with fatigue 56 to 1440 days after transplant. In the third trial, rhEpo was scheduled to start on day 35 in 14 patients at a dose of 500 U/kg/week {{with the aim of}} achieving Hb levels of 13 to 14 g/dL. RESULTS: In trial 1, erythroid recovery to 1 % reticulocytes and red blood cell transfusion independence were faster, but the number of transfusions was not reduced compared to 10 controls. Responses were brisk in trial 2, with transfusion independence achieved after a median of 1 week in 12 of 13 patients, and 2 -g Hb increments or Hb values of 11, 12, and 13 g/dL after 6, 7, 10, and 10 weeks, respectively. Transfusions were significantly reduced in the first month of rhEpo therapy. In trial 3, transfusion independence was obtained after a median of 1 week in 13 of 14 patients, and 2 -g Hb increments or Hb values of 11, 12, and 13 g/dL after 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, respectively. Transfusions rates were considerably reduced compared to the previous month in the same patients or compared to controls undergoing peripheral blood or marrow transplant without rhEpo. CONCLUSIONS: Anemia after allogeneic HSCT is exquisitely sensitive to rhEpo. The benefit is minimal when it is given early post-transplant, as used in all trials to date. However, the rate of major response is greater than 90 % when rhEpo is started after day 35. These data provide the basis on which to conduct a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of rhEpo therapy after allogeneic HSCT. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{pathologic}} {{increase in}} the amount of por-phyrin excreted in the urine by patients with lead poisoning was first reported by Garrod (1) in 1892. Since then it has been generally assumed that this porphyrinuria is related in some way to the destruction of <b>hemoglobin.</b> <b>Until</b> recently there has been no means of testing the validity of this belief. Lately, however, the advance in knowledge concerning the chemistry of the por-phyrins, and the development of methods for dis-tinguishing one type from another, have provided a new approach towards an understanding of the underlying metabolic disorder responsible for the porphyrinuria of plumbism. The isomeric identity of the Type III copro-porphyrin found in the urine in lead poisoning with the Type III protoporphyrin of hemoglobin has been demonstrated by Grotepass (2) and by Watson (3). The porphyrin in the urine in lead poisoning thus fundamentally differs from the Type I isomer which is the predominant type ex-creted in several other conditions associated with porphyrinuria. These facts justify the assump-tion that the porphyrinuria in lead poisoning is a consequence of some alteration in the metabolism of hemoglobin itself. In theory, it might originate from an altered synthesis of hemoglobin just as probably as from hemoglobin destruction; but owing to the traditional belief that the anemia in lead poisoning is hemolytic in nature, only the latter possibility has received any general attention until recently. The hypothesis that the copro-porphyrin excreted in lead poisoning is a product of hemoglobin destruction requires, however, an additional corollary.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Linus Pauling {{incorporated}} hemoglobin and {{a disease}} of the blood, sickle cell anemia, into many of his researches between the mid- 1930 s and mid- 1970 s. In the early 1930 s Pauling became interested in organic chemistry and named hemoglobin {{as one of the}} first biochemical substances that he planned to analyze. In 1935 he published his first paper on hemoglobin, which determined the structure of the four hemes in hemoglobin. Pauling continued to study the structure of <b>hemoglobin</b> <b>until</b> the early 1950 s when he proposed that it was an alpha-helix. In 1945 Pauling learned about sickle cell anemia and published an important paper in 1949 with Harvey A. Itano, S. J. Singer, and Ibert C. Wells titled "Sickle Cell Anemia, a Molecular Disease. " Pauling investigated hemoglobin into the mid- 1970 s when he tried to find an orthomolecular therapy for sickle cell anemia. From the mid- 1950 s to early 1970 s, Pauling also used sickle cell anemia to promote negative eugenics, point out the possible mutagenic effects caused by nuclear weapons testing, and propose an evolutionary theory. Additionally, in the final year of his life, Pauling wrote two forewords for books on sickle cell anemia, which were published in 1994, the year he died. Hemoglobin and sickle cell anemia can be considered a theme within Pauling's work. He often returned to normal and abnormal hemoglobin as his primary substance for examination, and his familiarity with hemoglobin and sickle cell anemia inspired new research...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Hypothermic {{circulatory arrest}} {{is widely used}} for adults with aortic arch disease {{as well as for}} {{children}} with congenital heart disease. At present, no method exists for monitoring safe duration of circulatory arrest. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a new technique for noninvasive monitoring of cerebral oxygenation and energy state. In the current study, the relationship between near-infrared spectroscopy data and neurologic outcome was evaluated in a survival piglet model with hypothermic circulatory arrest. Methods: Thirty-six piglets (9. 36 ± 0. 16 kg) underwent circulatory arrest under varying conditions with continuous monitoring by near-infrared spectroscopy (temperature 15 °C or 25 °C, hematocrit value 20 % or 30 %, circulatory arrest time 60, 80, or 100 minutes). Each setting included 3 animals. Neurologic recovery was evaluated daily by neurologic deficit score and overall performance category. Brain was fixed in situ on postoperative day 4 and examined by histologic score. Results: Oxygenated hemoglobin signal declined to a plateau (nadir) during circulatory arrest. Time to nadir was significantly shorter with lower hematocrit value (P <. 001) and higher temperature (P <. 01). Duration from reaching nadir <b>until</b> reperfusion (“oxygenated <b>hemoglobin</b> signal nadir time”) was significantly related to histologic score (rs = 0. 826), neurologic deficit score (rs = 0. 717 on postoperative day 1; 0. 716 on postoperative day 4), and overall performance category (rs = 0. 642 on postoperative day 1; 0. 702 on postoperative day 4) (P <. 001). All animals in which oxygenated hemoglobin signal nadir time was less than 25 minutes were free of behavioral or histologic evidence of brain injury. Conclusion: Oxygenated hemoglobin signal nadir time determined by near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring is a useful predictor of safe duration of circulatory arrest. Safe duration of hypothermic circulatory arrest is strongly influenced by perfusate hematocrit value and temperature during circulatory arrest. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2001; 122 : 339 - 5...|$|R

MÉTODOS: No período {{de janeiro}} de 2003 a janeiro de 2004, estudamos 25 pacientes com anemia ferropriva que apresentaram intolerância e/ou resposta inadequada ao tratamento com ferro por via oral e/ou valor de hemoglobina OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} intravenous iron III-hydroxide saccharate for treating adult patients with iron deficiency anemia lacking satisfactory response to oral iron therapy. METHODS: Between January 2003 and January 2004, 25 patients with iron deficiency anemia who presented intolerance or inadequate response to iron oral therapy, or hemoglobin level < 7 g/dl were studied. The main laboratory tests performed were: complete blood cell count, reticulocyte count, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, serum ferritin. Patients received a weekly dose of 200 mg of iron diluted in 250 mL of 0. 9 % sodium chloride solution administered intravenously for 30 minutes. Treatment continued <b>until</b> a <b>hemoglobin</b> level = 12 g/dL for women and = 13 g/dL for men were obtained or until full administration of the total dose of parenteral iron recommended for each patient. RESULTS: Edian age of the patients studied was 45 years (ages ranging from 31 to 70). Nineteen out of 25 patients (76 %) were women. The {{most common cause of}} iron deficiency anemia was abnormal uterine bleeding observed in 68 % of the female patients (13 out of 19) and partial gastrectomy observed in 67 % of the male patients (4 out of 6). Seventeen (68 %) patients were included in this study because they did not respond to oral iron therapy, 24 % (6 out of 25) showed intolerance to oral iron and 8 % (2 out of 25) presented hemoglobin level < 7 g/dl. Correction of anemia was obtained in 12 out of 19 female patients (63 %) and in 5 out of 6 male patients (83 %). The mean hemoglobin and ferritin values were 8. 09 g/dl and 4. 20 ng/ml (pre-treatment) and 12. 42 g/dl and 87. 78 ng/ml (post-treatment) (p< 0. 001), respectively. The average increase of hemoglobin was 3. 74 g/dl, ranging from 1. 30 to 7. 60 g/dl. None of the patients received blood transfusion during or after the intravenous iron treatment. CONCLUSION: The use of intravenous iron III-hydroxide saccharate is an efficacious and safe option in the treatment of adult patients with iron deficiency anemia lacking satisfactory response to oral iron therapy. This option of treatment should be considered mainly for patients with severe anemia in order to obtain rapid increase of the hemoglobin level and avoid blood transfusion...|$|R
40|$|Blood volume tests made by {{the vital}} red method (Keith, Rowntree, and Geraghty) on {{patients}} after hemorrhage showed a marked reduction in the total blood bulk. Not uncommonly the blood volume was less than 60 per cent of the normal. The reduction after a certain point had been reached seemed to parallel the decrease in blood pressure. This relation of diminished blood volume to low pressure suggested a rough method of estimating blood volume from the change in blood pressure. By means of the blood volume and the hemoglobin per cent the actual amount of blood loss was determined. Cases of severe anemia showed a loss {{of as much as}} five-sixths of their total hemoglobin. Progressive changes in blood volume following hemorrhage were estimated in three ways: (1) repeated vital red tests; (2) calculation from changes in hemoglobin per cent produced by the injection of gum acacia; (3) calculation from changes in hemoglobin per cent following the dilution of the blood by the patient's own body fluids. The effects of the different methods of transfusion and of injection of gum acacia on blood volume were observed. No differences were apparent. It was found that transfusion and gum injections only partially restored the blood volume. Forced fluids by mouth were found to bring about its complete restoration in a comparatively short time. It was observed that the organism did not restore its blood volume beyond a certain point when a further increase in it would, by dilution, have brought the hemoglobin per cent to a very low figure. In such cases a further increase of the blood volume occurred only when the hemoglobin rose. In cases with a low hemoglobin per cent {{as the result of a}} restoration of the blood bulk an abnormally high blood pressure appeared, which continued <b>until</b> the <b>hemoglobin</b> per cent again increased. Accompanying the low blood pressure seen shortly after hemorrhage was a well marked difference in hemoglobin per cent between capillary and venous blood, with a relative concentration on the capillary side. As compensation occurred and blood pressure rose this difference lessened until the two readings were identical, indicating an even redistribution of the red blood cells. Reticulated red cell counts made in these cases showed that a marked bone marrow stimulation occurs after hemorrhage. However, except in the very anemic cases the degree of increased blood production seemed to depend largely on the restoration of the blood volume. The patients who were put on forced fluids, with consequent rapid restoration of blood volume, showed a much higher per cent of reticulated cells than those in whom no attempt was made to increase the amount of fluid in circulation...|$|R
