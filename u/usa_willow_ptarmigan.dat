40|$|The recent range contractions and {{population}} declines of many grouse species worldwide {{have been attributed}} to loss and fragmentation of their habitats, although the empirical evidence for the actual drivers is often weak. In case of the <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> Lagopus lagopus in Fennoscandia, ungulate overbrowsing of willows has been hypothesized to exert such negative habitat-related impacts. Moreover, a steep population decline of <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> in southern Fennoscandia has recently been attributed to community interactions linking the fate of the <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> to a change in keystone tundra rodent populations. Community and habitat factors may also interact in their impact on <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> abundance. Here we assess whether willow thicket structural characteristics sensitive to ungulate browsing impacted <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> habitat occupancy and whether such impacts depended on small rodent population dynamics. We employed an extensive survey approach spatially encompassing three riparian tundra regions and covering the phases of increase, peak and crash of the small rodent cycle. <b>Willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> habitat occupancy increased with the areal extent of willow thickets, whereas it decreased with increasing degree of thicket fragmentation (i. e. habitat shredding). Both of these effects were consistent with ungulate over-browsing impacting <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> abundance negatively. Over the 4 -year study period, <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> habitat occupancy declined steeply independently of spatial variation in willow thicket areal extent and fragmentation. Moreover, the expected increase in ptarmigan populations during the increase/peak phase of the rodent cycle was not observed. Thus although our study provides support for the hypothesis that intense ungulate browsing negatively impacts <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan,</b> our study also suggests that causes of the current steep decline of ptarmigan populations in northern Fennoscandia should be sought in factors other than habitat fragmentation and changed rodent population dynamic...|$|R

40|$|The <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus) is an {{economically}} important and desired game species in Scandinavia. Its abundance varies considerably {{in time and}} space, {{but there has been}} a long-term population decline over recent decades. Earlier studies demonstrated <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> select certain habitat features. We investigated the relationship between area-specific conditions (habitat and ownership status) and 2 variables describing <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> demography (adult density and reproductive success). We found no connection between adult density and cover of 6 vegetation types. However, <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> had lower reproductive success in survey areas dominated by mountain birch (Betula pubescens czerepanovii) forest. The lack of any clear association between <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> density and vegetation types could be explained by relatively low population densities in our study areas. Thus, relative to years with higher population levels, resources (e. g., food and shelter) were plentiful and competition was low. We found strong indications in areas of similar vegetation composition that adult density was higher in areas managed by private landowners than on state-owned land. The difference in density was 2. 56 birds/km 2, equivalent to a 46 % increase compared to adult density on state-owned land. This difference in density may be due to a difference in hunting pressure. We conclude that management actions to improve habitat will have little effect on <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> populations during periods of relatively low densities...|$|R

50|$|A small {{minority}} of male <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> are polygynous but most are monogamous. They are assiduous at guarding both nest and mate, particularly early in the incubation period and when the eggs are nearly ready to hatch. During this time, the greatest danger may be from conspecifics. Although adult <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigans</b> are herbivores, the newly hatched young also feed on insects. In most other species of grouse, only the female {{takes care of the}} young, but the male <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> also helps with feeding the brood and protecting them. He may take over completely if the female dies. In particular, the male defends the young from predators and both he and his mate can dive-bomb intruders or lure attackers away by pretending to have a broken wing. Nevertheless, the chicks face many dangers which range from attacks by foxes or birds of prey, getting separated {{from the rest of the}} brood, bad weather and coccidiosis. Fewer than 35% of chicks survive to eleven months and only a minority of these reach maturity. Despite this, in favourable seasons, many juveniles may survive and the population of <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> is prone to wide fluctuations in size. By September, families begin to form flocks. The females and young migrate to lower altitudes and may overwinter 100 mi from their breeding grounds in wooded valleys and hilly country. The males also congregate in small groups but do not usually travel as far as the females.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Sustainable {{harvesting}} requires reliable quantitative {{estimates of}} pre-harvesting population size, however, within low management budgets, good quality predictions are {{often difficult to}} obtain. For the popular game species <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> (Lagopus lagopus) estimates of population density or relative indices are often obtained from line transect surveys, however, the quality of estimates could be sensitive to low sampling effort. Additional ptarmigan population data is hunting statistics, but the potential lack of convergence between population density and hunting bag remains a concern. The sympatric rock ptarmigan (Lagopus muta) is commonly given much less management attention, and the species is often arbitrarily expected to show synchronised dynamics with <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan.</b> In this paper we evaluate different population indices obtained from <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> line transects surveys in late summer, and catch reports of subsistence snare trapping in late winter, and specifically assess these indicesâ€™ ability to predict subsequent ptarmigan hunting bags in eight municipalities in northernmost Norway. We use line transect data from 6 â€“ 7 years of varying monitoring effort, snare trapping data from between 6 and 12 years in different municipalities, and hunting statistics from 7 â€“ 8 years in all municipalities. Generalised linear mixed-effect models indicated that only crude predictions of the subsequent <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> hunting bags could be made from the line transect estimates under the current management regime. The snare trapping index made only a minor improvement of the prediction, and although the potential effects varied between municipalities, its inclusion as a predictor is not generally recommended in future ptarmigan management. The rock ptarmigan hunting bags could not be predicted {{by any of the}} available pre-harvesting indices. Variance component analyses revealed pronounced lack of systematic variation in all indices for both ptarmigan species, consequently any prediction of subsequent hunting bag outcome, should be highly conservative. Although we did not find clear tendencies of better predictions in municipalities with higher line transect effort, we suspect that the monitoring effort needed to provide useful pre-harvest indices is highly underestimated in the current management regime. Potentially unknown ptarmigan population processes and an elevated hunting pressure, should encourage management to increase, knowledge-based ptarmigan monitoring in the future.

40|$|Context. Nest {{predation}} is a {{major factor}} influencing life history and population dynamics of ground-nesting birds. The transitions between the northern boreal mountain birch forests and the low-alpine tundra are important habitats for the <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan,</b> Lagopus lagopus (Linnaeus, 1758). During the past decades, these landscapes have been extensively developed with cabin resorts in southern Norway, which has led to an increased number of roads and foot paths in relatively undisturbed habitats. Aims. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate relative nest-predation rates in elevation gradients (ecotones) spanning from northern boreal mountain birch forests to low-alpine tundra in three locations with contrasting <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> densities. Methods. We conducted an artificial nest study by using baited track boards (n = 108). Track boards were placed along transects (200 m) in the following three habitat types: birch forest, edge habitat and low-alpine tundra. Predator prevalence was analysed in relation to study-design variables (location, habitat, study period) and the load of human infrastructure (i. e. distance to foot paths and roads), using generalised linear mixed-effect models assuming binomial distribution for the response variable. Key results. Prevalence of avian predators was consistently high (range 38. 2 â€“ 85. 3 %), in contrast to much lower prevalence of mammalian predators (range 2. 8 â€“ 22. 9 %). Raven (Corvus corax) was the dominant nest predator, followed by hooded crow (C. cornix) and pine marten (Martes martes). Location, as contrasted by differences in <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> density, was not significantly related to total relative predation rates. Species-specific predator prevalence was habitat specific and related to human infrastructure, but with opposite relative predation patterns between pine marten and raven. Hooded crow predation was similar across the ecotone and not related to human infrastructure. Conclusions. Predator prevalence was habitat specific and affected by human infrastructure (distance to human foot paths). Our study confirmed that human activity might alter the predation rates by generalist species in these low-alpine environments. Implications. We recommend that attractive <b>willow</b> <b>ptarmigan</b> habitat should be avoided when planning human infrastructure in alpine ecosystems. To reduce predation pressure in this ecosystem, it appears that generalist predators should be considered for management actions. Further research is needed to explain the underlying mechanism driving expansion of generalist species into alpine habitats. Such knowledge is also important in developing alternative management actions with focus other than predator control...|$|R
