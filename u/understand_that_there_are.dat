5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
25|$|The team {{wanted to}} capture the aspect of BioShock where not every non-player {{character}} would immediately be aggressive towards you; Levine discusses a situation in Infinite where the player character walks into a crowded bar and cannot immediately tell the disposition of the non-player characters towards the player. Levine compared this {{to the introduction of}} the Big Daddy in BioShock, giving the player several opportunities to view but not engage the characters so they would <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several possible outcomes depending on what approach they used when they did have the ability to engage one. As Infinite contains numerous groups in internal conflict with each other, the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} learn how to utilize different non-player character agents to progress in the game. Irrational wanted to make sure consequences of the player's actions were reflected in the game; part of this is through the strain on Elizabeth when using her powers, but through altering the suspended city, they are able to change the environment in response to the player's choice and force the player to consider different tactics.|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Sel√§nne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and I apologize for that. That's a thing that you won't hear from me again. I hope I didn't offend anybody outside the circle that we trust." ...|$|E
60|$|Jim {{looked at}} me in pity, and I {{afterward}} <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> good reason for his so doing.|$|R
6000|$|... "To the point, my friend. I <b>was</b> {{given to}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a certain {{document}} in existence which assured success." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No indeed, Tom. Three or {{four months}} would be quite time enough to put me straight; and if I consent to go, it must <b>be</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> to be no presents, and nothing except {{travelling}} expenses." ...|$|R
2500|$|Van Helmont is {{regarded}} as the founder of pneumatic chemistry, as {{he was the first to}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> gases distinct in kind from atmospheric air and furthermore invented the word [...] "gas". He perceived that his [...] "gas sylvestre" [...] (carbon dioxide) given off by burning charcoal, was the same as that produced by fermenting must, which sometimes renders the air of caves unbreathable. For Van Helmont, air and water were the two primitive elements. Fire he explicitly denied to be an element, and earth is not one because it can be reduced to water.|$|E
60|$|PRINCE PAUL. When {{you are as}} old as I am, Prince, {{you will}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> few things easier than to live badly and to die well.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Morton; [...] "but we <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{measures}} adopted here {{in which the}} safety of the army is deeply concerned--Lord Evandale is your prisoner?" ...|$|E
50|$|After some time, Miles <b>understands</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no {{prison guards}} left {{and that the}} thing outside his cell is {{connected}} to him.|$|R
50|$|For the circle, line, and polar rose below, it <b>is</b> <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no {{restrictions}} on the domain and range of the curve.|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{want to get}} as {{far north}} as the timber limit, if we can," [...] Harding said. [...] "I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no Hudson Bay {{factories}} near our line, but we were told we might find some Stony Indians." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he made {{a little}} gesture. [...] "You will <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> matters which demand my attention, and I may have {{something}} more to say later. In the meanwhile you will give me your parole. The boys will be looked after." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On {{her last}} {{birthday}} we breakfasted with my father-in-law Cantacuzene, and Madame Phoebus {{found in her}} napkin a check for five thousand pounds. I expended it immediately in jewels for her personal use; for I wished my father-in-law to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> other princely families in the world besides the Cantacuzenes." ...|$|E
60|$|Charley said <b>that</b> he had <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{to be some}} fixed {{scale of}} pay; so much per sheet, or {{something}} of that sort.|$|R
60|$|Brooke could <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> reasons {{which made}} that likely in his host's case, {{but he had}} by this time {{had enough of the}} subject.|$|R
6000|$|Tim <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{some secret}} {{regarding}} the matter, and he at once proceeded {{to get rid}} of a possible eavesdropper by saying to the assistant: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, Beatrice dear,' he said imploringly, 'can you not <b>{{understand}}</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{things a}} man doesn't {{like to talk}} about--secrets that he must keep {{for the sake of}} others, and not for his own sake? Everything that relates to myself you may ask me, but do not ask me to tell other people's secrets. Don't you understand me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll try," [...] Thorne replied genially. [...] "Perhaps because she's married, Mrs. Farquhar {{seems to}} <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{occasions}} {{when a man}} is driven into doing things he has an aversion for. In a way, it's to his credit when he recognizes that the alternative {{is out of the}} question. Can you get hold of that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the Red-headed Men. It's worth quite {{a little}} fortune to {{any man who}} gets it, and I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> more {{vacancies}} than there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end {{what to do with}} the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, Sir Adrian, I <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a young lady, Miss Aurelia, that Master Merrifield was lamenting, {{as if she}} had {{met with}} a watery grave." ...|$|R
60|$|He nodded, and Frank <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{no more to}} say, and, thanking the officer, {{turned and}} walked off home. The {{fisherman}} met him on the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have called," [...] he {{explained}} to the young man, [...] "to see you about Box A on Monday night. I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a benefit performance." ...|$|R
60|$|I couldn't {{understand}} Father's {{point of}} view. Of course, he hated old John Fenwick, {{who had once}} sued him for libel and won the case. Father had written an indiscreet editorial in the excitement of a red-hot political contest--and was made to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some things you can't say of another man even at election time. But then, he need not have hated Mark because of that; Mark was not even born when it happened.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let's see," [...] he figured; [...] "it {{will be in}} {{tomorrow}} morning's edition. The tired business man will read it either at breakfast or after he reaches his office. I <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> three million people here in Chicago. Out of that three million {{it is safe to}} assume that one million will read my advertisement, and of that one-million there must be at least one thousand who have responsible positions which are, at present, inadequately filled.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are. Nothing {{is so hard}} as to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> human beings in this world besides one's self and one's set. But let us be selfishly thankful that it isn't you and I there in the apothecary's shop, as it might very well be; and let us get to the boat {{as soon as we}} can, and end this horrible midsummer-day's dream. We must have a carriage," [...] he added with tardy wisdom, hailing an empty hack, [...] "as we ought to have had all day; though I'm not sorry, now the worst's over, to have seen the worst." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I answered, [...] "I <b>understood</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> good fishing hereabout, and, at any rate, I {{should like}} {{to spend a few}} days among these hills and mountains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I have deceived him. Coming {{to him as}} I did, I {{gave him}} to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing wrong;--nothing to which special {{objection}} could be made in my position." ...|$|R
60|$|Now {{the reader}} must <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a {{wonderful}} {{difference between the}} winter {{in that part of}} the North American wilderness called Rupert's land, and winter in our own happy island.|$|R
6000|$|As the King passed Esclairmonde, he paused, and said, in an undertone, 'Dear lady, deem {{not that}} I have {{forgotten}} your holy purpose; but you <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{some who are}} jealous of any benefit conferred on Paris save from themselves, and whose alliance I may not risk.

60|$|All this voyage I {{have been}} busy over my TRAVELS, which, given {{a very high}} {{temperature}} and the saloon of a steamer usually going before the wind, and with the cabins {{in front of the}} engines, has come very near to prostrating me altogether. You will therefore <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no more poems. I wonder whether there are already enough, and whether you think that such a volume would be worth the publishing? I shall hope to find in Sydney some expression of your opinion on this point. Living as I do among - not the most cultured of mankind ('splendidly educated and perfect gentlemen when sober') - I attach a growing importance to friendly criticisms from yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Irene--she is my wife--is also {{addicted}} to sport. It was partly {{for this reason}} that I married her. It is not always by sharing my dangers and my glories that my dear Irene shows her passion for the outdoor sports which are so fascinating to me; it is often that she does this merely by sympathy. She can remain at home and think of me in the field or on the stream, and be happy. When I return she welcomes, she appreciates. If I overstay my time I do not give myself worry--I know that she will <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> contingencies. When she greets me there are no reproaches. She is the wife for a sportsman! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you <b>are</b> to <b>understand</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no {{disagreement}} between {{your mother and}} the family at The Cleeve. The idea of the marriage has, as I think very properly, been laid aside." ...|$|R
