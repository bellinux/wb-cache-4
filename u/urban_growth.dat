40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{contemporary}} urbanization process of sub-Saharan Africa. The region {{is predicted to}} experience a surge in <b>urban</b> population <b>growth</b> the forthcoming decades, yet why and how this is happening is not very clear. Theory often considers urbanization {{to be a part}} of a modernization process where people migrate from rural areas to urban. But depictions of reality suggest that rural-to-urban migration might be less significant than previously thought, and neither is it given that urbanization causes prosperity in sub-Saharan Africa. This thesis tries to complement the gap of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of urbanization in sub-Saharan Africa. Statistical data is organized and assembled by using the structured, focused comparison method and then analyzed in order to create an understanding of urbanization and <b>urban</b> population <b>growth</b> in this particular region. The result of this study suggests that the mechanisms for <b>urban</b> population <b>growth</b> change over time. <b>Urban</b> population <b>growth</b> is often thought to be driven by rural-to-urban migration. However, nowadays there is a correlation between <b>urban</b> population <b>growth</b> and population increase, which did not exist a couple of decades ago. It is clear that urbanized countries are, typically, more advanced regarding economic growth, but it is unsure whether this factor affects socio-economic development. The findings underscore the vast complexity of urbanization and <b>urban</b> population <b>growth,</b> as well as the heterogeneity of sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there is potential for a new theoretical framework that can provide explanations to the processes sub-Saharan Africa is expected to undergo...|$|R

5|$|After {{the war of}} independence, Lima {{became the}} capital of the Republic of Peru but {{economic}} stagnation and political turmoil brought its urban development to a halt. This hiatus ended in the 1850s, when increased public and private revenues from guano exports led to a rapid expansion of the city. In the next two decades, the State funded the construction of large size public buildings to replace colonial establishments; these included the Central Market, the General Slaughterhouse, the Mental Asylum, the Penitentiary, and the Dos de Mayo Hospital. There were also improvements in communications; a railroad line between Lima and Callao was completed in 1850 and an iron bridge across the Rímac River, the Balta Bridge, was opened in 1870. The city walls were torn down in 1872 as further <b>urban</b> <b>growth</b> was expected. However, the export-led economic expansion also widened the gap between rich and poor, fostering social unrest.|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically tests whether <b>urban</b> {{economic}} <b>growth</b> {{has been}} pro-poor {{in the post}} reform India. The study uses data from the three rounds of quinquennial household survey of urban monthly per capita consumer expenditure (MPCE) carried out by National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) in 1993 - 94, 2004 - 05, and 2009 - 10. To empirically measure the propoorness of <b>urban</b> economic <b>growth,</b> this paper uses the framework developed by Duclos (2004) and also follows the methodological approach of Araar, Duclos, Audet, and Makdissi (2007, 2009). The study finds strong statistical evidence that India‘s <b>urban</b> economic <b>growth</b> has been absolutely pro-poor but relatively anti-poor between periods 1993 - 94 - 2004 - 05, 2004 - 05 - 2009 - 10, and 1993 - 94 - 2009 - 10.

Land to {{accommodate}} urban development in China is provided through requisitions by government officials, suggesting that land availability {{may be a}} constraint on <b>urban</b> economic <b>growth.</b> An econometric model of <b>urban</b> GDP <b>growth</b> suggests that land has constrained economic growth in coastal areas but not elsewhere. Elasticities calculated from the estimated coefficients indicate that land availability has a larger proportional impact on economic growth than domestic and foreign investment, labor supply, and government spending. The estimated parameters provide evidence about arbitrage opportunities created by discrepancies between urban land value and compensation for requisitioned rural land, suggesting rural unrest associated with conversion of farmland to urban uses may have some economic roots. 1...|$|R
