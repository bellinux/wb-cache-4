50|$|The series {{originally}} {{grew out}} of a group of chassis built by Hayashi in Japan for the Jim Russell Racing Drivers School in California, USA. These cars were completed by Russell mechanics in the paddock of the 1984 Long Beach Grand Prix, where the cars made their US debut. The cars have a basic welded steel tube frame chassis, with in-board front shocks operated by upper rocker arms. A 180 hp carbureted Mazda rotary engine drives through a 5 speed H-pattern (H-gate) Hewland Mk 9 transaxle. Rear suspension is by two trailing links, an <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> and a lower a-arm. In the interest of creating close racing and limiting cost, the rules state that no modification is allowed until the rules expressly permit it—at one time even replacing the mirrors on the car was prohibited. The engines cannot be modified, and they are sealed to make it easy to detect cheating. The cars all use the same tires, springs, dampers, and adjustable anti-roll bars.|$|E
50|$|A set of jars {{consisted}} of two interlocking links which could telescope. In 1880 they had a play of about 13 inches such that the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> could be lifted 13 inches before the lower link was engaged. This engagement occurred when the cross-heads came together.Today, there are two primary types, hydraulic and mechanical jars. While their respective designs are quite different, their operation is similar. Energy is stored in the drillstring and suddenly released by the jar when it fires. Jars can be designed to strike up, down, or both. In the case of jarring up above a stuck bottomhole assembly, the driller slowly pulls up on the drillstring but the BHA does not move. Since {{the top of the}} drillstring is moving up, this means that the drillstring itself is stretching and storing energy. When the jars reach their firing point, they suddenly allow one section of the jar to move axially relative to a second, being pulled up rapidly {{in much the same way}} that one end of a stretched spring moves when released. After a few inches of movement, this moving section slams into a steel shoulder,imparting an impact load.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interesting}} {{rear suspension}} permits independent action of each wheel. Vertical {{movements of the}} wheels are controlled by two links, in which the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> doubles as the axle shaft; and a rod, rubber bushed on each end as the lower. A third link runs from each rear wheel hub forward to the frame to transmit driving and braking thrust. Variable rate coil springs unitized with direct, double-acting shock absorbers are diagonally mounted at each rear wheel. Adjustment provisions in the rear suspension linkage permit variations in camber and toe-in to facilitate engineering studies. Front suspension is independent with high roll center geometry, and also utilizes unitized variable rate coil springs and shock absorbers as in the rear suspension. An 11/16" [...] stabilizer bar interconnects the front wheels. The independent rear suspension design became {{the basis of the}} 1963 Corvette Sting Ray suspension. So that weight distribution during tests shall vary little if any, two fuel cells of rubber construction and total capacity of 20 gallons, are located {{on either side of the}} [...] "CERV-I" [...] at approximately the fore and aft location of the center of gravity.

5000|$|The first tractor of {{the series}} was the 9N, the first tractor to have both three-point hitch and a rear power {{take-off}} (PTO). The 9N was first demonstrated in Dearborn, Michigan on June 29, 1939. Its model name reflected a model-naming system using the last digit of the year of introduction and a letter for product type, with [...] "N" [...] for tractors (hence 9N). Like the Farmall, {{it was designed to}} be a general-purpose row-crop tractor for use on smaller farms. An extremely simple tractor, the 9N was fitted with the Ferguson system three-point hitch, a three-speed transmission, and featured footpegs instead of running boards. The 9N's relatively tall and wide-spaced front wheel design resulted in somewhat sluggish steering and reduced maneuverability compared to competing machines such as John Deere's Models A and B, and the Farmall [...] "Letter series". The 9N had variable front track, a valuable feature for row-crop cultivation, via front half-axles that could be slid in and out and pinned in place. It also had variable rear track via the reversible offset of the rear wheel design (flipping the rear wheels around 180°, moving the formerly inboard side to the outboard side, widened the rear track). Uniquely, the exhaust was routed underneath the tractor, much like an automobile. All 9N tractors were painted dark grey. This tractor has a rear PTO, which could be used to drive three-point or towed implements. The Ferguson hitch was designed to solve some of the problems found in the earlier Fordson tractors, such as flipping over if the plow hit an obstruction. The <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> also would adjust the hydraulic lift to use the drag of the plow to improve traction. This was known as draft control.|$|E
40|$|Stability {{criteria}} of front-mounted lateral movable three-point hitches {{have been known}} for several years. The steering ability of the tractor will be improved by this kind of implement hitch, compared with an implement hitch unable to move sideways. This is applicable particularly when a soil-working implement is used. There are several other advantages with front-mounted lateral movable three-point hitches. In spite of all advantages, this kind of implement hitch is not used in practice. This work shows that the lateral motion of front-mounted directional implements mostly follows the simplified theory proposed by Jönsson (1983). Also the lateral motion of front- mounted non-directional implements follows the simplified theory, provided that the area within which the non-directional hitch-point is moving can be approximated by a point. Another necessary requirement for the simplified {{theory is that the}} friction in the links can be neglected. According to the simplified theory, directional implements are moving towards the directional hitch-point and non-directional implements are moving towards the non-directional hitch-point. The lateral disturbances, are exponentially reduced according to the equation (Jönsson, 1983) : Ls = Ls 0 ∙e^-(x/Lh) where Ls side disturbance X travelled distance Lh hitch length The simplified theory assumes that the areas within which the hitch points are moving, when implements are moving laterally, can be approximated by points. This assumption implies that the hitch length can be approximated as constant. This approximation was shown to be fulfilled when the implement was mounted on a rear-mounted three-point hitch. In this case, the force in the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> was relatively small. This was shown by a study of two different pulled non-directional implements. One implement with a draught force in the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> and one with a compressive force in the <b>upper</b> <b>link.</b> The return of the implement from the lateral disturbance was almost similar for both implements. Thus, small variations in the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> force were shown to have only minor influence on the lateral motion of the implement. To get front-mounted three-point linkages laterally stable and self-centring a large draught force in the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> is required. This complicates the application of the simplified theory to front-mounted laterally movable three-point hitches, because the simplified theory has so far neglected the influence of the force in the <b>upper</b> <b>link.</b> The influence of different hitch geometry variables on the areas, within which the hitch points move when the implement moves laterally, has been studied in this work. For laterally stable implement-hitch combinations it is normally possible to approximate the area, within which the directional hitch point moves, by a point. The area, within which the non-directional point moves, is often larger. However, some combinations of hitch variables made it possible to reduce this area, within which the non-directional hitch-point moves, so much that also this area could be approximated by a point. Variable changes that contribute to reduce this area are: 1 Reducing the convergence of the lower links or moving forward the convergence point of the lower links 2 Reducing the length of the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> 3 Increasing the relation between the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> draught force and the soil force 4 Increasing the length of the lower links The influence on the lateral motion of the implements from these variables was studied partly by simulating the lateral motion of different implements and partly by measuring the lateral motion of different test hitch-implement combinations. In the simulations, the motion of the implement was always directed towards the momentary hitch point. The motion of the implements was then compared with the lateral motion of the implements according to the simplified theory. As long as the hitch points were moving within a small area, the lateral motion of the implement followed the simplified theory...|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{front-mounted}} implements {{has increased}} {{during the last}} couple of years. One drawback of the commercially available front linkages is, however, that they have been unable to move sideways. Jönsson (1983) formulated the conditions that must be fulfilled to build a front-mounted three-point hitch that allows lateral movements of the implement since it centres the implement. This is done in two different ways, depending on the implement. Directional implements are centred if the lower links of the hitch converges in the direction of travel. This was first shown by Makanjuola & Cowell (1970). The return velocity of the implement depends on the convergence of the lower links. Non-directional implements are more difficult to centre. While directional implements centre due to the linkage geometry, non-directional implements centre due to the internal forces in the linkage. Jönsson (1983) formulated a criterion of stability: (FT/FR) > (LC/LA) where FT= Force in <b>upper</b> <b>link.</b> FR= The implement's resulting force on the linkage. LC= Lateral distance between the linkage’s instantaneous centre and the centre of resistance. LA= Distance between the instantaneous centre and the <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> forces. If the stability criterion is true in every possible position that the three-point linkage can reach, a non-directional implement will centre after a. disturbance. In this work, a front-mounted self-centring three-point hitch of that kind was built and tested. The hitch was tested in combination with five different implements: 1. A one-furrow fully-mounted plough. During the work the plough proved to be self-centering and steerable. The plough was, however, very sensitive to the linkage adjustments. This was primarily due to the short <b>upper</b> <b>link</b> and mast height. On the other hand, the short top link functioned as a depth control. As the working depth of the plough changed, the change of the share pitch brought the tool back to its original depth. 2. Hoe. With this implement this front-coupling was superior to the conventional rear-mounted type. According to the driver's wish, the linkage was easily adjusted to slow or fast reaction. A slowly reacting implement compensates better for bad driving in rowcrops than a fast reacting one. On the other hand, the turning radius increases. It is also better from the ergonomic point of view to have this kind of implement in front of the driver. 3. Harrow. During the tests the harrow usually, but not always, centred itself. In extreme conditions the harrow's clod-crusher nullified the centring ability. A harrow with a jointed cross-shaft ought to be self-centering. The joint will permit vertical movement of the implement. Thereby the clod-crusher cannot interfere with the upper link-forces. 4. Single tine. The front coupling was also tested with a single tine. This was done to test a pure non-directional implement. With the tine the centring was good and the front-mounted three-point hitch behaved as expected. 5. Single disc. In order to test a pure directional implement, a single disc was mounted to the hitch. During the tests the return velocity of the implement was measured at different cross-shaft lengths. A dependence between the length of the cross-shaft (the convergence) and the return velocity was indicated, in spite of severe disturbances during the tests. The tested type of front-linkage probably has a greater developing potential than the ones available on the market today. The self-centring front-linkage reduces the stress on the tractor, the linkage and the implement more than the conventional front-linkages. The driver ergonomy is improved by using front-mounted implements instead of rear mounted. A lot of work is however needed, before this type of linkage can be commercially available. The adjustment of the coupling needs to be simplified. Some kind of regulating device for working depth is also needed to fully use the advantages of front-mounting...|$|E
