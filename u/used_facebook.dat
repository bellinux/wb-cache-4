40|$|There is {{relatively}} little research considering motivations of passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use.</b> However, research regarding motivations of general <b>Facebook</b> <b>use</b> indicates that people <b>use</b> <b>Facebook</b> to escape – and that escapism may motivate passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use.</b> Research {{also suggests that}} <b>using</b> <b>Facebook</b> to escape is associated with <b>Facebook</b> addiction. <b>Using</b> an experimental vignette design, the present research investigated whether passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use</b> is motivated by escapism and whether this escape motivation is associated with passive Facebook addiction. A within-participant experimental design using vignettes was used to explore the effect of positivity and, in addition, socialness on passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use.</b> Addiction to passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use</b> and perceived effect of passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use</b> on mood were also assessed. Participants (n= 69) responded to 16 vignettes describing daily life events, as well as responding {{to a question about}} passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use</b> on mood and completing the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale. Results suggested that individuals did not <b>use</b> <b>Facebook</b> to escape. There was no association between escapism in passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use</b> and passive <b>Facebook</b> addiction. Social contact had a positive effect on passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use,</b> and participants perceived passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use</b> to have no effect on mood. Findings suggest that passive <b>Facebook</b> <b>use</b> is a less effective method of escape than general <b>Facebook</b> <b>use,</b> and reducing individuals’ likelihood of experiencing Facebook addiction symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that some people <b>use</b> <b>Facebook</b> for antisocial purposes, such as for “trolling” or attention-seeking.

To this end, 573 participants living in the United States completed measures of narcissism, relational self-construal, and motives for <b>using</b> <b>Facebook.</b> Results revealed that men reported more antisocial motives for <b>using</b> <b>Facebook</b> than did women, which was explained by their greater narcissism.

2500|$|The media often compares Facebook to Myspace, but one {{significant}} difference between the two Web sites is the level of customization. Another difference is Facebook's requirement that users give their true identity, a demand that MySpace does not make. MySpace allows users to decorate their profiles using HTML and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), while Facebook allows only plain text. Facebook has a number of features with which users may interact. They include the Wall, a space on every user's profile page that allows friends to post messages for the user to see; Pokes, which allows users to send a virtual [...] "poke" [...] to each other (a notification then tells a user that he or she has been poked); Photos, that allows users to upload albums and photos; and Status, which allows users to inform their friends of their whereabouts and actions. Facebook also allows users to tag various people in photographs. Depending on privacy settings, anyone who can see a user's profile can also view that user's Wall. In July 2007, Facebook began allowing users to post attachments to the Wall, whereas the Wall was previously limited to textual content only. Facebook also differs from Myspace in the form of advertising <b>used.</b> <b>Facebook</b> uses advertising in the form of banner ads, referral marketing, and games. Myspace, on the other hand, uses Google and AdSense. There is also a difference in the userbase of each site. MySpace, initially, was much more popular with high school students, while Facebook was more popular among college students. A study by the American firm Nielsen Claritas showed that Facebook users are more inclined to use other professional networking sites, such as LinkedIn, than Myspace users.|$|E

Perceived Enjoyment was added to the TAM variables to explain the continuance intention to <b>use</b> <b>Facebook.</b> A survey method was adopted and the sample constituted students of undergraduate and post graduate courses.
