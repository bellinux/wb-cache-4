5000|$|The {{agency was}} also criticized {{heavily in the}} wake of the August 26, 2011 <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>House</b> bombing in Abuja. The Boko Haram Islamist sect which has ties to Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) claimed {{responsibility}} for the car bomb attack that left 24 people dead; the sect had been fighting an Islamic insurgency that started as a result of their leader being killed by policemen after he had been arrested. The Nigerian public grew even more critical of the agency after newspapers ran stories in which they claimed that the agency had received intelligence about the bombing beforehand from the Americans. This news item later turned out to be false when it was revealed that it was the SSS who had actually received credible intelligence from sources within Boko Haram about an impending attack in Abuja. The intelligence pointed out key government buildings and ministries as targets, the agency subsequently raised the alert level in Abuja and also advised diplomatic missions and international organizations in the city to take adequate security precautions for their staff and premises. The final UN report on the incident indicted the UN resident Security adviser in Abuja and his deputy, they were accused of negligence considering the fact that they had been given [...] "adequate intelligence on a possible suicide attack", yet they failed to implement suitable safeguards. Both men were subsequently relieved of their positions.|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} British press {{coverage}} of Boko Haram, a militant group in Nigeria, concentrates on condensational symbols in news reports {{of one of its}} major acts of terrorism, the bombing of the <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>House</b> in Abuja, the country’s capital city, in August 2011. The study examines the visibility of Boko Haram in British newspapers before and after the attack. It identifies the condensational symbols that dominated the coverage and how these provided a particular trajectory that could have shaped newspaper readers’ understanding of the event. The study argues that the symbolic terms that journalists used in their reports were not only easily identifiable but were specifically chosen to simplify a complex story for audiences that were perhaps uninformed about the group and its activities. The terms also reflect the repertoire of news frames that journalists mine to reconstruct reality for their audiences...|$|E

Yet although local government is at the forefront of changes that will transform the lives of citizens, the New Urban Agenda sees local governments as implementers rather than innovators, and local government will remain on the margins until a stronger mechanism for its inclusion in <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> debates is found...|$|R

You need sand {{but we do not}} have any sand in the compound." [...] Senior Israeli defense officials maintain that the shelling using white phosphorus munitions was in response to Israeli military personnel being fired upon by Hamas fighters who were in proximity to the UN headquarters, and was used for smoke. The Israeli army investigated improper use of WP in the conflict, particularly in one incident in which 20 WP shells were fired in a built-up area of Beit Lahiya.On 17 January, Peter Herby, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross Arms Unit, confirmed the use of white phosphorus weapons by Israel in Gaza, outlined the rules applicable to phosphorus weapons and explained the ICRC's approach to the issue.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} critical role played by modern architecture and planning in shaping the discourse on Third World development after the Second World War. At stake here is an ignored dimension {{of the history of}} modern architecture and planning {{as well as that of}} the development discourse that sheds important light on the relationship of both these discourses to the trajectories of global domination and control. Critiques of development have largely focused on how the economic approaches proposed by international institutions such as the World Bank and the UN have favored the financial and political agendas of global industrial powers. This dissertation argues that design practices like architecture and planning-usually thought to be concerned only with shaping the physical environment-have also played a significant role in shaping the key assumptions of the development discourse, from the existence of urbanizing masses caught between demands of tradition and modernization to the exploding Third World city that is unable to manage its emergence into modernity. After the Second World War, as modern architecture began to lose its disciplinary footings as a medium of social reform in the industrialized world, modem architects and planners found tremendous opportunities as "experts" in programs of Third World development. The <b>United</b> <b>Nations</b> <b>Housing</b> Town and Country Planning section (HTCP), headed by Ernest Weissmann, a member of Congrns International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM), sent out hundreds of missions, featuring famous housing and planning names such as Charles Abrams, Otto Koenigsberger, Catherine Bauer, and Jacob Crane, among others. (cont.) These missions produced master plans for cities from Singapore (recounted most famously by Rem Koolhaas in SMLXL) to Kabul to Beirut to Lima to Lagos, organized numerous conferences, and set up planning and public administration bodies, building research centers, and schools of architecture all over the decolonizing world. This dissertation examines this wide range of activity to identify particular modes of social and economic intervention, such as self-help architecture, "core" housing, and regional planning, that were able to negotiate the demands of postcolonial nation-states, the Cold War geo-political context, and the agendas of institutions of international finance emerging after the war. by M.
