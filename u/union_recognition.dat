In the mining town of Lethbridge, for example, the Alberta Railway and Coal Company locked out its workforce in 1894 during an attempt to cut staff and reduce wages; a team of ten police was deployed to maintain order, in particular any risks posed by eastern European immigrants, and to mediate in the dispute. Police deployed there again in 1906 for nine months during a dispute between the company, now called the Alberta Railway and Irrigation Company, and the workforce over <b>union</b> <b>recognition,</b> pay and working conditions. A team of 82 regular police were reinforced by 11 special constables recruited from within the company, with an undercover constable deployed to infiltrate the strike and send back intelligence. Efforts were made to collect information on the earnings of the union leaders, probably intended for use in discrediting them. The police maintained order and escorted non-striking workers past the picket lines.|$|E

Those two victories, however, came about very differently.|$|E

40|$|Labour {{legislative}} {{reforms are}} recent phenomena in Fiji. History of Fiji's employment and industrial relations illustrates that the labour market of Fiji is characterised with dynamism and uncertainty. In particular, this dynamism and uncertainty was {{mainly caused by}} the existing employment laws such as Employment Act (Cap. 92), Trade Disputes Act (Cap. 97), Wages Councils Act (Cap. 98), Trade Unions Act (Cap. 96), Trade <b>Unions</b> (<b>Recognition)</b> Act 1998 and Public Holidays Act (Cap. 101). These industrial relations acts were labeled as archaic and were not suitable to the changing context of Fiji. As a result, Employment Relations Promulgation (2007) was formulated and enforced in the country primarily to stabilise the labour market of Fiji. Employment Relations Promulgation (2007) was enforced in the country into two specific time periods. Against this backdrop, {{this article examines the}} economic implications of Employment Relations Promulgation (2007) on the public sector of Fiji...|$|R

25|$|Przeworski's book uses {{rational}} choice and game theory {{in order to}} demonstrate that the revolutionary strategies adopted by socialists in the twentieth century were likely to fail, since it was in the rational interests of workers to strive for the reform of capitalism through the achievement of <b>union</b> <b>recognition,</b> improved wages and living conditions, rather than adopting the risky strategy of revolution. Przeworski's book is clearly influenced by economic explanations of political behaviour advanced by thinkers such as Anthony Downs (An Economic Theory of Democracy, 1957) and Mancur Olson (The Logic of Collective Action, 1965).|$|E
25|$|The {{administration}} initially {{denied the}} <b>union</b> <b>recognition.</b> While the university discouraged {{the formation of}} labor unions, arguing that “it can do more ‘for’ the employee than a union,” Local 77 denounced this idea as “deepening the basic problem,” suggesting that “Employees {{need to have a}} voice in their own future; and that voice can only come through collective bargaining...Only then may employees negotiate and sign a contract as mutual, equal participants rather than dependents of a paternal employer with unilateral decision-making power. Only then will the psychology of dependence be overcome.” The black work force had little power in the grievance procedures.|$|E
