Although various sensing methods have been proposed, their robustness at very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and uncertain noise/interference environment is generally not satisfactory. In this paper, the concept of robust sensing is discussed first. Subsequently the cooperative covariance and eigenvalue based detections are proposed for robust spectrum sensing. It is proved mathematically that under some conditions the proposed methods are robust to uncertain and <b>unpredictable</b> <b>noise</b> and interference. The performances of the methods are also verified by simulations. I...|$|E

So rather than taking an explicit microfoundations' approach, in which individuals are represented as white-box' sources of fully-specified optimizing behavior (rational agents), we instead represent individuals as black box' sources of <b>unpredictable</b> <b>noise</b> subject to objective constraints (zero-intelligence agents).

It usually follows this pattern because most noise or jitter in an electrical circuit {{is caused by}} thermal noise, which has a Gaussian distribution. Another reason for random jitter to have a distribution like {{this is due to}} the central limit theorem. The central limit theorem states that composite effect of many uncorrelated noise sources, regardless of the distributions, approaches a Gaussian distribution.One of the main differences between random and deterministic jitter is that deterministic jitter is bounded and random jitter is unbounded.|$|R
40|$|High {{information}} {{quality is}} a paramount requirement for {{wireless sensor network}} monitoring applications. However, {{it is challenging to}} achieve a cost effective information quality solution due to <b>unpredictable</b> environment <b>noise</b> and events, unreliable wireless channel and network bandwidth, and resource and energy constraints. Specifically, the dynamic and unreliable nature of WSNs make it difficult to pre-determine optimum sensor rates and predict packet loss. To address this problem, we use information quality metrics presented by [26, 11] which characterize information quality based on the sampling frequency of sensor nodes and the packet loss rate during network transmission. These fundamental quality metrics are based on signal-to-noise ratio and are therefore application independent. Based on these metrics, a quality-aware scheduling system (QSS) is developed, which exploits cross-layer control of sensor nodes to effectively schedule data sensing and forwarding. Particularly, we develop and evaluate several QSS scheduling mechanisms: passive, reactive and perceptive. These mechanisms can adapt to environment noise, bandwidth variation and wireless channel collisions by dynamically controlling sensor rates and sensor phase. Our software and hardware experimental results indicate that our QSS is a novel and effective approach to improve information quality for WSNs...|$|R
40|$|As a key {{component}} of hydraulic control systems, hydraulic servovalves influence their performance significantly. <b>Unpredictable</b> self-excited <b>noise</b> inside hydraulic servovalves may cause instability and even failure. Being functional, with higher saturation magnetization and increased viscosity when exposed to a magnetic field, magnetic fluids (MFs) have been widely used in dampers, sealing, and biomedical treatment. In this paper, magnetic fluids are applied in the torque motor of a hydraulic servovalve to exert damping and resistance for vibration and noise suppression. Construction of the torque motor armature with magnetic fluids is introduced and the forces due to magnetic fluids on the torque motor armature are studied. Based on a bi-viscosity-constituted relationship, a mathematical model of the damping force from magnetic fluids is built when magnetic fluids are filled in the working gaps of the torque motor. Measurements of the properties of an Fe 3 O 4 composite magnetic fluid are carried out to calculate the parameters of this mathematical model and to investigate the influence of magnetic fluids on the vibration characteristics of the armature assembly. The simulated and tested harmonic responses of the armature with and without magnetic fluids show the good suppression effects of magnetic fluids on the self-excited noise inside the servovalve...|$|R
40|$|Most {{acoustic}} signals {{received by}} underwater systems in shallow waters are non-stationary and corrupted by <b>unpredictable</b> <b>noise</b> sources.

While classical methods often fail to characterise these noises in such an environment, recent multi-resolution methods like the adaptive wavelet transform and its dual, the cosine packet transform, provide a promising alternative. This paper treats the received signal as being made up of four components – tonals, transients, time/frequency transients, and spectrally smooth noise.

40|$|Children’s hearing deteriorates {{markedly}} in {{the presence}} of <b>unpredictable</b> <b>noise.</b> To explore why, 187 school-age children (4 – 11 years) and 15 adults performed a tone-in-noise detection task, in which the masking noise varied randomly between every presentation. Selective attention was evaluated by measuring the degree to which listeners were influenced by (i. e., gave weight to) each spectral region of the stimulus. Psychometric fits were also used to estimate levels of internal noise and bias. Levels of masking were found to decrease with age, becoming adult-like by 9 – 11 years. This change was explained by improvements in selective attention alone, with older listeners better able to ignore noise similar in frequency to the target. Consistent with this, age-related differences in masking were abolished when the noise was made more distant in frequency to the target. This work offers novel evidence that improve-ments in selective attention are critical for the normal development of auditory judgments...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-contact}} 3 D sensing technology, though achieved many {{success in}} a variety of applications, needs an automation system to expand its applications to automotive industries for 3 D shape inspection. The reason is the difficulty for an operator to find an optimal solution by the manual control of sensor viewpoints. The problem of this industrial application is the capability for the sensing system to simultaneously satisfy all requirements of competence, efficiency, and cost. A robot-aided 3 D sensing system can provide such a solution. A CAD-guided robot view planner can automatically generate viewpoints. Measurement accuracy can be satisfied in a certain range. However, the <b>unpredictable</b> image <b>noises</b> still need to be compensated for better measurement performance.

40|$|Australia {{typically}} experiences drought during El Niño, especially {{across the}} eastern {{two-thirds of the}} continent during austral spring (September–November). There have, however, been some interesting de-partures from this paradigm. For instance, the near-record-strength El Niño of 1997 was associated with near-normal rainfall. In contrast, eastern Australia experienced near-record drought during the modest El Niño of 2002. This stark contrast raises {{the issue of how}} the magnitude of the drought is related to the character and magnitude of El Niño, for instance as measured by the broadscale sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the equatorial eastern Pacific. Internal (<b>unpredictable)</b> atmospheric <b>noise</b> is one plausible explanation for this contrasting behavior during these El Niño events. Here, the authors suggest that Australian rainfall is sensitive to the zonal distribution of SST anomalies during El Niño and, in particular, the greatest sensitivity is to the SST variations on {{the eastern edge of the}} Pacific warm pool rather than in the eastern Pacific where El Niño variations are typically largest. Positive SST anomalies maximized near the date line in 2002, but in 1997 maximum anomalies were shifted well into the eastern Pacific, where their influence on Australian rainfall appears to be less. These findings provide a plausible physical basis for the view that forecasting the strength of El Niño is not sufficient to accurately predict rainfall variations across Australia during El Niño. 1...|$|R
40|$|Accuracy is {{essential}} to surface quality control when a range sensor is applied to measure the 3 D shape of an automotive body part. A sensor's viewing pose, including location and orientation, is related to measurement accuracy. It is usually difficult to find an optimal solution by manual control of sensor viewpoints. A CAD-guided robot view planner developed previously can automatically generate viewpoints. Measurement accuracy can be satisfied in a certain range. However, the <b>unpredictable</b> image <b>noises,</b> especially in regions with low intensity contrast, cannot be compensated by the CADguided robot view planner. In another aspect, measurement accuracy is evaluated all over the part surface. The local accuracy of a small patch may exceed the measurement tolerance. In this paper, feedback design {{is applied to the}} CADguided robot sensor planning system. The feedback controller can evaluate the accuracy of obtained point clouds, identify problem regions, and generate new viewpoints. This process is recursively executed until the measurement accuracy reaches to a tolerant value.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the impact of}} acute noise stress on the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and whether this effect depended on stressor predictability. Participants performed a gambling task in a silence and a noise condition with either predictable or <b>unpredictable</b> <b>noise.</b> FRN amplitude was measured in three ways, either neglecting (mean amplitude) or correcting for overlap with other components (base-to-peak; mean amplitude minus average mean amplitude of surrounding peaks). Notably, results differed between measures. Valence and magnitude both affected the FRN. These effects were additive on the mean amplitude and base-to-peak measures, but interactive on the mean amplitude corrected for both peaks measure. Acute noise stress specifically modulated valence and magnitude effects on the FRN, although evidence differed between measures as to whether valence and/or magnitude were processed differently. These findings indicate that acute stress impairs cognitive control by the anterior cingulate cortex. Stressor predictability added little to the explanation of effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the effects of behavioral and cognitive control on post-stress performance. Half of the subjects exposed to loud <b>unpredictable</b> <b>noise</b> bursts were given 'behavioral' control (a button which would terminate the noise), while the other half had no behavioral control. In addition, subjects were provided with one of three levels of feedback (success, failure, or no feedback) regarding their performance during the noise. It was expected that information about performance would provide subjects with an increased sense of 'cognitive' control which would affect their appraisal of stressful events and their later performance. The results indicated that subjects given feedback performed better on subsequent tasks than those given no feedback. Perceived behavioral control had little effect on performance. The causal attributions made by subjects were used to interpret these effects. These findings were viewed as supportive of Averill's (1973) notion that various types of control are related to stress in a complex fashion.

40|$|Questions: How will genetic {{differentiation}} {{and genetic}} drift in spatially structured populations {{be affected by}} different classes of autocorrelated environmental noise? How does dispersal interact with fluctuations generated from the demographic and environmental forcing in shaping the neutral genetic patterns? Model and key assumptions: Populations are regulated locally by density-dependent feedback including demographic stochasticity {{but they are also}} here forced by environmental noise (white, red, and blue noise corresponding to random, positive, and negative autocorrelation respectively). Spatial structure consists of a looped string of populations connected by dispersal and each with a predefined carrying capacity (one-dimensional stepping stone structure). Method: Simulations initialized by randomly distributing individuals, and thus genotypes, in space (no fitness differences, no mutation, no recombination, no selection). Conclusions: In an <b>unpredictable</b> way, red <b>noise</b> reinforces the genetic differentiation among populations more than white or blue noise. Dispersal appears unable to dilute the differentiation effect of positively autocorrelated forcing. In modelling the effect of environmental stochasticity, details about the type of environmental noise are of paramount importance for the results and their biological and management implications...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} low-rank approximation based multichannel Wiener filter algorithms for {{noise reduction}} in speech plus noise scenarios, with application in cochlear implants. In a single speech source scenario, the frequency-domain autocorrelation matrix {{of the speech}} signal is often {{assumed to be a}} rank- 1 matrix, which then allows to derive different rank- 1 approximation based noise reduction filters. In practice, however, the rank of the autocorrelation matrix of the speech signal is usually greater than one. Firstly, the link between the different rank- 1 approximation based noise reduction filters and the original speech distortion weighted multichannel Wiener filter is investigated when the rank of the autocorrelation matrix of the speech signal is indeed greater than one. DRAFT 2 Secondly, in low input signal-to-noise-ratio scenarios, due to noise non-stationarity, the estimation of the autocorrelation matrix of the speech signal can be problematic and the noise reduction filters can deliver <b>unpredictable</b> <b>noise</b> reduction performance. An eigenvalue decomposition based filter and a generalized eigenvalue decomposition based filter are introduced that include a more robust rank- 1, or more generally rank-R, approximation of the autocorrelation matrix of the speech signal.

The filters are especially usefull in cochlear implants, where more speech distortion and hence a more agressive noise reduction can be tolerated...|$|E
30|$|An {{environment}} with multipath fading and interference generates signal strength variations over distances of a wavelength. Small {{changes in the}} position of the router can be exploited to improve the received signal strength [50]. In this phase, we exploit the information we have about the multipath fading and positions of the transmitter and interfering nodes to improve the end-to-end throughput of the selected route. Assuming that the fading channel is learned beforehand, the link quality at the unvisited location can be predicted using the position information of the transmitter and interferers of that link. Even if the channel is known beforehand, the stochastic nature of a wireless channel makes it difficult for iterative methods to find the global optimal position, as the channel map in general has a lot of local optimal positions and is <b>unpredictable</b> due to <b>noise,</b> path loss, multipath fading, and interferences. In such a situation, heuristic-based algorithms are good candidates to achieve beneficial performance in avoiding extreme local optima. Previously, the PSO-based algorithm incorporated with distributed virtual force algorithm (VFA) is developed by Loscri et al. in [51] to improve dynamic event coverage for mobile sensor networks. We use the PSO to find the optimal position for the router, so that the RP and overall throughput are improved.|$|R

30|$|The World Health Organisation (WHO) {{recommends}} that noise levels within hospital wards should not exceed 30 dB(A) {{at night in}} order to reduce sleep disturbance [68]. The ability for ICUs to meet the WHO recommendations is improbable and is further reiterated within the literature whereby ICUs worldwide repeatedly cite noise levels in excess of 50 dB [2, 64, 65, 69 - 71]. Moreover, noise levels in ICUs have steadily increased over the past decades, with a study conducted by Busch-Vishnich [72] quantifying this at a rate of 0.38 dB(A) per day and 0.42 dB(A) per night, per year. The evolving advances in medical care, technology and increasing patient acuity are contributing factors to the acoustical changes within the clinical environment. The noise generated from alarms associated with the intensive monitoring of patients frequently exceeds 70 dB(A), which is reflective of the noise generated by traffic [73]. Further, with the increasing ambient noise level, the impact of the Lombard effect can be compounded. This communication phenomenon results in individuals increasing their speech amplitude in order to enhance the intelligibility of their speech within noisy environments and contributes to a rapid escalation in environmental noise. This creates an environment that is detrimental to patients’ sleep as noise levels frequently undulate between low levels, with frequent short, sharp and <b>unpredictable</b> escalations in <b>noise</b> [74].|$|R
