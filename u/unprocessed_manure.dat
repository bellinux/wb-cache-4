40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to conduct an applied field study {{investigating}} the feasibility of utilizing processed liquid swine manure in crop production. Four treatments were evaluated; unprocessed liquid swine manure, processed liquid effluent, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and zero-rate control. For shallow subsurface water (as measured by lysimeters), the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer treatment had the greatest levels of nitrate-N. However, there were no significant differences for any measured chemical parameter for groundwater (as measured by sampling wells) among the four treatments. In general, the zero-rate control treatment was the lowest yielding treatment for corn (Zea mays L.), in contrast to the equivalent response of the other treatments. Nutrient accumulation was similar for the four treatments, with the exception of greater plant manganese content of the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer treatment. For soybean (Glycine max L.), all four treatments responded in a similar fashion. After 5 years of annual treatment application, the processed liquid effluent and <b>unprocessed</b> <b>manure</b> treatments were similar for most soil parameters. In addition, soil and plant tissue samples were evaluated for pathogenic organisms (total coliform and Escherichia coli) and non-detectable levels were found for all treatments. The results of this study indicate the processed liquid swine effluent produced in this study, inorganic nitrogen fertilizer and <b>unprocessed</b> <b>manure</b> had similar effects on crop characteristics and subsurface water quality...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. To reduce {{overloading}} lagoons {{used for}} treating/holding animal manures, {{some form of}} pretreatment to reduce organic strength of the manure is necessary. Aerobic treatment is one such pretreatment, but the associated aeration costs most often limit use of this process. Reducing these associated aeration costs, therefore, would make this fast pretreatment method more feasible. In this study, a combination of solids/liquid separation and low−level aeration treatment processes were examined for stabilization of the swine slurry and on their effect on pertinent manure nutrients. Results indicate that solids/liquid separation and low−level aerobic treatments of swine manure enhance bio−stabilization of the separated liquid manure. In this study, 0. 164 day− 1 and 0. 061 day− 1 bio−stabilization rates were observed in the separated liquid manure and in the control (unseparated) manure, respectively. By day nine, 40 % and 76 % reductions in COD were achieved in the control and the treatment, respectively, i. e., {{the strength of the}} influent into the anaerobic lagoons can be reduced by as much as 76 % using this combined treatment approach within nine days. The faster bio−stabilization in the separated manure liquid is believed to be a result of improved aeration efficiency and better contact between the microbial biomass and the dissolved substrate. Although aeration treatment did not result in considerable change in both TKN and TAN, effluent liquid after an overnight sedimentation process from the <b>unprocessed</b> <b>manure</b> (control) was found to retain approximately 90 % of TKN, 34 % of TP, and 73 % of TS, while effluents from the treatment after the same overnight sedimentation retained approximately 67 % of TKN, 30 % of TP, and 54 % of TS. The treatment, therefore, not only resulted in higher reduction of organic strength but also in substantial reductions of TKN, TP, and TS than the control in the liquid effluent after an overnight sedimentation process...|$|E
40|$|Several {{negative}} {{factors have}} arisen {{from the use}} of unprocessed organic fertilizer application on farm lands in Zimbabwe thus overshadowing its abundance and cheapness as a source of manure. Leaching, de-nitrification and volatilization of nitrogen in the <b>unprocessed</b> poultry <b>manure</b> have been of major concern as they are contributing factors to the greenhouse effect and pollution of water sources. In addition it is a source of air pollution and is a concern to locals near farms applying poultry manure. Also due to the high moisture content in the <b>unprocessed</b> poultry <b>manure,</b> it is a breeding area for flies and other insects making people close to the farms prone to disease outbreaks. The main goal of the research was to design an automated organic fertilizer production plant with an output of 50 tonne per day from organic waste with the aid of BM 1 enzyme. To meet its aim and objectives, temperature and moisture analysis experiments were carried out. Interviews, questionnaires and process observations on site at poultry and fertilizer producers in Zimbabwe were done. The results were presented and analysed so as {{to come up with an}} optimized system during design. An intermediate PLC controlled hammer mill plant which facilitates particle reduction using BM 1 enzyme at a production rate of 50 tonnes per day was developed. The plant design layout and simulation results were presented. To a greater extend the design was a success...|$|R
40|$|Processing {{of organic}} waste can improve its {{nutrient}} availability and content, and thereby increases the agricultural {{value of the}} waste when used as fertilisers, while contributing to a more bio-based, ‘circular’ economy. It is therefore important to guide future policies on waste management and {{on the development of}} industries related to processing of organic wastes from agriculture, industry and households. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the decision-making processes underlying the use of processed and unprocessed organic waste-based fertilisers by farmers. We conducted a survey asking farmers in Denmark about their current use of organic fertiliser, their interest in using alternative types in the future, and their perception of most important barriers or advantages to using organic fertilisers. A representative sample of farmers with > 10 ha of land were sent a questionnaire; in total 452 responses (28 % response rate) were received. Almost three quarters of respondents (72 %) used organic fertiliser, and half of the arable/horticultural farms (without livestock) used <b>unprocessed</b> <b>manures,</b> suggesting significant manure exchange from animal production farms to arable farms in Denmark. Looking forward three years from the time of the survey, respondents did not expect to increase the amount of organic fertiliser they used. However, future interest in using processed manures (PRO) and urban waste-derived fertiliser (URB) was greater than their use at the time of the survey (66 % interest vs 19 % current use of PRO and 32 % vs 9 % current use of URB). Anaerobically-digested slurry, acidified slurry, and composted/thermally-dried manure or slurry were products of particular interest. A large percentage (40 %) of farmers did not have access to processed forms of organic fertiliser, particularly PRO (35 % of respondents). Farm and farmer characteristics such as farming activity, farmer age, farm size, and conventional/organic farming influenced the likelihood of future interest in alternative organic fertilisers. The most important barriers to the use of organic fertiliser identified among respondents were: unpleasant odour for neighbours, uncertainty in nutrient content, and difficulty in planning and use. Improved soil structure was clearly chosen as the most important advantage or reason to use organic fertiliser, followed by low cost to buy or produce, and ease of availability. Danish government policies aim to increase in manure processing (e. g. increasing anaerobic digestion for bioenergy recovery). A mix of industry and government-led measures could potentially increase availability and farmer-use to meet these targets. </p...|$|R
30|$|Vermicomposting is a non-thermophilic {{biological}} oxidation {{process in which}} organic material are converted into vermicompost which is a peat like material, exhibiting high porosity, aeration, drainage, water holding capacity and rich microbial activities (Edwards 1998; Atiyeh et al. 2000 b; Arancon et al. 2004 a), through the interactions between earthworms and associated microbes. Vermiculture is a cost-effective tool for environmentally sound waste management (Banu et al. 2001; Asha et al. 2008). Earthworms are the crucial drivers of the process, as they aerate, condition and fragment the substrate and thereby drastically alter the microbial activity and their biodegradation potential (Fracchia et al. 2006; Lazcano et al. 2008). Several enzymes, intestinal mucus and antibiotics in earthworm’s intestinal tract {{play an important role}} in the breakdown of organic macromolecules. Biodegradable organic wastes such as crop residues, municipal, hospital and industrial wastes pose major problems in disposal and treatment. Release of <b>unprocessed</b> animal <b>manures</b> into agricultural fields contaminates ground water causing public health risk. Vermicomposting is the best alternative to conventional composting and differs from it in several ways (Gandhi et al. 1997). Vermicomposting hastens the decomposition process by 2 – 5 times, thereby quickens the conversion of wastes into valuable biofertilizer and produces much more homogenous materials compared to thermophilic composting (Bhatnagar and Palta 1996; Atiyeh et al. 2000 a). Distinct differences exist between the microbial communities found in vermicomposts and composts and hence the nature of the microbial processes is quite different in vermicomposting and composting (Subler et al. 1998). The active phase of composting is the thermophilic stage characterized by thermophilic bacterial community where intensive decomposition takes place followed by a mesophilic maturation phase (Lazcano et al. 2008; Vivas et al. 2009). Vermicomposting is a mesophilic process characterized by mesophilic bacteria and fungi (Benitez et al. 1999). Vermicomposting comprises of an active stage during which earthworms and associated microbes jointly process the substrate and the maturation phase that involves the action of associated microbes and occurs once the worm’s moves to the fresher layers of undigested waste or when the product is removed from the vermireacter. The duration of the active phase depends on the species and density of the earthworms involved (Ndegwa et al. 2000; Lazcano et al. 2008; Aira et al. 2011). A wide range of oganic wastes viz., horticultural residues from processed potatoes (Edwards 1988); mushroom wastes (Edwards 1988; Tajbakhsh et al. 2008); horse wastes (Hartenstein et al. 1979; Edwards et al. 1998); pig wastes (Chan and Griffiths 1988; Reeh 1992); brewery wastes (Butt 1993); sericulture wastes (Gunathilagraj and Ravignanam 1996); municipal sewage sludge (Mitchell et al. 1980; Dominguez et al. 2000); agricultural residues (Bansal and Kapoor 2000); weeds (Gajalakshmi et al. 2001); cattle dung (Gunadi et al. 2002); industrial refuse such as paper wastes (Butt 1993; Elvira et al. 1995; Gajalakshmi et al. 2002); sludge from paper mills and dairy plants (Elvira et al. 1997; Banu et al. 2001); domestic kitchen wastes (Sinha et al. 2002); urban residues and animal wastes (Edwards et al. 1985; Edwards 1988) can be vermicomposted (Sharma et al. 2005).|$|R
