40|$|Autolysis of cell walls from {{polygalacturonase}} (PG) -antisense tomato fruit was {{studied in}} a conventional buffer designed to maximize the catalytic activity of PG (30 mM sodium acetate, 150 mM NaCl, pH 4. 5), and in solutions mimicking the pH and mineral composition of the fruit apoplast at the mature-green and ripe stages. Autolytic release of <b>uronic</b> <b>acids</b> was very limited under simulated apoplastic conditions compared with the conventional buffer, but minimal differences in the release of reducing groups were observed among the incubation conditions. Autolytic release of <b>uronic</b> <b>acids</b> from active walls was lower than solubilization from enzymically inactive walls. <b>Uronic</b> <b>acids</b> that remained ionically bound to the cell walls during autolysis were subsequently extracted and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography.

The emulsification index of exopolymer produced by Halomonas sp.

40|$|Isolated {{cell wall}} from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv Rutgers) fruit {{released}} polymeric (degree of polymerization [DP] > 8), oligomeric, and monomeric <b>uronic</b> <b>acids</b> in a reaction mediated by bound polygalacturonase (PG) (EC 3. 2. 1. 15). Wall autolytic capacity increased with ripening, reflecting {{increased levels of}} bound PG; however, characteristic oligomeric and monomeric products were recovered from all wall isolates exhibiting net pectin release. The capacity of wall from fruit at early ripening (breaker, turning) to generate oligomeric and monomeric <b>uronic</b> <b>acids</b> was attributed to the nonuniform ripening pattern of the tomato fruit and, consequently, a locally dense distribution of enzyme in wall originating from those fruit portions at more temporally advanced stages of ripening. Artificial autolytically active wall, prepared by permitting solubilized PG to bind to enzymically inactive wall from maturegreen fruit, released products which were similar in size characteristics to those recovered from active wall isolates. Extraction of wall-bound PG using high concentrations of NaCl (1. 2 molar) did not attenuate subsequent autolytic activity but greatly suppressed the production of oligomeric and monomeric products. An examination of water-soluble <b>uronic</b> <b>acids</b> recovered from ripe pericarp tissue disclosed the presence of polymeric and monomeric <b>uronic</b> <b>acids</b> but only trace quantities of oligomers.
