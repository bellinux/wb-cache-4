30|$|Both mordants and dyes are {{dissolved}} into the dye bath simultaneously for dyeing. This kind of processing makes a large wastage of the resources, both dye and mordant, by complexation between each other. Some {{sites of the}} textile materials are occupied with mordants and some directly with the dye compounds causes to <b>uneven</b> <b>dyeing.</b> Three type of complexation occurs that are between textiles and mordants, textiles and dyes, and between dyes and mordants leads to overloading of dye effluent into the ecosystem, a threat to sustainability issues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{new image}} {{segmentation}} approach is proposed based on the morphological watershed transform and an improved balloon snake algorithm for reducing the incorrect segmenting rate that caused by <b>uneven</b> <b>dyeing</b> of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) cells. Firstly, a marker-controlled watershed pre-segmentation was applied to resolve the over-segmentation problem of the watershed and eliminate the approximate contour of CSF cells. Secondly, due to the weak boundary of some cytoplasm, we performed a coarse segmentation by using an improved balloon snake to dilate the watershed result. Finally, a fine segmentation was performed to obtain the ultimate cytoplasm contours. The {{results show that the}} new method is more accurate and robust to weak boundary...|$|E
40|$|Ordinarily indigo dyeing is {{performed}} {{by reducing the}} dye under basic conditions. On the other hand indigo can also be dyed using fresh leaves of indigo plants. Though silk and wool can be dyed by this method, cotton is difficult to apply. In this article an attempt to dye cotton using powder of dry leaves of indigofera which contains indican (a precursor of indigo) is described. By paste of the powder cotton fabrics was dyed deeper than normal method of indigo dyeing with fresh leaves. However, as the shade was <b>uneven,</b> <b>dyeing</b> of cotton by the mixture of the extract with hot water (indican solution) and the extract with cold water (enzyme solution) under basic conditions and argon atmosphere was examined. As a result basic condition of pH being 12. 5 and condition without oxygen {{were found to be}} preferable to dye cotton. Moreover it was suggested that indigo is formed from indoxyl via leuco-indigo (the reduced form of indigo) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{remainder}} of this thesis considers the longitudinal coherence of the copper vapour laser, and describes the design and initial performance of a narrow bandwidth dye laser for use with a CVL. Careful construction of a grazing-incidence grating arrangement {{similar to that of}} Littman has resulted in a laser which is particularly simple to align and which promises ease of tuning over a wide range. Operation confined to a single longitudinal mode has been demonstrated, corresponding to single shot bandwidths below IGHz, but instabilities caused by vibration and <b>uneven</b> <b>dye</b> flow broaden the time-averaged width to around 3 GHz. Suggested improvements have not yet been implemented...|$|R
30|$|Around 10, 000, 000 tons of {{synthetic}} dyes are annually {{used in the}} world (Ghorpade et al. 2000; Goodarzian and Ekrami 2010; Saravanan et al. 2014) by various industries for coloring numerous materials. Textile industry accounts for two-thirds of the total dyestuff market (Anouzla et al. 2009; Riu et al. 1998; Shertate and Thorat 2013). Over 10, 000 dyes with an annual production of over 7 [*]Ã—[*] 105 metric tons are commercially available for use by this industry (Campos et al. 2001). However, some common problems of textile <b>dyeing</b> industries include <b>uneven</b> or faulty <b>dyeing</b> and formation of color patches on the fabric surface during dyeing and downstream processing of textiles materials (Fono and Montclair 1980; Ogulata and Balci 2007). Such problems in the finished quality of fabric are generally tackled through a chemical stripping process which is a common practice in dyeing industries for the deep shade batches.|$|R
30|$|This {{study has}} {{provided}} results that {{demonstrate that the}} aerial spot-gun application method has potential to deliver an even distribution of active ingredient onto the leaf surfaces throughout the canopy. The spot-gun method excelled at evenly distributing dye on both the adaxial and abaxial leaf surfaces. A critical next step for validating the spot-gun methodology is {{to determine if the}} <b>uneven</b> distribution of <b>dye</b> found at the base of canopy, compared to the top and middle of the canopy, can be mitigated with method adjustment. We did not measure off-target spray drift during this pilot study, however the overall pesticide loading in the target zone is much lower for the spot-gun method compared to that for the broadcast treatment (sum of total active applied in spot treatments/total applied in broadcast treatment), therefore the potential for drift is dramatically reduced. In addition, the drop size used in the spot treatment was coarse with less spray available for drift compared to the smaller drops used in the broadcast method. Further work is needed to quantify the reduction in spray drift produced by the spot-gun method compared to the standard broadcast method and to obtain a dataset for use in aerial spray models.|$|R
40|$|Control of {{the warp}} and weft yarn tension is an {{important}} factor. In this research, effect of warp yarn tension variations {{on the quality of}} greige and dyed woven fabrics was investigated. Six fabric samples (three Plain and three Twill weaves) were woven on shuttle loom at varied warp yarn tension. The fabric samples were then pre-treated and dyed (Drimarene Red Cl 5 B, 3 % owf) using laboratory singeing machine and HT dyeing machine. Greige fabric quality such as fabric inspection, fabric length, fabric width, GSM (Gram per Square Meter), EPI (Ends per Inch), PPI (Picks per Inch), and dyed fabric quality such as L*, a*, b*, C, h o, (K/S) ?max and fastness properties were assessed according to the standard. It has been observed that fabric samples, both Plain and Twill weave; woven at improper warp yarns tension gives rejected greige fabric quality and 1 - 7 % lower (K/S) 550 nm values as compared to the fabric weave at requisite warp yarn tension such as 38 - 39 cN for Plain fabric and 78 cN for Twill fabric for 42 x 38 and 64 x 36 tex construction. Hence, among other weave faults, warp yarn tension variation has influence on the greige fabric quality as well as caused improper and <b>uneven</b> <b>dyeing</b> behavior...|$|E
40|$|Purpose : to {{evaluate}} the safety and effectiveness of proposed method for staining with trypan blue anterior lens capsule in cases with small and rigid pupils. Methods : the safety and effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated in 169 cases having small and rigid pupils of III and IV grade. Surgical steps included: irrigation of anterior chamber with small amount of air, enough to block the pupil; irrigation of posterior chamber with little amount of dye followed by aspiration of air bubble. the excess dye came out and stained the capsule in pupillary area. Results : No difficulty was encountered in irrigating the posterior chamber with <b>dye.</b> <b>Uneven</b> staining of the capsule was noticed in 16 cases (9. 5 %). In 3 cases (1. 8 %) extensive staining of iris and posterior capsule was observed. Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis was performed successfully in 97. 6 % cases. In 4 cases there was radial run of the rhexis extending up to posterior capsule. Postopera- tive inflammation of 1 st and 2 nd degree was observed in 5. 9 and 23. 1 % cases, which was related to unavoidable trauma to iris tissue during pupil stretching. Conclusion : the proposed method of capsule staining in cases with small and rigid pupils is safe and effective. </p...|$|R
30|$|Some common {{problems}} of textile <b>dyeing</b> industries include <b>uneven</b> or faulty <b>dyeing</b> and formation of color patches on the fabric surface during dyeing and downstream processing of textiles materials. Such {{problems in the}} finished quality of fabric are generally tackled through a chemical stripping process which is a common practice in dyeing industries for the deep shade batches. However, reactive dyes cannot be stripped satisfactorily from cellulosic materials due {{to the formation of}} co-valent bonds between dye and fiber. This research was undertaken using 2.5 % and 5 % bi-hetero reactive dyes on pretreated cotton fabric and dye stripping was carried out in alkali reductive stripping process. The aim of the work was to investigate the effects of dye stripping on the quality of cotton fabric. Strength loss, weight loss, pilling resistance and absorbency of stripped fabric were calculated. Though with the increase of concentration of stripping chemicals and temperature, stripping percentages were improved; processing damage to the fabric such as losses in strength, weight and pilling resistance ratings was found. In contrast, increased fabric absorbency was found due to stripping. This is explained that during stripping, alkaline solution as an intracrystalline swelling agent is effective in loosening the crystalline region of cotton in addition to the amorphous region. Stripping agent can also attack such crystalline region. As a result, cotton fiber can release maximum number of hydroxyl groups which previously formed covalent bonds. This is the reason behind the stripped fabric having more water absorbency.|$|R
