40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{part of the}} thesis explains several terms from the area of civil protection, such as civil protection, international humanitarian law, extraordinary and crisis event, and describes {{the historical development of}} civil protection in an international environment and in the territory of today's Czech Republic. The thesis also characterizes international institutions while addressing some of them, namely ICRC, UN, NATO and EU, in more detail. It describes the history, characteristics and organization structure of international institutions, as well as involvement of the North Atlantic Alliance and European Union in civil emergency planning. In terms of the Czech Republic, the thesis examines particularly how the population protection is organized in its territory. Last but not least, the thesis specifies international rules of law connected with civil protection, rules of law of the NATO addressing civil protection, rules of law of the EU addressing civil protection and Czech rules of law addressing population protection. The objective of thesis is to compare and evaluate fulfilment of tasks of the Czech and international legislation in the area of civil protection. The thesis will also serve as a study material for students of the branches "Civil Emergency Preparedness" and "Population Protection with Specialization in CBRNE" and as a supporting material for the regional authority and the authorities of municipalities with extended competence. The first section of the research part of the diploma thesis examines selected rules of law of civil protection of the Czech Republic, NATO and EU and, last but not least, Geneva Conventions. In 2013 the new Population Protection Policy for the period until 2020 with an outlook until 2030 entered into effect in the Czech Republic, based on which six areas of population protection were created. A new document of civil emergency planning of NATO is the 2014 - 2017 Political Guidance of CEP. Decision No. 1313 / 2013 /EU on a <b>Union</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Mechanism</b> has been used as the principal document for civil protection within the EU since 1. 1. 2014. These three rules of law are the main documents used for the comparison and evaluation of fulfilment of tasks of the Czech and international legislation in this thesis and are examined in more detailed. The last of the documents mentioned {{in this part of the}} thesis are the Geneva Conventions, and the thesis examines particularly their embodiment in the Czech legal regulation. At the end of this part there is a summary table that matches Czech rules of law to international rules of law in individual areas. The rules of law of the EU and NATO constitute a superstructure above the rules of law of their Member States and cannot be directly compared; however, it is possible to determine whether the Czech rules of law comply with them. The Geneva Conventions have been embodied in the legal order of the Czech Republic, and other provisions thereof have been implemented through other Acts. As far as NATO is concerned, cooperation takes place particularly between organizations in individual cases. Cooperation and coordination between EU and Member States do not interfere in the primary responsibility for the protection of population, environment, property and cultural heritage of the Member States within their own territories. The Decision on the Mechanism also does not concern mutual rights and obligations of Member States that are embodied in bilateral or multilateral treaties in the area of civil protection. At the conclusion, the thesis proposes certain changes and amendments to the Czech rules of law, which could improve civil protection in the territory of the Czech Republic and facilitate interconnection with the international environment, which has not been working yet as it is supposed to since the new Population Protection Policy has not been in full compliance with the international rules of law...|$|E
40|$|The dam of Mosul on the Tigris {{river in}} {{northern}} Iraq {{is the largest}} in the country and holds around 11 km 3 of water. Built on water permeable rock, the inherent instability of the Mosul dam has been known since it was built and this was mitigated by continuous grouting. In recent years adequate maintenance has not taken place, leading to concerns about the safety of the dam. In 2003 the government decided to lower the maximum water level from 330 to 319 metres. During the recent conflict, maintenance has again been disrupted and signs at the dam have triggered renewed concerns, highlighted in the Schnabel report. As a result, the government of Iraq have contracted the Italian engineering company Trevi to undertake remedial work on the dam. This work is scheduled to start later in the Spring of 2016. In late February 2016 the Iraqi government advised the residents of Mosul to move at least 5 km away from the river in case of breach. A UN mission of UNDAC experts left for Iraq in early April to assess the situation, supported by an associated expert from the European <b>Union</b> <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Mechanism.</b> A number of studies have been devoted to the possible effects of a failure of the dam. In this study we perform a number of medium-resolution (180 m) dynamic hydraulic simulations starting from various constant percentages of destruction of the dam and allowing the corresponding quantity of water (supposing the lake to be at its highest level) to flow downslope for periods of 6 and 12 days. Compared to previous studies we provide in addition a complete timescale of the water flow progression, detailed maps of the water depth and extent in the affected cities’ areas and focus more on the numbers of population affected by various water depths. The main scenario analysed in this study, where the dam is 26 % destroyed, the level of the lake is at its maximum value of 330 m, and most of the lake’s water is allowed to flow out fast, results in a very high wave of water (in places 25 m high, mean height around 12 m) arriving at Mosul city after 1 h 40 min. The capital Baghdad is reached after about 3. 5 days with a max water height of 8 m and a mean of around 2 m. The simulations suggest that in the above scenario a total of more than 6 million people (close to one sixth of the country’s population) will be affected by floodwaters, with two million of them facing water of more than 2 m. Water heights of more than 10 m would inundate an area with 270 000 people, most of them in Mosul city and its surroundings, whose lives, houses and infrastructure would risk complete destruction. A number of other scenarios involving lower initial levels of the lake are also analysed, considering levels of 319 m (the current one), and 315, 309, 307, 305 and 300 m. Significant reductions in the affected populations and later arrival times are seen for lower initial lake levels. The differences are quite prominent in Mosul as well as in Baghdad, where we also provide detailed maps of the inundation in the various cases. The scenario of part of the flood wave being diverted to lake Tharthar by an existing channel near Samarra is also examined in detail. These results are a first-order approximation, favouring speed of calculation over detail for a rapid assessment; it is planned to refine them later using higher resolution ground elevation data (that take much longer to run) and more detailed, time-dependent scenarios of dam failure.

40|$|This report {{seeks to}} {{identify}} the main obstacles that existing rules create for international cooperation {{in the event of}} disasters in Italy: It does so by looking to the Guidelines for the Domestic Facilitation and Regulation of International Disaster Relief and Initial Recovery Assistance (hereinafter the IDRL Guidelines) and to the EU Host Nation Support Guidelines (HNSG). The analysis seeks to point out solutions (mostly legislative ones) that may contribute to enhancing international cooperation in response to disasters occurring in Italy. The report finds that Italy has developed advanced and flexible disaster response mechanisms. Furthermore, Italy’s participation in international cooperation arrangements, notably the European <b>Union</b> (EU) <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Mechanism,</b> reinforces the country’s capacities and preparedness. As of today, the country has seldom relied on external assistance, and when it did, international cooperation did not prove problematic. Indeed, it would seem that Italian law is generally in line with the prescriptions of the IDRL Guidelines and the HNSG, especially as concerns assistance originating from other EU countries. However, the investigation has also indicated three main problems {{that need to be addressed}} in order to ensure effective and accountable assistance in the future. In the first place, the institutional framework is fragmented: Numerous organs with different resources and powers intervene in disaster response. In the second place, it is not always easy to say what rules apply: There is a multiplicity of instruments that regulate disaster response, and their identification and interpretation is often complex. And, in the third place, some of the rules may hinder incoming aid: There are cases in which the law may prevent the provision of assistance or may discourage it by imposing onerous procedures and financial obligations. These problems can be addressed by fixing the flaws identified in the report, that is, by clarifying existing law, repealing outdated provisions, and introducing specific norms designed to regulate and facilitate international cooperation. To this end, the report offers recommendations for the competent authorities. International Federation of Red Cross and Red Cross Societie...|$|R

Insufficient resources and capacity, slow implementation of the (at that time) novel risk prevention and protection framework, embodied in the law 183 / 89 of 18 May 1989, increased the reliance on the response and recovery operations of the <b>civil</b> <b>protection.</b> As a result, {{the importance of the}} <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and the relative body of norms and regulation developed rapidly in the 1990 s.

40|$|The term "civil protection" has {{different}} meanings and interpretations, sometimes varying {{from country to}} country. In the context of Europe, <b>civil</b> <b>protection</b> and its developing and multi-faceted relationship with resilience is a relatively recent phenomenon, arguably originating {{from the end of}} the cold war, commonly described as the period from the end of World War II to the early to mid- 1990 s, when the focus changed to <b>civil</b> <b>protection</b> from <b>civil</b> defence, with contingency plans being put in place by many countries for the civilian populations to organise, prepare to mobilise and defend themselves in the event of a major incident such as a nuclear attack or potential invasion by another country. Over the past two to three decades, and at the level of the European Union, the use of the term "civil protection" has become synonymous with the contingency and emergency planning arrangements that countries either individually and now increasingly collectively (such as the six regional European <b>civil</b> <b>protection</b> initiatives) have put in place to increase resilience and the ability to respond effectively both to the threat or occurrence of natural disasters, such as earthquakes and damage to the built environment, volcanic eruptions, forest fires, floods, landslides and man-made disasters such as marine pollution incidents or threats or actual acts of terrorism such as those experienced in London (2005) or Madrid (2004).. The European Union determined that increasing preparedness and resilience to natural or man-made disasters or to terrorism events would require greater humanitarian focus and co-ordination of resources at a community-based level. In response to this, the European Union adopted two pieces of legislation which cover European civil protection: first, Council Decision 2007 / 779 /EC established a Community <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> <b>Mechanism</b> and, second, Council Decision 2007 / 162 /EC established a <b>Civil</b> <b>Protection</b> Financial Instrument.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{objectives}} of the new EU <b>civil</b> <b>protection</b> <b>mechanism</b> is an enhanced understanding of risks the EU is facing. Developing a European perspective may create significant opportunities of successfully combining resources for the common objective of preventing and mitigating shared risks. Risk assessments and mapping represent {{the first step in}} these preventive efforts. The EU is facing an increasing number of natural disasters. Among them earthquakes are the second deadliest after extreme temperatures. A better-shared understanding of where seismic risk lies in the EU is useful to identify which regions are most at risk and where more detailed seismic risk assessments are needed. In that scope, seismic risk assessment models at a pan-European level have a great potential in obtaining an overview of the expected economic and human losses using a homogeneous quantitative approach and harmonized datasets. This study strives to demonstrate the feasibility of performing a probabilistic seismic risk assessment at a pan-European level with an open access methodology and using open datasets available across the EU. It aims also at highlighting the challenges and needs in datasets and the information gaps for a consistent seismic risk assessment at the pan-European level.
