The paper then overviews the growth of impact fee use as an infrastructure-financing tool in the United States and presents principles for their “appropriate ” use, based on the U. S. experience. The paper then summarizes the nascent use of transport impact fees in Santiago, where they are currently being used to help finance transport infrastructure demands resulting from rapid suburbanization there. After providing a background to the current urban transportation infrastructure finance system in Chile, the paper assesses the use of impact fees in Santiago, based on the principles of use developed in the U.

Based on this preliminary assessment, the paper recommends that, if transport impact fees are to be used effectively in Chile then proper over-arching legal guidance for their use must be established, a uniform approach to their application should be employed, the relationship of impact fees to other user fees and other forms of development exactions must be clarified, the question of who actually bears the ultimate burden of impact fee costs should be answered, and, finally, the effects of transport impact fees on other public policy goals should be more clearly understood.

Global spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) are first {{used to analyze the}} spatial–temporal clustering of <b>urban</b> growth and <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> from 1980 to 2007. Then, spatial regression analysis is conducted to investigate the mutual spatial–temporal effects of <b>urban</b> growth and <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> Results indicate a significant positive global spatial autocorrelation of all defined variables between 1980 and 2007. LISA results also reveal a constant significant spatial association of <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> expansion and <b>urban</b> growth variables from 1980 to 2007.

This study shows that <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> is a constant and strong spatial influencing factor of urban growth in the polycentric urban structure that Jeddah has. Overall, this study demonstrates that exploratory spatial data analysis and spatial regression analysis are able to detect the spatial–temporal mutual effects of <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>urban</b> growth.

Limited traffic infrastructures and increasing demands in dense urban regions lead to frequent delivery runs with smaller freight vehicles.

40|$|Abstract: It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that transportation infrastructure has important impacts {{on the development of}} cities. Specifically, we expect that improvements to urban infrastructure generate welfare benefits by reducing commuting and shipping costs, that they affect driving behavior, that they affect the physical layout of cities and that they affect the organization of activities within cities. Until recently, however, there has been little systematic evidence with which to evaluate claims about the effects of transportation infrastructure on the development of cities and regions. In this paper, we describe the evolution of Chinese transportation infrastructure and how it relates to the evolution of location patterns of population and production in Chinese cities and surrounding regions. Using empirical evidence from our work with Loren Brandt, Vernon Henderson and Qinghua Zhang on the causal effects of various types of transportation infrastructure on the decentralization of Chinese cities, we evaluate the efficacy of various <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> policies for China. Finally, we put our results in context of the existing literature on the effects of infrastructure on productivity and the allocation of resources across locations...|$|E

Against this background, this paper frames urban transportation as an issue of justice: contemporary transport systems are characterized by injustice, as they tend to favour and prioritize motorized transport, accepting that considerable environmental and social burdens are put on more sustainable forms of transportation, other traffic participants and society as a whole. To conceptualize ‘urban transport justice’, the paper discusses three dimensions where injustices are apparent: Exposure to traffic risks and pollutants; distribution of space; and valuation of transport time. It is argued that public and political recognition of <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> injustices provides significant argument for changes in <b>urban</b> planning, <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> development and traffic management...|$|R

I find the significantly heterogeneity in the effects from better rail access on homeowners’ happiness with respect to different dimensions of residential environment. The welfare estimates suggest that better rail access provided substantial benefits to homeowners’ happiness, but these benefits have strong social-spatial differentiations.

Busways were introduced in cities like São Paulo, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Belo Horizonte and Goiânia under the coordination of a Federal agency.

Lifestyle migration boosts urban growth as these cities become home to ‘permanent tourists’ attracted by the characteristics that attract tourism.

Likewise, the growing focus on global warming and greenhouse issues places additional pressure on <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> to reduce its CO 2 output. This paper provides a review of <b>transport,</b> <b>urban</b> form, energy use and CO 2 emissions patterns in an international sample of 84 cities in the USA, Australia, Canada, Western Europe, high income Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, low income Asia, Latin America and China. This overview concentrates on factors such as <b>urban</b> density, <b>transport</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and car, public transport and non-motorised mode use, which help us to better understand the different levels of per capita passenger transport energy use and CO 2 emissions in different cities. Patterns of energy consumption, modal energy efficiency and CO 2 emissions in private and public transport in the different groups of cities are examined. Automobile cities such as those in the USA use extraordinary quantities of energy in <b>urban</b> <b>transport.</b> An average US urban dweller uses about 24 times more energy annually in private transport as a Chinese <b>urban</b> resident. Public <b>transport</b> energy use per capita represents a fraction of that used in private transport in all cities, with rail being the most energy-efficient mode.
