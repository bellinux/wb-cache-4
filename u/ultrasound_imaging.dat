We performed high mechanical index contrast-enhanced <b>ultrasound</b> perfusion <b>imaging</b> in 30 patients. Time-to-peak intensity of 10 ischemic regions of interests {{was compared to}} four standardized nonischemic regions of interests of the same patient. A time-to-peak > 3 [*]s (<b>ultrasound</b> perfusion <b>imaging)</b> or > 4 [*]s (perfusion computed tomography and magnetic resonance perfusion) defined hypoperfusion. In 16 patients, 98 of 160 <b>ultrasound</b> perfusion <b>imaging</b> regions of interests of the ischemic hemisphere were classified as normal, and 52 as hypoperfused or nonperfused. Ten regions of interests were excluded due to artifacts. There was a significant correlation of the <b>ultrasound</b> perfusion <b>imaging</b> and magnetic resonance perfusion or perfusion computed tomography (Pearson`s chi-squared test 79. 119, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) (OR 0. 1065, 95 % CI 0. 06 - 0. 18). No perfusion in <b>ultrasound</b> perfusion <b>imaging</b> (18 regions of interests) correlated highly with diffusion restriction on magnetic resonance imaging (Pearson's chi-squared test 42. 307, p[*]<[*] 0. 001).

40|$|The biomechanical {{properties}} of soft tissues vary with pathological phenomenon. <b>Ultrasound</b> elasticity <b>imaging</b> is a noninvasive method {{used to analyze}} the local biomechanical {{properties of}} soft tissues in clinical diagnosis. However, the echo signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR) is diminished because of the attenuation of ultrasonic energy by soft tissues. Therefore, {{to improve the quality of}} elastography, the eSNR and depth of ultrasound penetration must be increased using chirp-coded excitation. Moreover, the low axial resolution of ultrasound images generated by a chirp-coded pulse must be increased using an appropriate compression filter. The main aim of this study is to develop an <b>ultrasound</b> elasticity <b>imaging</b> system with chirp-coded excitation using a Tukey window for assessing the biomechanical properties of soft tissues. In this study, we propose an <b>ultrasound</b> elasticity <b>imaging</b> system equipped with a 7. 5 -MHz single-element transducer and polymethylpentene compression plate to measure strains in soft tissues. Soft tissue strains were analyzed using cross correlation (CC) and absolution difference (AD) algorithms. The optimal parameters of CC and AD algorithms used for the <b>ultrasound</b> elasticity <b>imaging</b> system with chirp-coded excitation were determined by measuring the elastographic signal-to-noise ratio (SNRe) of a homogeneous phantom. Moreover, chirp-coded excitation and short pulse excitation were used to measure the elasticity properties of the phantom.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) From the {{literature}} {{it is evident}} that <b>imaging</b> <b>ultrasound</b> has expanded outside the traditional radiology setting. One profession that has found <b>imaging</b> <b>ultrasound</b> useful is physiotherapy where it is used as a biofeedback tool to assess muscle activation. This study was conducted to investigate and provide Physiotherapists with training in <b>imaging</b> <b>ultrasound</b> specific to their professional needs. Focus groups were conducted with Physiotherapists to explore their training and use of <b>imaging</b> <b>ultrasound,</b> how important they perceived <b>imaging</b> <b>ultrasound</b> in practice and if they were happy with their imaging outcomes. Also explored were the gaps they perceived in their knowledge and how they felt this information might best be provided. With the insight gained from the focus groups, a questionnaire was developed and completed by Physiotherapists throughout Australia. The questionnaire assessed the baseline knowledge and training received by Physiotherapists and their needs and interest for training in the modality. The questions also explored which methods of training interested Physiotherapists perceived might best suit their training needs and what the training curriculum might include. A training package was then developed based on the focus group and questionnaire outcomes and used to compare two delivery formats; face to face workshop and self directed training using a DVD; the same content was covered in both formats. Both training formats resulted in a statistically significant increase in participant knowledge and participants reported increased confidence in the use of <b>imaging</b> <b>ultrasound</b> in clinical physiotherapy practice.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Ultrasound</b> {{elasticity}} <b>imaging</b> provides biomechanical and elastic {{properties of}} vascular tissue, {{with the potential}} to distinguish between tissue motion and tissue strain. To validate the ability of <b>ultrasound</b> elasticity <b>imaging</b> to predict structurally defined physical changes in tissue, strain measurement patterns during angioplasty in four bovine carotid artery pathology samples were compared to the measured physical characteristics of the tissue specimens. Methods Using computational image-processing techniques, the circumferences of each bovine artery specimen were obtained from ultrasound and pathologic data. Results Ultrasound-strain-based and pathology-based arterial circumference measurements were correlated with an R 2 value of 0. 94 (p = 0. 03). The experimental elasticity imaging results confirmed the onset of deformation of an angioplasty procedure by indicating a consistent inflection point where vessel fibers were fully unfolded and vessel wall strain initiated.

Transthoracic echocardiography is suitable for the sampling used in decompression studies to identify highly reflective gas bubbles.

40|$|International audienceMedical <b>ultrasound</b> {{contrast}} <b>imaging</b> is {{a powerful}} modality undergoing successive developments {{in the last decade}} to date. Lately, pulse inversion has been used in both ultrasound tissue harmonic and contrast imaging. However, there was a tradeoff between resolution and penetration.

Linear chirps, 5 ?m diameter microbubbles and gradient ascent algorithm were simulated to optimize the chirp setting parameters.

25|$|Because <b>ultrasound</b> <b>imaging</b> {{techniques}} do not employ {{ionizing radiation}} to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), {{they are generally}} considered safer {{and are therefore more}} common in obstetrical imaging. The progression of pregnancies can be thoroughly evaluated with less concern about damage from the techniques employed, allowing early detection and diagnosis of many fetal anomalies. Growth can be assessed over time, important in patients with chronic disease or pregnancy-induced disease, and in multiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.). Color-flow Doppler ultrasound measures the severity of peripheral vascular disease and is used by cardiologists for dynamic evaluation of the heart, heart valves and major vessels. Stenosis, for example, of the carotid arteries may be a warning sign for an impending stroke. A clot, embedded deep in one of the inner veins of the legs, can be found via ultrasound before it dislodges and travels to the lungs, resulting in a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism. Ultrasounds is useful as a guide to performing biopsies to minimise damage to surrounding tissues and in drainages such as thoracentesis. Small, portable ultrasound devices now replace peritoneal lavage in trauma wards by non-invasively assessing for the presence of internal bleeding and any internal organ damage. Extensive internal bleeding or injury to the major organs may require surgery and repair.|$|E
