5000|$|Wheel chock [...] - [...] Wheel chocks {{are used}} to {{stabilize}} vehicles resting on their wheels. They can support vehicles of a 10 to 15 percent grade. They are commonly constructed of aluminium, hard rubber, wood, or <b>urethane</b> <b>plastic.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, Canadian American {{architect}} Frank Gehry {{designed a}} new trophy for the tournament. It {{is made from}} a composite alloy of copper and nickel as well as solid cast <b>urethane</b> <b>plastic.</b> The trophy was criticized by the sports community, noting the Toronto Suns headline [...] "What is that?" ...|$|E
50|$|An air mattress, {{also known}} as an airbed or a blow-up bed, is an {{inflatable}} mattress, the majority of which are usually made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), although recently developed textile-reinforced <b>urethane</b> <b>plastic</b> or rubber versions exist. The deflated mattress can be rolled up or folded and carried or stored relatively easily, making them a popular choice for camping trips and for temporary bedding at home for guests. They are inflated either orally by blowing into a valve, or with a manual foot-powered or more commonly inflated via an electric pump. Some are even automatically inflating (up to a certain pressure—some additional inflation is also needed) just by opening the valve. There {{is a kind of}} air beds called lamzac, which can be inflated with a special technique or by the wind without a pump or any other additional device.|$|E
40|$|Mercury {{has been}} in use since time immemorial for medicinal, {{agricultural}} and industrial purposes. It is widely used {{in the manufacture of}} thennometers, fungicides, insecticides, batteries, caustic soda, pulp and paper, <b>urethane</b> <b>plastics</b> and many other purposes. During 1953 to 1961, 43 people ilied and about 113 were affected with mercury poisoning after consuming mercury contaminated fish in Minamata, Japan. In 1960, in Sweden, methyl mercury accumulation in fish and decrease in the population of birds was noticed. This was attributed to the use of methyl mercury dicyanide...|$|R

50|$|The other Tyman {{divisions}} in 2015 were AmesburyTruth (hardware components, extrusions and sealing systems) and ERA (Security).The Schlegel division of Amesbury, located in Rochester, NY, manufactures <b>urethane</b> foam, <b>plastic</b> and textile weatherstripping for {{windows and doors}} in buildings, and products for the transportation and copier industries.|$|R
5000|$|The fiber drums {{referred}} to above will easily hold 180 - 270 kg, and are usually coated internally with a <b>urethane</b> or <b>plastic</b> protective coating. They have steel reinforcement rims at their ends, and are sufficiently strong {{that this is the}} only type of drum that is not reinforced in the middle third, but that is almost certainly due to the difficulty in creating a [...] "vee" [...] rib in a paper layer that essentially spirals out from a single end seam.|$|R
5000|$|Modern shave brushes {{are similar}} in appearance, {{composition}} and function to their centuries-old predecessors. Although {{a variety of different}} materials are still used to fashion shave brush handles, synthetic handles of nylon, <b>urethane</b> or <b>plastic</b> are the most common even by the most expensive shave brush manufacturers. Benefits of synthetic handles include a lesser chance of breakage and resistance to damage by moisture. [...] A limited number of consumers [...] prefer natural materials such as wood or exotic materials such as tortoise shell. A shave brush's handle, regardless of its material composition, rarely affects the overall performance of the brush.|$|R
50|$|Other {{plastics}} may {{be successfully}} engraved, but orderly experimentation on a sample piece is recommended. Bakelite {{is said to}} be easily laser-engraved; some hard engineering plastics work well. Expanded plastics, foams and vinyls however are generally candidates for routing rather than laser engraving. Plastics with a chlorine content (such as vinyl, PVC) produce corrosive chlorine gas when lasered, which combines with Hydrogen in the air to produce vaporized hydrochloric acid which can damage a laser engraving system. <b>Urethane</b> and silicone <b>plastics</b> usually don't work well—unless it is a formulation filled with cellulose, stone or some other stable insulator material.|$|R
50|$|Volumes are an {{extremely}} large type of hold that any variety of holds can be attached to. The volume {{is attached to}} the wall, and it has pre-placed t-nuts in it to which other holds can be attached. Volumes were at one time made from wood, but now they are also made in a variety of materials (including fiberglass, coated wood, resin, <b>urethane,</b> and moulded <b>plastic)</b> by several climbing companies. Volumes are especially prevalent in Europe and on the World Cup circuit, where sometimes entire routes will be constructed from gigantic volumes. To imitate these textured World Cup volumes, sandpaper can be placed on homemade wooden volumes to create texture and allow climbers {{to make use of the}} volume's features.|$|R
5000|$|Latex is a {{synthetic}} rubber {{often used in}} special effects. Foamed latex is sometimes considered the [...] "ultimate in prosthetic appliance." [...] It {{can be used in}} an inflatable bladder effect to make it seem like the actor’s skin is moving or rippling like Rick Baker’s werewolf change effect An American Werewolf in London. This is accomplished by covering an inflatable balloon of some type underneath a covering made of latex, <b>urethane,</b> or <b>plastic</b> molding. Latex {{can also be used to}} make scar effects or other more blatant mutilation. For example, with latex prosthetics, movie makers can make an actor appear to have more or less limbs than he should. They can also make the actor appear to be horribly wounded with flesh hanging and large gashes. To accomplish these tricks, the actor must first have a mold made of the part of him that will be replicated using latex. Take, as an example, one of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead. To make this actor seem to be rotting, they need to make a cast. The technicians prep the area of the body, say the face, to be cast. They must cover the hair and coat the eyebrows, eyelashes, and any other hair that can’t be covered with petroleum jelly. Then they must apply the alginate or other comparable substance, completely covering the molding area, keeping the mouth, nose, or both open for breathing. When that is finished, they layer the area with plaster bandages to create the cast. When all of it has dried and settled, they remove the cast from the actor and put it together again to create the mold. After this, they pour plaster of Paris into the mold to create a cast that is exactly like the actors face. From the cast they can get another mold which they then can use to sculpt any prosthetic attachments they need. This can include fake limbs, fake skin, or growths. It is important to use the a good adhesive to apply the prosthetic. In his book Vincent Kehoe recommends one that is [...] "easy to apply, sets rapidly, be dilutable for use, and be removable with a solvent that is not harmful to the skin.|$|R
