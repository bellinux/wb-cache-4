60|$|I took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> {{again and}} gave another call. There was no reply.|$|E
60|$|Quest hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> {{and rang}} off. Then he turned towards his two assistants.|$|E
60|$|The {{telephone}} bell disturbed his reflection. He rose at {{once and}} took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dredlinton, dazed {{now with}} terror, took his fingers from the bell and {{snatched}} <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>receiver.</b> All <b>the</b> time {{his eyes were}} riveted upon his companion's, their weak depths filled with a nameless horror.|$|R
30|$|However, {{this happens}} less {{frequently}} than the slave read process needs to read {{data from the}} 3 D graphics SoC. Therefore, to resolve this deadlock, we force the master read process to give <b>up</b> <b>the</b> SC <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> SC <b>receiver</b> will record <b>the</b> master read request, and re-request the AHB bus when it is idle. The QEMU will be suspended until this happens.|$|R
5000|$|Many nations' militaries have {{disposed}} of their Bren guns as surplus to their needs. Surplus Brens have been imported to the United States {{for sale to}} collectors, but due to US gun laws restricting the importation of automatic weapons such guns must be legally destroyed by cutting <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receivers.</b> A number of US gunsmiths have manufactured new semiautomatic Brens by welding the pieces of destroyed receivers back together, with modifications to prevent the use of full automatic parts, and fitting new fire-control components capable of only semiautomatic fire. The balance of the parts are surplus Bren parts. Such [...] "semiautomatic machine guns" [...] are legally considered rifles under US Federal law {{and the laws of}} most states.|$|R
60|$|Geraldine {{left her}} place {{at once and}} hastened into the library. She took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{telephone}} bell suddenly interrupted them. Hardy took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> {{and listened}} for a moment.|$|E
60|$|John took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> He {{recognized}} the voice at once--it was Lady Hilda's brother who spoke.|$|E
50|$|In simple terms, {{the edge}} ray {{principle}} states {{that if the}} light rays coming from {{the edges of the}} source are redirected towards the edges of <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> this will ensure that all light rays coming from the inner points in the source will end <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> There is no condition on image formation, the only goal is to transfer the light from the source to the target.|$|R
25|$|Another type of pass is the bounce pass. Here, the passer bounces {{the ball}} crisply {{about two-thirds of}} the way from his own chest to <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> ball strikes the court and bounces <b>up</b> toward <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> bounce pass takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.|$|R
50|$|A {{receiver}} and manager was appointed in July 1923. The company was compulsorily wound <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> Official <b>Receiver</b> in 1927. <b>The</b> Hammersmith Borough Council bought the former Gwynnes Wharf.|$|R
60|$|She hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> thoughtfully, {{paused a}} moment, {{and went back}} to the drawing-room. Brent looked up.|$|E
60|$|The {{telephone}} {{broke in}} once more upon their conversation. Crawshay took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> It was Henshaw speaking.|$|E
60|$|The {{telephone}} {{was on the}} stairs, {{just outside}} her door. She went out and took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mobile phone {{services}} are prepaid. A person finding himself with inadequate prepaid {{time to make}} a call will ring <b>up</b> <b>the</b> intended recipient of the call and hang <b>up</b> immediately. <b>The</b> <b>receiver</b> of <b>the</b> call, hearing the phone ring once and seeing the number, understands himself to have been beeped. Alternatively, it is called being flashed on account of the brief flashing of the screen. The understood message is I wish to talk to you at your expense.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> man picks <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{telephone}} <b>receiver</b> and dials. We {{only hear}} {{his side of}} the following phone conversations. He asks the young lady who answers the phone - he refers to her as “Miss” - to have the doctor call him back. He says that it’s urgent and waits impatiently for the phone to ring.|$|R
50|$|Second, {{the tight}} man bump and run {{technique}} typical of blitz scheme cornerbacks can be defeated with aggressive wide receiver release moves. Once this happens, the cornerback is {{at a disadvantage}} and must regain ground and position quickly to prevent a catch. If the blitz is picked <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> wide <b>receiver</b> can create enough separation to become open relatively quickly.|$|R
60|$|I had finished. I had {{no further}} {{observations}} to make. I hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> and crawled into bed.|$|E
60|$|Sir Henry took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> He {{dropped his}} voice a little, {{although}} it was none the less distinct.|$|E
60|$|Lady Ruth took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> Some {{instinct}} {{seemed to}} have prompted her {{to close the door}} of the study.|$|E
5000|$|Terrell, Wilson, and Cindy Birdsong {{had already}} {{recorded}} {{most of the}} material for the first post-Ross Supremes album, Right On, and Terrell had just been publicly introduced as the newest Supreme, so Wilson refused and threatened to quit if Gordy dropped Terrell. Gordy angrily replied he would [...] "wash his hands of the group", and hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>receiver.</b>|$|R
60|$|Nikasti, {{with a low}} bow, {{watched the}} {{disappearance}} of the lift into which his two new masters, James Van Teyl and Oscar Fischer, had stepped. He waited until the indicator registered its safe arrival on the ground floor. Then he slowly retraced his steps along the corridor, entered the sitting-room, and took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> telephone <b>receiver,</b> which was still lying upon the table.|$|R
50|$|Whereas the Browning SA-22's barrel {{tightening}} {{is accomplished}} with an adjusting ring {{at the base}} of the barrel (and can easily be seen) where it butts <b>up</b> against <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> - <b>the</b> Remington Model 241's barrel tightening mechanism uses a dual-sided nut (with an interrupted-screw thread in the interior and a full thread cut into the exterior) riding inside the threaded hole in the front of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> (only visible when the barrel is separated from <b>the</b> <b>receiver).</b> Selecting how deeply the dual-sided nut sits in <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> (with <b>the</b> dual-sided nut's exterior thread meshing with the thread cut into the hole in the front of <b>the</b> <b>receiver)</b> controls how tightly the barrel fits against <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> when it is attached (the rifle is assembled).|$|R
60|$|The plain-clothes man {{did as he}} was told. Quest took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> {{from his}} {{telephone}} instrument and arranged the phototelesme.|$|E
60|$|Tallente took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> {{and asked}} for Dartrey's number. In half an hour {{he was on his}} way to see him.|$|E
60|$|He hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> and, turning, met {{the pale}} {{eye of the}} long boy, who had propped himself up in the doorway.|$|E
40|$|LIDAR is {{the optical}} {{equivalent}} of RADAR. A LIDAR facility {{has been established}} at Rhodes University using a flashlamp-pumped dye laser as the transmitter and a photomultiplier tube at {{the focus of a}} searchlight mirror as <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> setting <b>up</b> of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and transmitter as well as the design and construction of the photon counting electronics is described. The LIDAR has been used to measure aerosol scattering ratios and temperature profiles in the stratosphere and these results are presented with the algorithms and software used to reduce the data. Finally some recommendations are made for future wor...|$|R
50|$|In a TOFD system, {{a pair of}} {{ultrasonic}} probes sits {{on opposite}} sides of a weld. One of the probes, the transmitter, emits an ultrasonic pulse that is picked <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> probe on the other side, <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> In undamaged pipes, <b>the</b> signals picked <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> probe are from two waves: one that travels along the surface and one that reflects off the far wall. When a crack is present, there is a diffraction of the ultrasonic wave from the tip(s) of the crack. Using the measured time of flight of the pulse, the depth of a crack tips can be calculated automatically by simple trigonometry.|$|R
50|$|The Škorpion is {{equipped}} with open-type iron sights (mechanically adjustable forward post and flip rear sight with 75 and 150 m range notches) and a folding metal wire shoulder stock, which folds <b>up</b> and over <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and is locked on the front sight’s protection capture.|$|R
60|$|She {{heard him}} slam <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> and she leaned there, palpitating, with the queer, vacant {{sounds of the}} {{telephone}} filling her ear.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} was already at the telephone. His hand shook as he took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> He turned to the {{elevator}} boy.|$|E
60|$|She hung <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> quickly, to {{cut short}} a fresh {{outburst}} of protest. And {{as she turned}} away a voice spoke behind her.|$|E
50|$|The Model 24 uses {{a barrel}} {{tightening}} method (needed {{due to the}} takedown nature of the design in which the barrel can be separated from <b>the</b> <b>receiver)</b> that {{is very close to}} that of the Browning SA-22. That tightening method uses an adjusting ring on {{the lower end of the}} barrel where it presses <b>up</b> against <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> <b>The</b> Model 241 uses a different method of tightening the barrel to <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> (a dual-sided nut with an interrupted-screw threading rides inside the opening in the front of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> and, by selecting how deeply the nut sits in <b>the</b> <b>receiver,</b> it controls how tightly the barrel fits against <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> when <b>the</b> barrel is fitted to <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> This mechanism of the Model 241 is not visible unless the barrel is separated from <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> so that <b>the</b> opening in the front of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> can be viewed).|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a cheap-talk setting that mimics {{the situation where}} an incumbent firm (the sender) is endowed with incentives to understate the true size of the market demand to two potential entrants (<b>the</b> <b>receivers).</b> Although our experimental data reveals that senders' messages convey truthful information and this is picked <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receivers,</b> this overcommunication (relative to standard theoretical prediction) does not enhance efficient entry levels (and payoffs) to beyond what can be achieved without any communication. The reason is that receivers fail to optimally translate the information received in their entry decision, possibly due to overcautiousness...|$|R
40|$|A {{microwave}} emitter "E" that produces 3 -cm microwaves is fixed in space, and a receiver "R" {{is mounted on}} a rotating platform, as shown in Figure 1. A bar graph of red light-emitting diodes located in front of <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> provides a graph of length proportional to the intensity of <b>the</b> signal picked <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>receiver.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> is {{directly in front of}} the emitter, the bar graph indicates a strong signal; as <b>the</b> <b>receiver</b> is rotated away from a line {{directly in front of the}} emitter the signal decreases, as indicated in the video by the length of the bar graph. The microwave beam can be blocked by a metal sheet, as shown in the video...|$|R
