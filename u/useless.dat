5|$|President Thomas Jefferson and his Republican party opposed {{a strong}} navy, arguing that small gunboats {{in the major}} harbors were all the nation needed to defend itself. They proved <b>useless</b> in wartime.|$|E
5|$|After this, Khrushchev {{made many}} desperate {{attempts}} to reconstitute the Sino-Soviet alliance, but Mao considered it <b>useless</b> and denied any proposal. The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled {{out in an}} intra-communist propaganda war. Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement.|$|E
5|$|In a side plot, Olivia and Sam Weiss {{continue}} {{to meet at}} the bowling alley, where he subjects her to seemingly menial tasks like tying her shoes and keeping score during games. Although initially finding their conversations <b>useless,</b> he cures Olivia's inability to walk without a cane {{by the end of}} the episode.|$|E
5|$|In spiking {{the guns}} at the Red House battery, the Americans had {{accomplished}} {{the more important}} of their two objectives: an invading force could now land between Chippawa and Fort Erie without facing artillery fire. However, subsequent events would render their service <b>useless.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{academic}} sources {{maintain that}} the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so vague as to render them <b>useless</b> as evidence of any genuine predictive power.|$|E
5|$|Old {{scientific}} {{data do not}} distinguish between the two species, making it <b>useless</b> for determining structural differences between them. The IUCN lists both species as data deficient on their Red List of endangered species because of this issue.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the Ripper murders, the police, newspapers, and others {{received}} hundreds of letters regarding the case. Some were well-intentioned offers of advice for catching the killer, but the vast majority were <b>useless.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Conqueror-class {{monitors}} were enlarged {{versions of}} HMS Rupert with improvements based on suggestions {{from one of}} Ruperts captains. The <b>useless</b> foremast was removed, and breech-loading guns and heavier compound armour were added. The rear superstructure was enlarged to better accommodate the crew and secondary armament. Six 14-inch torpedo tubes were fitted above water.|$|E
5|$|Today, shetland sheep {{are mainly}} {{kept in the}} Shetland isles {{and a handful of}} other locales. This is because of their ability to survive on {{infertile}} land that would otherwise be agriculturally <b>useless.</b> Their good-natured temperament is also a major attraction in keeping Shetland sheep. They are most commonly farmed for their prized wool, but they also may be kept for their meat.|$|E
5|$|A major {{stimulus}} {{to improving the}} accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually <b>useless</b> on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} new {{sketches}} were also added, including Sweaty Betty's Burger Bar and QCV' (Quite Cheap Value), a parody of the shopping channel QVC which saw Cawood and Suttie as fictitious presenters Hilary and Ursula, two garishly dressed middle aged women with a strong dislike for each other who would try to promote a <b>useless</b> product whilst making snide digs at each other underneath forced smiles and insincere laughter.|$|E
5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were left standing. All four schools and medical buildings were destroyed, with nearly all medical supplies being washed away. Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of the coconut trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut crop to return to normal. Banana and breadfruit trees were temporarily <b>useless,</b> though they were in recoverable statuses.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} commandos came up against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} patrols mounted on the tanks of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which rendered the tanks <b>useless</b> and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E
5|$|Ali is Baba's servant, a Hazara {{believed}} to be Hassan's father. In his youth, Baba's father adopted him after his parents were killed by a drunk driver. Before {{the events of the}} novel, Ali had been struck with polio, rendering his right leg <b>useless.</b> Because of this, Ali is constantly tormented by children in the town. He is later killed by a land mine in Hazarajat.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1942, German flak commanders had already {{concluded}} that AAA would be essentially <b>useless</b> against jet aircraft, and began development of guided missiles {{to fill this}} role. Most forces reached the same conclusion soon after, with both the US and UK starting missile development programs before the war ended. The UK's Green Mace {{was one of the}} last attempts to develop a useful high-altitude AAA weapon, but its development ended in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Commercially navigable only at its mouth, the Saw Mill River {{itself was}} <b>useless</b> {{as a way}} to bring crops to market, {{limiting}} settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between a bend in the river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in Canada, a 'runway plough', {{assembled}} in Scotland, survives at Eglinton Country Park. It {{was purchased by}} the army in World War II to rip up aerodrome runways and railway lines if an invasion took place as means of causing disruption, making them <b>useless</b> to the occupying forces. It was used at the old Eglinton Estate, which had been commandeered by the army, to provide its army operators with the necessary experience. It was hauled by a powerful Foden Trucks tractor, possibly via a pulley and cable system.|$|E
5|$|Freeze tells Batman that he {{has created}} a cure, but it is {{rendered}} <b>useless</b> via instability. Batman deduces that the restorative properties of Ra's al Ghul's blood can complete the cure and tracks one of his assassins to his underground lair, leading Batman into a confrontation with Ra's and his daughter Talia, Batman's former lover. With Ra's al Ghul's blood, Freeze {{is able to develop}} an antidote, but it is stolen by Harley Quinn before Batman can use it. When Batman returns to the Joker, he finds his health has been restored.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 Einstein {{postulated}} {{from the}} outset that {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived the special theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuum c featured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) <b>useless</b> and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016 the Bild {{newspaper}} {{revealed that}} the newsest upgrade of the ASSTA suite to version 3.1, which includes color multifunctional LCD screens in place of monochrome CRT displays, is interferring with helmet-mounted nigh-vision optical displays worn by pilots, rendering German Tornado bombers deployed to Syria <b>useless</b> for night missions. The defense ministry admitted that bright cockpit lights could be a distraction for pilots, and disclosed that the solution will be implemented in a few weeks, but denied the need to fly night missions in Syria.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the anti-terrorism {{industry}} offered bullet-proof vehicles, bugging {{devices and}} security hardware, so Mardas set up companies offering these products to VIPs. King Hussein of Jordan bought {{a fleet of}} cars that Mardas had customised, but then reportedly had the changes reversed when tests demonstrated them to be <b>useless.</b> In 1987, Mardas was a managing director of Alcom Ltd, which specialised in electronic communications and security. He later returned to Greece.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 40, Octavian and Antony {{approved}} the Treaty of Brundisium, by which Lepidus would remain in Africa, Antony in the East, Octavian in the West. The Italian peninsula was left open to all for the recruitment of soldiers, but in reality, this provision was <b>useless</b> for Antony in the East. To further cement relations of alliance with Mark Antony, Octavian gave his sister, Octavia Minor, in marriage to Antony in late 40BC. During their marriage, Octavia gave birth to two daughters (known as Antonia the Elder and Antonia Minor).|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, Franciscan missionaries argued that further {{attempts}} at peaceful pacification of the Ch'ol were <b>useless</b> and argued for armed intervention against the Manche Ch'ol and their Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours. The Manche were forcibly relocated in the Guatemalan Highlands, {{where they did}} not prosper. By 1770, most of the Manche Ch'ol were extinct. The few survivors were soon absorbed into the surrounding Q'eqch'i Maya population.|$|E
5|$|King Matthias' all {{attempts}} to secure his son's succession to the throne proved to be <b>useless</b> shortly after his death. The prelates and the barons elected Vladislaus II Jagiellon king on 15 July 1490. He retained his domains and the Duchy of Troppau. The new monarch bestowed the title of Duke of Slavonia upon him, but he renounced of it in 1495. He also renounced of the Duchy of Troppau in 1501.|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political power, but she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately <b>useless.</b> Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{peculiar}} fact {{associated with the}} episode was a letter by Senator Hillary Clinton and Representative John M. McHugh addressed to show character Josh Lyman, concerning the closing of an upstate New York army base. Josh {{points out that the}} deep-snow training base of Fort Drum is relatively <b>useless</b> in a time when most wars take place in desert terrain. Clinton and McHugh wrote a tongue-in-cheek response pointing out flaws in Lyman’s reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Salinger then accompanies Wexler to Istanbul, where Skarssen {{is buying}} the crucial {{components}} from their only other manufacturer. Salinger attempts {{to record the}} conversation {{so that he can}} obstruct the deal by proving to the buyers that the missiles will be <b>useless,</b> but he ultimately fails. Both Wexler and Skarssen are then killed by a hitman contracted by Enzo and Mario Calvini to avenge their father's murder by the bank. Salinger is left stunned, his investigation, pursuit, and determination to bring down the IBBC, have led him to nothing.|$|E
5|$|Setting {{up her own}} {{publishing}} house Marsden House, Karen is relying on <b>useless</b> Ramona as personal assistant. Adam is determined to take things one step further with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on his feet as a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{conflict}} on {{the number}} of torpedo tubes originally included in the ships, but it is clear they were located on the berth deck and had above-water ports located on the extreme front and aft and midships. Located too close to the waterline to allow use while moving and vulnerable to gunfire when opened, they were considered <b>useless</b> and were quickly reduced in number, and removed entirely before 1908.|$|E
5|$|Spider-Man {{enters the}} lizard room where Connors has taken refuge. Connors knocks {{him out and}} Eddie arrives to help him out. When he regains consciousness, Spider-Man {{comes up with a}} plan to trick him into the polar bear pond. They almost succeed when Connors is alerted by Spider-Man's {{cellphone}} ringing. Billy then arrives and tries to talk some sense into his father, but it is <b>useless</b> and Spider-Man leaps in to get Connors into the pond. Spider-Man pours the cleanser into the mouth of Connors who, as a result, returns to normal, his arm lost once more.|$|E
5|$|The French {{opened fire}} on the forts of Salé at 10:00a.m., and the Moroccans retaliated {{instantly}} with forty batteries of artillery weapons. An hour into the confrontation, the batteries in Salé were destroyed, and the artillery in Rabat were damaged to a level that they became almost <b>useless.</b> The French fire intensified, but at 3:30p.m., the damaged batteries {{were removed from the}} city by Moroccan forces; however, resistance did not stop until 5:00p.m. Sané and Gomer, lacking for ammunition, withdrew from the battle, while Henri IV continued its barrage on the city until 7:00a.m. the next morning.|$|E
5|$|The {{failures}} of these titles were further compounded by Atari's business dealings from 1981. Confident in strong sales, {{the company had}} told its distributors to place their 1982 orders all at once. However, video game sales in 1982 had slowed, and distributors who had ordered en masse in expectation of high turnover were left to simply return large quantities of unsold stock to Atari. As a result, the company soon found itself in possession of several million essentially <b>useless</b> video game cartridges, which it would be entirely unable to sell.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Belgium by Nazi Germany started on 10 May 1940 under the codename Fall Gelb ("Case Yellow") {{as part of}} the wider {{invasion of}} France, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The Belgian Albert Canal fortifications, some of the most modern defensive networks in Europe, proved almost <b>useless.</b> At Eben-Emael, the fort held by 1,200 Belgians was taken when the Germans deployed 500 glider-borne Fallschirmjäger against them, opening the border for Blitzkrieg-style warfare. Almost all of the air force's modern Hurricane fighters were also destroyed by the Luftwaffe on the ground at Schaffen airfield on May 10.|$|E
5|$|The largely outnumbered {{defenders}} of Medina, mainly Muslims led by Islamic prophet Muhammad, dug a trench on {{the suggestion of}} Salman Farsi, which together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) <b>useless,</b> locking the two sides in a stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Muslim-allied Medinan Jews, Banu Qurayza, to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organised defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} armed with four 30-calibre BL 13.5-inch Mk I–IV guns in two twin gun turrets, one each {{fore and aft}} of the superstructure. Each gun was {{provided}} with 80 shells per gun. Hoods secondary armament consisted of ten 40-calibre 6-inch Mk I-III guns mounted in casemates in the superstructure. A major problem with the four of these guns mounted on the upper deck {{was that they were}} mounted low in the ship and were unusable at high speed or in heavy weather. They were removed as <b>useless</b> in 1904. The ship carried 200 rounds for each gun.|$|E
5|$|Though the Pacific {{electric}} ray will feed at any hour, it responds to prey {{much more quickly}} at night than during the day. Most prey captures occur in darkness or turbid conditions, when its eyes are largely <b>useless.</b> Instead, it relies on electroreception via its ampullae of Lorenzini to locate food. Experiments in the field have shown that it will attack artificially generated electric fields and conductive metal electrodes. Mechanical sensory cues, detected via the lateral line, also play an important role: this species has been observed preferentially attacking faster-moving prey even if a closer food item was available.|$|E
