5|$|With Ore {{still not}} fully {{recovered}} from his injury and two inexperienced {{players on the}} Georgia side, {{it appeared that the}} teams' passing offenses would have to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> Virginia Tech's Eddie Royal, with 452receivingyards, led both teams in receiving yardage coming into the game. Georgia's receiving corps was led by wide receiver Mohammed Massaquoi and tight end Martrez Milner. Massaquoi caught 28passes for 348yards and two touchdowns coming into the game, while Milner had 27receptions for 376yards and twotouchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{hampered}} the wing's {{activities in}} January 1945. No.1 Squadron was withdrawn to Queensland to re-equip with Mosquitos, with No.13 Squadron, flying Venturas, taking <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> on anti-shipping missions. The squadron accounted for around {{half of the}} thirty-eight enemy vessels sunk by No.79 Wing in February, and a similar ratio to the twenty sunk the following month. Wing operations were cut back in March, as preparations were made to transfer the Mitchells to Jacquinot Bay in New Britain. On 6April, all twenty available aircraft of Nos.2 and 18 Squadrons were ordered to join B-24 Liberators of No.82 Wing in an assault on a Japanese convoy that included the cruiser Isuzu. The Liberators were late for their rendezvous with the Mitchells off Sumba so the latter, at the very limit of their range, attacked the convoy regardless. They claimed two direct hits without loss, despite anti-aircraft fire from the cruiser and other ships, and frontal attacks by enemy fighters. Allied submarines sank the damaged Isuzu the next day.|$|E
25|$|Pashkin — Chairman of {{the local}} trade union. He {{frequently}} urges the group to work harder and later brings in former bureaucrats to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> Pashkin once went through a long court trial in which his patriotism and ethnicity, specifically due to {{the name of his}} father, Leon Ilych, were questioned.|$|E
5000|$|On {{bicycles}} with fixed chain-lines, no {{chain tensioner}} is required, eliminating a part that could otherwise become damaged in rough terrain- an advantage for off-road cyclists. Where a tensioner is required, a short cage is usually sufficient to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> chain <b>slack.</b>|$|R
50|$|Small {{groups are}} more {{cohesive}} than large groups. This is often caused by social loafing, {{a theory that}} says individual {{members of a group}} will actually put in less effort, because they believe other members will make <b>up</b> for <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> It has been found that social loafing is eliminated when group members believe their individual performances are identifiable - much more the case in smaller groups.|$|R
5000|$|To [...] "sweat" [...] the halyard {{is to take}} as much slack out of it as possible. This may be {{done with}} a winch, or {{manually}}. To manually sweat a halyard, the sweater grasps the line and, in a fluid motion, hauls it laterally towards himself, then down toward the deck, letting <b>the</b> tailer take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> new <b>slack.</b>|$|R
25|$|The United States of America took <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> as the French departed, {{setting up}} the Programs Evaluation Office as a sub rosa {{military}} mission in January 1954. It supplied 100 instructors to replace the departing French mentors. It also supplied six C-47s, two DHC L-20s, and two L-19 Bird Dogs. They also began airfield construction throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|The Wankel {{design is}} used in the seat belt {{pre-tensioner}} system in some Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen cars. When the deceleration sensors detect a potential crash, small explosive cartridges are triggered electrically, and the resulting pressurized gas feeds into tiny Wankel engines which rotate to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> in the seat belt systems, anchoring the driver and passengers firmly in the seat before a collision.|$|E
25|$|Keynes' {{basic idea}} was simple: {{to keep people}} fully employed, governments have to run deficits {{when the economy is}} slowing, as the private sector would not invest enough to keep {{production}} at the normal level and bring the economy out of recession. Keynesian economists called on governments during times of economic crisis to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> by increasing government spending and/or cutting taxes.|$|E
5000|$|Cynthia Johnson {{was already}} {{decreasing}} her {{involvement with the}} group, with Melanie Rosales and Margie Cox picking <b>up</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> and later becoming lead vocalists. Johnson left for good in 1983 after three albums. Lipps Inc. released one more album before breaking up in 1985. Greenberg eventually moved into web design in 1992 until 2007.|$|R
2500|$|A single set trigger {{is usually}} one trigger {{that may be}} fired with a {{conventional}} amount of trigger pull weight or may be [...] "set" [...] – usually by pushing forward on the trigger, or by pushing forward on a small lever attached {{to the rear of}} the trigger. This takes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> trigger <b>slack</b> (or otherwise called take-up) in the trigger and allows for a much lighter trigger pull. This is colloquially known as a hair trigger.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{derailleur}} gears the chain is usually long enough {{so that it can}} be shifted onto the largest front chain ring and the largest rear sprocket without jamming, and not so long that, when shifted onto the smallest front chain ring and the smallest rear sprocket, the rear derailleur cannot take <b>up</b> all <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> Meeting both these requirements is only possible if the rear derailleur is compatible with the gear range being used on the bike. It is broadly accepted as inadvisable to actually use the large/large and small/small gear combinations due to chain stress and wear.|$|R
25|$|Scully {{also contributed}} to the network's tennis and PGA Tour golf {{coverage}} in the late 1970s and early 1980s, usually working the golf events with Pat Summerall, Ken Venturi, and Ben Wright. From 1975 to 1982, {{he was part of the}} team that covered the Masters tournament for CBS. Scully's network commitments led to his working a reduced schedule with the Dodgers, who hired Ross Porter to help pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b>|$|E
25|$|His {{theory of}} asabiyyah {{has often been}} {{compared}} to modern Keynesian economics, with Ibn Khaldun's theory clearly containing {{the concept of the}} multiplier. A crucial difference, however, is that whereas for John Maynard Keynes it is the middle class's greater propensity to save that is to blame for economic depression, for Ibn Khaldun it is the governmental propensity to save at times when investment opportunities do not take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> which leads to aggregate demand.|$|E
25|$|As {{the piston}} moves in and out, the seal drags and {{stretches}} on the piston, causing the seal to twist. The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of a millimeter. The piston {{is allowed to}} move out freely, but the slight amount of drag caused by the seal stops the piston from fully retracting to its previous position when the brakes are released, and so takes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> caused by the wear of the brake pads, {{eliminating the need for}} return springs.|$|E
60|$|You {{can never}} tell with restaurants. What kills one makes another. I've {{no doubt that}} if we had chucked out a good {{customer}} from the Guelph {{that would have been the}} end of the place. But it only seemed to do MacFarland's good. I guess it gave just that touch to the place which made the nuts think that this was real Bohemia. Come to think of it, it does give a kind of charm to a place, if you feel that at any moment the feller at the next table to you may be gathered <b>up</b> by <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> of his trousers and slung into the street.|$|R
50|$|With a good rod {{and decent}} mono or flurocarbon line, the 'thump' of a bass should be easily felt on limp line. After the first 'thump', {{wait a second}} {{to see if there}} is a second one as he sucks the worm in further. At this point, or if there is no second 'thump' after a second or so, draw <b>up</b> most of <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> and set <b>the</b> hook HARD AND FAST. This is {{important}} to set the hook. Then hold steady tension on the fish until landed.|$|R
50|$|From 1959 to 1964, black {{students}} in Prince Edward County {{had to go to}} school elsewhere or forgo their education altogether. Some got schooling by living with relatives in nearby communities or at makeshift schools the community created in church basements. Others were educated out of state with funds raised by groups such as the Society of Friends (Quakers). In the final year (1963-1964), the NAACP-sponsored Prince Edward Free School picked <b>up</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> by educating some of the black youth who had been unable to leave the county to attend public schools elsewhere.|$|R
25|$|The law of {{accelerating}} returns is {{the basis}} for all of these speculations about creating a digital brain. It explains why computational capacity will continue to increase unabated even after Moore's Law expires, which Kurzweil predicts will happen around 2020. Integrated circuits, the current method of creating computer chips, will fade from the limelight, while some new more advanced technology will pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> It is this new technology that will get us to the massive levels of computation needed to create an artificial brain.|$|E
25|$|Iowa's offense proved unstoppable as Fred Russell and Jermelle Lewis {{combined}} for 293 of the Hawkeyes' 376 rushing yards. Quarterback Brad Banks was steady in his debut, completing {{five of his}} eight passes, two for touchdowns. Wide receiver Mo Brown was {{on the receiving end}} of both of Banks' touchdowns. The defense was suspect at times (nearly 300 passing yards by Akron), but linebacker Kevin Worthy picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> with a 72-yard fumble return for a touchdown. Iowa's 37 points in the first quarter was a school record for points in a single quarter.|$|E
25|$|The Bengals forced three interceptions, {{and allowed}} only 45 rushing yards and 136 passing yards, while their offense held {{the ball for}} 39:29. Bills {{starting}} running back Thurman Thomas was held to just six yards on four carries, while quarterback Jim Kelly completed only 14 of 30 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown, with three interceptions. The Bills had only 10 first downs, one more than the AFC Championship record for the fewest amount ever, and failed to convert any of their 10 third down conversion attempts. Just like their previous game, the Bengals did not get much of a performance from NFL MVP Boomer Esiason, who completed only 11 of 20 passes for 94 yards, with a touchdown and two interceptions. But once again, their running game was able to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> gaining 175 yards on the ground, 102 {{yards and two touchdowns}} coming from fullback Ickey Woods.|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} {{of health insurance}} in California changed dramatically {{after two years of}} high unemployment, from 2009 to 2011. According to data from the annual California Health Interview Survey, just under half of all nonelderly Californians in 2011 were insured through their own or a family member's job-based coverage. Nearly seven million children and adults were uninsured for {{all or part of the}} prior year, and almost four million of those had no insurance at all for the entire year or longer. The Medi-Cal and Healthy Families programs picked <b>up</b> much of <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> for private insurance, covering one in five nonelderly Californians...|$|R
5000|$|Problems worsened in 1929 {{with the}} start of the great depression, but Metrovick's {{overseas}} sales were able to pick <b>up</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> notably a major railway electrification project in Brazil. By 1933 world trade was growing again, but growth was nearly upset when six Metrovick engineers were arrested and found guilty of espionage and [...] "wrecking" [...] in Moscow after a number of turbines built by the company in and for the Soviet Union proved to be faulty. The British government intervened; the engineers were released and trade with Russia was resumed after a brief embargo.|$|R
50|$|To {{add to the}} new {{fresh air}} passing through the club, the team now donned a newlook jumper. For over 100 years, the Magpies had worn a jumper with black stripes on a white background. Now, it was reversed, the players wearing a black back on their jumper with a white number, and the colours of each stripe were reversed. The year began brightly, with some {{promising}} showings in the Ansett Cup morphing into some heartening displays in the real season, with the youth, {{in the form of}} Shane O’Bree, Paul Licuria and Tarkyn Lockyer picking <b>up</b> much of <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> from Buckley in the midfield.|$|R
25|$|By the 1580s, whaling was in decline, as ships {{returned}} to port half empty. This decade also {{coincided with the}} period when the king needed Spanish Basque ships for his armadas. The trade was particularly affected in 1586, 1587, and 1588, when Spanish Basque ships and sailors were detained {{in preparation for the}} 1588 armada against England. The threat of such detentions continued to undermine Spanish Basque whaling into the 1590s and early 1600s. Although whale stocks may {{have had a chance to}} increase in the 1590s and early 1600s with the diminution of the Spanish Basque fleet, it appears the French Basques may have taken <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> of their counterparts of northeastern Spain. In April 1602, Saint-Jean-de-Luz alone sent seven ships to carry out whaling in Terranova. Other factors, such as attacks by hostile Inuit (which, according to parish records, resulted in at least three instances of fatalities between 1575 and 1618), piratical attacks by the English and Dutch, and the opening of the Spitsbergen fishery (see below) may have also played a part in the decline.|$|E
25|$|Back home in Nashville on December 13, the Predators {{fell into}} a three-goal hole {{by the start of}} the second period against St. Louis thanks to Brad Hunt, Ryan Reaves and Kevin Shattenkirk. The Predators – with goals by Fisher (who scored two goals), Forsberg, Johansen, Neal and Ribeiro – rallied with six {{unanswered}} goals to defeat the Blues 6–3 on December 13. Two nights later, Nashville, with goals from Ellis and Fisher, held Minnesota to a one-goal lead through the third period. As the Wild's offense sputtered through the final two periods, however, former Predators goalie Devan Dubnyk picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> with 34 saves and the Wild, thanks to two empty net goals, beat the Predators 5–2. Capping the week on December 17 against the New York Rangers, the Predators tied the score with a second period goal by team captain Fisher, but their miserable run in overtime continued as former Predator Jimmy Vesey scored the first goal in the shootout, and the Rangers won 2–1.|$|E
25|$|Assigning jobs in occupations {{that women}} had never held before was a {{daunting}} task. By social custom, working {{women did not}} work in the trades and rarely supervised men. Women worked mainly in offices, classrooms, hospitals, retail stores, libraries, and beauty shops. In 1943, Marine Corps manpower was in short supply, but members of the WR were available to pick <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> However, the corps had to select, train, classify, and assign the women to jobs where they could contribute and {{do so in the}} shortest amount of time. After completing their Marine Corps indoctrination training, selected women received advanced schooling in a variety of specialties. By {{the end of the war}} 9,641 members of the WR had attended more than 30 specialist schools run by higher educational institutions, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. Colonel Streeter's philosophy was to let them try anything, except heavy lifting and combat. The WR strength on 1June 1945 was 17,672. Of this number 1,342 were engaged in occupations classified as professional or semi-professional; 10,279 in clerical; 741 in sales; 587 in services; 344 in skilled trades; 1,305 as semi-skilled; 14 as unskilled; 35 as students; and 6 as unaccounted for. Marine Corps recruiting literature indicated there were over 200 types of jobs available in the WR. While this may have been correct, the fact was that well over half the women were assigned to and worked in clerical fields. The first duty posts and stations for the WR included places such as Washington, D.C.; New York; Philadelphia; Chicago; San Diego; and Quantico, Virginia. Marine aviation was the fastest-growing unit of the Corps. Both officers and enlisted women served at Marine Corps Air Stations including Cherry Point and Edenton, North Carolina; Paris Island, South Carolina; El Centro, El Toro, Mojave, and Santa Barbara, California.|$|E
50|$|Women's clubs spread {{very rapidly}} after 1890, taking <b>up</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> left by <b>the</b> {{decline of the}} WCTU and the temperance movement. Local clubs at first were mostly reading groups focused on literature, but {{increasingly}} became civic improvement organizations of middle-class women meeting in each other's homes weekly. To The clubs avoided controversial issues that would divide the membership, especially religion and the prohibition issue. In the South and East, suffrage was also highly divisive, while there was little resistance to it among clubwomen in the West. In the Midwest, clubwomen had first avoided the suffrage issue out of caution, but after 1900 increasingly came to support it.|$|R
50|$|Right {{behind the}} Bullets in the NBA's East Division were the resurgent 76ers. Jack Ramsay, a legendary local product himself, {{was now the}} coach. With Wilt gone, Ramsay turned to Billy Cunningham as a team leader. Cunningham was third in the NBA in scoring and tenth in rebounds. An {{aggressive}} defender, Cunningham also led the NBA in personal fouls. Guard Hal Greer also picked <b>up</b> some of <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> <b>The</b> 32-year-old speedster added 23.1 points per game and five assists to help the NBA's highest scoring offense. The team had gained some bench depth with the Wilt trade from the Lakers, but also lost big man Luke Jackson to injury after 25 games. Like the Bullets, they would be hampered at playoff time.|$|R
60|$|Later on we {{returned}} to Malu, picked up seven recruits, hove up anchor, and started to beat out the treacherous entrance. The wind was chopping about, the current upon the ugly point of reef setting strong. Just as {{we were on the}} verge of clearing it and gaining open sea, the wind broke off four points. The Minota attempted to go about, but missed stays. Two of her anchors had been lost at Tulagi. Her one remaining anchor was let go. Chain was let out to give it a hold on the coral. Her fin keel struck bottom, and her main topmast lurched and shivered as if about to come down upon our heads. She fetched <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> of <b>the</b> anchors at the moment a big comber smashed her shoreward. The chain parted. It was our only anchor. The Minota swung around on her heel and drove headlong into the breakers.|$|R
500|$|On 1January 1985, in {{preparation}} for the introduction of the McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet to Australian service, No.77 Squadron took over all Mirages and Macchi MB-326s of No.2 Operational Conversion Unit, assuming responsibility for fighter combat instructor, introductory fighter, and Mirage conversion courses. The transfer swelled the squadron's strength to fifty-six aircraft—forty Mirages and sixteen Macchis—and over 500 officers and men, making it the largest operational unit in the RAAF. Along with a heavily expanded training program, and its existing Australian Army close support role, No.77 Squadron's fleet support commitment was increased to take <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack</b> resulting from the diminution of the Royal Australian Navy's fixed-wing capability. [...] Its last fatal accident with the Mirage occurred on 2May 1986; the aircraft crashed into water during air-to-air gunnery practice.|$|E
500|$|Taylor's most {{productive}} season was 1962. With Hornung missing {{most of the}} season due to injury, Taylor picked <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack.</b> He set a league record by scoring 19 touchdowns and won the NFL rushing title with 1,474yards, notable for being the only season in which Jim Brown did not lead the league during his nine-year career. He became the third player in NFL history to lead the league in both rushing yards and total points scored, following Steve Van Buren and Brown. He was named the [...] "Player of the Year" [...] by the AP, and was also awarded the Jim Thorpe Trophy by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) as the NFL's players' choice for league MVP. He earned first-team All-Pro honors from the AP, UPI, and NEA.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic {{felt that}} the {{reworking}} of Madonna's older hits like [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and [...] "Holiday" [...] gave them a campy, Eurotrash feel like the songs on Confessions on a Dance Floor; he added that [...] " [...] help give the disc a cohesive feel even if the live performance, like the album it's hawking, is kind of humorless. That said, as Madonna's first live CD, I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining, {{and even if the}} excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours, it's also quite well done." [...] Sterdan from Jam! complimented the CD section of the release, saying that [...] "Thankfully, the CD takes <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>slack,</b> delivering more than an hour of newer fare like 'American Life' and 'Music', peppered with oldies like 'Vogue', 'Holiday' and 'Like a Prayer'. Next time Madonna wants to share a secret, she should just leave the cameras at home." [...] Conversely, Sébastien Chicoine from Canoe.ca website preferred the DVD over the CD, saying that the disc was not [...] "absolutely necessary" [...] but could understand the business logic behind adding the CD to the release.|$|E
500|$|Griese had one {{touchdown}} and 254yards on 19 of 26 passing. Howard had 100yards on 26 carries, including two touchdowns. Floyd added 66 yards on just six carries.
