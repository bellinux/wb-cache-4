5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect <b>us.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud because we were forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E
25|$|He says {{religion}} has always stopped the philosophers and scientists from gaining knowledge because the Christian religion {{is opposed to}} any knowledge that differs from Biblical knowledge. Hedgel is indifferent to what the Bible says. He writes in his Philosophy of Religion If at the present day philosophy be an object of enmity because it occupies itself with religion, this cannot really surprise <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> consider the general character of the time. Every one who attempts to take {{to do with the}} knowledge of God, and by the aid of thought to comprehend His nature, must be prepared to find, that either no attention will be paid to him, or that people will turn against him and combine to oppose him. The more the knowledge of finite things has increased and the increase is so great that the extension of the sciences has become almost boundless, and all regions of knowledge are enlarged to an extent which makes a comprehensive view impossible so much the more has the sphere of the knowledge of God become contracted.|$|E

500|$|During the {{following}} US tour, the new management of Columbia Records, {{which had been}} sold to Sony Music in 1988, terminated Columbia's almost 20-year relationship with Blue Öyster Cult because of their low sales. This left them without a recording contract {{for the next ten}} years. Eric Bloom stated that [...] "in general, CBS was straight with <b>us,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had fans working inside the company", but after [...] "3-4 different Presidents of the company came and went" [...] the commercial appeal of Blue Öyster Cult had disappeared for the new management.|$|E
500|$|Killen {{said that}} writing the pilot episode's script {{was one of}} the more-difficult {{components}} of creating the show. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result they created outlines, distinguishing the separate realities with green or red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. Stating that things are [...] "initially confusing to <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are just trying to break story," [...] he hoped that when viewers watched the pilot episode, they would be immediately oriented in the reality on screen at the time.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Pearl Jam's legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, [...] "I think {{at some point}} along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people {{something}} to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this... The answers weren’t always easy, but I think we found a way." ...|$|E

He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are just trying to break story, I think by the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear where you are that all of the little tricks that we needed sort of go away. And hopefully when you see it on the screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the series, Bobrov {{held a press}} luncheon in Moscow. He {{refused to}} {{consider}} that either team would sweep the series. To him, Team Canada had [...] "the fire power, know-how and goaltending", but how would it adapt to international rules, two-referee system and amateur officials? He conceded that Phil Esposito would [...] "be difficult {{to move from the}} front of the net. I expect there will be some surprises for <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> meet your Canadian stars." [...] He also predicted that Valeri Kharlamov [...] "will stand out, even against your best Canadians. By North American standards, he is small but he has an excellent shot. I think he will be effective." [...] Sinden was aware of Kharlamov and he selected Ron Ellis to the Team Canada roster especially to cover Kharlamov.|$|E

500|$|Following their Edinburgh Fringe shows, {{the group}} enjoyed {{considerable}} {{success in the}} United Kingdom, making appearances on numerous BBC comedy shows. In 1988, the group was nominated for the Perrier Comedy Award for their performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Fidler says that the British people were more receptive to their act at the time than Australians had been. [...] "The whole thing exploded for <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> got there, it was quite incredible. Within {{a very short time}} we were doing national television appearances in front of millions of people and playing these enormous shows," [...] he says. They played extensively in Canada, Germany, America and Britain, and finished their time in Britain by appearing on the final episode of the successful Friday Night Live. However, despite the acclaim they were receiving overseas, when they returned to Australia at the end of 1988 they remained unknown. Upon arriving in Melbourne, they struggled to gain a following and went back to busking on the streets.|$|E
500|$|Having {{fulfilled}} {{their creative}} intentions with The Revival, Tony! Toni! Toné! wanted {{to pay homage}} to their musical influences with Sons of Soul. In a 1993 interview for The New York Times, Wiggins elaborated on their direction for the album, stating [...] "We're paying homage to a lot of older artists who paved the way for us artists like the Temptations, Sly and the Family Stone, Earth, Wind and Fire. They're the people who inspired <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were growing up, people like Aretha Franklin, James Brown. We feel we're the sons of everything and all those people who came before us." [...] He also explained the album's title as a declaration of them being descendants of those artists, [...] "not in a grandiose sense, but from the standpoint that we really are the musical offspring of all that's come before us... paying homage to our past, but creating in a contemporary environment." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{institution}} of the draft and the arrest of outspoken anti-administration Democrat Clement Vallandigham further incensed Pierce, who gave an address to New Hampshire Democrats in July 1863 vilifying Lincoln. [...] "Who, I ask, has clothed the President with power to dictate {{to any one of}} <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> must or when we may speak, or be silent upon any subject, and especially in relation to the conduct of any public servant?", he demanded. Pierce's comments were ill-received in much of the North, especially as his criticism of Lincoln's aims coincided with the twin Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg. Pierce's reputation in the North was further damaged the following month when the Mississippi plantation of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was seized by Union soldiers. Pierce's correspondence with Davis, all pre-war, revealing his deep friendship with Davis and predicting that civil war would result in insurrection in the North, was sent to the press. Pierce's words hardened abolitionist sentiment against him.|$|E

500|$|Lennon {{left the}} Beatles in September 1969, and {{agreed not to}} inform the media while the group renegotiated their {{recording}} contract, but he was outraged that McCartney publicised his own departure on releasing his debut solo album in April 1970. Lennon's reaction was, [...] "Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it!" [...] He later wrote, [...] "I started the band. I disbanded it. It's as simple as that." [...] In later interviews with Rolling Stone magazine, he revealed his bitterness towards McCartney, saying, [...] "I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record." [...] Lennon also spoke of the hostility he perceived the other members had towards Ono, and of how he, Harrison, and Starr [...] "got fed up with being sidemen for Paul... After Brian Epstein died we collapsed. Paul took over and supposedly led us. But what is leading <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> went round in circles?" ...|$|E
500|$|On November 16, 2009, {{the paper}} was {{abruptly}} shut down because of the financial status of its parent company, Window Media, and its majority shareholder, Avalon Equity Partners. [...] Employees at the Blade were aware of Window Media's financial troubles, but the timing and total closure of the publication {{came as a shock}} to the entire staff. [...] Kevin Naff, editor of the Blade, said employees [...] "found out when two of the corporate officers were waiting for <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> got to work this morning". [...] Since the Blade had been a profitable newspaper, and because the debt-ridden Window Media was no longer draining the publication's finances, the same day the Blade shut down, Naff told the Washington City Paper he and the remaining staffers [...] "We're all together. Our first meeting for our new venture is tomorrow morning." [...] Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton said the Blade had been a [...] "weekly must-read", and pledged support for a new publication to serve Washington's LGBT community.|$|E
500|$|Because of {{the role}} of Westerners in the war between the Nguyễn and the Tây Sơn, and Pigneau's role in {{recruiting}} European assistance, Duyệt protected Vietnamese Catholic converts and Westerners from Minh Mạng's isolationalist and Confucian policies by disobeying the emperor's orders. In defense of the Christians, Duyệt wrote to Ming Mạng, [...] "We still have between our teeth the rice which the missionaries gave <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were starving." [...] This came in response to an imperial edict that ordered missionaries to leave their areas of operation and move to the imperial city, ostensibly because the palace needed translators, but in reality to stop the Catholics from proselytizing. Whereas the government officials in central and northern Vietnam complied, Duyệt disobeyed the order and Minh Mạng was forced to bide his time. In the meantime, southern Christians were still publicly identifying themselves as such and praticising their beliefs without facing any obstacles from local officials. Choi said that [...] "From {{the point of view of}} Minh Mạng and his men, the land of Gia Định was thoroughly sheltered by Lê Văn Duyệt's prestige." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2010 when {{accompanying}} the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on a three-day visit to Saudi Arabia, he said [...] "We feel that Saudi Arabia {{has a long}} and close relationship with Pakistan, that makes Saudi Arabia even more a valuable interlocutor for <b>us.</b> <b>When</b> <b>we</b> tell them about our experience, Saudi Arabia listens as somebody who is {{not in any way}} an enemy of Pakistan, but a friend of Pakistan and, therefore, will listen with sympathy and concern to a matter of this nature". He was asked whether India expected Saudi Arabia, given its close ties with Islamabad, to help address the terror threat from Pakistan. The remark about Saudi Arabia being a [...] "valuable interlocutor" [...] raised a strong reaction within the Indian political circle. The Pakistani press even went on to report that he had proposed that Saudi Arabia play a mediator's role in improving India's relationship with Pakistan. In response, Tharoor denied that 'interlocutor' meant 'mediator', and tweeted an explanation, saying, [...] "An [...] is someone you speak to. If I speak to you, you are my interlocutor. I mentioned the Saudis as our interlocutors, i.e. the people we are here to speak to".|$|E
500|$|Turner also {{appeared}} in four films with Clark Gable between 1941 and 1954, beginning with Honky Tonk (1941). The Turner-Gable films' successes were heightened by gossip-column rumors about {{a relationship between the}} two. In January 1942, she began shooting her second picture with Gable, titled Somewhere I'll Find You; however, the production was halted for several weeks after the death of Gable's wife, Carole Lombard, in a plane crash. Meanwhile, the press continued to fuel rumors that Turner and Gable were romantic offscreen, which Turner vehemently denied. Consequently, the publicity generated by this would lead MGM to play up her image as a sex symbol in her following film, a romantic comedy titled Slightly Dangerous (1943). In promotion of Somewhere I'll Find You, Turner embarked on a nationwide war bond tour, during which she returned to her hometown of Wallace, Idaho with her mother, where she was greeted with a large celebration: [...] "We checked into our hotel, and were told that the Mayor had declared a holiday in my honor," [...] she recalled. [...] "A banner stretched across the street read, in large letters, WELCOME HOME, LANA. We'd been in our rooms only a few moments when people who claimed to have known <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> lived in Wallace began knocking on the door." ...|$|E
500|$|... 52 was {{promoted}} as a comic that {{would attempt to}} incorporate as many DC Comics characters as possible. In a Q session hosted by Newsarama.com, 52 editor Michael Siglain answered {{a series of questions}} regarding which characters fans wanted to see in the series. Question No.19 asked [...] "We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52. Could you please tell <b>us</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> can expect his appearances?" [...] Siglain's simple response to readers was, [...] "check back in the late 40s." [...] Speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue No.48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication. [...] On the cover, the circle-A could be seen as a minor element in the background. In a review for [...] "Week 48", Major Spoilers considered the absence of Anarky a drawback: [...] "It's too bad we didn't see the return of Anarky as hinted by this week's cover" [...] Pop culture critic, Douglas Wolk, wrote, [...] "I guess this issue's cover is the closest we're going to get to Anarky after all (and by proxy as close as we're {{going to get to the}} Haunted Tank). Too bad." ...|$|E
