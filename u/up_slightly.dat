5|$|On April 5, 2001, a new {{forecast}} was issued, {{calling for}} 12 named storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. The {{increase in the}} forecast was attributed to the warm sea surface temperatures, although the agency noted that the season would likely not be as active as previous ones due {{to the effect of}} a weak to moderate El Nino. The estimated potential for at least one major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly to 65 percent; the East Coast potential also went <b>up</b> <b>slightly,</b> and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability remained nearly the same.|$|E

The estimated potential {{for at least one}} major hurricane to affect the U.S. was upped slightly once again to 69 percent; the East Coast potential also went <b>up</b> <b>slightly</b> to 50%, and from the Florida Panhandle westward to Brownsville, Texas, the probability was also upped slightly.|$|E

Khali won the match and retained the title after pinning Kane. The primary match on the ECW brand was John Morrison versus CM Punk for the ECW Championship, which Morrison won by pinfall after hitting Punk with both of his knees. The featured matches on the undercard included Montel Vontavious Porter versus Matt Hardy for the WWE United States Championship and Randy Orton versus Dusty Rhodes in a Texas Bullrope match. This was Dusty Rhodes' final match. The event had 229,000 buys, <b>up</b> <b>slightly</b> on the 2006 figure of 227,000 buys.|$|E

5|$|The {{pilot was}} first {{broadcast}} on Monday 13 May 2002, during the 9 to 10 pm time slot. The Spooks producers were hoping the {{ratings for the}} pilot would achieve at least six million viewers, with a 30 per cent audience share; at the time this would be considered acceptable ratings by the BBC, as it {{would allow them to}} further consider Spooks future. The episode ended up with an overnight rating of 9.2 million viewers, with a 41 per cent audience share, easily winning its time slot, and nearly doubling the numbers of ITV1's Helen West, which was viewed by 4.8 million with 22 per cent share in the same slot. The final numbers posted on the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board website was <b>up</b> <b>slightly</b> to 9.6 million viewers, making the Spooks pilot the seventh most viewed BBC One broadcast, and the tenth most viewed broadcast in total the week it aired.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{thought on}} {{the form of the}} earth {{remained}} almost unchanged from early times until the first contacts with modern science through the medium of Jesuit missionaries in the seventeenth century. While the heavens were variously described as being like an umbrella covering the earth (the Kai Tian theory), or like a sphere surrounding it (the Hun Tian theory), or as being without substance while the heavenly bodies float freely (the Hsüan yeh theory), the earth was at all times flat, although perhaps bulging <b>up</b> <b>slightly.</b>|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{demand has}} been held down by the {{combination}} of the price shock {{at the start of the}} stabilization program, steeply falling real wages, reduced government deficits, and much tighter restraint of credit. All these were deliberate measures to stop inflation, accepting the likely costs of higher unemployment and restraint of production as necessary to that end. In 1990 GNP fell 3.9 percent, aggravating the plunge of 19 percent between 1988 and 1990. In 1991 production turned <b>up</b> <b>slightly,</b> with a gain of 2.9 percent in GNP. That situation left output per capita essentially unchanged from 1990 and at 29 percent below its level a decade earlier.|$|E
25|$|Ironically, Will and Jim {{can be said}} to have aged prematurely in the novel; {{the horrors}} of the {{carnival}} force them to grow up fast to {{be able to deal with}} its tricks on a knowledgeable level. Furthermore, Will and Jim do take a brief ride on the carousel before Will pulls Jim off, and they are never shown reversing this process before Charles destroys its machinations. Thus, it can be stated that they, in fact, grow <b>up</b> <b>slightly.</b> In this case, though, Will and Jim have also matured emotionally, too, having had their first encounter with evil. This enables them to grow more proportionally in both physical and emotional status.|$|E

25|$|The Adelaide Oval is {{traditionally}} a dull, lifeless wicket with bounce {{so low that}} even the fastest bowlers rarely rise it above stump height and batsmen {{found it difficult to}} get the ball away. On this occasion frequent light rain helped freshen it <b>up</b> <b>slightly</b> for the pacemen and it resolutely refused to turn. England dropped their injured wicket-keeper John Murray and Alan Smith returned to the team. Tom Graveney was well again and replaced the out of form Peter Parfitt and the off-spinner Ray Illingworth was brought in for the fast-medium bowler Len Coldwell. Once again Fred Trueman advised the opposite, he thought an extra seamer would be better at Adelaide, but was ignored; in any case the spinners struggled on a pitch that refused to turn. Typically the selectors chose the out of form Illingworth over David Allen because of his superior batting. Barry Jarman was also dropped as Australia's first choice keeper Wally Grout was fit to play against after breaking his jaw in November and the paceman Colin Guest was dropped in favour of Ken Mackay in what would be his final Test. Richie Benaud now had 228 Test wickets, Fred Trueman 229 and Brian Statham 235, just one behind Alec Bedser's Test record of 236. Richie Benaud won the toss for the third time and chose to bat.|$|E
