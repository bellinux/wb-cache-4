40|$|LAser RElativity Satellite (LARES) is a {{satellite}} designed for measuring gravitomagnetism predicted by Einstein general relativity. One {{of the requirements}} imposed on LARES satellite {{is to have the}} distance between the center of mass and the geometric center of the satellite lower than 0. 2 mm. The material used for LARES satellite is a tungsten alloy. The producer provided two spheres manufactured with liquid sintering, a process that bring the Cu and Ni present in the alloy in liquid phase. The two spheres are among the biggest tungsten alloy items ever manufactured and the producer could not guarantee the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>alloy.</b> Also the center of mass could not be predicted with a sub-millimeter level of accuracy. Balancing of satellites is usually made by adding masses at pre-configured positions. In case the distance between the center of mass and the geometric center is bigger than 1 mm, adding masses on the LARES satellite would be very difficult and will increase the surface-to-mass ratio, a very important parameter connected to the scientific objective of the mission. For this reason a procedure for a rough measurement of the satellite center of mass has been devised. Purpose of the paper is to show how to use a lathe machine and a homemade system with load cells, to measure the position of the center of mass with an accuracy of about 0. 5 mm...|$|R
40|$|Liquid phase {{segregation}} frequently {{occurs in}} the process of semi-solid die forging, which makes the parts appear “weak point” or “weak region”, and usually, the “weak point” or “weak area” is the reason of crack and service condition failure. In order to analyze the influencing factors for the liquid phase segregation of the semi-solid die forging, in this paper, the sample <b>of</b> semi-solid 7075 <b>alloy</b> is prepared by hand stirring method. The casting-forging forming of the sample is made by means of press machine and cup mould to research the influence <b>of</b> <b>alloy</b> temperature, head preheating temperature, hold time and other process parameters on the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the microstructure. The results show that the semi-solid casting-forging process is feasible within a set of mold. Under the conditions of head temperature of 400 ℃, hold time of 2 s and the forming pressure of 50 MPa, the liquid phase segregation degree of cup sample increases, the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the microstructure becomes worse with increasing <b>of</b> <b>alloy</b> temperature. The segregation degree is up to 14. 02 % when the alloy temperature is 628 ℃. The liquid phase segregation degree of cup sample decreases and <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the microstructure becomes better along with increasing of head preheating temperature. Under the conditions <b>of</b> <b>alloy</b> temperature <b>of</b> 621 ℃, the forming pressure of 50 MPa, and head preheating temperature of 400 ℃, the liquid phase segregation degree of cup sample decreases, the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> the microstructure becomes better along with increasing of the hold time.

40|$|Due to its poor {{corrosion}} resistance, Aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3 {{has been}} targeted to study corrosion mechanisms and protection strategies. The present study has two areas of focus: (1) {{the effects of}} aquatic microorganisms on corrosion, and (2) the surface-cleaning step in the conversion coating process. ^ Microorganisms and biofilms on solid surface can be found almost in any natural aqueous environments. So far, microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), or biocorrosion, has been poorly understood. A comparative study on the corrosion <b>of</b> aluminum <b>alloy</b> 2024 -T 3 was conducted in either plain seawater or nutrient-rich ZoBell 2216 medium, and {{with or without the}} marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas atlantica by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Results indicated that the presence of P. atlantica in seawater decreased the corrosion rate <b>of</b> aluminum <b>alloy</b> 2024 -T 3. Nutrients such as yeast extract and peptone in ZoBell 2216 medium also reduced the corrosion rate <b>of</b> aluminum <b>alloy</b> 2024 -T 3 {{in the absence of the}} bacterium. Examination of attached P. atlantica on the surface <b>of</b> aluminum <b>alloy</b> 2024 -T 3, in different media, suggested that, in low nutrient-concentration environments, more bacteria adhered to the solid surface; in high nutrient-concentration environments, bacterial cells tended to distribute in the aqueous media. ^ Health and environmental concerns call for the development of a non-toxic conversion coating with comparable corrosion protection and paint adhesion properties, to replace excellent chromate conversion coatings on aluminum alloys, due to the toxicity of chromates. A titanate conversion coating has been already developed towards this end; the main focus of this study was on improving the surface-cleaning step that precedes coating. Impedance measurements showed that in surface-cleaning step, proper mechanical abrasion and efficient chemical cleaning improved the surface <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> aluminum <b>alloy</b> 2024 -T 3 before immersion in the titanate conversion solution; the surface 2 ̆ 7 s uniformity then contributed to the formation of a high-quality titanate conversion coating. The pH of the conversion coating solution was important to the formation of the titanate conversion coating and its anticorrosive properties: the corrosion inhibition <b>of</b> aluminum <b>alloy</b> 2024 -T 3 with titanate conversion coating developed at pH = 5 was better than that at pH = 2. ...|$|R

Viscous {{pressure}} forming(VPF) using a semi-solid, flowable, highly viscous {{and certain}} rate sensitive macromolecule polymer as the forming flexible-die {{is a good}} forming method for high strength, low plasticity, complex sheet metal parts.

Currently, researchers typically investigated the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence by manual measurement, a time-consuming and laborious process. This study employed field RGB images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to obtain information related to the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> wheat seed emergence and missing seedlings. The calculation {{of the length of}} areas with missing seedlings in both drill and broadcast sowing can be achieved by using an area localization algorithm, which facilitated the comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence. Through a comparison between UAV images and the results of manual surveys used to gather data on the <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> seed emergence, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was 0. 44 for broadcast sowing and 0. 64 for drill sowing. The RMSEs of the numbers of missing seedling regions for broadcast and drill sowing were 1. 39 and 3. 99, respectively. The RMSEs of the lengths of the missing seedling regions were 12. 39 cm for drill sowing and 0. 20 cm 2 for broadcast sowing.

However, ill vitro studies <b>of</b> NiTi <b>alloys</b> report the dependence <b>of</b> <b>alloy</b> biocompatibility and corrosiun behavior on surface conditions. Surface oxidation {{seems to be}} very promising for improving the corro-sion resistancc and biocompatibility of NiTi. In this work, we studied the effect on corro-sion resistancc and surface chanlcteristics of electropolishing, heat treatment, and nitric acid passivation of NiTi stents. Characterization techniques such as potentiodyna mic polarization tests, scanning electron microscopy, Auger electron spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to relute corrosion behavior to surface ch. mlcteris-tics and surface treatments.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of components made by PM steels are normally inferior to {{those made by}} alternative processes. One {{of the main reasons}} is that a large amount of pores are present in sintered components. The other main reason is that the alloying elements, particularly Ni, are not uniformly distributed after conventional sintering procedures.   This work is aimed at {{a better understanding of the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>alloying</b> additions on {{mechanical properties}} and homogeneity of the microstructure. The experimental work has been carried out in two trials. Trial 1 was performed to investigate mechanical properties of Distaloy powders (commercial grades) and second trial to examine influence <b>of</b> <b>alloying</b> additions on homogeneity of microstructure.   For trial 1, as-sintered and heat treated specimens were produced by mixing commercial powders with two different carbon levels. Whereas, alloying elements were admixed to base iron powder for producing  sintered specimens for trial 2. Mechanical properties including dimensional changes, micro-hardness, tensile strength and impact resistance were measured. Distribution <b>of</b> <b>alloying</b> elements was studied using LOM and SEM-EDS analysis. The results obtained show that additions <b>of</b> <b>alloying</b> elements enhance the mechanical properties. Moreover, interaction of C with Cu and Ni as well as interaction between Cu and Ni have a deceive role in determining final properties of the components. The metallographic investigation indicated that major reasons of heterogeneous microstructure are slow diffusion of Ni in Fe matrix and interaction <b>of</b> other <b>alloying</b> elements with Ni.   The results of trial 2 showed that addition of Mo and Cu to Ni-containing PM steels improves the distribution of Ni in Fe matrix. Mo results in improved <b>uniformity</b> <b>of</b> microstructure by lowering the chemical potential of carbon. In Ni and Cu containing alloys, the interaction between Ni and Cu is responsible for enhanced distribution of Ni. However, the improved Ni distribution is achieved at the expense of non-uniform distribution of Cu. In Ni-containing PM steels, improved microstructure homogenization can be attained by increasing Ni-Cu interaction, lowering the surface energy of Ni-Cu liquid and decreasing the chemical potential of carbon...|$|R
