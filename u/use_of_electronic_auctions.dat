40|$|The <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> as a {{means of}} trading goods has {{increased}} year after year. eBay has gone from half a million registered users in 1998 to 88 million today. Businesses have also shown interest in using auctions. However, the traditional single good auction as used by eBay lacks the required ability to express dependencies between goods in complex procurement auctions leading to risky bidding strategies and sub optimal allocations. The use of combinatorial auctions, where bidders can place bids on combinations of goods, allows bidders to take advantage of any dependencies and auctioneers to generate optimal allocations of goods. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for creating a combinatorial auction circuit {{that can be used to}} compute the result of a combinatorial auction by any garbled circuit auction protocol. In an electronic auction bids from competing parties are commercially sensitive information as bidders will not want their competitors finding out the value they place on a given item. Therefore, there has been considerable research into auction protocols that protect knowledge of all bids except the winning bid from everyone, including the auctioneer. The Garbled Circuit (GC) protocol as described by Naor, Pinkas and Sumner is an example of such an auction. However, it has only been used to provide privacy for single good auctions rather than combinatorial auctions and has been consideredimpracticalfor realisticallysizedauc tions due to the protocol’s communication overheads. Using our algorithm for creating combinatorial auction circuits, the GC protocol can conduct combinatorial auction while keeping losing bid values secret. We have also conducted performance measurements on both the computation and communication overhead of the GC protocol using our combinatorial auction circuit. These experiments show that the communication overhead is low enough to allow its use for realistically sized auctions (6 MB for an auction wit...|$|E

40|$|The vast {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>electronic</b> markets {{have been based}} purely on a single variable (price) as the factor that determines ‘the winner’. Multi-attribute auctions {{are likely to be}} more appropriate for procurement scenarios where factors other than price need to be considered in determining the outcome. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of empirical research on multi-attribute <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions.</b> In particular, there is little empirical evidence of how multi-attribute auctions fit with our theoretical conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>electronic</b> markets. This paper uses the market design aspects of multi-attribute auctions to explore a multivariable <b>electronic</b> <b>auction,</b> using frameworks from electronic market process design and systematic sourcing. Evidence from the case study illustrates that multi-variable <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> can be used to procure a wider range of operating and manufacturing input that has been considered possible with traditional, price only, auctions. The findings reveal how the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> an <b>electronic</b> <b>auction</b> intermediary creates a middle ground of interaction between spot and systematic sourcing, by automating for the buyer certain general parameters and trade context processes.

We collect data on a large number <b>of</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions,</b> across four product categories, to explore the behavior of consumers bidding in a real marketplace. In particular, we focus on the role experience plays in their bidding behavior to uncover whether consumer learning drives the bidding process towards outcomes described in the theoretical literature on auctions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Researchers {{studying}} on-line auction venues {{have focused}} on the business-to-consumer (B 2 C) auction and overlooked consumer-to-consumer (C 2 C) auctions. Since these two venues differ significantly in consumer type and auction rules, they are expected to generate different levels of consumer surplus. This paper explores the extent to which consumers in each type of auction experience the winner’s curse—that is, pay more than the minimum fixed price for identical products. The paper also examines how product value, information asymmetry, and type of auction affect the occurrence of the winner’s curse. KEY WORDS AND PHRASES: <b>Electronic</b> <b>auctions,</b> <b>electronic</b> bidding, information asym-metry, product value, search costs, winner’s curse. Despite the recent slowdown <b>of</b> e-commerce, <b>electronic</b> <b>auctions</b> remain strong and have far exceeded expectations of revenue growth. For example, eBay’s second-quarter revenue in 2001 jumped to $ 180. 9 million, more than 80 per-cent above the same quarter a year earlier, and posted net income of $ 24. 6 million [44].
