5|$|Titanic sank in 1912, {{when she}} {{collided}} with an iceberg during her maiden voyage. The wreck {{could not be}} located {{at the time and}} was not discovered until 1985. Numerous expeditions tried <b>using</b> <b>sonar</b> to map the sea bed in the hope of spotting it, but were unsuccessful. The wreck was finally located by a joint French-American expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel of IFREMER and Robert Ballard of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The wreck {{has been the focus of}} intense interest since its discovery and has been visited by numerous expeditions, including salvage operations which have controversially recovered thousands of items which have been conserved and put on public display.|$|E
5|$|In Abzû, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of a diver in a vast ocean—after waking up {{floating}} on the ocean's surface, the diver begins exploring the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life. The diver can accelerate, and interact with marine life <b>using</b> <b>sonar</b> chimes. The diver can grab onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them. Each area sports hidden collectables for the diver to find.|$|E
25|$|In 2008 Rines theorised {{that the}} {{creature}} {{may have become}} extinct, citing the lack of significant sonar readings {{and a decline in}} eyewitness accounts. He undertook a final expedition, <b>using</b> <b>sonar</b> and an underwater camera in an attempt to find a carcass. Rines believed that the animals may have failed to adapt to temperature changes resulting from global warming.|$|E

50|$|A {{scientific}} echosounder is {{a device}} which <b>uses</b> <b>sonar</b> {{technology for the}} measurement of underwater physical and biological components—this device {{is also known as}} scientific sonar.

25|$|Another {{area that}} was left unexcavated was the initial Teotenanca settlement, Ojo de Agua, on the valley floor {{on the north side}} of Tetepetl Hill. <b>Using</b> <b>sonar</b> in the 1970s, a small {{platform}} was detected about two meters underground and a few objects were uncovered and put on display at the site museum. However, lack of funding prevented any serious work here, but did allow for measures to protect the area from damage, although it still remains private property.|$|E
25|$|A study <b>using</b> <b>sonar</b> in French Polynesia, found large shoals of {{juvenile}} bigeye tuna and yellowfin tuna aggregated {{closest to the}} devices, 10 to 50 m. Further out, 50 to 150 m, was a less dense group of larger yellowfin and albacore tuna. Yet further out, to 500 m, was a dispersed group of various large adult tuna. The distribution and density of these groups was variable and overlapped. The FADs were also used by other fish, and the aggregations dispersed when it was dark.|$|E
500|$|Her wreck was {{discovered}} {{at a depth}} of about 1000 metres by an American underwater survey company <b>using</b> <b>sonar</b> mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle, under contract from the BBC for the filming of a documentary about the ship, in December 2002, approximately [...] from Gibraltar.|$|E

500|$|In 2008 the Army Corps of Engineers {{completed}} {{a survey of}} the Celilo Falls site <b>using</b> <b>sonar</b> technology, in response to the 50th anniversary of the flooding of the falls.

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) were found by the submarine [...] <b>using</b> <b>sonar</b> to detect the underwater locator beacon signals and were quickly retrieved by Canadian Navy divers (the FDR on 6 September and the CVR on 11 September 1998). Both had stopped recording when the aircraft lost electrical power at approximately , 5 minutes and 37 seconds before impact.|$|E
500|$|Ballard {{realized}} that {{looking for the}} wreck itself <b>using</b> <b>sonar</b> was unlikely to be successful and adopted a different tactic, drawing {{on the experience of}} the surveys of Thresher and Scorpion; he would look for the debris field instead, using Argos cameras rather than sonar. Whereas sonar could not distinguish man-made debris on the sea bed from natural objects, cameras could. The debris field would also be a far bigger target, stretching a mile (1.6km) or longer, whereas Titanic itself was only [...] wide. The search required round-the-clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed, with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris. After a week of fruitless searching, at 12.48am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorrs screens. One of them was identified as a boiler, identical to those shown in pictures from 1911. The following day, {{the main part of the}} wreck was found and Argo sent back the first pictures of Titanic since her sinking 73 years before. The discovery made headlines around the world.|$|E

They concluded that the ship was lying in one piece. However, the two survivors continued to maintain that they saw the Bradley break in two. [...] The U.S. Steel survey of the wreck was criticized because it was conducted in secrecy without impartial witnesses.|$|E
2500|$|A {{forensic}} engineering {{team from}} the Louisiana State University, <b>using</b> <b>sonar,</b> showed {{that at one point}} near the 17th Street Canal breach, the piling extends just [...] below sea level, [...] shallower than the Corps of Engineers had maintained. [...] "The Corps keeps saying the piles were 17feet, but their own drawings show them to be 10 feet, Ivor van Heerden said. [...] "This is the first time anyone has been able to get a firm fix on what's really down there. And, so far, it's just 10feet. Not nearly deep enough." [...] The two sets of November tests conducted by the Corps of Engineers and LSU researchers used non-invasive seismic methods. Both studies understated the length of the piles by about seven feet. By December, seven of the actual piles had been pulled from the ground and measured. The Engineering News Record reported on December 16 that they ranged from 23' 3 1/8" [...] to 23' 7 7/16" [...] long, well within the original design specifications, contradicting the early report of short pilings.|$|E
5|$|Whale vocalization {{is likely}} to serve several purposes. Some species, such as the {{humpback}} whale, communicate using melodic sounds, known as whale song. These sounds may be extremely loud, depending on the species.

These ships <b>use</b> <b>sonar</b> and video systems, cable cutters and a mine-detonating device that can be released and detonated by remote control.
