5|$|Devil Daggers was {{released}} for Windows in February 2016, after being greenlit for release on digital distribution platform Steam. OS X and Linux versions were released in July and September 2016 respectively. The game received a positive reception from reviewers, with praise directed towards its sound design, unique visual style and challenging gameplay. However, some reviewers noted {{that during the}} latter stages of the game, the overwhelming number of enemies and visual style {{made it difficult to}} <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> was happening. Critics likened the aesthetics, movement and shooting mechanics of Devil Daggers to Doom, Quake and other first-person shooters of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Amy Pond, Rory and River Song are {{summoned to}} Utah, United States, by the Eleventh Doctor, who is {{killed by a}} mysterious figure in a space suit.

He understood everything, from the bishop on the bench to the hyssop on the wall, and Balkis, his Head Queen, the Most Beautiful Queen Balkis, was nearly as wise as he was.|$|R

5|$|Jenner would {{normally}} {{wake up to}} pray at 5am each day. In the 1940s, Jenner left the Glanton Brethren and joined the Open Brethren. For {{the rest of his}} life, Jenner attended Open Brethren churches: one on Goulburn Street in Sydney and the other in Bexley, New South Wales. At these churches, people did not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> narcolepsy was and thought that Jenner was consistently falling asleep during services because he lacked respect for God. The church on Goulburn Street also disapproved of his partnership with other Christian organisations and churches; Jenner actively partnered with The Navigators, Campaigners for Christ, Baptists, Anglicans, and Methodists.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> was happening and is reluctant to talk about it in interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E

5|$|The film {{created a}} greater {{awareness}} of the franchise and drew in many new fans. Transformers box office success led to the active development of films based on Voltron and Robotech, {{as well as a}} Knight Rider remake. When filming the sequel, Bay was told by soldiers the film helped their children <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> their work was like, and that many had christened their Buffalos – the vehicle used for Bonecrusher – after various Transformer characters.|$|E
5|$|The team realize Travers has valid criticisms {{and make}} changes, though she becomes {{increasingly}} disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> troubles her, Disney invites Travers to Disneyland, which, {{along with her}} developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, {{and the addition of}} a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when Travers discovers that there is to be an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.|$|E

5|$|According The New York Times, the {{eavesdropping}} operations did {{not only}} target local criminals, {{but also the}} communications of top Chinese leaders, {{including those of the}} General Secretary, President Hu Jintao. One source connected to the Chinese leadership said that Bo tried to monitor nearly all central leaders who had visited Chongqing in order to better <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> they thought of him. In August 2011, a phone call between Hu Jintao and anti-corruption official Ma Wen was found to be wiretapped under Bo's orders. The revelations about the eavesdropping operation resulted in intense scrutiny from the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. It was also said to have sowed distrust and {{played a role in the}} falling out of Bo and his police chief Wang Lijun, who allegedly began to use the same eavesdropping methods against Bo himself. The operations were believed to have contributed to Bo's downfall in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Angie (Drea de Matteo) {{takes an}} instant dislike {{to her son}} Danny's (Beau Mirchoff) new girlfriend, Ana (Maiara Walsh), who she fears is too fun-loving and not serious enough. However, Danny feels {{comfortable}} talking to Ana, who seems to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> he has been through. Ana assures Angie she is not going anywhere. Meanwhile, Katherine (Dana Delany) speaks to her psychiatrist at a mental clinic. She says the medicine is working, but she now realizes the person she has become and how much she has hurt her neighbors and friends. Karen (Kathryn Joosten) visits her and asks {{her to come back}} to Wisteria Lane, but Katherine says she will not come back because she does not feel she will be forgiven. Later, Karen returns with Bree, Lynette, Gabrielle and Susan, who comfort Katherine and say they will try to forgive her.|$|E
5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} {{accounting practices}} were not {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting practices were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E

5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Number 18 {{was one of}} the girls in the storage truck, but that she escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Traumatized, she does not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> Jason wants. She knows that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed and is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason is not like the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E
5|$|Nelson's love {{interest}} is Destiny (Canis selfabsorbedb*tchicus), an Afghan hound. However, Destiny {{has no interest}} in Nelson. She is the pet dog of Gary (Tony Way), the landlord of The Lord Nelson. However, like the other humans that appear in the series, he cannot <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> Destiny or what the other animals are saying. Elsewhere there is Marion (Felis retardicus), an idiotic cat to whom Nelson acts as a father-figure. Marion has been abandoned by several owners and is very corruptible. Then there is Kali (Aves aggravaticus), a pigeon who likes to revel in the misfortune of others. She has several grudges, including a hatred of all humans and foxes for the way they treat birds. Lastly, there is Vince, Nelson's older brother (Vulpus c***itcus), a violent, foul-mouthed fox who considers himself a proper animal. Almost all his lines contain at least one swear word that is always bleeped over.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Tony Sawicki rushing his friend Sammy, {{who has just}} been shot, to an empty warehouse. Before dying, Sammy implores Tony to find Beth Childs and pass on a message to her. Not knowing that Beth is dead, Tony's call to Beth's phone is {{answered}} by her former partner, suspended detective Art Bell, who brings Tony to Felix. Realising that Tony is a transgender clone of his foster sister Sarah Manning, Felix ascertains that Tony is unaware of his origins, but refuses to impart any information until Sarah arrives. After Sarah arrives at Felix's apartment and explains to Tony that they are clones, he is unflustered. He passes on Sammy's message for Beth, although neither Sarah or Felix <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> it means. Felix gives Tony his, Sarah and Art's phone numbers and shares a kiss with Tony before he leaves again.|$|E

5|$|The {{plan called}} for the units to {{maintain}} strict radio silence and secrecy {{in order to maintain}} surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to get across the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> the operation was about, or what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front, and were happy to follow their flight leaders on this basis.|$|E
5|$|Veltmann {{denied that}} there was a mutinous conspiracy, saying the men were {{in a state of shock}} {{stemming}} from the horrific explosion and the subsequent cleanup of human body parts belonging to their former battalion mates. He said the conversations at Camp Shoemaker were simply those of men who were trying to <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> had happened, and that these discussions were not mutinous nor could they provide the groundwork for conspiracy. Veltmann argued that Small's brief four- or five-minute speech to the men on the barge was given in the performance of his duty to maintain order, a duty placed upon him by his superiors. Veltmann restated that the established legal definition of mutiny was a concerted effort to usurp, subvert or override military authority, and that there had been no such action or intent. Refusal to obey an order was not mutiny.|$|E
5|$|Ann Rule began {{corresponding}} with Green in 1996, {{and interviewed}} her in person in 1997. Rule recalls {{in her book}} on the case that Green's letters denied any unhappy childhood memories. Green claimed that though her behavior {{in the summer and}} fall of 1995 had been neglectful, she had neither the desire nor the wherewithal to set fire to her house or harm her children or her husband. Rule—who was neither a doctor nor a psychologist, but had a background in criminology and law enforcement—believed that even Green does not <b>understand</b> <b>what</b> caused her to attempt to murder Michael Farrar beyond {{the fact that she had}} come to hate him. Rule's theory was that in destroying Farrar, Green would have been able to preserve her own ego, in that Farrar would not have been able to leave her for another woman. Psychiatrist Michael H. Stone, using Rule's book as a source of information about Green, identifies Green as showing characteristics of psychopathy, borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.|$|E
