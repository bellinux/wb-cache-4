(2002), when a 0-3 year old child has a mother who practices a healthy lifestyle, this child will be 27% more likely to become healthy and adopt the same lifestyle. For instance, high income parents are more likely to eat organic food, have time to exercise, and provide the best living condition to their children. On the other hand, low income parents are more likely to participate in <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activities</b> such as smoking to help them release poverty-related stress and depression.

Survey results showed that participants who thought that they had received a multivitamin were predisposed to smoking more cigarettes and more likely to believe that they were invulnerable to harm, injury, and disease as compared with subjects who knew that they were given a placebo. Participants who believed they were given a multivitamin were also less likely to exercise and to choose healthier food, and had a higher desire to engage in [...] "hedonic activities that involve instant gratification but pose long-term health hazards", such as casual sex, sunbathing, wild parties, and excessive drinking. In the 'multivitamin' group, the more supplements a participant used, the less likely they were to exercise, and smoking was highest among participants who expressed a conscious belief that multivitamins increased health. [...] The study's authors argued that because dietary supplements are perceived as conferring health advantages, use of such supplements may create an illusory sense of invulnerability that disinhibits unhealthy behaviors. Overall, the study shows that people who take supplements may feel that merely taking a pill is a sufficient contribution to healthful living to enjoy other activities without regard to health, and it exposes a potential hypocrisy among supplement users.

We find that, due to the social transmission of NCDs, agents choose lower health conditions and higher <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activities</b> than what is socially optimal. Taxes on <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activities,</b> that may subsidize health investments, can be used to restore the social optimum.

Parents are not fully al-truistic and when they make their choices they do not fully account for the impact of their choices on their children’s health. Consequently, the negative externality results on a lower health capital level and a higher level of <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activities</b> at the descentralized equilibrium, when contrasted to the optimal choices.

A parsimonious model, {{used in the}} literature to explain the decision to pursue an <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activity,</b> represents that decision as a tradeoff between risks and benefits. We build on this literature by surveying a rural population in South Africa to elicit the perceived riskiness and the perceived pleasure for various risky activities and to examine how these perceptions relate {{to the pursuit of}} four specific unhealthy behaviors: frequent smoking, problem drinking, seatbelt nonuse, and risky sex. We show that perceived pleasure is a significant predictor for three of the behaviors and that perceived riskiness is a significant predictor for two of them. We also show that the correlation between the riskiness rating and behavior is significantly different from the correlation between the pleasure rating and behavior for three of the four behaviors. Finally, we show that the effect of pleasure is significantly greater than the effect of riskiness in determining drinking and risky sex, while the effects of pleasure and riskiness are not different from each other in determining smoking and seatbelt nonuse.

40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} the relationships among activity choices, perceived health, stress, and life orientation (optimism-pessimism) in a general population of 675 healthy adults {{ranging in age from}} 18 - 91 years. The objective was to examine assumptions that occupational scientists and practitioners hold regarding the relationships among health factors and engagement in activities/occupations. Method: The study used four self-report measures, including a customized activity card sort that asked participants about both healthy and unhealthy activity patterns. Responses were then compared with the participants’ perceptions of overall health, stress levels, and degrees of optimism and pessimism (life orientation). Results: Major findings confirmed that being engaged in more activities overall is aligned with more optimally perceived health, positive life orientation, and lower stress. However, participation in <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activities</b> negatively affected overall health, stress perception, and life orientation. The study also confirmed that women tend to have higher perceived stress than men and that caring for others is associated with more positive health ratings. Conclusion: The amount and type of activity participation appears to matter for even healthy individuals in terms of overall health, stress perception, and life orientation.

OBJECTIVE: Unnecessary dietary {{restraint}} (ie {{in the absence}} of a need to lose weight) and chronic overeating are both very <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activities.</b> As a precursor to a more involved longitudinal study, we sought to identify potential early-life predictors that merit scrutiny in this context. DESIGN: Four retrospective questionnaire studies were conducted (Study 1, N¼ 242; Study 2, N¼ 297; Study 3, N¼ 175; Study 4, N¼ 261). Female participants (18 – 30 y) completed measures of current dietary restraint and overeating. They also recalled experiences between 5 and 10 years of age. All were staff or students at Loughborough University (UK). RESULTS: After considering obvious sources of systematic bias, we report evidence that (i) dietary restraint is related to memories of maternal weight and dietary behaviour, and (ii) overeating and meal-size selection are both associated with memories of receiving a high-energy diet. CONCLUSION: The role of maternal factors in dietary restraint is consistent with previous research exploring the early onset of this behaviour. However, the relationship between childhood diet and overeating has not been suggested elsewhere. This is particularly important because it suggests a previously unreported correspondence between childhood experience and behaviours associated with obesity in adulthood...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study aims to (1) use the {{objective}} activPAL activity monitor to assess physical activity behaviors, including sitting/lying, standing, and both light (LIPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA); (2) to develop distinct activity profiles based on {{time spent in}} each behavior {{in a sample of}} adolescent females; and (3) examine whether levels of adiposity differ across these activity profiles. Methods: Female adolescents (n = 195; 14 - 18 y) had body mass index (median = 21. 7 [IQR = 5. 2] kg/m(2)) and 4 -site skinfold thickness (median 62. 0 mm; IQR = 37. 1) measured. Physical activity behaviors were measured using the activPAL. Hierarchical cluster analysis grouped participants into activity profiles based on similar physical activity characteristics. Linear mixed models explored differences in body composition across activity profiles. Results: Three activity profiles were identified, a low (n = 35), moderate (n = 110), and a high activity profile (n = 50). Significant differences across activity profiles were observed for skinfold thickness (p =. 046), with higher values observed in the low activity profile compared with the high activity profile.

40|$|Focusing {{mainly on}} the company Nintendo, this paper {{examines}} the political economic and cultural forces underpinning the video game industry’s recent interest in merging entertainment and health promotion. This is a trend best exemplified in sexagenarian actress Helen Mirren’s endorsement of Nintendo’s fitness-themed game Wii Fit Plus. In one sense, ‘health-entertainment’ is deemed {{a product of the}} coercive laws of competition that impress the need for reinvestment and innovation as a way of warding off industry rivals. Nintendo’s turn to health promotion is from this perspective an extension of the ‘console wars’ that in the past drove gaming companies to pursue verisimilitude on screen in hopes of attracting (young male) consumers. In another sense, the present moment offers an ideal time to direct innovation towards the issues of health and healthy ageing in particular, as the cultural logics of healthism and the ‘third age’ both emphasise the virtues of ‘healthy’ and autonomous consumer activity. As such, Nintendo has pursued aesthetic simplicity but kinaesthetic realism as a way of extending the appeal of video gaming beyond the male youth demographic. In examining the implications of these developments, it is argued that health and entertainment, as independent constructs, are conceptually reimagined through their integration with one another. The pursuit of entertainment is made ‘responsible’, thereby remedying the concern that video gaming is an <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activity.</b> The pursuit of health, meanwhile, becomes a matter of playful, technology-enhanced and ultimately consumption-based experience...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} considered that parental lifestyle activities affect children. It is said that parents are an important influence on their children’s behavior and that the habits pass from generation to generation. It is true that children consider their parents as role-models and {{it is more likely}} to behave similar to them adopting their healthy or <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activities.</b> However, there are other factors that can affect children’s behavior throughout the years such as their friends, the social class, family finances etc. This study aims at examining how parental lifestyle activities are transmitted. We use the Sixteen-year Follow-up (1986, 16 -year old individuals) of the British Cohort Study 1970 Database, where data are collected from individuals born in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, in a specific week in April 1970. A sample of 11, 615 16 -year old boys and girls is taken in order to see how the smoking, alcohol drinking and physical activity of their parents are affecting their lifestyle. Other factors are also taken into account i. e. the number of natural parents and any possible financial hardship of the family. The analysis is conducted using logistic regression, indicating that the selected independent variables can explain the influences on the dependent variables. Results show great parental influence on children’s drinking, children’s smoking and children’s physical activity. A significant peer influence is also shown for children’s smoking. Children tend to smoke more if their friends smoke. Father’s employment status plays only a small role on children’s drinking habits, though not as expected. If the father is unemployed, children are less likely to drink or smoke. There is no influence by the presence of family financial hardships or the number of natural parents. As a conclusion, our findings suggest that parental and peer habits exert great influence on children’s lifestyles. parental lifestyle, children’s behavior, intergenerationally trasmission, logit regression. ...|$|E

The bombardment of stressors provoked by social media, external demands, self-doubt, {{and consequences of}} dangerous and spontaneous acts {{can result in a}} perception of self-inadequacy. Consequently, an increase in <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activities</b> and a decline in self-actualization become possible. Negative outcomes that result from avoidance of goal setting and ill-conceived decisions lead to familial and social sanctions, and adolescents become further detached from personal growth and success. The persistence of some youth to negative behaviour suggests that further investigation of effective interventions is a worthwhile undertaking. From this perspective, MI-via-CALC was investigated as a possible behaviour intervention for adolescents. This constructivist grounded theory study was undertaken with the goal of providing a co-construction of meaning that was apprehended in the form of multiple realities to give expression to adolescent participants, deliver an approach that respected their familiarity and contribution to research, and resulted in a substantive theory that is generated for and about them. The methodological, epistemological, and philosophical principles of constructivist grounded theory were applied to this study. The strength of this study was its potential to explain what really happened from the adolescents’ point of view and from their experience. Both MI-via-CALC and constructivist grounded theory required the coach and researcher to focus on shared experiences of coachee/participant and the processes by which conclusions were made of the world. The core process “getting it done” was accessed through the words of the participants and interweaved the concepts that emerged from the study; that is, “empowering self,” “shoring up purpose,” “creating connections,” and “envisioning the future” formed an interplay of categories and subcategories that represented the process of “getting it done. ” The data collected from the participants interconnected with data gathered from my memos of interpretations and crystallizations, the principles of MI-via-CALC, and extant literature. Significant to the findings is that the concerted coaching relationship is critical to the adolescent confidently and positively traversing the processes of “getting it done” and MI-via-CALC.

A non-experimental, cross-sectional survey design was used to address the problem of the study. Four-hundred-eighty-nine students enrolled in Health Science 160, "Fundamentals of Human Health," participated in the study. The 12 -item instrument consisted of an assessment of physical activity patterns and health related quality of life (HRQoL), as well as demographic questions. Data were analyzed using two different statistical techniques. Chi-square tests were used to determine differences between those participants that met CDC physical activity recommendations and those who did not meet the recommendations with regards to the following variables: age, sex, class standing, enrollment status, race/ethnicity, academic major, and self-rated health. T-tests were used to determine if the aspects of HRQoL (i. e., physical unhealthy days, mental <b>unhealthy</b> days, <b>activity</b> limited days, and the Healthy Days Index) were significantly different between the activity groups. The results indicated that those who met the recommended levels of physical activity were more likely to rate their health good, very good, or excellent.

30|$|When {{considering}} {{the result of}} the presented quantitative method, a number of important parameters have to be accounted for, e.g. count density (statistical noise), collimator, number of iterations and subsets, reconstruction compensations and post-filtering. In this work we used clinically relevant values for these parameters. Other important factors are the method-specific ones, i.e. the lung edge effects and kernel size that we evaluated. The resolution of the SPECT system is limited, and therefore, high CV values will always be found in the periphery of the healthy lung. Lung edges with low activity lesions will instead give lower CV values. High CV values due to healthy edges reduce the differences between frequency functions from healthy and <b>unhealthy</b> <b>activity</b> distributions; i.e. they also reduce the separation between corresponding AUC(CVT) values. Therefore, the CV analysis was performed in a volume that had part of the edge effect excluded. Exclusion of a one-voxel layer, however, removes 21 % of the phantom lung and 20 % to 29 % of the human lung parenchyma from the analysis, which is why small lesions in the periphery might not be detected. The kernel approach used does not exclude any additional volume of the lung in the analysis. Kernels with five different side lengths were evaluated in the simulated COPD study, i.e. 1.0, 1.7, 2.3, 3.0, 3.6 and 4.3 cm. Increasing the side length resulted in an increasing differentiation between the AUC(CVT) values of the simulated normal and 1 cm 50 % 10 % evenly distribution (distributions 1 and 2 in Table  1). However, for the two largest cube sizes tested, in combination with some values of the above-mentioned parameters (e.g. LEHR collimator, a Butterworth post-filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.3 cm− 1 and a power of 6, 125 MBq, ten iterations and 16 subsets and no exclusion of edge voxels), the CV frequency functions of the simulated normal distribution were double peaked. Therefore, to minimise the risk of double peaks in a clinical setting, we chose a kernel with the side length of 3 cm, including 729 voxels.|$|R
40|$|Information {{serves as}} an {{essential}} intermediate input in decision-making for any business process. It is an essential requirement not only for effective and efficient management but also for medium and long term planning. In this era of technological advancement {{the rapid growth of}} information flow has contributed significantly in the expansion of business, commercial, industrial, financial, educational and research organisations. Electronic communication provides the ability to overcome many organisational problems. In recent years, an easy and inexpensive access to information through the Internet and e-mail has created an atmosphere of strong competition among organisations. In this competitive environment, the organisations need an efficient, productive and competent internal set-up based on a well-informed workforce. In the absence of effective co-ordination, the expansion of an organisation may result in inter-group conflicts, <b>unhealthy</b> bureaucratic <b>activities,</b> and various complexities in decision-making [Telleen (1996) ]. This applies even more to organisations in developing countries such as Pakistan that are in need of efficient ways to improve governance and enhance institutional reforms. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} {{among adolescents}} {{of the impact}} of Well London, a programme of wellbeing interventions delivered across 20 deprived neighbourhoods of London using a community engagement model. 1, 254 adolescents were surveyed from matched intervention and control areas. There was no significant intervention effect on the main outcome measures: <b>unhealthy</b> eating; physical <b>activity</b> and mental health. Factors influencing the results may include the possibility that the communities defined by the cluster randomised controlled trial (CRCT) were not an accurate reflection of the adolescent’s natural community, and interactions within the school environment in particular could have led to a dilution of effect...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{association}} between health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and physical activity (PA). Methods: Cross-sectional data were obtained via a national telephone survey from 9173 respondents (30. 9 % response rate; 51. 4 % cooperation rate). Four indicators of HRQOL were measured: self-rated health, physically unhealthy days, mentally <b>unhealthy</b> days and <b>activity</b> limitation days. Prevalence estimates were calculated by body mass index (BMI) category and PA level. Logistic regression evaluated BMI as an effect modifier {{of the relationship between}} HRQOL and PA. Results: Inactive adults reported more fair to poor HRQOL than active adults, regardless of BMI category (...|$|R
30|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) Healthy Days {{measure is}} a tool for {{measuring}} HRQoL. The core module of this simple yet comprehensive tool, which has {{been included in the}} Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System since 1993, includes four questions on general health, physical unhealthy days, mental <b>unhealthy</b> days and <b>activity</b> limitations [13]. Of particular interest and relevance, the tool gives equal weight to physical and mental health when assessing HRQoL. The Healthy Days measure has been used in clinical, public health and research settings, and has been correlated with disease progression and health outcomes [14 – 18]. The Healthy Days measure has been compared to other commonly used tools to assess HRQoL, including the SF- 36 [19] and the PROMIS Global Health Scale [20], and has been shown to compare favorably to these tools, while using fewer questions.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Several {{studies suggest}} that {{physical}} activity may improve health-related quality of life. Other {{studies have shown that}} participation in physical activity differs among women of different racial/ethnic groups. This study aimed to determine whether the association between physical activity and health-related quality of life differs among women aged 40 to 64 years from different racial/ethnic groups. Methods We explored the association between physical activity level and health-related quality of life with descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders among 11, 887 women aged 40 to 64 years who identified themselves as Latinas, Asians, African Americans, or whites in the 2005 California Health Interview Survey. Results Although white women reported more regular physical activity than women of other racial/ethnic groups, Asian women reported fewer mentally and overall unhealthy days than women of other groups. Nonetheless, as physical activity increased, health-related quality of life improved only among white women (fewer physically unhealthy, mentally <b>unhealthy,</b> recent <b>activity</b> limitation, and overall unhealthy days) and among Latinas (fewer overall unhealthy days). Conclusion Future studies should try to confirm if and clarify why the association between physical activity level and health-related quality of life differs among these middle-aged women of different races/ethnicities. If confirmed, this association would imply that health care professionals and those who design public health interventions may need to vary their promotion methods and messages to encourage physical activity among women of different races/ethnicities...|$|R
