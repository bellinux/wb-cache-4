5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak force or weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the title {{indicates}} that the ‘stories’ are not merely fictitious but have a factual basis in domestic, quotidian life, though readers would understand ‘from real life’ to mean ‘based on’ or ‘adapted from real ‘life’, and not necessarily ‘representation of actual events’. The ‘stories’ are ‘original’ because narratives for children should start afresh in order to avoid continued ideological contamination from vulgar chapbooks or courtly ‘fairy tales’. The phrase ‘real life’ strengthens ‘original’, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary. ‘Conversations’ suggests familiar, familial discourse rather than formal moralising. ‘Calculated’ suggests a programme rationally determined. These ‘conversations’ and ‘stories’ are also to construct the youthful self in a particular way, by regulating ‘the affections’ or emotional self and forming ‘the mind’ or rational and moral self ‘to truth and goodness’ – <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> professional middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{problems}} with viewing attachment as a trait (stable characteristic of an individual) {{rather than as}} a type of behaviour with organising functions and outcomes, led some authors to the conclusion that attachment behaviours were best <b>understood</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> their functions in the child's life. This way of thinking saw the secure base concept as central to attachment theory's logic, coherence, and status as an organizational construct. Following this argument, the assumption that attachment is expressed identically in all humans cross-culturally was examined. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the three basic patterns, secure, avoidant and ambivalent, can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm.Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies. How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken; for example Gusii infants are greeted with a handshake rather than a hug. Securely attached Gusii infants anticipate and seek this contact. There are also differences in the distribution of insecure patterns based on cultural differences in child-rearing practices. The scholar Michael Rutter in 1974 studied the importance of distinguishing between the consequences of attachment deprivation upon intellectual retardation in children and lack of development in the emotional growth in children. Rutter's conclusion was that a careful delineation of maternal attributes needed to be identified and differentiated for progress in the field to continue.|$|E

25|$|The {{photoelectric}} effect helped to propel the then-emerging concept of wave–particle duality {{in the nature}} of light. Light simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles, each being manifested according to the circumstances.
