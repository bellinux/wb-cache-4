The exact input–output weight spectrum is derived for the case when only the outer code has the <b>uniform</b> <b>error</b> <b>property.</b> Thereby, an upper bound to the bit error probability under maximum likelihood detection is obtained. However, numerous examples for serially concatenated continuous phase modulation show that neglecting the non-uniform error property of the inner system gives an accurate and less complex approximation.

40|$|Abstract—Antenna spacing and the {{properties}} of a scattering environment can create correlation between channel coefficients. Temporal correlation between fading coefficients may also be present, because one may be {{unable or unwilling to}} fully interleave the channel symbols. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of multiple-input multiple-output systems under correlated fading. We calculate pairwise-error-probability (PEP) expressions under quasi-static fading, fast fading, block fading, as well as arbitrarily temporally correlated fading, under Rayleigh and Rician conditions. We use the PEP expressions to calculate union bounds on the performance of trellis space–time codes, super orthogonal space–time codes, linear-dispersion codes, and diagonal algebraic space–time codes.

We introduce {{a class of}} binary labelings for signal constellations, called bit geometrically uniform (BGU) labelings, for which the uniform bit error property holds, i. e., the bit error probability {{does not depend on}} the transmitted signal. Strong connections between the symmetries of constellations and binary Hamming spaces are involved. For block-coded modulation (BCM) and trellis-coded modulation (TCM) Euclidean-space codes, BGU encoders are introduced and studied. The properties of BGU encoders prove quite useful for the analysis and design of codes aimed at minimizing the bit, rather than symbol, error probability. Applications to the analysis and the design of serially concatenated trellis codes are presented, together with a case study which realizes a spectral efficiency of 2 b/s/Hz...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Bit {{interleaved}} coded space-time modulation with iterative decoding (BICSTM-ID) is a {{concatenated coding}} scheme over MIMO channels consisting of an outer code {{and a general}} inner space time modulation (STM). In this paper, a tight upper bound and a tight lower bound on BER performance based on Information Processing Characteristics (IPC) analysis [1], [2] are extended to BICSTM-ID by simplifying BICSTM-ID to an equivalent model of two combined binary channels. These bounds are later confirmed by simulation. Moreover, since the traditional upper bound on BER performance for concatenated coding scheme is proposed under the assumption of <b>uniform</b> <b>error</b> <b>property</b> [3] preserved only by linear code, the IPC based {{upper and lower bounds}} on BER performance are of significant interest for estimating the performance of the coding schemes with general (usually nonlinear) inner systems over MIMO channels.

We show that, even when the <b>uniform</b> <b>error</b> <b>property</b> does not hold for the kind of constituent chaos coded modulations employed, it is still possible to draw a reasonable bound for the bit error probability at the error floor region based on the interleaver structure. The simulations validate the bounds and show that the dynamics of the underlying chaotic maps, rather than the quantization level of the constituent encoders, is the most important factor to account for both the bit and frame error rate behavior at the error floor region. We also show that these chaos bases parallel concatenated schemes yield performances comparable to binary turbocodes and are thus of potential interest in communications...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the convergence problem of autonomous mobile robots with inaccurate sensors, which may return the erroneous location of other robots. In this paper, we newly introduce a <b>uniform</b> <b>error</b> model, {{which is a}} restricted variant of the original observation-error model proposed by Cohen and Peleg [4]. The degree of an observation error is characterized by distance errors and angle errors.

40|$|In this thesis, we are {{concerned}} with the transmission of data over noncoherent channels (the carrier phase is random). We consider a receiving system which does not attempt to estimate the carrier phase from the received data. Instead, the transmitter and receiver will be designed so that the data transmission is robust with respect to the unknown phase variations of the channel. For the transmitter, we propose new combined coding and modulation, specifically designed to match the noncoherent channel. For the receiver, efficient decoders to noncoherently decode the coded modulation are developed. As a result, we are able to show, both analytically and by computer simulations, that Noncoherent Coded Modulation (NCM) approaches the performance of coded coherent modulation. NCM achieves almost the same power efficiency without bandwidth expansion or an extensive increase in complexity. We consider the problem of the <b>Uniform</b> <b>Error</b> <b>Property</b> (UEP) for a broad class of transmitters and receivers. A sufficient condition for a general linear code to satisfy the UEP is presented and a structure of a trellis-coded modulation that satisfies this condition is offered. We call these codes "linear noncoherent trellis-coded modulation" since they apply to noncoherent detection. The problem of noncoherently catastrophic codes, which can result in noncoherent detection of trellis codes, is discussed and a general solution which does not rely on differential encoding of the code output is offered. High performance noncoherent detection is achieved using multiple symbol observations. Unlike previous approaches, a sliding window is used for the observations, with each observation covering several branches of the trellis, so that the observations are time-overlapped. We define a new type of noncoherent maximum likelihood sequence estimator, and analyze its performance over the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel by numerical calculation of the union bound. We perform a computerized search and present new high performance coded M-ary Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulations for noncoherent detection and their performance. The new codes cover many useful rates and complexities and achieve higher performance than existing codes for noncoherent detection. We evaluate the performance of NCM in the presence of phase jitter in the channel. The method can also be used for multiple symbol demodulation of M-ary Differential PSK (MDPSK) and of Continuous Phase Modulation (CPM). We provide results for both, full and partial response CPM schemes as well as convolutionally coded CPM. The complexity and power efficiency of this new method is superior to all past schemes known to the author for noncoherent detection. The optimal implementation of the decoder, using the Viterbi Algorithm (VA), is given. For L-symbols observation, it requires a number of states that grows exponentially with L. Three novel sub-optimal algorithms are presented, whose number of states {{is the same as the}} original code so their complexity has a relatively weak dependence on L. For practical values of L, these algorithms are substantially less complex than the optimal algorithm. The first suboptimal algorithm to be described is called the Basic Decision Feedback Algorithm (BDFA). In this algorithm, the symbols from the decisions are fed back to be used in the subsequent decisions. This algorithm suffers from increased error event probability and from error propagation. However, by a small modification of the BDFA, we obtain another improved algorithm, which will be called Modified Decision Feedback Algorithm (MDFA). To obtain close to optimal performance, the third algorithm, the Estimated Future Decision Feedback Algorithm (EFDFA) is offered. This sophisticated algorithm, which uses the BDFA as a basic building block, is based on a novel concept called "estimated future. " Performance analysis and simulation results are given...|$|E
