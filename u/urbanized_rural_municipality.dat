40|$|While {{undergoing}} {{the unprecedented}} urbanization {{process in the}} past few decades, China has also experienced a major epidemiological shift from predominantly infectious diseases to chronic conditions. Using data from a national survey of 1, 288 respondents in urban China, this study examines the prevalence of chronic conditions and receipt of treatment among <b>urbanized</b> <b>rural</b> residents who have experienced in situ urbanization. Negative binomial and logistic regressions were applied to estimate the differences in chronic conditions, receipt of treatment, and concern of seeking medical treatment among <b>urbanized</b> <b>rural</b> residents as compared to urban residents and rural-to-urban migrants. The results indicate that <b>urbanized</b> <b>rural</b> residents have similar number or prevalence of chronic conditions with urban residents, but {{they are less likely to}} receive treatment particularly for cardiovascular conditions. The analysis further reveals that <b>urbanized</b> <b>rural</b> residents are more anxious about their potential inability to cover medical expenses than both urban residents and rural-to-urban migrants. The study stresses the converging prevalence of chronic conditions but the continuing divide in receipt of treatment between urban residents and <b>urbanized</b> <b>rural</b> residents. As China’s urbanization continues with the epidemiological transition, there is an urgent need to address such disparities. Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R
