40|$|Passive scalar {{transport}} in turbulent {{channel flow}} subject to spanwise system rotation is studied by direct numerical simulations. The Reynolds number Re = U_b h/ν is fixed at 20 000 and the rotation number Ro = 2 Ω h/U_b is varied from 0 to 1. 2, where U_b is the bulk mean velocity, h the half channel gap width and Ω the rotation rate. The scalar value is constant but different {{at the two}} walls, leading to steady scalar transport across the channel. The rotation causes an <b>unstable</b> <b>channel</b> side with relatively strong turbulence and turbulent scalar transport, and a stable channel side with relatively weak turbulence or laminar-like flow, weak turbulent scalar transport but large scalar fluctuations and steep mean scalar gradients. The distinct turbulent-laminar patterns observed at certain Ro on the stable channel side induce similar patterns in the scalar gradient field. The main conclusions of the study are that rotation reduces the similarity between the scalar and velocity field and that the Reynolds analogy for scalar-momentum transport does not hold for rotating turbulent channel flow. This is shown by a reduced correlation between velocity and scalar fluctuations, and a strongly reduced turbulent Prandtl number of less than 0. 2 on the <b>unstable</b> <b>channel</b> side {{away from the wall}} at higher Ro. On the <b>unstable</b> <b>channel</b> side, scalar scales become larger than turbulence scales according to spectra and the turbulent scalar flux vector becomes more aligned with the mean scalar gradient owing to rotation.

Based on recent topographic profiles and on the maps drawn in the late 1970 s, several parameters of the bankfull stage are computed: the ratio between the maximum depth and {{the height of the}} lower bank, the ratio between the channel width and its mean depth, the river competence, and the specific stream power. This methodology is applied for 32 cross profiles in the perimeter of the gauging stations lying within the Ialomiţa and Buzău watersheds. In the case of our study area, three types of channels are distinguished, each showing a different stability under the present conditions: <b>unstable</b> <b>channels</b> susceptible to evolve laterally and vertically; <b>unstable</b> <b>channels</b> susceptible to evolve sideways; and moderately <b>unstable</b> <b>channels.</b> Each of these types includes sub-types differentiated by river competence and sub-sub-types described by channel pattern and characterized by specific stream power. The study confirms the idea that the sinuous channels of the Carpathian streams and the braided channels specific to the Sub-Carpathians and piedmont plains are susceptible to evolve rapidly, whereas the meandering channels belonging to the lowlands of the Romanian Plain have a slower evolution. Beyond this overall picture, the typology leaves room for identifying some particularities due especially to human interventions.

We first validate the Markov Decision Process (MDP) {{formulation of the}} underlying feedback control problem with a 4 R-variable (4 R-V) state, where R {{is the number of}} the transmit antennas. Due to the high complexity of finding an optimal feedback policy under the 4 R-V state, we consider a reduced 2 -V state. As opposed to a pre-vious study that assumes the feedback problem under such a 2 -V state remaining an MDP formulation, our analysis indicates that the underlying problem is no longer an MDP. Nonetheless, the approximation as an MDP is shown to be justifiable and efficient. Based on the quantized 2 -V state and the MDP approximation, we propose practical implementation algorithms for feedback control with unknown state transition probabilities. In particular, we provide model-based off-line and on-line learning algorithms, as well as a model-free learning algorithm. We investigate and compare these algorithms through extensive simulations, and provide their efficiency analysis. According to these results, the application rule of these algorithms is established under both statistically stable and <b>unstable</b> <b>channels.</b> Index Terms—beamforming, stochastic feedback control, im-plementation algorithms, reinforcement learning.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is developed}} to realized optimal channel input conditional distributions, which maximize the finite-time horizon directed information, for channels with memory and feedback, by information lossless randomized strategies. The methodology {{is applied to}} general Time-Varying Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) Gaussian Linear Channel Models (G-LCMs) with memory, subject to average transmission cost constraints of quadratic form. The realizations of optimal distributions by randomized strategies are shown to exhibit a decomposion into a deterministic part and a random part. The decomposition reveals the dual role of randomized strategies, to control the channel output process and to transmit new information over the channels. Moreover, a separation principle is shown between the computation of the optimal deterministic part and the random part of the randomized strategies. The dual role of randomized strategies generalizes the Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) stochastic optimal control theory to directed information pay-offs. The characterizations of feedback capacity are obtained from the per unit time limits of finite-time horizon directed information, without imposing á priori assumptions, such as, stability of channel models or ergodicity of channel input and output processes.

40|$|Channel {{instability}} {{has occurred}} in the Bell River in the form of meander cutoffs, a number of which have occurred since 1952. Increased sediment loading from widespread gully erosion in the catchment has been proposed as the trigger for this instability. Willow species of the Salix family, in particular S. caprea, have been planted along the banks in an effort to prevent further channel shifting. This study reports the results of an investigation into the effect of vegetation on channel form and stability over a 17 km stretch of channel. Results indicate that riparian vegetation has significant effects on channel form which have implications for channel stability. Riparian vegetation increases bank stability and reduces channel cross-sectional area, thereby inducing stability at flows less than bankfull. Evidence indicates that narrow stable stretches are associated with relatively high levels of riparian vegetation. Wider, <b>unstable</b> <b>channels</b> are associated with relatively less riparian vegetation. The effectiveness of riparian vegetation relative to bank sediments was investigated. A dense growth of willows was found to have an equivalent effect to banks with a silt-clay ratio of about 70 per cent. The channel narrowing induced by vegetation may contribute to channel shifting at high flows. The reduced channel capacity is thought to result in more frequent overbank flooding which may ultimately lead to channel avulsion. Thus where increased sediment loading is pushing the channel towards instability, vegetation may be effective in imparting local stability, but it is unable to prevent long-term channel shifts, and may rather help to push the system towards more frequent avulsions...|$|R

Due to its highly {{specialized}} habitat requirements and its vulnerability to habitat degradation, it is of concern through much of its range in the Pacific Northwest. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the range of the tailed frog in British Columbia, and to generate hypotheses for its current distribution. The tailed frog is resident of steep mountain streams. Along the coast, other than its absence from Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii, the tailed frog's distribution coincides closely with the Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH) biogeoclimatic zone. In the interior, an area with a continental climate, its distribution is allied with the Engelmann Spruce/Subalpine Fir (ESSF) biogeoclimatic zone. However, streams in the ESSF are likely only suitable to tadpoles if a thick blanket of snow buffers them from winter freezing. Thus, drier subzones of the ESSF are less likely to support tailed frogs. This close association with moist biogeoclimatic zones may reflect the species preference for a humid temperate climate regime. The tailed frog's distribution may also be associated with geology: in contrast to streams underlain by competent plutonic rocks (e. g., granite), which typically have coarse gravel beds with locked boulder steps, areas with highly fractured or weak rock types (e. g. shale) have a finer and more mobile stream bedload, leading to <b>unstable</b> <b>channel</b> conditions.

In a wired network, random bit error rate, a characteristic usually more pronounced in the wireless network, is negligible, and congestion is the main cause of packet loss. The emerging wireless applications, especially high-speed multimedia services and the advent of wireless IP communications carried by the Internet, call for calibration and sophisticated enhancement or modifications of this protocol suite for improved performance. Based on the assumption that packet losses are signals of network congestion, the additive increase multiplicative decrease congestion control of the standard TCP protocol reaches the steady state, which reflects the protocol’s efficiency in terms of throughput and link utilization. However, this assumption does not hold when the end-to-end path also includes wireless links. Factors such as high BER, <b>unstable</b> <b>channel</b> characteristics, and user mobility may all contribute to packet losses. Many {{studies have shown that the}} unmodified standard TCP performs poorly in a wireless environment due to its inability to distinguish packet losses caused by network congestion from those attributed to transmission errors. In this article, following a brief introduction to TCP, we analyze the problems TCP exhibits in the wireless IP communication environment, and illustrate viable solutions by detailed examples...|$|E
40|$|Channel {{instability}} {{has occurred}} in the Bell River in the form of meander cutoffs, incipient meander cutoffs, and general channel instability. This paper examines the incidence of channel instability in relation to the spatial variability of factors controlling channel form. The locations of channel change were mapped from aerial photographs for a 40 year period. Channel form characteristics were measured over a 17 km stretch of channel. Data collected from this stretch included pattern, width, depth, form ratio, channel gradient, particle-size distribution of bed and bank materials and riparian vegetation. Results indicate that the two primary spatial controls on channel form and pattern are riparian vegetation and bed-material size. Evidence indicates that narrow stable stretches are associated with finer bed-material and relatively high levels of riparian vegetation. Riparian vegetation increases bank stability and reduces channel cross-section, thereby inducing stability at flows less than bankfull. However, at flows greater than bankfull, reduced channel capacity results in more frequent flooding which may ultimately lead to <b>channel</b> avulsion. Wider, <b>unstable</b> <b>channels</b> are associated with larger calibre bed material and relatively less riparian vegetation. Predicted threshold slopes for braiding have indicated that most reaches in the Bell river are close to or above the threshold slope for braiding. Since riparian vegetation serves to increase bank stability, steeper threshold slopes are required for braiding in channels with high vegetation density Recent incidences of channel instability have been identified as occurring in the transitional zone between the upper, coarser reach and lower, finer channel reach...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{nonlinear}} prediction {{and information}} theory, vertical heterogeneity of predictability and information loss rate was obtained over the Northern Hemisphere. In seasonal to interannual time scales, the predictability {{is low in}} lower troposphere and high in mid-upper troposphere. But within mid-upper subtropics troposphere over some ocean area there is a relatively poor prediction. The conclusions fit the seasonal time scale too. When {{it goes to the}} interannual time scale, the predictability is high in lower troposphere and low in mid-upper troposphere contrary to the formers. And on the whole the interannual trend is more predictable than the seasonal trend. The average information loss rate is low over mid-east Pacific, west of North America, Atlantic and Eurasia, and the atmosphere over other places have a relatively high information loss rate in all time scales. Two channels were found steadily over the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean in subtropics. There exist <b>unstable</b> <b>channels</b> as well. The four-season impact on predictability and information communication was studied too. The predictability is low no matter what season data are removed and each season {{plays an important role in}} the existence of the channels except the winter. The predictability and teleconnections are paramount issues in atmospheric science, and the teleconnections may be established by communication channels. So this work is interesting since it reveals the vertical structure of predictability distribution and channel locations, the contribution of different time scales to them and their variations with different seasons.

40|$|In the {{presence}} of malicious nodes, {{one of the main}} challenges in MANETs is to design a novel, scalable and robust Geographic Multicast Protocol (RSGM) that can protect MANETs from various routing attacks. The vulnerabilities in the RSGM protocol were explored and various attacks like blackhole, wormhole and flooding attack are simulated. Several virtual architectures are used in the protocol without need of maintaining state information for more robust and scalable membership management and packet forwarding in {{the presence}} of high network dynamics due to <b>unstable</b> wireless <b>channels</b> and node movements. Specifically, scalable and efficient group membership management is performed through a virtual-zone-based structure, and the location service for group members i...|$|R
