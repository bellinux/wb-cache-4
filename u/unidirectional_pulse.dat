A novel feature of our analysis is the self-consistent description of the atomic motion due to recoil. It is shown that {{the evolution of the}} two count er-propagating fields within the cavity can be very different from that when recoil is neglected. We present an analytical study of the stationary unidirectional and bidirectional emission solutions and an analysis of their stability for a given average atomic velocity and Gaussian atomic velocity distribution. It is shown that the unidirectional emission solution is unstable if either the average velocity or the velocity distribution width is larger than a specific threshold value. If the mode frequency is resonant with the atoms. the symmetric bidirectional emission solution is stable. If the mode frequency is blue-detuned, the laser emits, <b>unidirectional</b> <b>pulses</b> alternately in opposite directions.

These pulses are forming some average reactive stream from the output nozzle on the stern of boat. The suggested model provides the conversion of its oscillatory motions (both pitching and rolling) into a jet flow. This becomes possible due to special construction {{of the boat and}} due to several details, sensitive to the local wave field. The boat model presents the uniflow jet engine without slow conversions of mechanical energy into intermediate forms and without any external sources of energy (besides surface waves).

40|$|In this dissertation, we have {{proposed}} a novel class of approximants, the so-called modified Padé approximant operators for the wide-angle beam propagation method (WA-BPM). Such new operators not only allow a more accurate approximation to the true Helmholtz equation than the conventional operators, but also give evanescent modes the desired damping. We have also demonstrated the usefulness of these new operators for the solution of time-domain beam propagation problems. We have shown this both for a wideband method, which can take reflections into account, and for a split-step method for the modeling of ultrashort <b>unidirectional</b> <b>pulses.</b> The resulting approaches achieve high-order accuracy not only in space but also in time. In addition, we {{have proposed}} an adaptation of the recently introduced complex Jacobi iterative (CJI) method for the solution of wide-angle beam propagation problems. The resulting CJI-WA-BPM is very competitive for demanding problems. For large 3 D waveguide problems with refractive index profiles varying in the propagation direction, the CJI method can speed-up beam propagation up to 4 times compared to other state-of-the-art methods. For practical problems, the CJI-WA-BPM {{is found to be}} very useful to simulate a big component such as an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) in the silicon-on-insulator platform, which our group is looking at. Apart from WA beam propagation problems for uniform waveguide structures, we have developed novel Padé approximate solutions for wave propagation in graded-index metamaterials. The resulting method offers a very promising tool for such demanding problems.

Under the “slip” evolution law, which experiments show to be the more relevant law for nucleation, this expansion {{takes the form of a}} <b>unidirectional</b> slip <b>pulse.</b> In numerical simulations these pulses often tend to approach, with varying degrees of robustness, one of a few styles of self-similar behavior. Here we obtain an approximate self-similar solution that accurately describes slip pulses growing into regions initially sliding at steady state. In this solution the length scale over which slip speeds are significant continually decreases, being inversely proportional to the logarithm of the maximum slip speed V_(max), while the total slip remains constant. This slip is close to D_c(1 −a/b) ^(− 1), where D_c is the characteristic slip scale for state evolution and a and b are the parameters that determine the sensitivity of the frictional strength to changes in slip rate and state. The pulse has a “distance to instability” as well as a “time to instability,” with the remaining propagation distance being proportional to (1 −a/b) ^(− 2) [ln(V_(max) Θ_(bg) /D_c) ]^(− 1), where Θ_(bg) is the background state into which the pulse propagates.

40|$|We compare 2 -D, {{quasi-static}} earthquake nucleation on rate-and-state faults {{under both}} “aging” and “slip” {{versions of the}} state evolution law. For both versions mature nucleation zones exhibit 2 primary regimes of growth: Well above and slightly above steady state, corresponding respectively to larger and smaller fault weakening rates. Well above steady state, aging-law nucleation {{takes the form of}} accelerating slip on a patch of fixed length. This length is proportional to b^− 1 and independent of a, where a and b are the constitutive parameters relating changes in slip speed and state to frictional strength. Under the slip law the nucleation zone is smaller and continually shrinks as slip accelerates. The nucleation zone is guaranteed to remain well above steady state only for values of a/b that are low by laboratory standards. Near steady state, for both laws the nucleation zone expands. The propagating front remains well above steady state, giving rise to a simple expression for its effective fracture energy G c. This fracture energy controls the propagation style. For the aging law G c increases approximately as the square of the logarithm of the velocity jump. This causes the nucleation zone to undergo quasi-static crack-like expansion, to a size asymptotically proportional to b/(b−a) ^ 2. For the slip law G c increases only as the logarithm of the velocity jump, and crack-like expansion is not an option. Instead, the nucleation zone grows as an accelerating <b>unidirectional</b> slip <b>pulse.</b> Under both laws the nucleation front propagates at a velocity larger than the slip speed by roughly μ′/bσ divided by the logarithm of the velocity jump, where μ′ is the effective elastic shear modulus.

40|$|The {{remarkable}} {{level of}} control of atomic wavepackets {{that can be achieved}} using very-high-n Rydberg atoms (n ≥ 350) is demonstrated. This control is accomplished with carefully-tailored sequences of short <b>unidirectional</b> electric-field <b>pulses,</b> termed half-cycle pulses (HCPs), with duration Tp ≪ Tn, where Tn is the classical orbital period. In this limit, each HCP simply delivers an impulsive momentum transfer or "kick" to the Rydberg electron. We show that strongly polarized very-high-n (n ∼ 600) potassium Rydberg atoms can be produced by manipulating lower- n (n ∼ 350) polarized atoms. This enables us to study the response of such quasi-one-dimensional (quasi- 1 D) very-high- n Rydberg atoms to a periodic train of HCPs at high scaled frequencies, nu 0 > 15. Pronounced non-monotonic structure in the survival probability is observed as N, the number of HCPs in the train, is increased. This behavior is very sensitive to the polarization of the Rydberg states. A different protocol that enables us to localize and to steer Rydberg wavepackets in phase space is explained using classical phase-space portraits and confirmed experimentally by navigating phase-space localized wavepackets to targeted positions. Very-high-n quasi- 1 D Rydberg atoms also provide a valuable laboratory for studying irreversible dephasing, i. e., decoherence. This is demonstrated by observing the evolution of a Stark wavepacket containing states of different n in an external electric field. Based on a quantum beat echo technique we report the first demonstration of the reversibility of the dephasing of an ensemble of electric dipoles which is monitored by a probe HCP. This technique allows the measurement of decoherence in the presence of strong dephasing, which can be very important for quantum information processing. All experimental results are explained with the aid of classical trajectory Monte-Carlo simulations (CTMC) and good agreement is seen...|$|R

Microdisk lasers, with a diameter below 10 mum and fabricated in InP membranes with a high index contrast, offer this possibility at the telecom wavelengths. The lasers are fabricated using heterogeneous integration of InP membranes on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) passive waveguide circuits, which allows to combine the active elements with compact, high-index contrast passive elements. The lasing mode in such microdisk lasers is a whispering gallery mode, which can be either in the clockwise (CW) or counter clockwise direction (CCW) or in both. The coupling to the SOI wire waveguides is through evanescent coupling. Predefined, unidirectional operation can be achieved by terminating the SOI wires at one end with Bragg gratings. For all-optical flip-flops, the laser operation must be switchable between CW and CCW, using short optical <b>pulses.</b> <b>Unidirectional</b> operation in either direction is only possible if the coupling between CW and CCW direction is very small, requiring small sidewall surface roughness, and if the gain suppression is sufficiently large, requiring large internal power levels. All-optical flip-flops based on microdisk lasers with diameter of 7. 5 mum have been demonstrated. They operate with a CW power consumption of a few mW and switch in 60 ps with switching energies as low as 1. 8 fJ. Operation as all-optical gate has also been demonstrated. The surface roughness is limited through optimized etching of the disks and the large internal power is obtained through good heat sink...|$|R
