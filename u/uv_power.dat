Although the physical mechanisms underlying such phenomenon are still not completely clear, such an effect has already been exploited to fabricate channel waveguides at visible and infrared wavelengths [1, 2]; In order to elucidate the structural changes associated to UV irradiation in congruent LN, APE:LN and RPE:LN, we carried out systematic micro-Raman analyses on UV-irradiated channels (lambda = 244 nm) written under various conditions (<b>UV</b> <b>powers</b> = 40 - 80 mW, writing speeds = 10 - 1000 mm/min). In the micro-Raman experiments, light from a He-Ne laser was focused by a microscopic objective x 100 on the crystal. A back-scattering scheme was used to extract the light scattered from an extremely small region (width ~ 1. 6 µm, depth ~ 3. 5 µm) on the surface. The spectra of the UV-irradiated channels show: (1) Numerous extra lines for some intrinsic damaged areas of the channels; (2) significant decreases of Raman intensities and line broadenings for all the bands related to the LN phonon spectrum. In particular, the Raman spectra for channels exposed to higher <b>UV</b> <b>powers</b> (70 and 80 mW) exhibit typical features of amorphous LiNbO 3 (reported previously for Kr+ and He+ irradiated LN).
