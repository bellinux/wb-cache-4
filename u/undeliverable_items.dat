25|$|In July 2012 Ofcom {{consulted}} on {{a scheme}} proposed by Royal Mail to alter its delivery obligations to allow larger postal items {{to be left}} with neighbours rather than returning them to a Royal Mail office to await collection. The scheme was presented as offering consumers greater choice for receiving mail when not at home, that is if Royal Mail deliver items as per their stated contractual obligations and was said to follow Royal Mail research from a 'delivery to neighbour' trial across six areas of the UK that showed widespread consumer satisfaction. In a statement dated 27 September 2012, Ofcom announced it would approve the scheme after noting that more goods were being purchased over the internet and that Royal Mail's competitors were permitted to leave undelivered items with neighbours. People who {{do not wish to}} have parcels left with neighbours, or to receive those of others, can opt out by displaying a free opt-out sticker near their letterbox. Royal Mail remains liable for <b>undeliverable</b> <b>items</b> until they are received by the addressee or returned to sender.|$|E

5000|$|In the 20th century, {{the term}} [...] "Nixie clerk" [...] {{referred}} to a postal employee who {{tried to figure out}} what to do with <b>undeliverable</b> <b>items,</b> which were not just poorly addressed mail, but ranged from torn-open envelopes of photographs, even to lost and found wallets dropped into a mailbox. More recently, the USPS National Change of Address (NCOA) Service provided data to mailers with scoring on how close a match the name and address are to something actually forwardable or deliverable, which were {{referred to a}}s [...] "Nixie Codes".|$|E
50|$|At a DLO, mail {{is usually}} opened {{to try to}} find an address to forward to. If an address is found, the {{envelope}} is usually sealed using tape or postal seals, or enclosed in plastic bags and delivered. If the letter or parcel is still <b>undeliverable,</b> valuable <b>items</b> are then auctioned off while the correspondence is usually destroyed. Despite this practice, in the past some undeliverable envelopes were acquired by philatelists.|$|R
