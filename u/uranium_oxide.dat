5|$|The most {{effective}} way to purify <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> in a laboratory was {{to take advantage of the}} fact that uranium nitrate is soluble in ether. Scaling this process up for industrial production was a dangerous proposition; ether was explosive, and a factory using large quantities was likely to blow up or burn down. Compton and Spedding turned to Mallinckrodt in Saint Louis, Missouri, which had experience with ether. Spedding went over the details with Mallinckrodt's chemical engineers, Henry V. Farr and John R. Ruhoff, on 17 April 1942. Within a few months, sixty tons of highly pure <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> was produced.|$|E
5|$|The uranium {{fraction}} diagrams in {{the presence}} of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium is converted to a hydrated <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.|$|E
5|$|The Advisory Committee on Uranium {{provided}} {{money for}} Fermi to buy graphite, and {{he built a}} pile of graphite bricks {{on the seventh floor}} of the Pupin Hall laboratory.

5|$|Uranium ore is mined {{in several}} ways: by open pit, underground, in-situ leaching, and {{borehole}} mining (see uranium mining). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides.</b> Extensive measures must {{be employed to}} extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in Athabasca Basin deposits in Saskatchewan, Canada can contain up to 23% <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> on average. <b>Uranium</b> ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an acid or alkali. The leachate is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called yellowcake, contains at least 75% <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> U3O8. Yellowcake is then calcined to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor the {{recovery}} of nuclear materials from spent fuel, a novel reprocessing process based on sulfide chemistry has been proposed. In this paper, the sulfurization behavior of thorium and <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> was studied using carbon disulfide. When U 3 O 8 was reacted with CS 2, it was reduced to UO 2 at temperatures lower than 673 K, while sulfuruization of UO 2 was observed at temperatures higher than 773 K forming UOS and US 2. On the other hand, no reaction was observed for ThO 2 up to 773 K. Similar results were obtained for the mixture of U 3 O 8 and ThO 2. The obtained results were also compared with thermodynamic consideration. Then, separation of uranium from thorium was suggested by selective sulfurization of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides.</b> Finally, it was summarized that most of thorium oxide could be recovered as ThO 2 after the separation of sulfurized <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides...</b>|$|R
5|$|In early 1942, {{with the}} United States now embroiled World War II, Arthur Compton {{concentrated}} the Manhattan Project's various teams working on plutonium at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Zinn used athletes to build Fermi's increasingly large experimental configurations under the stands of the disused Stagg Field. In July 1942, Fermi measured a k = 1.007 from a <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> lattice. This raised hopes that pure uranium would yield a suitable value of k.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied armies {{advanced}} into Germany in April 1945, Alsos Mission teams searched Stadtilm, {{where they}} found documentation concerning the German nuclear program, components of a nuclear reactor, and eight tons of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Scientists captured at Göttingen and Katlenburg-Lindau included Werner Osenberg, {{the chief of the}} planning board of the Reichsforschungsrat, and Fritz Houtermans, who provided information about the Soviet atomic bomb project. At Celle, the Alsos Mission uncovered an experimental centrifuge for separating uranium isotopes, the result of work undertaken at the University of Hamburg by a team under Paul Harteck.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of elements and compounds. Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E
25|$|Uranium {{trioxide}} is shipped between processing {{facilities in}} the form of a gel, most often from mines to conversion plants. When used for conversion, all <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> are often called reprocessed uranium(RepU).|$|R
50|$|UF4 is {{generally}} an intermediate in {{the conversion of}} uranium hexafluoride (UF6) to either <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> (U3O8 or UO2) or uranium metal. It is formed by the reaction of UF6 with hydrogen gas in a vertical tube-type reactor or {{by the action of}} hydrogen fluoride (HF) on uranium dioxide. UF4 is less stable than the <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> and reacts slowly with moisture at ambient temperature, forming UO2 and HF, the latter of which is very corrosive; it is thus a less favorable form for long-term disposal. The bulk density of UF4 varies from about 2.0 g/cm3 to about 4.5 g/cm3 depending on the production process and the properties of the starting uranium compounds.|$|R
500|$|Phase {{relationships}} in the uranium-oxygen system are complex. The most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium(IV) and uranium(VI), and their two corresponding <b>oxides</b> are, respectively, <b>uranium</b> dioxide (...) and uranium trioxide (...)

5|$|Uranium metal {{reacts with}} almost all {{non-metal}} elements (with {{the exception of}} the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.|$|E
5|$|Nichols {{took charge}} of ore procurement. He {{arranged}} with the State Department for export controls {{to be placed on}} <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> and negotiated with Edgar Sengier for the purchase of 1,200 tons of ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on Staten Island. Nichols arranged with the Eldorado Mining and Refining Company for the purchase of ore from its mine in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots. Nichols met with Undersecretary of the Treasury Daniel W. Bell and arranged for the transfer of 14,700 tons of silver from the West Point Depository for use in the Y-12 National Security Complex in place of copper, which was in desperately short supply in wartime.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1942, {{as part of}} the Manhattan Project, {{another team}} led by Enrico Fermi was able to {{initiate}} the first artificial self-sustained nuclear chain reaction, Chicago Pile-1. An initial plan using enriched uranium-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities. Working in a lab below the stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400short tons (360metric tons) of graphite, 58short tons (53metric tons) of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide,</b> and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by Westinghouse Lamp Plant in a makeshift production process.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Soil {{samples from}} an {{abandoned}} uranium mine {{have been investigated}} {{in order to determine}} the molecular phases of uranium compounds. The experiments were carried out with soil particulate matter, collected randomly from the area of the formerly exploited ore. To select the particles rich with uranium, scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray attachment (SEM/EDX) was applied first. Afterwards, the particles were relocated and measured by l-Raman spectrometry (MRS). Residues of the main deposit, uraninite UO 2, were detected, along with its alteration products. In terms of Raman scattering properties, <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> are quite sensitive to the laser beam wavelength, which results in very specific features of their Raman spectra. In this paper the Raman spectra of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> of different origin and oxidation states, measured with 514 and 785 nm lasers, are also presente...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} of the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of uranium determined the oxidation state and coordination environment of uranium atoms in glasses containing 40 mol % Na$_ 2 $O, 10 mol % Al 2 O 3, 10 mol % Fe$_ 2 $O$_ 3 $, and 40 mol % P$_ 2 $O$_ 5 $ to which <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> were added to a concentration of 50 wt % (above 100 %). If the added amount of UO 2 was small, uranium occurred as U(IV) in a near-octahedral oxygen environment with an average U–O distance in the first coordination sphere of 2. 25 Å. At higher concentrations of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides</b> introduced both as UO$_ 2 $ and as UO$_ 3 $, uranium occurred as U(V) and U(VI); the first coordination sphere is split; shorter (~ 1. 7 – 1. 8 Å) and longer (2. 2 – 2. 3 Å) distances were observed, which corresponded to the axial and equatorial U–O bonds in uranyl ions, respectively; and the redox equilibrium shifted toward U(VI). The glass with the maximal (~ 33 wt %) UO$_ 3 $ concentration contained mainly U(VI). The existence of low-valence uranium species {{can be related to}} the presence of Fe(II) in glasses. The second coordination sphere of uranium manifests itself only at high concentrations of <b>uranium</b> <b>oxides...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{experiments}} {{continued in}} 1942, but were ultimately unsuccessful; the problems posed by impurities in the coke and <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> {{had not been}} fully appreciated, {{and as a result}} too many neutrons were captured. But Laurence's efforts attracted some attention, and in the summer of 1940 he was visited by R. H. Fowler, the British scientific liaison officer in Canada. This was followed by a visit from John Cockcroft of the British Tizard Mission to the United States in the autumn. They brought news of the similar research being carried out {{under the supervision of the}} MAUD Committee in Britain and the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{sandstone}} formations {{from which}} Silver Reef gets its name were formed when tectonic stresses forced long, longitudinally aligned sections of Navajo Sandstone to buckle and {{stand on their}} sides, giving them the appearance of ocean reefs. Over {{long periods of time}} silver ore, sediments, and vegetation were carried in water runoff from the Chinle Formation to the White, Buckeye, and East reefs. The ore settled as deposits and the vegetation became petrified. The Silver Reef Mining District's geologic resources consist mainly of silver deposits, with smaller deposits of copper, gold, lead, and <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide.</b> Iron oxide deposits in the soil rocks cause a red coloration, and dinosaur tracks from the early Jurassic period have been found in the area.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of uranium}} {{in its natural}} oxide form dates back to at least the year 79 CE, when {{it was used to}} add a yellow color to ceramic glazes. Yellow glass with 1% <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> was found in a Roman villa on Cape Posillipo in the Bay of Naples, Italy, by R. T. Gunther of the University of Oxford in 1912. Starting in the late Middle Ages, {{pitchblende}} was extracted from the Habsburg silver mines in Joachimsthal, Bohemia (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local glassmaking industry. In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines.|$|E

5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|Uranium and thorium {{were the}} first {{actinides}} discovered. Uranium was identified in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in pitchblende ore. He named it after the planet Uranus, which had been discovered only eight years earlier. Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely sodium diuranate) by dissolving pitchblende in nitric acid and neutralizing the solution with sodium hydroxide. He then reduced the obtained yellow powder with charcoal, and extracted a black substance that he mistook for metal. Only 60 years later, the French scientist Eugène-Melchior Péligot identified it as <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide.</b> He also isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating uranium tetrachloride with metallic potassium. The atomic mass of uranium was then calculated as 120, but Dmitri Mendeleev in 1872 corrected it to 240 using his periodicity laws. This value was confirmed experimentally in 1882 by K. Zimmerman.|$|E
5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing <b>uranium</b> <b>oxide</b> with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
