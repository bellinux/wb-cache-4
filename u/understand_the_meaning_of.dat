5|$|Philosopher John Searle {{argues that}} Watson—despite {{impressive}} capabilities—cannot actually think. Drawing on his Chinese room thought experiment, Searle claims that Watson, like other computational machines, is capable only of manipulating symbols, {{but has no}} ability to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> those symbols; however, Searle's experiment has its detractors.|$|E

The software uses semantic algorithms to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> a data table's columns and pattern recognition algorithms to find potential duplicates in a data-set. It also uses indexing, text pattern recognition and other technologies traditionally found in social media and search software.|$|E
5|$|Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was {{therefore}} selected {{to perform the}} item number instead. She was friends with Jagannadh, and he approached her for this song during the film's shoot at Mumbai, saying that the song suited her and her personality as a dancer. She also tried to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the lyrics while dancing. Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E

Proper use of XBRL assures that relevant data gathered from multiple sources is easily comparable and analyzable. XBRL is a derivative of the XML file format, which tags data with contextual and hierarchical information. It is expected that many enterprise resource planning systems will provide data in the XBRL-GL format to facilitate machine readability.|$|E

25|$|The Foundation Pit (Russian: Котлован, kotlovan) is {{a gloomy}} {{symbolic}} and semi-satirical novel by Andrei Platonov. The {{plot of the}} novel concerns a group of workers living in the early Soviet Union. They attempt to dig out a huge foundation pit {{on the base of}} which a gigantic house will be built for the country's proletarians. The workers dig each day but slowly cease to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> their work. The enormous foundation pit sucks out all of their physical and mental energy.|$|E

25|$|When Phan was five, {{his father}} {{returned}} {{home and he}} began attending his father's classes, where he studied the Chinese classics, such as the Three Character Classic, which took him just three days to memorize. As {{a result of his}} ability to learn quickly, his father decided to move him to further Confucian texts, such as the Analects, which he practiced on banana leaves. In his autobiography, Phan admitted he did not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the text in great detail at the time, but by age six, he was skillful enough to write a variant of the Analects that parodied his classmates, which earned him a caning from his father.|$|E

25|$|Arakawa {{wanted to}} {{integrate}} social problems into the story. Her research involved watching television news programs {{and talking to}} refugees, war veterans and former yakuza. Several plot elements, such as Pinako Rockbell caring for the Elric brothers after their mother dies, and the brothers helping people to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> family, expand on these themes. When creating the fictional world of Fullmetal Alchemist, Arakawa was inspired after reading about the Industrial Revolution in Europe; she was amazed by differences in the culture, architecture, and clothes of the era and those of her own culture. She was especially interested in England during this period and incorporated these ideas into the manga.|$|E
25|$|Translations of sung texts—whether of {{the above}} type meant to be sung or of {{a more or less}} literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a {{language}} not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or surtitles projected during opera performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the words they are singing.|$|E
25|$|The country's {{laws are}} {{published}} in Hebrew, and eventually English and Arabic translations are published. Publishing {{the law in}} Hebrew in the official gazette (Reshumot) {{is enough to make}} it valid. Unavailability of an Arabic translation can be regarded as a legal defense only if the defendant proves he could not <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the law in any conceivable way. Following appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the use of Arabic on street signs and labels increased dramatically. In response to one of the appeals presented by Arab Israeli organizations, the Supreme Court ruled that although second to Hebrew, Arabic is an official language of the State of Israel, and should be used extensively. Today most highway signage is trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic, and English).|$|E

5000|$|In some {{discussion}} models, participants {{are expected to}} come to discussions prepared with their own lists of questions about texts, to encourage independent thinking. Interpretive discussions can arise or flow from participants' questions; discussants can be genuinely motivated to participate {{as well as to}} engage with texts so as to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> texts. That is, no questions need be thrust upon groups for discussions, but rather interested discussants can participate actively to better <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanings</b> <b>of</b> texts. [...] In other discussion models (often those with more limited time), leaders guide participants through questions to ensure that important topics are covered over the course of discussions.|$|R

25|$|Ethologists and sociobiologists have {{characteristically}} analysed animal {{communication in}} terms of more or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising {{the question of whether}} the animals concerned <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> the signals they emit and receive. That is a key question in animal cognition. There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding. A much discussed example is the use of alarm calls by vervet monkeys. Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators (leopards, eagles, and snakes), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately—but that this ability develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call. Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.|$|E
25|$|His next {{work was}} {{published}} in 1933 titled The Physical Dimensions of Consciousness; he attempts an accommodation with behaviorism by viewing sensations through their physical mechanisms. In this Boring expresses his monist physicalism perspective, similar to operationalism’s emphasis on measurement in order to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> concepts. Boring himself was surprised by his view being in direct opposition to his deeply respected mentor Titchener. However Titchener was dead by this time and Boring was now free to express his views. The mentalist and dualist perspective of Titchener seemed insecure to Boring, he focused on a physical brain rather than the abstract mind. One {{of the purposes of}} this book was try to clarify such complex terms as consciousness and sensation, questions that had been plaguing him since his automobile accident. Boring wanted to define what these phenomena actually meant physically.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas finds little {{justification}} for human experimentation through informed consent. He {{argues that a}} patient’s understanding of an experimental procedure will never approach that {{of his or her}} physician. He questions even the possibility of a patient reaching a state of “informed consent.” He further believes that if individuals reach such a state of “informed consent”, this does not mean individuals should consent, or fully <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> their consent. “For persons can misuse themselves even if they do so voluntarily and with full knowledge.” Individuals consenting to experimentation through the justification of the human good, turn themselves into objects {{for the use of the}} experimentation. The issue is further complicated for Hauerwas as to whom should be considered for medical experimentation. The use of prisoners only proliferates social stereotypes and denigration. He believes that informed consent is necessary for human experimentation, but it does not provide {{justification for}} our willingness to submit and participate in experimentation.|$|E

5000|$|The Tibetan {{term for}} arhat was {{translated}} by meaning from Sanskrit. This translation, dgra bcom pa, means [...] "one who has destroyed the foes of afflictions." [...] Thus the Tibetan translators also <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> arhat to be ari-hanta.|$|R
25|$|Anyone {{who came}} into contact with a human corpse, or grave, was so ritually impure that they had to be {{sprinkled}} with the water produced from the red heifer ritual, in order to become ritually pure again; however, the person who carried out the red heifer ritual and who sprinkled the water, was to be treated as having become ritually impure by doing so. According to biblical scholars, this ritual derives from the same origin as the ritual described in Deuteronomy for a group of people to atone for murder by an unknown perpetrator, according to which a heifer is killed at a stream, and hands are washed over it; biblical scholars believe that these are both ultimately cases of sympathetic magic, and similar rituals existed in Greek and Roman mythology. The masoretic text describes the water produced from the red heifer ritual as a sin offering; some English translations discount this detail, because it differs from other sin offerings by not being killed at the altar, although biblical scholars believe that this demonstrates a failure by these translations to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> sin offerings.|$|E
25|$|Semiotic {{art history}} seeks {{to uncover the}} codified meaning or {{meanings}} in an aesthetic object by examining its connectedness to a collective consciousness. Art historians do not commonly commit to any one particular brand of semiotics but rather construct an amalgamated version which they incorporate into their collection of analytical tools. For example, Meyer Schapiro borrowed Saussure’s differential meaning in effort to read signs as they exist within a system. According to Schapiro, to <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> <b>meaning</b> <b>of</b> frontality in a specific pictorial context, it must be differentiated from, or viewed in relation to, alternate possibilities such as a , or a three-quarter view. Schapiro combined this method {{with the work of}} Charles Sanders Peirce whose object, sign, and interpretant provided a structure for his approach. Alex Potts demonstrates the application of Peirce’s concepts to visual representation by examining them in relation to the Mona Lisa. By seeing the Mona Lisa, for example, as something beyond its materiality is to identify it as a sign. It is then recognized as referring to an object outside of itself, a woman, or Mona Lisa. The image does not seem to denote religious meaning and can therefore be assumed to be a portrait. This interpretation leads to a chain of possible interpretations: who was the sitter in relation to Leonardo da Vinci? What significance did she have to him? Or, maybe she is an icon for all of womankind. This chain of interpretation, or “unlimited semiosis” is endless; the art historian’s job is to place boundaries on possible interpretations {{as much as it is}} to reveal new possibilities.|$|E
