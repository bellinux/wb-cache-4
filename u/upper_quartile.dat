40|$|Data on the {{pharmacokinetics}} (PKs) of penicillin G (PEN) in neonates {{date back}} to the 1970 s and do not include data for very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) neonates. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the steady-state PKs and to establish an optimal regimen for the dosing of PEN in neonates with gestational ages of less than 28 weeks and birth weights of less than 1, 200 g. Two PEN dosing regimens were studied: 50, 000 IU (30 mg) /kg of body weight every 12 h (q 12 h) (group 1; n = 9) and 25, 000 IU (15 mg) /kg q 12 h (group 2; n = 9). Samples for PK analysis were drawn before the injection of PEN and at 2 and 30 min and 1. 5, 4, 8, and 12 h after intravenous injection of the third to eighth PEN doses. The PEN concentration was measured by a high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection technique. The median peak and trough concentrations of PEN were 147 μg/ml (lower and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles,</b> 109 and 157 μg/ml, respectively) and 7 μg/ml (lower and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles,</b> 5 and 13 μg/ml, respectively) after administration of the dose of 50, 000 IU and 59 μg/ml (lower and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles,</b> 53 and 78 μg/ml, respectively) and 3 μg/ml (lower and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles,</b> 3 and 4 μg/ml, respectively) after administration of the dose of 25, 000 IU. The PEN half-life (median and lower and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles</b> for group 1, 3. 9 h and 3. 3 and 7. 0 h, respectively; median and lower and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles</b> for group 2, 4. 6 h and 3. 8 and 5. 6 h, respectively) was longer in VLBW neonates than in adults and term infants. PEN renal clearance correlated with creatinine clearance (R 2 = 0. 309596; P = 0. 038). Only a median of 34 % (lower and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles,</b> 28 and 37 %, respectively) of the administered dose was excreted in urine within the following 12 h. We conclude that in VLBW infants a PEN dose of 25, 000 IU (15 mg) /kg q 12 h is safe and sufficient to achieve serum concentrations above the MIC 90 for group B streptococci for the entire dosing interval...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the {{relationships}} among cognitive functions, neurological soft signs, and clinical symptoms {{in a group of}} patients with chronic schizophrenia. A total of 90 patients were recruited. Blink rate was recorded when patients were in a resting and relaxed condition. Significant correlations were found only between blink rate and general psychopathology (p <. 01) and disinhibition soft signs (p <. 05). When the group was further divided into two subgroups by taking the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles</b> of their blink rate, patients at the <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles</b> exhibited significantly more disinhibition signs than those at the lower quartiles. There was also a trend for those patients at the <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles</b> to commit more error in a sustained attention task.

Conservatively, a QLAC can be a diversifier, introducing mortality credits, to a bond portfolio.

40|$|OBJECTIVEdTo {{examine the}} {{association}} of objectively measured participation in low levels of physical activity with incident type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdThe study population included participants free of diabetes and cardiovascular disease at baseline (n = 1, 826) who participated in a follow-up examination. Generalized estimating equations were used to examine {{the association of}} steps per day with incident diabetes. RESULTSdDuring 5 years of follow-up, 243 incident cases of diabetes were identified. When compared with participants in the lowest quartile of steps per day (, 3, 500 steps), participants in the <b>upper</b> three <b>quartiles</b> of steps per day had lower odds for diabetes, consistent with a threshold effect. Contrasting the three <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles</b> with the lowest quartile, the odds ratio of diabetes was 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 51 – 0. 98).

50|$|Research has {{suggested}} that the enhancement of growth factor pathways, including that of GH/IGF-1, could potentially increase the risk of various cancers, including breast cancer. Increased proliferation due to increased IGF-1 activity has been suggested to possibly {{play a key role in}} the high risk of breast cancer seen in women with the BRCA1 mutation. Multiple large studies have found a correlation in premenopausal women between serum IGF-1 levels in the <b>upper</b> <b>quartile</b> of the normal range and IGFBP-3 levels in the lower quartile (i.e., high circulating IGF-1 levels and low circulating IFGBP-3 levels) and the risk of developing various cancers, including breast cancer. However, the increase in breast cancer risk has been found only to be modest (e.g., only more than twice the usual risk). Subsequent studies have found the increase in risk to be even less clear, and it is notable that high-normal range IGF-1 levels have been found to correlate only with premenopausal and not with postmenopausal breast cancer incidence. In any case, mice engineered to have lower circulating levels of IGF-1 show a lower risk of developing various cancers, including breast cancer. In contrast to the case of IGF-1, the upper quintile (20%) of postmenopausal women with the highest of both circulating estrogen and androgen levels have been found to have a significantly increased risk of breast cancer (relative to lowest quintile, the risk is 2- to 3-fold higher). A significant positive association with breast cancer risk has also been found with prolactin levels in postmenopausal women.|$|E

A high coefficient of variation (CV = 1.68) and standard deviation (SD = 2.30) indicates the highly variable wave energy regimes of this locality. The quartiles of distribution were calculated and results show that the lower <b>quartile,</b> median and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles</b> are 0.206, 0.644 and 1.52 kW/m, respectively.

30|$|Variations {{in power}} flux {{for the region}} of Tamarin is {{presented}} in Fig. 10 a and statistical analysis shows a mean power flux of around 0.484 kW/m with a peak value of 9.54 kW/m, indicative of the lower potential of this site as {{compared to that of}} Flic-en-Flac. The coefficient of variation (CV = 1.85) and standard deviation (SD = 0.894) reflects the relatively stable wave energy conditions prevailing at Tamarin as compared to that of Flic-en-Flac. The lower, median and <b>upper</b> <b>quartiles</b> of distribution was found to be 0.07, 0.133 and 0.426 kW/m, respectively, showing that the major portion of the distribution for wave energy computations at Tamarin lies significantly lower than that at Flic-en-Flac. Similar to the distribution observed at Flic-en-Flac, the region of Tamarin shows positively skewed distribution (3.86) and is characterized as leptokurtic (23.3).|$|R

Correlation between variables was measured using Spearman’s ρ. For biomarker levels, the association between biomarker quartile and the outcome of interest was assessed by linear-by-linear association. To determine whether syndecan- 1 levels were independently associated with in-hospital mortality, multivariable logistic regression was done and included age and APACHE II score, which are independent predictors of mortality, as covariates [31, 38 – 41].
