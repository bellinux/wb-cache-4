40|$|Japan's {{imperial}} {{history and}} its narrow self-interested post-WWII policies caused much animosity in Eastern Asia, yet its improved {{relations in the}} region from the 1980 s onwards, even when assessed from a critical perspective, demand scholarly attention. This dissertation finds improved relations a result of Japan legitimating its regional hegemony. The critical theories of Gramsci (1937) and Habermas (1976) applied within international relations suggest legitimation of hegemonic power {{at the international level}} only occurs when providing 'global public goods'-defined metaphorically with the UNDP's modification of Kindleberger's (1986) work-such that post colonial states achieve rapid economic development to close the rich-poor gap as understood by Strange (1950). Analogous to the enabling notion of Sen's (1974) "positive freedoms," such 'public goods' are needed by states to enable nationalist projects of development, and as such their delivery is seen by Murakami (1996) as the responsibility of hegemonic powers of the day. In order to assess 'global public goods' the dissertation deploys Susan Strange's (1988 a) framework of 'structural power. ' Within the knowledge structure, it is shown that Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda's 1977 doctrine successfully guided policy towards improving regional relations in Eastern Asia. On the economic side, the Fukuda Doctrine provided 'global public goods' in knowledge by deploying Japan's own experience of 'developmentalism' for the Eastern Asian region thus countering neo-liberalism of the "Washington Consensus," while it also assisted in the transfer of appropriate and absorbable technology. The provision of 'global public goods' over the 1980 s put Eastern Asia on course to catch-up with industrialised nations as Japanese firms, aided by a rising yen, went on to invest in the region. These firms began to transfer production bases from Japan, such {{that by the end of}} the 1990 s each of these post colonial states saw their manufactured exports leading to economic growth rates that put them on a path to catch-up to Japan and other industrialised nations in time. In military security terms, Japan continued its pacific and defensive military posture thus calming a volatile region to enable economic development. Tokyo also pushed for collective regional security, while tacitly supporting the <b>upgrading</b> <b>of</b> <b>post</b> colonial Eastern Asia's own defence capabilities. The implications of the dissertation are that Japan's success in improving its regional relations places it in the international system as a responsible self-interested power to be emulated by other powers interested in a peaceful world, thus contributing to scholarship in international relations, development and history...|$|E
50|$|Before 1981, {{the prison}} {{officers}} in all provinces of Pakistan {{used to wear}} khaki colour uniforms as worn by the Pakistan Army. During the regime of Chief Martial Law Administrator, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, some army officers objected to the wearing of army-type uniforms by the prison officials and suggested that the police type uniforms should be prescribed for them. Thus a meeting {{was held in the}} Federal Ministry of Interior, Islamabad, and the pattern of uniform for prison officials was changed from military to that of police. On 2 May 2009, Chief Justice of Pakistan, Mr. Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry visited Central Jail Lahore. On 21 September 2009, on the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr, the Chief Justice visited Central Jail Rawalpindi. Besides passing various orders respecting management of prisons and prisoners during the said visits of jails, he issued verbal directions to the concerned authorities of Punjab Government for upgrading the pay scales of the prison officers in the Punjab and for doubling of their pay. Later, Khawaja Muhammad Sharif, Chief Justice, Lahore High Court, Lahore took suo moto notice of the case and issued directions to the provincial Government for the <b>upgrading</b> <b>of</b> <b>posts</b> <b>of</b> incumbents of the prisons department to make them at par with the equivalent ranks of Police. On 26 September 2009, Government of the Punjab, Home Department, Lahore issued notification through which the Pay Scales and Uniform Badges of Prison Officers in Punjab were made equivalent to the Punjab Police for all ranks.|$|R
