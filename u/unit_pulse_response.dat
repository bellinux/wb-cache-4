40|$|A unit {{hydrograph}} (UH) of a watershed {{may be viewed}} as the <b>unit</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function of a linear system. In recent years, the use of probability distribution functions (pdfs) for determining a UH has received much attention. In this study, a nonlinear optimization model is developed to transmute a UH into a pdf. The potential of six popular pdfs, namely two-parameter gamma, two-parameter Gumbel, two-parameter log-normal, two-parameter normal, three-parameter Pearson distribution, and two-parameter Weibull is tested on data from the Lighvan catchment in Iran. The probability distribution parameters are determined using the nonlinear least squares optimization method in two ways: (1) optimization by programming in Mathematica; and (2) optimization by applying genetic algorithm. The results are compared with those obtained by the traditional linear least squares method. The results show comparable capability and performance of two nonlinear methods. The gamma and Pearson distributions are the most successful models in preserving the rising and recession limbs of the unit hydographs. The log-normal distribution has a high ability in predicting both the peak flow and time to peak of the {{unit hydrograph}}. The nonlinear optimization method does not outperform the linear least squares method in determining the UH (especially for excess rainfall of one pulse), but is comparable...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} speech {{processing}} is presented. The method {{does not require}} voiced/unvoiced or pitch determination. It models the sampled speech wave as a concatenation of initial segments of unit pulse responses of linear, time-invariant, recursive discrete time systems. The poles of the systems are calculated by Prony's method applied to blocks of speech samples. The zeroes are chosen to zero the error between the speech wave and the first output samples of each system. The analysis phase proceeds as follows. After an initial block of <b>unit</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>response,</b> the system output samples are compared with the speech samples and the system continues to function until the error between the two grows too large. At this time the next block of samples {{is used to calculate}} a new system and the process continues. The parameters describing the speech are thus the system parameters (poles and zeroes, for example) and the number of output samples taken from each system. This information is quantized to produce a bit rate for the process of 20 kilobits/second. The approximate speech is synthesized by implementing each system sequentially, applying a pulse to the input and concatenating the required number of output samples to the samples from previous systems. The speech obtained is very noisy, but it is intelligible and speakers can be recognized. A demonstration tape is available from Dr. T. W. Parks of the Electrical Engineering Department.

40|$|With {{the steady}} {{progress}} of high performance electronic systems, {{the complexity of}} the electronic systems grows continuously and new features like high-speed, low power and low cost, become the key issues. The interconnection in the electronic systems distributes the power, clock and transfers the electrical signals among numerous components. As the feature size of microelectronic technology becomes smaller, the design and analysis of the interconnection are more important for the performance and cost of the system. The escape routing design is a new important problem in the interconnection design because the number of chip/package input/output (I/O) pins has continuously been growing for high-speed high-performance system. The traditional escape routing strategy and several improvements, pins/pads special placement and routing resource exploration, could not handle large number of I/Os efficiently and usually require increased cost. We introduce a novel concept, escape sequence, develop efficient escape routing strategies based on the new concept and model the escaping wires using 3 D extraction. For square grid array, we formulate and solve a maximum flow problem to analyze the escape bottleneck in area array. The layer count can be decreased dramatically by optimizing the I/O escape sequence. Two new escape routing strategies, central triangular escape routing and two-sided escape routing, are proposed and the number of escape routing layers could be reduced dramatically. We implement an automatic escape routing program to verify our analysis and to compare different escape sequence strategies. The escaping wires could be modeled as frequency dependent RLGC circuit for signal performance analysis. For hexagonal area array, we analyze its preponderant properties that the hexagonal array could increase the density of I/Os in the array remarkably. We propose three escape routing strategies for the hexagonal array: column-by-column horizontal escape routing, two- sided horizontal/vertical escape routing, and multi- direction hybrid channel escape routing. We can escape I/ Os in the hexagonal array in the same or less number of routing layers compared with square grid array. Therefore, we could reduce the number of escape routing layers as well as increase the density of I/Os. The eye diagram prediction is an important problem in the interconnection analysis because an eye diagram provides the most fundamental and intuitive view to evaluate the signal quality of high-speed communication. The traditional method to obtain the eye diagram involves performing a time domain simulation. It requires a very long simulation time and usually could not accurately characterize the communication systems because the limited length pseudorandom bit sequence (PRBS) as the input stimulus. Several eye diagram prediction methods, analytical techniques, analysis based on <b>unit</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> and analysis based on step response, have their application constraints because of their assumptions and usually could not handle general systems. We introduce an efficient and accurate method, the accumulative prediction method, to predict the eye diagram for high-speed signaling systems. We use the step response of the signaling system to extract the worst-case eye diagram, including the eye opening and timing jitter. Furthermore, this method generates the input data patterns which produce the worst- case inter-symbol interference. The main advantage is that this general-purpose method can handle signals with asymmetric as well as symmetric rise/fall time. Furthermore, {{the complexity of the}} proposed method is linear O(n), where n is the number of time points of step response. This method can be applied to analyze the signal performance in escape routing. It is very useful to analyze various high speed signaling system...|$|E

The space charge sign and the electric field distribution E(x) in MCz Si p+-n(TD) -n+ detectors irradiated by 24 GeV/c protons were analyzed using the data on the current <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> and the Double Peak (DP) electric field distribution model for heavily irradiated detectors. The approach considers an irradiated detector as a structure with three regions in which the electric field depends on the coordinate, and the induced current <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> arises from the drift process of free carriers in the detector with variable electric field. Reconstruction of the E(x) profile from the <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> shapes is performed employing a new method for DP electric field reconstruction.

40|$|Animals use {{behaviors}} to actively sample the environment {{across a broad}} spectrum of sensory domains. These behaviors discretize the sensory experience into unique spatiotemporal moments, minimize sensory adaptation, and enhance perception. In olfaction, behaviors such as sniffing, antennal flicking, and wing beating all act to periodically expose olfactory epithelium. In mammals, it is thought that sniffing enhances neural representations; however, the effects of insect wing beating on representations remain unknown. To determine how well the antennal lobe produces odor-dependent representations when wing beating effects are simulated, we used extracellular methods to record neural units and local field potentials (LFPs) from moth antennal lobe. We recorded responses to odors presented as prolonged continuous stimuli or periodically as 20 and 25 Hz pulse trains designed to simulate the oscillating effects of wing beating around the antennae during odor-guided flight. Using spectral analyses, we show that ~ 25 % of all recorded units were able to entrain to pulsed stimuli; this includes pulsed blanks, which elicited the strongest overall entrainment. The strength of entrainment to pulse train stimuli was dependent on molecular features of the odorants, odor concentration, and pulse train duration. Moreover, <b>units</b> showing <b>pulse</b> tracking <b>responses</b> were highly phase locked to LFPs during odor stimulation, indicating that unit-LFP phase relationships are stimulus-driven. Finally, a Euclidean distance-based population vector analysis established that antennal lobe odor representations are more robust, peak more quickly, and did not show adaptation when odors were presented at the natural wing beat frequency as opposed to prolonged continuous stimulation. These results suggest a general strategy for optimizing olfactory representations, which exploits the natural rhythmicity of wing beating by integrating mechanosensory and olfactory cues {{at the level of the}} antennal lobe...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{publication}} is to document a simple model of the atmospheric CO 2 concentration based on exogenous input of anthropogenic emission of CO 2 and taking air-sea exchange and biospheric responses into account. The approach described by Joos et al (1996) {{is based on the}} application of a mixed layer <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function. The advantage of using a mixed layer <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function instead of an atmosphere <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function (Siegentaler and Oeschger, 1978; Oeschger and Heimann, 1983; Meier-Reimer and Hasselmann, 1987; Sarmiento et al., 1992) is that it is then possible to represent the non-linear effects of seawater chemistry. As long as the CO 2 increase in the atmosphere is below approximately 50 % of the pre-industrial level, the CO 2 system behaves in a linear way and it is possible to represent the effects of anthropogenic emissions on the atmospheric concentrations by an atmospheric <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function. For CO 2 perturbations beyond this level the non-linear effects of the seawater chemistry becomes important, and it thus becomes necessary to apply a mixed layer <b>pulse</b> <b>response</b> function to obtain accurate results. The approach described in this paper includes changes in CO 2 uptake and release by terrestrial vegetation by CO 2 fertilization, but {{does not take into account}} possible feedback mechanisms of climate change on the carbon cycle. Possible feedbacks include changes in CO 2 solubility due to sea surface temperature (SST) changes and changes in vertical mixing by reduced deep-water formation in the North Atlantic. Joos et al. (1999 a) have estimated the marine part of this to be of minor importance (approximately 4 %) up to 2100, increasing to about 20 % in 2500. Since damage caused by climate change could imply high costs, an accurate representation of the carbon cycle is very important in models that are to be used to estimate the costs of climate and evaluate different mitigation and/or adaptation strategies (Joos et al., 1999 b).
