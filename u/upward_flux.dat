40|$|The nightside {{ionosphere}} of Venus {{is formed}} mostly by day-to-night transport of ions below the ionopause, {{with a small}} contribution from precipitation of energetic electrons from the wake. This nightward flux of ions should result in dayside ionospheres that are characterized by smaller electron density scale heights at high altitudes than those that are characteristic of diffusive equilibrium. In order to determine both the maximum possible values of the <b>upward</b> <b>fluxes</b> and the <b>upward</b> <b>fluxes</b> implied by comparison of our computed ion and electron density profiles to measurements, we have constructed more than 60 models of the high solar activity Venus ionosphere for upward velocity boundary conditions ranging from 0 to 3 × 105 cm s− 1. We show that as the upward velocity {{at the top of}} the model is increased, the high-altitude densities of the atomic ions decrease, as do the total ion and electron densities. The maximum <b>upward</b> O+ <b>flux</b> that we derive is ∼ 5. 3 × 108 cm− 2 s− 1. By comparing our model electron or total ion density profiles to those from Pioneer Venus data, we have derived <b>upward</b> <b>fluxes</b> of O+ that range from 1. 8 × 108 to 2. 5 × 108 cm− 2 s− 1 with an average of 2. 1 × 108 cm− 2 s− 1. This value is roughly equal to estimates of the transterminator ion flux and to estimates of the downward fluxes of ions over the nightside. From this, we infer that the escape flux due to ion outflow is small. We conclude that the <b>upward</b> <b>fluxes</b> of ions that we have inferred from the morphology of the ionosphere contribute mostly to the day-to-night flow and to the formation of the nightside ionosphere and are much less than their source-limited values...|$|R

In this study, the performance of model UPFLOW to estimate <b>upward</b> <b>flux</b> was evaluated. Evaluation of model performance was performed with both graphical display and statistical criteria. In distribution of simulated capillary rise values against observed field data, maximum data points lie around the 1 : 1 line, {{which means that the}} model output is reliable and reasonable.

Depending on the ecosystem, the published number varies between a dozen and several hundred compounds. We present ecosystem exchange fluxes from a mixed oak–hornbeam forest in the Po Valley, Italy. The fluxes were measured by a proton transfer reaction-time-of-flight (PTR-ToF) mass spectrometer and calculated using the eddy covariance (EC) method.

The result showed {{that both the}} 72 h averaged <b>upward</b> <b>flux</b> and downward flux of zonal momentum were negative at nearly each height, meaning that the <b>upward</b> <b>flux</b> was dominated by westward propagating waves while the downward flux was dominated by eastward propagating waves. The magnitude of the downward flux was approximately a factor of 1. 5 larger than the <b>upward</b> <b>flux</b> for waves in the 2 ~ 7 h and 7 ~ 24 h period bands, and about equal to the <b>upward</b> <b>flux</b> in the 10 – 30 min and 30 min– 2 h period bands.

We show that the observations of <b>upward</b> <b>fluxes</b> of HNO 3 (g+p) and ?PNs during summer are consistent with oxidation of NO 2 and acetaldehyde by OH with the product of concentration and residence time equal to 1. 1 × 10 10 molec OH cm ? 3 s, e. g. 3 × 10 7 molecules cm ? 3 OH for a 400 s canopy residence time. We show that ?AN (g+p) fluxes are consistent with this same OH if the reaction of OH with ?ANs produces either HNO 3 or NO 2 in 6 ? 30 % yield. Calculations of NO fluxes constrained by the NO 2 observations and the inferred OH indicate that NO x fluxes are downward into the canopy because of the substantial conversion of NO x to HNO 3 and ?PNs in the canopy. Even so, we derive that NO x emission fluxes of ~ 15 ng(N) m ? 2 s ? 1 at midday during summer are required to balance the NO x and NO y flux budgets. These fluxes are partly explained by estimates of soil emissions (estimated to be between 3 and 6 ng(N) m ? 2 s ? 1). One possibility {{for the remainder of the}} NO x source is large HONO emissions. Alternatively, the 15 ng(N) m ? 2 s ? 1 emission estimate may be too large, and the budget balanced if the deposition of HNO 3 and ?PNs is slower than we estimate, if there are large errors in either our understanding of peroxy radical chemistry, or our assumptions that the budget is required to balance because the fluxes do not obey similarity theory...|$|R

The smallest deposition fluxes and v(d) were measured in dry conditions (- 42 ng m(- 2) s(- 1) and 3. 5 mm s(- 1), resp.), which represented 57 % of all cases. Wet canopies were more efficient sinks for SO 2 and a dew-wetted canopy had a smaller v(d) (6 mm s(- 1)) than a rain-wetted canopy (ca 10 mm s(- 1)). Seasonal variability reflected differences in chemical climate or canopy buffering properties. During the summer half-year when surface acidity was low due to higher NH 3 /SO 2 ratios, a higher deposition efficiency (v(d) /v(dmax)) and lower non-stomatal resistance (R-w) were observed compared to winter conditions. Comparisons of R-c for different combinations of canopy wetness and surface acidity categories emphasized the importance of both factors in regulating the non-stomatal sinks of SO 2. Increased surface water acidity gradually led to a lower v(d) /v(dmax) and an increased R-c for all considered canopy wetness categories. The smallest v(d) /v(dmax) ratio and highest R-c were obtained for a dry canopy with high surface acidity. Conversely, a rain-wetted canopy was the most efficient sink for SO 2.

As such, this research seeks to explore a novel approach of forecasting short-term northern polar stratospheric variability using a hierarchy of linear and non-linear statistical models. In addition to El Niño Southern Oscillation, the Quasi-biennial Oscillation, and the 11 -year solar cycle indices, this research uses the <b>upward</b> <b>flux</b> of wave activity from the troposphere into the stratosphere as a predictor for modeling and forecasting northern polar stratospheric temperature and geopotential height anomalies. The <b>upward</b> <b>flux</b> of wave activity entering the stratosphere is the primary source of intraseasonal variability in the wintertime stratospheric polar vortex. Multiple linear regression and machine learning models were trained over the 1980 - 2005 time period, and the 10 -day and 20 -day northern polar stratospheric temperature and geopotential height forecasts were generated over the 2005 - 2011 time period. The importance of each predictor for modeling northern polar stratospheric variability was assessed using a permutation-based method. The study has found that the use of the meridional wave heat flux predictors improves the accuracy of short-term northern polar stratospheric geopotential height forecasts as demonstrated by the correlation coefficient of 0. 48 over the 2005 - 2011 time period. In contrast to previous studies, multiple linear regression shows better predictive performance than the machine learning models over the 2005 - 2011 time period. A better predictive performance of multiple linear regression in comparison to machine learning models is due to a much higher contribution of the <b>upward</b> <b>flux</b> of wave activity than other predictors to forecast skill...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} analyzer aboard Imp 7 examined energy spectra of positive ions in certain streaming plasmas {{adjacent to the}} plasma sheet and within the geomagnetic tail at geocentric radial distances of about 35 R-E, revealing minor, though often persistent, secondary maxima of intensities with energy per unit charge a factor of 16 {{greater than that of}} the maxima corresponding to the dominant H(+) ions. The secondary maximum at higher E/Q was identified as a small flux of singly ionized atomic oxygen O(+), from the ionosphere. O(+) fluxes in the geomagnetic tail were about 10 to the 5 th/(sq cm s) and imply O(+) <b>upward</b> <b>fluxes</b> in the upper ionosphere of about 10 to the 8 th/(sq cm s). The kinetic energy of the oxygen ions is about 1 - 5 keV, while estimates of the global escape of the ions are about 3 x 10 to the 6 th kg/yr...|$|R
40|$|Lake Kivu {{is one of}} {{the large}} African Rift lakes {{situated}} between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda. In its permanently stratified hypolimnion, unusually high methane concentrations have increased further in recent decades. Because methanogenesis is, in part, dependent on supply of organic material from the photic zone, it is necessary to quantify <b>upward</b> nutrient <b>fluxes</b> from the saline, nutrient-rich deep waters. These <b>upward</b> <b>fluxes</b> are mainly driven by advection caused by subaquatic springs. Biogenic calcite precipitation drives surface-water depletion and deep-water enrichment of Ca 2 +, Sr 2 +, and Ba 2 +. Methane is mainly oxidized aerobically at the redox interface at 60 m, with a small contribution of anaerobic methane oxidation. A subaquatic spring that sustains the major chemocline at 250 m depth was depleted of N, P, and CH 4, and concentrations of major ions were slightly lower than in the lake water of the same depth. Enrichment of the deep waters with nutrients and CH 4 are driven by mineralization of settling organic material, whereas SiO 2 is influenced by uptake and mineralization of diatoms and inputs through subaquatic springs. Dissolved inorganic phosphorus and Si fluxes supplied by internal loading through upwelling were found to be lower than the estimations for Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika. In contrast, N flux was within the lower range for Lake Malawi, whereas it was assumed to be totally lost by denitrification in Lake Tanganyika. In Lake Kivu, nutrient uptake b...|$|R
