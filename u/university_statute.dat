500|$|The {{position}} of Laudian Professor of Arabic at the University of Oxford {{was established in}} 1636 by William Laud, {{who at the time}} was Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Archbishop of Canterbury. The first professor was Edward Pococke, who was working as a chaplain in Aleppo in what is now Syria when Laud asked him to return to Oxford to take up the position. Laud's regulations for the professorship required lectures on Arabic grammar and literature to be delivered weekly during university vacations and Lent. He also provided that the professor's lectures were to be attended by all medical students and Bachelors of Arts at the university, although this seems not to have happened since Pococke had few students, despite the provision for non-attenders to be fined. In 1881, a <b>university</b> <b>statute</b> repealed Laud's regulations and provided that the professor was to lecture in [...] "the Arabic, Syriac, and Chaldee Languages", and attached the professorship to a fellowship at St John's College.|$|E
500|$|After {{reforms of}} the {{university}} {{during the second half}} of the 19th century, a <b>university</b> <b>statute</b> of 1881 set out the professor's duties and entitlements, and who should form the board appointing a new professor. It stated that [...] "The Laudian Professor of Arabic shall lecture and give instruction on the Arabic, Syriac, and Chaldee Languages." [...] The professor was to be appointed by a board consisting of the Secretary of State for India, the President of St John's College, Oxford, the Regius Professor of Hebrew, the Boden Professor of Sanskrit and Bodley's Librarian. [...] The chair was attached to a fellowship at St John's College, which would contribute £450 towards the professor's income. Sir Hamilton Gibb was the first Laudian Professor to be a fellow of St John's; although David Margoliouth, his predecessor, was appointed after the statute came into force, he stayed at New College where he was already a fellow. [...] Before the 1881 statute, the professor remained at the college (if any) with which he had links before his appointment.|$|E
