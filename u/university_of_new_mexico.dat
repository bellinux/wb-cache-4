5|$|Hewett {{suspended}} {{his research}} during Judd's 1924–27 excavation of Pueblo Bonito, {{financed by the}} National Geographic Society, but returned to Chetro Ketl in 1929 with graduate students from his newly founded Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico.</b> He studied the canyon until 1935, and several Chaco scholars worked for or with him during this period, including Gordon Vivian (father of R. Gwinn Vivian), Edwin Ferdon, Paul Reiter, and Florence M. Hawley. Hewett's methods have been widely criticized, and his work judged to have been substandard, particularly {{in comparison to the}} work done by the National Geographic Project. He spent several years excavating Chetro Ketl, but never published a detailed account of his research there. Despite this, much is known about his studies from the theses and dissertations written by students who worked with him.|$|E
5|$|Several {{minerals}} {{used for}} paint pigments were excavated from Chetro Ketl, including charcoal, shale, malachite, iron oxides, hematite, limonite, gypsum, and azurite. Twined sandals, and bones from the ferruginous hawk {{and the great}} horned owl have been found there. The relative lack of exotic material uncovered at Chetro Ketl, such as shells, copper bells, and macaw feathers, may indicate its lesser importance compared to Pueblo Bonito, where those items {{have been found in}} abundance. Because Chetro Ketl has only been partially excavated definitive conclusions remain elusive. In 1937, W. W. Postlethwaite, who had for three seasons directed Hewett's excavation of Chetro Ketl's great kiva, oversaw the final work at the site conducted by the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> and the School of American Research.|$|E

The Wolf Pack accepted their invitation with a 7–4 record in their first eleven games of the season, while the Wildcats accepted their invitation after finishing the regular season at 7–5.

40|$|Presented at the Medical Library Association 2007 Annual Meeting, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, May 21, 2007, 10 : 30 am. Objective: To {{increase}} the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico's</b> current manuscript contribution rate of zero to PubMed Central {{in accordance with}} the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Enhanced Public Access Policy (the Policy) by (1) determining investigators’ awareness of and perceived barriers to compliance with the Policy, (2) developing a range of library-based interventions to support investigator compliance with the Policy, and (3) measuring the effectiveness of the interventions. Methods: The authors developed a PubMed query to measure the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico’s</b> overall (7. 7 %) and investigator-submitted (0) contribution rate to PubMed Central {{in accordance with the}} Policy. The authors surveyed all (128) <b>of</b> the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico’s</b> 2002 - 2005 NIH-funded investigators to ascertain their knowledge, acceptance, and perceived barriers to Policy compliance. The authors used the data to identify promotional, educational, and service activities the library could implement to increase policy compliance. Library faculty ranked the recommendations in order of their potential effort and impact, and the authors developed a strategy for implementing the highest ranked recommendations. The PubMed query will be used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} these efforts by comparing the pre- and post-intervention contribution rates. 	 Results: The survey results demonstrate the importance of library support of the Policy and larger scholarly communication issues. As a result, the library included the creation of a scholarly communication support center in its 2007 - 2009 strategic plan. The new center will help researchers {{increase the}} impact of their scholarly work by integrating information dissemination protocols into the research process. Library faculty will implement these strategies in the newly created master's of science in clinical research program that is a part <b>of</b> the <b>University</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>Mexico's</b> Clinical and Translational Sciences Center...|$|R
