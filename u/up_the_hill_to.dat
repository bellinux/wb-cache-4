5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> meet him.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild {{began work}} on Waddesdon Manor, a short {{distance}} south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into the hill {{to provide access to}} the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south to the foot of Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> a gully close to the building site. Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Battalion {{had walked}} into a {{prepared}} North Korean ambush, suffering a bombardment of mortar and machine gun fire from prepared and hidden North Korean positions, and almost its entire command group was eliminated within a minute of the first shot being fired. L Company, at the pass, was heavily engaged with the North Korean forces higher on the hill. The company's 1st Platoon sustained a direct assault on its foxholes, with {{two members of the}} company killed by bayonets. L Company was separated {{from the rest of the}} battalion by North Korean forces advancing on its position further up the ridge. K Company attempted to move up to relieve it but was unable to do so. However, the company held in place. Meanwhile, I Company began moving <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> provide support. North Korean forces were able to cut the battalion into disorganized groups, with L Company engaging forces in the pass and I Company under attack from forces on the north ridge behind them. By noon, the North Korean forces on the higher ground had enveloped the American forces.|$|E

5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{compensation}} system involves the start gate position. If the gate is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete has jumped, then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions the gate was moved up, or awarded additional points for the gate being lowered. In variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on. In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E
25|$|The first troops {{advancing}} toward French {{lines were}} the thirteen companies of grenadiers and some 200 {{soldiers of the}} Royal Americans. Fire from the Montreal militia stalled their advance <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the entrenchments above.|$|E
25|$|A ford {{crossed the}} river at this point, the road then running <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> West Lambroughton. This was an {{important}} crossing as no bridge, road or ford existed at Chapeltoun until possibly {{the time of the}} building of Chapelton House in the 1850s.|$|E
60|$|It lay {{in sheets}} round the line. It ran <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dark pines. It rioted over the brown sandbars of the swollen rivers, and faded away by mile after {{mile to the}} shores of the leaden sea. The high-peaked houses of brown thatch stood knee-deep in it, and it surged <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> factory {{chimneys}} of Osaka.|$|R
60|$|Taking the troops, {{which were}} now {{commanded}} by General Stuart, {{a man of}} very different stamp from D’Aubant, Nelson landed them on the 19th June without opposition at a narrow inlet three miles {{and a half from}} the town. A body of seamen were also landed under Will. These instantly began, as at Bastia, to get <b>the</b> guns <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> form a battery.|$|R
5000|$|Huston and {{his crew}} were {{attached}} to the U.S. Army’s 143rd Regiment of the 36th Division. Unlike many other military documentaries, it was claimed Huston’s cameramen filmed alongside the infantrymen as they fought their way <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> reach San Pietro. Huston's claim that the film was made during the battle was proven false {{by the research of}} Peter Maslowski in his 1993 book, Armed With Cameras ...|$|R
25|$|Guanyin, {{after having}} a {{discussion}} with Shancai, decided to test the boy's resolve to fully study the Buddhist teachings.

"Oh--none in particular," [...] he answered, {{thoroughly}} {{sick and}} tired, his thoughts again reverting to Alfredston, {{and the train}} {{he did not go}} by; the probable disappointment of Sue that he was not there when she arrived, and the missed pleasure of her company on the long and lonely climb by starlight <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> Marygreen.

25|$|A sizable {{section of}} the town wall survives, {{stretching}} from the château in the lower town, <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> surround the upper town. Medieval citizens in the lower town were outside the fortifications and had to retreat into the fortress in times of trouble. The gate of the 15th century with a double drawbridge presents many defenses including moats, embrasures, machicolations, etc., and a protective Virgin turned outwards. It is the only fortified town gate which is left.|$|E
25|$|It took {{thirty-five years}} for Netzer to {{identify}} the exact location, but on May 7, 2007, an Israeli team of archaeologists of Hebrew University, led by Netzer, announced they had discovered the tomb.

The tomb contained a broken sarcophagus but no remains of a body.|$|E

25|$|An {{extensive}} area of parkland stretches <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> {{the west}} of the house. Some of the trees planted by Joseph Stubs are still present, although coming to the end of their lives. The formal garden is still there and a garden for the disabled has been constructed by Frodsham Round Table. In the park there are play facilities for children. The coach house has been developed into the Castle Park Arts Centre which has a small café and showrooms for the arts. Other outbuildings are now used as offices for small businesses. The park and gardens have been designated at GradeII in the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.|$|E
25|$|In 1505 Lisbon {{was being}} ravaged by the plague, which had arrived by ship from Italy. The {{king and the}} court were even forced to flee Lisbon for a while. The site of São Roque, outside the city walls (now an area known as the Bairro Alto), became a {{cemetery}} for plague victims. At {{the same time the}} king of Portugal, Dom Manuel I (reigned 1495–1521), sent to Venice for a relic of St. Roch, the patron saint of plague victims, whose body had been translated to that city in 1485. The relic was sent by the Venetian government, and it was carried in procession <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the plague cemetery.|$|E
25|$|A young William Bligh, {{the future}} captain of , later {{claimed to have}} been {{watching}} with a spyglass from Resolution as Cook's body was dragged <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the town where it was torn to pieces. In fact, Cook's remains were treated differently: the high esteem in which the islanders held Cook caused them to retain his body. Following their practice of the time, they prepared his body with funerary rituals usually reserved for the chiefs and highest elders of the society. The body was disembowelled, baked to facilitate removal of the flesh, and the bones were carefully cleaned for preservation as religious icons. Some of Cook's remains, thus preserved, were eventually returned to his crew for a formal burial at sea.|$|E

He also lectured them on logic and metaphysics. in 1894, he was transferred to Ranchi, where he was named in 1896 an instructor to the Third Years. In the meantime, His letters and reports from India continued to be in numerous missionary periodicals across Europe.|$|R
5000|$|In British practice, railway {{directions}} {{are usually}} described as up and down, with up being towards a major location. This convention is applied {{not only to}} the trains and the tracks, but also to items of lineside equipment and to areas near a track. Since British trains run on the left, the [...] "up" [...] side of a line is on the left when proceeding in the [...] "up" [...] direction. The names originate from the early railways, where trains would run <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mines, and down to the ports.|$|R

"Then, too, {{they will}} be sending great numbers of men <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hills,</b> <b>to</b> cut timber and {{branches}} for their embankments, their breastworks, {{and the construction of}} the wattles to protect their machines. We shall be in hiding and, when a party of men separates from the rest, we will fall upon these; we will harass their workers from a distance, always avoiding a regular combat, but hindering their work, and wearing them out. Thus we may do better service, to the defenders of Gamala, than if we were within the walls.|$|R
25|$|In 1910 Ainsworth Hall was {{constructed}} for the United States Weather Bureau as its central Vermont station. Later {{returned to the}} university in 1948, it served as the Administrative Headquarters of the campus. By 1955, growth of the University forced the relocation of the Administration back <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> Dewey Hall. When also in 1955 construction began on Webb Hall to the immediate west of the building, the infirmary moved into the now empty structure. Due to expansion of the university in the 1960s and 1970s the building was converted into {{the home of the}} Division of Social Sciences. The building is named for Mrs. Laura Ainsworth, widow of Captain James E. Ainsworth (NU 1853), who in 1915 worked to bring an infirmary to campus.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, {{the army}} awarded 24 Medals of Honor to {{participants}} in the fight on the bluffs for bravery, most for risking their lives to carry water from the river <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the wounded. Few on the non-Indian side questioned {{the conduct of the}} enlisted men, but many questioned the tactics, strategy and conduct of the officers. Indian accounts spoke of soldiers' panic-driven flight and suicide by those unwilling to fall captive to the Indians. While such stories were gathered by Thomas Bailey Marquis in a book in the 1930s, it was not published until 1976 because of the unpopularity of such assertions. Although soldiers may have believed captives would be tortured, Indians usually killed men outright and took as captive for adoption only young women and children. Indian accounts also noted the bravery of soldiers who fought to the death.|$|E
25|$|The {{remaining}} Confederate {{force on}} the road <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the Pass consisted of a detachment of 20 dismounted cavalrymen under Capt. George M. Emack from the 1st Maryland Cavalry Battalion, along with a single cannon. As Union troopers from the 5th Michigan Cavalry approached Emack's men, the cannon opened fire and eight of the Marylanders conducted a mounted charge into {{the head of the}} Union column. In the dark and the heavy rain, the Union cavalrymen were taken by surprise and many of them retreated in panic. The Confederate cavalrymen dismounted and took up positions {{on both sides of the}} road. When the Federals returned, Emack's men waited patiently until they were about 10 yards away and opened fire. The Union cavalrymen were convinced they were opposed by a much larger force. While this standoff continued, Ewell's wagons were moving as swiftly as possible to get out of range of the Union cavalry threat.|$|E
