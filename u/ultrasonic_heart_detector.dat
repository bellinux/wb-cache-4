40|$|A {{portable}} <b>ultrasonic</b> fetal <b>heart</b> <b>detector,</b> Heart-tone Model USD-I (Aloka Co. Ltd., Tokyo), with a 2. 25 MHz probe {{was used}} {{for a study of}} pregnancy diagnosis in swine. The animals to be examined were placed lying on the pen floor with neither fixation nor anesthesia. The probe was gently applied on the skin of the lower abdomen or the flank. Ultrasonic Doppler signals based on the fetal circulation were heard by the operator {{and at the same time}} recorded on magnetic tapes to aid fetal heart rate calculation. The maternal circulation was easily distinguishable from the fetal circulation by the considerably slower rhythm of the former. The accuracy of diagnosis was based on delivery. A total of 83 experiments were carried out on 70 sows of 4 different breeds from 22 days post-coitum to the full term. Before 30 days post-coitum, the accuracy rate for pregnancy diagnosis was not satisfactory (58. 3 %). However, it became higher during the period from 30 to 39 days (81. 8 %). After 40 days of pregnancy, the accuracy rate of diagnosis reached 100 percent. The earliest detection of pregnancy by this method was in a case of 26 days after copulation. A highly significant negative correlation was observed between the fetal heart rate and the fetal age. The correlation coefficient was- 0. 87 (P< 0. 01). The fetal heart rate became slower in a negative linear regression as gestation progressed; Y= 252. 6 - 0. 572 X (X=Fetal age, Y=Fetal heart rate) ...|$|R

40|$|The initial {{three years}} of a 10 -year {{reproductive}} study of elk involved three major phases. A fourth was added because of convenience. Objective 1 was to ascertain pregnancy rates in yearling and mature elk by rectal palpation, associate these rates with subsequent fall cow/calf ratios, and to test concurrently an <b>ultrasonic</b> fetal <b>heart</b> <b>detector.</b> Rectally observed anatomical changes in gravid uteri of cattle were directly applicable to elk. Ultrasonic detections of pregnancies in elk and deer were unsuccessful. Pregnancy rates in the 1969 - 70 winter of 100 and 0 percent, respectively, for 19 adult and five yearling elk were associated with subsequent pre- and post-season cow/calf ratios of 100 / 55 and 100 / 68. Pregnancy rates the next winter of 82 and 17 percent, respectively, for 60 adults and 23 yearlings resulted in pre- and post-season cow/calf ratios of 100 / 52 and 100 / 39. Pregnancy rates in the 1971 - 72 winter were 82 and eight percent, respectively, for 39 adults and 13 yearlings; compilation of data for the first {{three years of}} the study precluded inclusion of associated fall and winter cow/calf ratios. Objective 2 was to determine the breeding efficiency of yearling male elk. Pregnancy rates were 86 and 93 percent, respectively, in 14 yearling-bred cows and 15 adult-bred cows in 1971. Rectal palpations revealed eight of 12 conceived in October from yearling breeding and 10 of 14 in September from adult breeding. A peak in yearling breeding was estimated to have occurred between October 11 and October 25, as compared to two peaks in adult breeding estimated near September 5 and September 20, The earliest and latest conceptions were estimated near October 5 and November 21, and September 5 and November 3, respectively, in yearling and adult bred cows. Most wild and captive yearlings polished or began peeling their antlers about October 1. compared to August 15 for captive adults. Data suggested recrudescent testicular tissues had initiated a rise in blood androgen, which coincided with a peak in breeding activity in September and October. lnducement of twin births in Objective 3 was attempted via synchronized superovulations during the September rut in 1970. Progestogen implants were used from 14 to 20 days to synchronize elk in two pre-rut trials and one mid-rut trial. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) suspended in carboxy-methyl-cellulose (CMC), injected (intramuscular) coincident with implant removal was judged superior to pregnant mares serum (PMS) alone or FSH in peanut oil. Injections of FSH in anestrous elk produced a mean of 2. 4 follicles and corpora lutea (CL) (2. 0 follicles and 1. 33 CL), the first week, and PMS produced a mean of 9. 67 follicles and CL (8. 67 follicles and 1. 5 CL) response was low in a pre-rut trial with two levels of FSH in peanut oil. No conceptions apparently occurred in two groups of six cows injected with 15 and 20 milligrams FSH. Nine of 12 adults (including three of four controls) and none of four remaining yearlings were estimated to have conceived between September 30 and October 15 (five to 20 days after the treatment period), Two additional yearlings were superovulated with FSH without synchronization, but did not conceive. Data presented from blood analyses in Objective 4 included mean values for free-ranging mature elk (probability value indicates a significant difference between free-ranging and captive mature elk).

30|$|From a {{resource}} management perspective, extra high quality scans are ‘overexposed’ and present {{an opportunity to}} decrease radiopharmaceutical dose and/or scan-time. Although all cameras register higher count rates in smaller patients, only the D-SPECT capitalizes on this by shortening scan duration, thanks to its scan strategy that targets LV counts rather than a predetermined exposure time. The D-SPECT scan times could potentially be shortened even further for smaller hearts by targeting count density rather than total counts. LV volume might be estimated from the pre-scan. BMI input could further refine count-targets because improved <b>heart</b> <b>detector</b> proximity and less scatter in smaller patients could allow scan completion with lower than normal count-density. Currently, the Spectrum Dynamics recommends outlining the pre-scan LV with generous margins. As this study indicates, a tighter LV margin will increase count-rate by concentrating the CPFOV.

In order to achieve a high level of accuracy by the detector, the measured ECG signal must be free of noise. Typically, such noise originates from power line interferences and baseline wandering. To eliminate these noises, the ECG signal must be processed using the signal processing method. The ECG detection process can be divided into a preprocessing stage, which eliminates noise from the raw ECG signal, and the feature extraction stage, which extracts the QRS complex for heart rate calculation.

As these detectors progress to even better sensitivity, they will encounter measurement limits imposed {{by the laws of}} quantum mechanics.

Minimizing this quantum backaction noise and nonfundamental, or technical, noise requires an information efficient measurement. Here we integrate a microwave cavity optomechanical system and a nearly noiseless amplifier into an interferometer to achieve an imprecision below the SQL. As the microwave interferometer is naturally operated at cryogenic temperatures, the thermal motion of the oscillator is minimized, yielding an excellent force detector with a sensitivity of 0. 51 aN/rt(Hz).

PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-one American Society of Anesthesiologists III patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization. INTERVENTIONS: A perivascular ultrasonic flow probe (Linton Instrumentation, Norfolk, UK) was placed around the LIMA and saphenous vein graft after coronary anastomosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Immediately before and at 5 -minute intervals for 15 minutes after starting the infusion, blood flow was measured in the LIMA and one saphenous vein graft using a transit time <b>ultrasonic</b> flow probe. <b>Heart</b> rate, blood pressure, and central venous pressure were documented at these time points.

5000|$|It {{is often}} said that the Schottky diode is a [...] "majority carrier" [...] {{semiconductor}} device. This means that if the semiconductor body is a doped n-type, only the n-type carriers (mobile electrons) {{play a significant role}} in normal operation of the device. The majority carriers are quickly injected into the conduction band of the metal contact on the other side of the diode to become free moving electrons. Therefore, no slow random recombination of n and p type carriers is involved, so that this diode can cease conduction faster than an ordinary p-n rectifier diode. This property in turn allows a smaller device area, which also makes for a faster transition. This is another reason why Schottky diodes are useful in switch-mode power converters: the high speed of the diode means that the circuit can operate at frequencies in the range 200 kHz to 2 MHz, allowing the use of small inductors and capacitors with greater efficiency than would be possible with other diode types.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundMother-infant bonding is the {{earliest}} and most critical social relationship of mammalian infants. To promote this bond, infants have innate behaviors to seek maternal proximity and protest upon separation via {{communication with the}} mother vocally and through body movement. However, the physiological mechanisms regulating these infant behaviors remain largely undefined. ResultsHere we show a novel set of infant cooperative responses during maternal carrying. Infants under 6  months of age carried by a walking mother immediately stopped voluntary movement and crying and exhibited a rapid heart rate decrease, compared with holding by a sitting mother. Furthermore, we identified strikingly similar responses in mouse pups as defined by immobility and diminished <b>ultrasonic</b> vocalizations and <b>heart</b> rate. Using pharmacologic and genetic interventions in mouse pups, we identified the upstream and downstream neural systems regulating the calming response. Somatosensory and proprioceptive input signaling are required for induction, and parasympathetic and cerebellar functions mediate cardiac and motor output, respectively. The loss of the calming response hindered maternal rescue of the pups, suggesting a functional significance for the identified calming response. ConclusionsOur study has demonstrated {{for the first time}} that the infant calming response to maternal carrying is a coordinated set of central, motor, and cardiac regulations and is a conserved component of mammalian mother-infant interactions. Our findings provide evidence for and have the potential to impact current parenting theory and practice, since unsoothable crying is the major risk factor for child abuse. Video Abstrac...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY 24 -hour {{recordings}} of the ECG and respiration, the latter from an impedance technique, have shown a phenomenon which could account for hitherto unexplained failures of impedance apnoea alarm systems. Whenever apnoea is accompanied by bradycardia there is a pronounced increase in the amplitude of the cardiac impulse on the respiration carrier. This imitates the respiration signal and prevents the alarm from sounding. Conversely, apnoea unaccompanied by bradycardia does not present this problem and is detected by the alarm. If impedance alarm systems are {{to be used to}} detect apnoea they must be accompanied by a <b>heart</b> rate (ECG) <b>detector.</b> Impedance alarm systems are widely used for the detection of apnoea in the newborn infant.

The focus of this thesis is the mechanical design of the optics bench assembly of the UV-LED detector. The thesis first briefly describes the technology and operational theory of the new detector and then discusses the considerations when designing the optics bench. The thesis then presents a step by step methodology of mechanical design of the optics bench assembly. Based on functional requirements of the bench, the best suited material which minimizes vibration sensitivity, thermal gradient, distortion due to impact loading, and cost was selected. The optimal wall thickness of the optics bench was determined by analyzing the results of drop test and vibration analysis. Features to isolate the optics bench assembly from vibration, shock, dust and humidity are also discussed. Thermal analysis was carried out {{to find out the}} amount of thermal gradient produced in the optics bench assembly due to thermal heat sources. Based on the results of the thermal analysis, the design of a robust thermal management system is proposed. Guidelines for design for manufacturing, assembly and serviceability were considered at each step of the design process. On the basis of the design requirements and cost considerations, the best suited manufacturing process and surface coating was determined. In conclusion, this thesis offers a foundation and a starting point for the detailed mechanical design of optics bench assembly for UV-LED detector. by Aditya Shankar Prasad. Thesis: M.

40|$|Since {{the birth}} of X-ray astronomy, spectral, spatial and timing {{observation}} improved dramatically, procuring {{a wealth of information}} on the majority of the classes of the celestial sources. Polarimetry, instead, remained basically unprobed. X-ray polarimetry promises to provide additional information procuring two new observable quantities, the degree and the angle of polarization. Polarization from celestial X-ray sources may derive from emission mechanisms themselves such as cyclotron, synchrotron and non-thermal bremsstrahlung, from scattering in aspheric accreting plasmas, such as disks, blobs and columns and from the presence of extreme magnetic field by means of vacuum polarization and birefringence. Matter in strong gravity fields and Quantum Gravity effects can be studied by X-ray polarimetry, too. POLARIX is a mission dedicated to X-ray polarimetry. It exploits the polarimetric response of a Gas Pixel Detector, combined with position sensitivity, that, at the focus of a telescope, results in a huge increase of sensitivity. The <b>heart</b> of the <b>detector</b> is an Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chip with 105, 600 pixels each one containing a full complete electronic chain to image the track produced by the photoelectron. Three Gas Pixel Detectors are coupled with three X-ray optics which are the heritage of JET-X mission. A filter wheel hosting calibration sources unpolarized and polarized is dedicated to each detector for periodic on-ground and in-flight calibration. POLARIX will measure time resolved X-ray polarization with an angular resolution of about 20 arcsec in a field of view of 15 × 15 arcmin and with an energy resolution of 20 % at 6 keV. The Minimum Detectable Polarization is 12 % for a source having a flux of 1 mCrab and 105 s of observing time. The satellite will be placed in an equatorial orbit of 505 km of altitude by a Vega launcher. The telemetry down-link station will be Malindi. The pointing of POLARIX satellite will be gyroless and it will perform a double pointing during the earth occultation of one source, so maximizing the scientific return. POLARIX data are for 75 % open to the community while 25 % + SVP (Science Verification Phase, 1 month of operation) is dedicated to a core program activity open to the contribution of associated scientists. The planned duration of the mission is one year plus three months of commissioning and SVP, suitable to perform most of the basic science within the reach of this instrument. A nice to have idea is to use the same existing mandrels to build two additional telescopes of iridium with carbon coating plus two more detectors. The effective area in this case would be almost doubled...|$|R
40|$|Epilepsy is a {{neurological}} disorder that {{is associated with}} sudden and recurrent seizures. Epilepsy a?ects 65 million people world-wide and is the third most common neurological disorder, after stroke and Alzheimer disease. During an epileptic seizure, the brain endures a transient period of abnormally excessive synchronous activity, leading to a state of havoc for many epileptic patients. Seizures can range from being mild and unnoticeable to extremely violent and life threating. Many epileptic individuals are not able to control their seizures with any form of treatment or therapy. These individuals often experience serious risk of injury, limited independence and mobility, and social isolation. In an attempt to increase {{the quality of life of}} epileptic individuals, much research has been dedicated to developing seizure onset detection systems that are capable of accurately and rapidly detecting signs of seizures. This thesis presents a novel seizure onset detection system that is based on the fusion of independent electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) based decisions. The EEG-based detector relies on a on a common spatial pattern (CSP) -based feature enhancement stage that enables better discrimination between seizure and non-seizure features. The EEG-based detector also introduces a novel classi?cation system that uses logical operators to pool support vector machine (SVM) seizure onset detections made independently across di?erent relevant EEG spectral bands. In the ECG-based <b>detector,</b> <b>heart</b> rate variability (HRV) is extracted and analyzed using a Matching-Pursuit and Wigner-Ville Distribution algorithm in order to e?ectively extract meaningful HRV features representative of seizure and non-seizure states. Two fusion systems are adopted to fuse the EEG- and ECG-based decisions. In the ?rst system, EEG- and ECG-based decisions are directly fused to obtain a ?nal decision. The second fusion system adopts an over-ride option that allows for the EEG-based decision to over-ride the fusion-based decision in an event that the detector observes a string of EEG-based seizure decisions. The proposed detectors exhibit an improved performance, with respect to sensitivity and detection latency, compared with the state-of-the-art detectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the second detector achieves a sensitivity of 100 %, detection latency of 2. 6 seconds, and a speci?city of 99. 91 % for the MAJORITY fusion case. In addition, a novel method to calculate the amount of neural synchrony that exists between the channels of an EEG matrix is carried out. This method is based on extracting the condition number from multi-channel EEG at a particular time instant to indicate the level of neural synchrony at that particular time instant. The proposed method of neural synchrony calculation is implemented in two detection systems. The ?rst system uses only neural synchrony as the feature for seizure classi?cation whereas the second system fuses energy and synchrony based decision to make a ?nal classi?cation decision. Both systems show promising results when tested on a set of clinical patients...|$|R
