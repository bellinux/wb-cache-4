50|$|Sesame oil is a {{polyunsaturated}} (PUFA) semi-drying oil. Commercial {{sesame oil}} varies in colour from light to deep reddish yellow {{depending on the}} colour of the seed processed and the method of milling. Provided the oil is milled from well-cleaned seed, it can be refined and bleached easily to yield a light-coloured limpid oil. Sesame oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids, which together account for 85% of the total fatty acids. Sesame oil has a relatively high percentage of <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matter</b> (1.5-2.3%) in India and in some other European countries. It is obligatory to add sesame oil (5-10%) to margarine and generally to hydrogenated vegetable fats which are commonly used as adulterants for butter or ghee.|$|E

The suitability of the castor oil was also assessed in terms of its favourable colour, odour, specific gravity, acid value, iodine value, saponification value, viscosity, pour points and flash points in comparison to those of conventional JBO. Different recipes for the production of emulsions were standardized in the industrial scale and their suitability were assessed according to their stability, specific gravity, temperature, viscosity and pour points. The recipes were used to spin jute fibre in the jute mill machines. The yarn products were studied to evaluate their work performances based on their physico-chemical properties: moisture regain, t. p. i., W.

Materials and methods We analyzed the fatty acid composition of 10 traditionally (home-made) and 13 commercially (ready-made) prepared SJW oil macerates by GC–MS. The acid, peroxide, iodine, saponification values, and the <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matters</b> of the samples were determined according to the European Pharmacopoeia. We also explored potential mechanism of wound healing effect of the samples, i. e. TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. Results The most home-made oil samples contained oleic acid predominantly and complied with the requirements set for olive oil by European Pharmacopoeia. However, majority of the ready-made samples appeared to have adulteration with some other oils. Moderate NF-κB inhibitory effects have been observed with some of the oil samples. Conclusion This study sheds light on the fact that application of the proper traditional method to prepare olive oil macerates from Hypericum perforatum is able to get bioactive constituents in the oil. Besides, inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation appears to be a potential mechanism for topical wound healing activity of SJW oil macerates...|$|R

Among the methods developed, urea crystallization was preferred because it is simple, economic, and result in high purity of fatty acids. A source that had not been widely explored for - 3 fatty acids production is the by-product of tuna meal processing. This research studied the optimization condition for separation and purification of - 3 fatty acids from the by-product of tuna meal processing by urea crystallization. Crystallization reaction conditions of urea inclusion were optimized using the response surface methodology, and the model was developed. Optimization result showed a quadratic polynomial regression equation of Y= 140, 52677 X 1 + 8, 38203 X 2 – 19, 85850 X 12 – 0, 12173 X 22 – 0, 74000 X 1 X 2 – 240, 33546 with X 1 =urea to fatty acid ratio and X 2 =crystallization time. Maximum response was obtained at urea to fatty acid ratio of 3, 07 : 1,crystallization time of 25, 10 hours, and predicted response was 80, 60 %.

40|$|By definition, “butters” are {{anhydrous}} {{and solid}} fats at room temperature. A {{lot of different}} crude fats and butters are available in Africa and other tropical countries, and their characteristics make often them interesting to valorise. This presentation will focus on a personal experience dealing with production and development of African butters. The production of butters and particularly the shea fat, is done {{by one of the}} two basic methods, roughly described as “traditional or modern”. The rural (traditional) vegetable oil extraction processes, which predominate the extraction technologies in many of the shea kernel producing areas, involve water extraction. This method often employs simple small sized and household equipments; it is based on aqueous extraction techniques to produce oil. The work is very hard but provides jobs, money and “consideration” to the women who are traditionally in charge of this work. Such a traditional method yields not more than 35 % of the kernel oil contents and the product quality is often poor. It is obvious that a major contributing factor to the low yield is the treatment inability to adequately break the kernel cellular structures, a necessity to obtain an efficient oil/fat extraction. The “modern” methods involve the use of mechanical presses and organic solvents; although the methods are quite high-yielding (with extraction rates around 80 %), they are reportedly difficult to perform because of the high latex content in the kernels: in fact the latex agglutinates and clogs the equipment or inhibits an efficient penetration of the extraction solvent. As we all know olein rich vegetable oils are globally abundant but commercial sources of vegetable fats, or “stearin”, are less common. Stearin is used in confectionery for chocolates, cakes, etc. and for margarine industries. The most developed and well-known source of stearin is cocoa butter; the development of this production is historical and is based on the “chocolate business” involving a lot of organisms and industries mainly located in “developed” countries. Beside this, other butters like Shea butter, Illipe, Kokum, Sal and mangoare available sources for substitutes in the production of cocoa butter improvers (CBI), equivalent (CBE) or substitutes (CBS). Other markets for Shea butter exist in the personal care industry; the main reason for this growing interest has been the recognition by the cosmetic industry and consumers of the Sheat butter therapeutic benefits (ultra violet light protection, antiinflammatory, moisturizing, regenerative, anti-eczema and anti-wrinkle properties) due to the presence of a significant fraction of <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matters</b> (3 - 15 %) composed of many bioactive chemicals, e. g. triterpene alcohols, phenols, sterols and the poly-isoprenic hydrocarbons like karitenes. In this field of valorisation (cosmetics), the unsaponifiable content is a key factor. In 1992 on the demand of DESLOG company, ITERG worked and patented an interesting method of increasing the unsaponifiable content of Shea butter using cryogenic enrichment by fractionation at about – 30 °C. The final product called CRYOKARITENE (registered trade mark) can be enriched up to more than 50 % of unsaponifiable and shows excellent dermo-cosmetic properties...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCoffee {{is a much}} enjoyed {{beverage}} {{because of}} its unique flavor and taste characteristics. The lipid fraction of coffee beans, composed of wax, oil and <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matter,</b> prevents volatilization and loss of flavor during the roasting process. The lipid fraction extracted from green beans is high in linoleic acid and has an ultraviolet absorption. These properties {{that can be very}} useful and suitable for cosmetic products such as skin moisturizers and sunscreens. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the lipid fraction and to determine the sun protection factor of 10 species of Coffea. Significant variability was found for all the parameters investigated: the wax content varying between 0. 0 and 2. 8 %, the oil content ranging from 6. 9 % to 32. 4 %, <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matter</b> from 0. 3 % to 13. 5 % and the sun protection factor from 0. 0 to 4. 1.

40|$|Summary. Flax {{seed oils}} {{currently}} {{sold on the}} worldwide market are not governed by specific standards or specifications. Consumption of flax (Linum usitatissimum) seeds is beneficial for human health. Flax seeds, containing about 36 - 40 % oil are the richest (among crop plants) source of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) essential in the human diet. PUFA are highly susceptible to oxidation. Five flax cultivars (Sakha 1, Sakha 2, Giza 8, Lithuania and Aryana) were studied to determine protein profile and contents of fatty acids, <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matter,</b> total lipids, total tocopherols, total phenolics and total flavonoids {{in order to assess}} the nutritional value of flax seeds. No differences between flax cultivars were noticed in the protein profile, fatty acids and <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matter</b> content. In contrary, significant differences were established in total tocopherols, total phenolics and total flavonoids. Cvs. Giza 8 and Lithuania showed the highest levels of total tocopherols, total phenolics and total flavonoids among all flaxseed cultivars. Thus, our results suggest that these two cultivars are suitable for commercial use of edible oil...|$|E

Only the phosphorylated fraction did undergo hydrolysis at an appreciable rate. It was found that the free fatty acid production was mainly associated with the phospholipid hydrolysis. As regards the triglycerides and <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matter,</b> there was no significant change in levels during frozen storage...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} was to {{study the effects of}} {{processing}} on the <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matter,</b> sterols and fatty and triterpenic alcohol in ripe olive fat (Manzanilla and Hojiblanca cultivars) and to disclose the most influential factors using GLM, PCA and DA. There were significant effects of cultivars or ps on <b>unsaponifiable</b> <b>matter,</b> β-sitosterol, Δ 5 -avenasterol, total sterols, 1 -docosanol, 1 -tetracosanol (ps), erythrodiol and percentage erythrodiol + uvaol. The values of most of these parameters were within the limits established by the EU Directives for olive and pomace oils but classification of the respective oils was not conclusive. Predictive discriminant analysis using these variables permitted 100 % success in the classification according to cultivars and ps (68 % in the case of cross validation). Results revealed that some influential steps should be re-designed, particularly the storage phase, in order to minimise changes in the studied fat components during ripe olive processing.
