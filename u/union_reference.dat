The collaborative trial was conducted according to internationally accepted guidelines. Bayer CropScience provided the method-specific samples (genomic DNA extracted from the 0 % and 100 % event T 25 maize), whereas the JRC prepared the validation samples (calibration samples and blind samples at unknown GM percentage). The trial involved thirteen laboratories from eleven Countries of the European Union. The results of the collaborative trial fully met ENGL’s performance requirements and the scientific understanding about satisfactory method performance. Therefore, the JRC as European <b>Union</b> <b>Reference</b> Laboratory considers the method validated as fit for the purpose of regulatory compliance.

40|$|Abstract. Symbolic {{software}} verification engines such as Slam and ESC/Java often use automatic theorem provers to implement forms of symbolic simulation. The theorem provers that are used, such as Simplify, usually combine decision {{procedures for the}} theories of uninterpreted functions, linear arithmetic, and sometimes bit vectors using techniques proposed by Nelson-Oppen or Shostak. Programming language constructs such as pointers, structures and unions are not directly supported by the provers, and are often encoded imprecisely using axioms and uninterpreted functions. In this paper we describe a more direct and accurate approach towards providing symbolic infrastructure for program verification engines. We propose {{the use of a}} theorem prover called Cogent, which provides better accuracy for ANSI-C expressions with the possibility of nested logic quantifiers. The prover’s implementation is based on a machinelevel interpretation of expressions into propositional logic. Cogent’s translation allows the program verification tools to better reason about finite machine-level variables, bit operations, structures, <b>unions,</b> <b>references,</b> pointers and pointer arithmetic. This paper also provides experimental evidence that the proposed approach is practical when applied to industrial program verification. ...|$|R
