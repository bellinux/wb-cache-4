60|$|<b>Unable,</b> therefore, <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the bad {{passions of}} his fellow creatures the {{unconscious}} instruments of his good purposes, Popanilla must have been contented to have monopolised all {{the wisdom of the}} moderns, had he not, with the unbaffled wit of an inventor, hit upon a new expedient. Like Socrates, our philosopher began to cultivate with sedulousness the society of youth.|$|R

5|$|Members of {{the public}} take part in Parliament in two ways that are not the case at Westminster: a public petitioning system, and cross-party groups on policy topics which the {{interested}} public join and attend meetings of, alongside MSPs.

5|$|The British had {{witnessed}} the Polish drop but were <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> contact by radio so a swimmer was sent {{south of the}} Rhine.

5|$|While chrism is {{used only}} for the three sacraments that cannot be repeated, a {{different}} oil is used by a priest or bishop to bless a Catholic who, because of illness or old age, {{has begun to be}} in danger of death.

5000|$|It is {{important}} to note also, one of defensive neorealism's main criticisms that it is <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> theorise and <b>make</b> assumptions about the policies of specific states as offensive neorealism can.
