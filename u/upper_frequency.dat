40|$|This paper {{presents}} a reconfigurable dual-band 4. 86 and 8. 98 GI-Iz dipole antenna on silicon using series MEMS switches. The reconfigurable dual-band dipole is firstly designed assuming ideal switches (ON/OFF). The {{effects of the}} two series MEMS switches on the antenna performance are studied. The design is performed using the 3 D electromagnetic simulator HFSS. Using the designed series MEMS switches, the antenna return loss is- 10. 2 dB and- 21. 6 dB, at the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>frequencies,</b> respectively. However, comparable {{to the case of}} ideal switches, a frequency shift of 0. 4 % and of 2. 8 % at the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>frequencies,</b> respectively, are observed. The antenna, including the two MEMS switches, has bandwidth of 1. 9 % and 13. 6 % at the lower and <b>upper</b> <b>frequencies,</b> respectively. The antenna radiation efficiency is 86 % and the directivity is 2 dB at the lower band, and 94 % and 3 dB at the higher one...|$|R

50|$|In {{electronic}} {{digital to analog}} conversion, this {{is addressed}} {{by the use of}} low-pass filters to eliminate the spurious <b>upper</b> <b>frequencies</b> produced. Since these frequencies are eliminated in the electrical signal, they are not passed to the speaker and thus ultrasonic airwaves are not generated.|$|R
500|$|Like {{transmission}} line filters, waveguide filters always have multiple passbands, {{replicas of the}} lumped element prototype. [...] In most designs, only the lowest frequency passband is useful (or lowest two {{in the case of}} band-stop filters) and the rest are considered unwanted spurious artefacts. [...] This is an intrinsic property of the technology and cannot be designed out, although design can have some control over the frequency position of the spurious bands. [...] Consequently, in any given filter design, there is an <b>upper</b> <b>frequency</b> beyond which the filter will fail to carry out its function. [...] For this reason, true low-pass and high-pass filters cannot exist in waveguide. [...] At some high frequency there will be a spurious passband or stopband interrupting the intended function of the filter. [...] But, similar to the situation with waveguide cutoff frequency, the filter can be designed so that the edge of the first spurious band is well above any frequency of interest.|$|E
500|$|Biographer David Henderson {{describes}} Hendrix's guitar tone as [...] "at {{the razor}} edge of distort". [...] However, individual notes are still clear, {{as well as}} the harmonically more complex chords, even with the use of extreme overdrive for the time. [...] The tension is maintained until the guitar solo, which [...] "arrives as something of a release rather than a further racking up of the atmosphere." [...] It is also when Hendrix first introduces the Octavia, coupled with a Fuzz Face distortion unit. [...] Whitehill describes the solo as [...] "almost sound likes he's playing a blues raga. [...] He starts out playing in the Mixolydian mode and then he goes right into the blues side. [...] The Octavia has the effect of a sitar, kind of like Ravi Shankar meets B.B. King." [...] During the song's outro, the guitar part recorded at 7½ inches per second (ips) played back at 15 ips, is combined with the Octavia, further extending the guitar's <b>upper</b> <b>frequency</b> range. [...] Henderson describes it as [...] "an uncanny piercing tone that takes off, Eastern-sounding beyond the range of the guitar" [...] and, according to Shadwick, [...] "gives the impression that the guitar notes are flying off into the ether." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{frequency}} range handled by an amplifier might be specified {{in terms of}} bandwidth (normally implying a response that is 3dB down when the frequency reaches the specified bandwidth), or by specifying a frequency response that is within {{a certain number of}} decibels between a lower and an <b>upper</b> <b>frequency</b> (e.g. [...] "20Hz to 20kHz plus or minus 1dB").|$|E
50|$|Bats emit {{calls from}} about 12 kHz to 160 kHz, but the <b>upper</b> <b>frequencies</b> in this range are rapidly absorbed in air. Many bat {{detectors}} {{are limited to}} around 15 kHz to 125 kHz at best. Bat detectors are available commercially and also can be self-built.|$|R

5000|$|Adobe Audition is able {{to remove}} the effect using the Graphic Panner tool (the Automatic Phase Correction tool is unable to {{accurately}} do this) by manually selecting the [...] "Phase -90 degrees" [...] preset. The [...] "Auto Center Phase" [...] and [...] "Learn Phase" [...] features will also work, but are not recommended. There are sometimes slight offsets caused by various mixing effects and, to a lesser extent, tape-head misalignment; studio reverb or naturally decaying reverb is a prime example. As a waveform decays in a large room, it naturally changes phase. In Auto Center phase, this is (generally) shown as the <b>upper</b> <b>frequencies</b> making a drastic change. Tape head misalignment (azimuth) also will cause a phase change in <b>upper</b> <b>frequencies.</b> One {{should be aware of}} this when attempting to remove Haeco processing and not use auto-phase options. Azimuth alignment adjustment tools can however be used AFTER Haeco has been removed.|$|R
2500|$|All FETs have source, drain, {{and gate}} {{terminals}} that correspond roughly to the collector, emitter, and base of BJTs. Most FETs have a fourth terminal called the body, base, bulk, or substrate. This fourth terminal serves to bias the transistor into operation; {{it is rare}} to make non-trivial use of the body terminal in circuit designs, but its presence is important when setting up the physical layout of an integrated circuit. The size of the gate, [...] length L in the diagram, is the distance between source and drain. The width is {{the extension of the}} transistor, in the direction perpendicular to the cross section in the diagram (i.e., into/out of the screen). Typically the width is much larger than the length of the gate. A gate length of 1µm limits the <b>upper</b> <b>frequency</b> to about 5GHz, 0.2µm to about 30GHz.|$|E
2500|$|The coiled form of cochlea {{is unique}} to mammals. In birds and in other non-mammalian vertebrates, the {{compartment}} containing the sensory cells for hearing is occasionally also called [...] "cochlea," [...] despite not being coiled up. Instead, it forms a blind-ended tube, also called the cochlear duct. This difference apparently evolved in parallel with the differences in frequency range of hearing between mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates. The superior frequency range in mammals {{is partly due to}} their unique mechanism of pre-amplification of sound by active cell-body vibrations of outer hair cells. Frequency resolution is, however, not better in mammals than in most lizards and birds, but the <b>upper</b> <b>frequency</b> limit is – sometimes much – higher. Most bird species do not hear above 45kHz, the currently known maximum being ~ 11kHz in the barn owl. Some marine mammals hear up to 200kHz. A long coiled compartment, rather than a short and straight one, provides more space for additional octaves of hearing range, and has made possible some of the highly derived behaviors involving mammalian hearing.|$|E

40|$|Pararesonance (PR) {{whistlers}} {{observed in}} the topside ionosphere by the Dartmouth receiver on Ogo 6 are examined.

This is the modeled phase response of the subject HRTF as a time delay, dependent on the direction and elevation.|$|R
