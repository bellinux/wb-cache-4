5|$|Over {{four years}} after Cold Feet ended, ITV {{executives}} were {{still looking for a}} series that could comfortably replace it. On his appointment as chairman of ITV plc in 2007, Michael Grade announced that he wanted the ITV network to be broadcasting long-running series like Cold Feet to attract the younger, <b>upmarket</b> viewing demographic.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} of the woods is an {{affluent}} suburb of Bristol also known as Leigh Woods. It is situated at the western end of the Clifton Suspension Bridge, which opened in 1864, making the development of Leigh Woods as an <b>upmarket</b> residential area practicable. Houses in varying styles were built from the mid-1860s until the First World War.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{selection}} of <b>upmarket</b> restaurants, Copenhagen offers {{a great variety of}} Danish, ethnic and experimental restaurants. It is possible to find modest eateries serving open sandwiches, known as smørrebrød – a traditional, Danish lunch dish; however, most restaurants serve international dishes. Danish pastry can be sampled from any of numerous bakeries found {{in all parts of the}} city. The Copenhagen Baker's Association dates back to the 1290s and Denmark's oldest confectioner's shop still operating, Conditori La Glace, was founded in 1870 in Skoubogade by Nicolaus Henningsen, a trained master baker from Flensburg.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his positions in the media, Nash was also a publican, which proved so financially successfully {{he was able to}} pay cash for a house in the <b>upmarket</b> Melbourne suburb of South Yarra. An altercation with a drunken patron resulted in a broken left hip and forced Nash to sell his hotel, the Prince Alfred in Port Melbourne and gain employment as a clerk in the Melbourne Magistrates Court, a position he held until his mandatory retirement at 65.|$|E
5|$|The Polish {{architect}} Władysław Horodecki originally {{constructed the}} House with Chimaeras {{for use as}} his own <b>upmarket</b> apartment building {{during the period of}} 1901–1902. However, as the years went by, Horodecki eventually had to sell the building due to financial troubles, after which it changed ownership numerous times before finally being occupied by an official Communist Party polyclinic until the early 2000s. When the building was vacated, its interior and exterior decor were fully reconstructed and restored according to Horodecki original plans.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, most of Mayfair {{was built}} on with prestigious housing to suit the upper class; unlike some nearby areas of London, it has never lost its {{affluent}} status. The decline of the British aristocracy in the early 20th century led to Mayfair becoming more commercial instead of residential, with many former homes converted into offices for major corporate headquarters, embassies and other businesses. There remains a substantial quantity of luxury residential property, <b>upmarket</b> shops and restaurants, and modern hotels along Piccadilly and Park Lane in particular. Mayfair's prestigious status has been commemorated by being the most expensive property square on the London Monopoly board.|$|E
5|$|Catering for {{visitors}} at Belle Vue {{was on an}} industrial scale, ranging from the late 19th century hot water rooms, which accommodated up to 3,000 diners each, providing crockery and hot water for those who brought their own picnics, to more <b>upmarket</b> themed restaurants. Belle Vue {{became a part of}} the caterer and hotelier Charles Forte's business empire towards the end of its life in the 1960s. Although he made some improvements to the zoo, Forte's interests lay in developing the gardens' dining and exhibition facilities. The Kings Hall was then the largest exhibition space outside London, but competition from the G-Mex exhibition and conference centre in central Manchester led directly to its closure in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Chris Wilton, a {{recently}} retired tennis professional, is taken on as {{an instructor at}} an <b>upmarket</b> club in London. He strikes up a friendship with a wealthy pupil, Tom Hewett, after discovering their common affinity for opera. Tom's older sister, Chloe, is smitten with Chris, and the two begin dating. During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's American fiancée, Nola Rice, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Tom's mother, Eleanor, does not approve of her son's relationship with Nola, a struggling actress, which {{is a source of}} tension in the family. Chloe encourages her father, Alec, to give Chris a job as an executive in one of his companies; he begins to be accepted into the family and marriage is discussed.|$|E
5|$|Ford Australia's {{performance}} vehicle partner Ford Performance Vehicles {{produced a}} range of models based on the Falcon BA and marketed under the FPV name. The 2003 BA range included the GT, GT-P, and the Pursuit. The GT was the entry-level vehicle that started with a suggested retail price of A$59,810. The GT-P was the <b>upmarket</b> version of the GT, with a price tag of A$69,850. The Pursuit was a ute (utility) version of the GT, featuring the same seats, basic dash/interior package and wheels. FPV specific body-kits were applied to all cars, using the lights from the XR-range. The kit had a strong resemblance to the BA Falcon V8 Supercar, highlighting the connection to FPR.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis and was {{replaced}} by Howard Browne, who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction. Browne briefly managed {{to improve the quality of}} the fiction in Fantastic Adventures, and the period around 1951 has been described as the magazine's heyday. Browne lost interest when his plan to take Amazing Stories <b>upmarket</b> collapsed, and the magazine fell back into predictability. In 1952, Ziff-Davis launched another fantasy magazine, titled Fantastic, in a digest format; it was successful, and within a few months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor of Fantastic. The March 1953 issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{host to the}} European {{headquarters}} of IBM and, until 2007, the UK {{headquarters of}} Zurich Financial Services. In the city centre, shopping is centred on Commercial Road and the 1980s Cascades Shopping Centre, with over 100 high street shops between them. Approximately 185,000 to 230,000 people use the Cascades Shopping Centre each week. Recent redevelopment has created new shopping areas, including the <b>upmarket</b> Gunwharf Quays—a redevelopment of the HMS Vernon naval shore establishment— containing fashion stores, restaurants, and a cinema, and the Historic Dockyard, which caters to the tourist sector and holds an annual Victorian Christmas market. Ocean Retail Park sits on the north-eastern side of Portsea Island and was built on land previously occupied by a Metal Box factory in September 1985.|$|E
5|$|The trend had {{substantial}} {{implications for}} many early skyscrapers. Some were redesigned to fit new tastes. Much of the ornate detail {{was removed from}} the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s, for example, to fit contemporary, plainer fashions. Many older skyscrapers could not be adapted, however, as they lacked the physical depth to build larger modern offices or the space for new service facilities. Some were demolished to make way for new, larger structures. Amongst these was the Singer Tower, demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building. In the 21st century, buildings such as 90 West Street have been renovated as <b>upmarket</b> housing, partially because of their extensive windows and access to sunlight.|$|E
5|$|A more <b>upmarket</b> SS, the SS V-Series {{represents}} {{the first time}} this type of naming has been applied to Holden products. The V-Series naming is reminiscent of the V-badging on selected Cadillac models, another member of the GM family. The badge design on the bootlid bears strong resemblance to the ones used by Cadillac. But whereas Cadillac uses it to signify high-performance versions of its products, Holden V-Series variants boast extra features. The V-Series variants were introduced, largely due to a fully optioned Commodore SS in the VZ range being rather successful. The SS V offers extra luxuries at a similar price point to the preceding SS. Inside, it is recognisable by the metallic look pedals and instruments matched with the exterior colour. Additionally, the entire dashboard can be optioned in a range of loud colours: bright red, orange or black. The SS V exterior is equally adventurous, exhibiting five-spoke 19-inch alloy wheels and the option of larger 20-inch wheels: the largest wheels ever fitted to a Holden car.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{significant}} easing of the closure policy in 2010, {{the economy of}} Gaza began to see a substantial recovery from anemic levels {{during the height of}} the blockade. The economy of Gaza grew by 8% in the first 11 months of 2010. Economic activity is largely supported by foreign aid donations. There are a number of hotels in Gaza, including the Palestine, Grand Palace, Adam, al-Amal, al-Quds, Cliff, al-Deira and Marna House. All, except the Palestine Hotel, are located along in the coastal Rimal district. The United Nations (UN) has a beach club on the same street. Gaza is not a frequent destination for tourists, and most foreigners who stay in hotels are journalists, aid workers, UN and Red Cross personnel. <b>Upmarket</b> hotels include the al-Quds and the al-Deira Hotel.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Lexus debuted {{its first}} sport utility vehicle, the LX 450, {{followed}} by the third generation ES 300 sedan. The marque's plans for developing an SUV model had accelerated during the U.S.-Japan tariff discussions of 1995. Lexus added the first luxury-branded crossover SUV, the RX 300, and the second generation GS 300 and GS 400 sedans in 1998. The RX crossover targeted suburban buyers who desired an <b>upmarket</b> SUV but did not need the LX's off-road capability. It was particularly successful, eventually becoming the marque's top-selling model ahead of the ES sedan. The same year, Lexus made its debut in South America's most populous country when it launched sales in Brazil. In 1999, Lexus recorded its 1 millionth vehicle sold in the U.S. market and was ranked the top-selling premium car maker in the U.S. overall.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, {{the mayor}} of London, Boris Johnson {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} tunnel beneath the street, allowing land to be released for development and green spaces. The traffic improvements and remodelling have diminished the appeal of Park Lane as a residential address, since it became one of the busiest and noisiest roads in central London. In 2011, Johnson introduced spot fines for coaches idling on Park Lane. The widening of the road distanced the houses {{on the east side of}} Park Lane from Hyde Park itself, access to which is now by underpass. Despite the traffic noise the road is still <b>upmarket,</b> featuring five-star hotels (such as The Dorchester, the Grosvenor House Hotel and the InterContinental London Park Lane Hotel) and showrooms for several sports car models, including BMW, Aston Martin and Mercedes-Benz.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 2012 - 2013, sales of Guinness in South East Asia were over £100 million. FES (6.8% ABV) is brewed and {{distributed}} in Malaysia by Guinness Anchor Berhad, a listed company in which Diageo holds a 25.5 percent stake. The Malaysian variant is distributed {{throughout most of}} South East Asia. The brew was reduced in ABV from 8 to 6.8% in 2008. Malaysia is the largest Asian market for Guinness, where, in 2012, the brand grew by between 10 and 15 per cent. In Singapore, FES is brewed and distributed by Asia Pacific Breweries. In Indonesia, Guinness is brewed to 4.9% ABV by PT Multi Bintang (a subsidiary of Asia Pacific Breweries), and is distributed by PT Dima Indonesia. In China, small amounts of FES are sold, where it is positioned as a premium priced import in <b>upmarket</b> bars.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne {{took over}} as editor of both Amazing Stories and Fantastic Adventures in 1950. Browne {{preferred}} fantasy to science fiction, and enjoyed editing Fantastic Adventures, but when his plans for taking Amazing <b>upmarket</b> were derailed by the Korean War, he lost interest in both magazines for a while. He let William Hamling take responsibility for both titles, and the quality declined. At the end of 1950, Ziff-Davis moved its offices from Chicago to New York; Browne relocated to New York, but Hamling decided to stay in Chicago, so Browne became more involved once again, and sf historians such as Brian Stableford and Mike Ashley consider the result {{to have been a}} definite improvement in quality. Browne's interest in fantasy led him to start a new digest-sized magazine, Fantastic, in the summer of 1952; it was an immediate success, and led Ziff-Davis to convert Amazing Stories to digest format as well. The move from the pulp format to digests was well under way in the early 1950s, and with Fantastics success there was little reason to keep Fantastic Adventures going. It was merged with Fantastic; the last issue was dated March 1953, and the MayJune issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead, though this disappeared with the following issue.|$|E
5|$|Howard Browne, who {{had been}} on a leave of absence from Ziff-Davis to write fiction, took over as editor and began by {{throwing}} away 300,000 words of inventory that Palmer had acquired before he left. Browne had ambitions of moving Amazing <b>upmarket,</b> and his argument was strengthened by Street & Smith, one of the longest established and most respected publishers, who shut down all of their pulp magazines in the summer of 1949. The pulps were dying, {{largely as a result of}} the success of pocketbooks, and Street & Smith decided to concentrate on their slick magazines. Some pulps struggled on for a few more years, but Browne was able to persuade Ziff and Davis that the future was in the slicks, and they raised his fiction budget from one cent to a ceiling of five cents per word. Browne managed to get promises of new stories from many well-known authors, including Isaac Asimov and Theodore Sturgeon. He produced a dummy issue in April 1950, and planned to launch the new incarnation of Amazing in April 1951, the 25th anniversary of the first issue. However, the economic impact of the Korean War, which broke out in June 1950, led to budget cuts. The plans were cancelled, and Ziff-Davis never revived the idea.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2000, SFI, {{the owner}} of the Litten Tree bar chain, {{announced}} a £31.6 million takeover of Slug and Lettuce, paid for in shares, and McKenzie left the chain in order to pursue new challenges. By this time the chain had 32 outlets. According to analysts, the chain was too small and had too much debt to survive alone. SFI refurbished a number of their existing pubs under the Slug and Lettuce concept, and by 2004 the chain had 56 outlets. In 2005, SFI attempted to reposition the chain as an <b>upmarket</b> place to eat, in anticipation of the forthcoming smoking ban. In June 2005 SFI went into administration, and sold 98 of its 150 outlets to the Laurel Pub Company, controlled by Robert Tchenguiz, for £80 million. In 2008 Laurel itself collapsed, and the Slug chain became a part of the Bay Restaurant Group, later Town & City Pub Company. The chain has withdrawn from a number of locations, including Glasgow and Cardiff, leaving it with only one location in Scotland, and no presence in Wales. In 2010, Town & City began to refurbish the outlets, switching from a brown colour scheme to aubergine and updating upholstery and lighting. In June 2011 Town & City merged with the Stonegate Pub Company.|$|E
