40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{acquisition}} and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers in learners/users of L 2 Spanish {{and the role}} these markers play {{in the development of}} fluency and conversational participation during a five-month stay in Spain as exchange students of business administration. The study has been conducted in three steps. The first part focuses on the theory and categorization of metadiscourse markers, followed by an analysis of the use and development of these markers in learners of L 2 Spanish. The second part deals with the categorization and operationalization of aspects of fluency and conversational participation that can be associated with the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers; followed by an analysis of these aspects in the performance of the learners. The third part of the study is a summary of the results obtained and a discussion {{of the relationship between the}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers and the development of fluency and conversational participation. The data underlying the current study consists of a selection of 17 recorded conversations between learners of L 2 Spanish and native speakers of Spanish taken from the AKSAM database. The conversations belong in two activity types: discussions and simulated negotiations. The selected sample has a duration of approx. 10 hours and comprises 87   683 words. The study focuses on nine learners who have been recorded at the beginning and at the end of their five month study-abroad stay. Results show that frequency of <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers has increased considerably at the end of the stay in the majority of the learners under study. A qualitative development can also be found, through which the metadiscourse markers that characterize the learners’ L 1 and/or interlanguage have been substituted by more target-like expressions. Furthermore, both their fluency and level of conversational participation have generally increased. Within this development, however, a notable individual variation can be found. The learners who show the strongest development as regards fluency and conversational participation are also found to exhibit the most salient development of metadiscourse markers. Since disfluency is reduced to a lesser degree in those participants who also exhibit a less developed <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers, it is argued that the development of metadiscourse markers in the L 2 learner runs parallel to the development of discourse skills, but also that acquiring an adequate use of metadiscourse markers helps developing these skills. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article aims at {{reporting}} {{on some of}} the preliminary results of an on-going study on the difference of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> strategies in e-mail writing between a Polish teacher and a Chinese student. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) Metadiscourse Theory, the purpose of the analysis is to show how the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> devices varies between an English-speaking person and a non English-speaking person in e-mail writing which covers a time period from 9 December 2013 to 1 January 2014. According to the analysis, we found out that metadisourse devices are frequently used in E-mail writing. Thanks to the different thinking mode and different ideology, people from different countries may use metadisourse devices differently. For example, the Polish Peter used more engagement markers than the Chinese student Tina did. While Tina used more hedges than Peter did. In this whole process, culture plays an important role...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the misuses of two main categories <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers <b>used</b> by a group of university students. To this end, 50 EFL learners of intermediate language proficiency level were chosen by means of administering a TOEFL proficiency test. The participants were female junior students majoring in English literature at Kerman Azad University. These learners were regarded as intermediate ones scoring 400 - 550 in the proficiency test. Then, the learners were provided with an argumentative topic to write a 250 -word essay in 45 minutes. The number <b>of</b> misuses <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers were counted with regard to their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> textual and interpersonal markers of this kind, and the subcategories of textual (logical connectives, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, and code glosses), and the subcategories <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>metadiscourse</b> markers (hedges, emphatics, attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers). Moreover, different classifications of misuses were explored. The results of Chi-square analysis indicated that misuses <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> makers can be due to overuse of these markers (e. g. logical connective and person markers), punctuation,interlingua, and intralinguaerrors.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} emphasis on the interpersonal function <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> features in academic texts. This means that research on writing in academic contexts began to focus on the rhetorical features, such as interactional metadiscourse, that writers use to present their voice in writing. These developments in academic writing have also considered the context in which specific genres are produced. Using a multiple-methods approach to genre analysis, this article compares students’ <b>use</b> <b>of</b> interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> features in two undergraduate courses, Media Studies and Primary Education at the University of Botswana.

The corpus analyzed was taken from 20 investigative journalism blogs published in [URL] the official website of the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ) blogs. Based on the findings of the study, it can be inferred that there is much evidence in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> in Philippine investigative journalism blogs; thus, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> as an appropriate linguistic resource is supplemental and essential. The data revealed that the investigative journalism blogs have a higher frequency of use of interactive resources, allowing writers to organize and structure their propositions so that the text becomes more coherent to the readers. Among the five categories of interactive resources, the use of evidentials has the highest frequency. As regards the use of interactional resources, hedges are the most frequent.

40|$|The study {{explores the}} interplay of EFL/ESL writers’ {{composing}} processes and features of their written products, specifically revising and <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> elements. Both are crucial to success in writing but have {{so far not been}} researched from this perspective. A corpus of 104 essays, draft versions and corresponding final versions written by 52 advanced EFL/ESL writers, was analysed manually and electronically to show the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> elements and the revisions made in the process of writing. The two sets of data were then analysed statistically to uncover potential correlations. While there was variation in the quantities of both metadiscourse elements and text revisions, patterns emerged in both areas. Increased density of metadiscourse correlated positively with the number of major content revisions, but not with the number of minor content revisions and surface revisions. Content analysis found that metadiscourse elements were often integral parts of added chunks of text, but also served to modify or restructure existing text. Results suggest that while metadiscourse depends on genre and topic, it also plays {{a significant role in the}} process of text composing. The growth of its density as writers revise texts at the level of content and structure indicates that metadiscourse can function as a reconceptualizing tool in the process of writing...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} gender {{differences}} {{has proved to be}} a popular line of inquiry for researchers for decades, and the recent growing interest in the pervasive phenomenon of metadiscourse makes it a major domain in the research of discourse analysis and corpus-based analyses. This study extends the investigation of gender and metadiscourse to newspaper opinion columns. The study seeks to explore both gender and metadiscourse in media texts by analyzing a corpus of British and Saudi opinion columns. Using corpus-linguistics techniques, the study aims to investigate gender differences in the writings of men and women columnists regarding their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> and selected linguistic and stylistic features. Drawing on Hyland’s (2005) model of metadiscourse, the study further aims to compare the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers among both columnists in order to identify which categories predominate in this type of discourse and how they are distributed according to cultural preferences. The corpus consists of 320 opinion columns totaling 273, 773 words, selected from four elite newspapers. The columns were searched electronically using concordancing software programs and then all the metadiscourse devices were examined qualitatively in context to determine their actual functions. All frequencies reported have been normalized and tested statistically. Results confirmed that there were 33, 854 metadiscourse tokens in the corpus, an average of 105. 49 occurrences per column or 3 elements of metadiscourse in every 25 words in each of the two corpora. Findings revealed both male and female columnists showed more similarities than differences in their overall <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> especially in the interactive dimension. In spite of that, some significant gender-based variations in the use of interactional dimension of metadiscourse were also found. Female columnists used more self-mentions, engagement markers, adjectives, pronouns, and adverbs than their male counterparts, and tended to adopt a personalized engaging subjective style that relies on personal experiences. In contrast, male columnists used more hedges, verbs, numerical terms, and swear words, and tended to adopt a more factual informative style. In addition, results revealed that both columnists made use of interactive and interactional metadiscourse, and some statistically significant variations in the amount and type of metadiscourse were reported. The study concludes that metadiscourse is a useful concept in the discourse of opinion columns and that gender is a significant source of variation that influences the linguistic and the stylistic choices of opinion columnists along with the genre’s conventions...|$|E

On the basis of a quantitative corpus survey of abstracts in Journal of Pragmatics, two major points are made. One is that the distribution of hedges, boosters and attitude markers in abstracts, when compared with their distribution in research articles, supports the idea that abstracts are not just pale reflections of the full-length articles, but rather have a specific make-up, which can plausibly be linked to their function. The second point is that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> in abstracts has undergone interesting changes {{in the course of the}} past 30 years. On the whole, the degree of interpersonality realised by hedges, boosters and attitude markers diminishes over time, though notable differences exist with regard to the subcategories in the interactional domain.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{research}} on writing in academic contexts {{began to focus}} on the types and nature of writing tasks students encounter in the content subjects. Research has also examined particular rhetorical features like the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> features that writers use to present their voice in writing and which might distinguish specific genres. These developments in academic writing have also considered the socio-cultural context in which specific genres are produced. The pedagogical motivation for researchers has been to better understand students' writing needs in their content subjects in order to prepare them for academic writing in their disciplines. Much of this research has focused on other fields of study like science and engineering and business students and in L 1 contexts and I have found nothing that relates specifically to academic writing for Media Studies and Primary Education in the context <b>of</b> Botswana. <b>Using</b> mixed-methods approach to genre analysis, this thesis compares students' <b>use</b> <b>of</b> interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> features to present voice in three writing contexts, the EAP preparatory course and two undergraduate courses (Media Studies and Primary Education) at the University of Botswana. A sub-corpus of L 1 (BAWE) undergraduate writers working on similar essays was also used to compare how the L 2 writers and L 1 writers in this study vary in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> these features in essay writing. A total of 123 essays from these various contexts were analyzed. Interviews with students and tutors in the EAP department and Media Studies and Primary Education departments were also done to understand the socio-cultural context in which the essays were produced. The results indicate that writing tasks in the departments of Media Studies and Primary Education included both the general essay and discipline specific genres. The comparison <b>of</b> interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> features in the different sub-corpora indicated variations in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> these features by the different groups of learners. Contextual information shows that such variations reflect the different values and beliefs about academic writing of the concrete discourse communities that students belong to. These values and beliefs can be problematic for EAP tutors who have to prepare students for writing in the various disciplines. The research has provided valuable insights into writing in Botswana context and may prove to have relevance for similar contexts. They have raised pedagogical implications for the design of the EAP writing course at the University of Botswana where a focus on a more contextual approach to teaching the academic writing would prove useful. The findings of this study are also potentially beneficial to the wider EAP community and the field of Applied Linguistics {{as an example of a}} mixed-method, contextual approach to genre analysis.

This study explores the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers in three multimodal management reports written by 10 international Master’s of Accounting students. It employs Hyland and Tse’s model and Hyland’s model for the multimodal analysis of metadiscourse markers in finance texts. The findings show a high frequency of interactive and interactional markers in the orthographic texts compared with a lack of implicit interactive markers and a high frequency of implicit interactional markers in the tables and graphs. Implications for the teaching of English for Business Purposes (EBP) are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} an attempt to {{investigate}} the functional role of textual and interpersonal metadiscourse markers in English and Persian Economic news reports. To this end, 10 news articles, 5 in each language, were randomly selected from the Economic sections of the leading newspapers published in 2013 - 2014 in Iran and the United States. Based on Kopple’s (1985) taxonomy, the type and frequency of metadiscourse markers used in the texts were analyzed to find out their functions in the text. The findings revealed that the textual markers used by Persian authors were considerably more frequent than those employed by the American writers. Interestingly, unlike the Persian writers, the American authors enlisted a larger number of interpersonal markers, which made their angle of the subject treatment different. It is evident that the differential <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> markers by nationally different authors could be attributed to culture-specific norms governing the development and organization of discourse...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a qualitative, {{comparative study of}} metadiscourse in the academic writing of two groups of undergraduate students working in two different disciplines. The groups of students were: 1) Native speakers of Mandarin studying in China {{through the medium of}} English; 2) Native speakers of Mandarin studying in the UK through the medium of English. For each group of students, we examined writing undertaken in two undergraduate disciplinary courses: Literary Criticism and Translation Studies. Our aim was to extend research into English writing by L 1 Mandarin speakers, and to identify patterns of difference and similarity both between educational contexts and between disciplines. Results suggest that patterns of metadiscourse use in our corpus are associated with both disciplinary and contextual factors, but that contextual factors may have a stronger effect than disciplinary factors. For our data, local institutional culture seems to have a noticeable influence on student writers' <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} a corpus of ninety discussion sections of applied linguistics research articles, {{with the goal}} of analyzing different aspects of academic written discourse. Three types of texts were considered: English texts written by native speakers of English, English texts written by Iranians (as non-natives of English), and Persian texts written by Iranians. In order to understand the cultural differences between Persian and English-speaking researchers, the following metadiscourse sub-types adapted from Hyland's (2004) model were examined: transitions, frame markers, endophoric markers, evidentials, code glosses, hedges, boosters, attitude markers, engagement markers, and self-mentions. The first five comprise interactive metadiscourse, and the rest comprise interactional metadiscourse. After the detailed analysis <b>of</b> the <b>metadiscourse</b> types in question, chi-square tests were carried out to clarify the probable differences. The analysis revealed how academic writings of these groups differed in their rhetorical strategies <b>using</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> type because <b>of</b> their respective mother tongues. However, the different groups were found to <b>use</b> all sub-types <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse.</b> Yet, some subcategories were used differently by the writers of these two languages. In addition, interactive metadiscoursal factors (those resources which help to guide the reader through the text such as transitions, frame markers, etc.) were used significantly more than interactional metadiscoursal factors (those resources involve the reader in the argument such as hedges, boosters, etc.) by both groups...|$|R
40|$|This {{contribution}} {{proposes a}} comparative exploration <b>of</b> the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> some <b>metadiscourse</b> resources {{in a small}} corpus of texts from popular scientific magazines in English and Italian, namely Scientific American (henceforth SA) and Le Scienze (henceforth LS). Scientific popularization is a meeting point of different discourse communities with their own needs, intentions and modes of communication (see Calsamiglia 2003, Myers 2003, Gotti 2005, 2013). Metadiscourse (cf., among others, Crismore and Farnsworth 1990, Crismore, Markkanen, Steffensen 1993, Hyland 1998, 2005) can be modulated and can modulate communication in different ways, as it covers a variety of linguistic elements which are aimed at organizing the text for its readers – the interactive dimension – and at engaging them in exposition and argumentation – the interactional dimension (see Hyland 2005). Recent research (e. g. Neff and Dafouz 2008, Musacchio and Ahmad 2009, Musacchio and Palumbo 2010, Suau 2010, Masi 2013) has indeed pursued comparisons <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse</b> devices associated with scientific discourse domains and genres of popularisation in different languages to appraise the extent of cross-linguistic correspondence and avoid, for example, inappropriate translations. 	Special attention is here devoted to both interactive and interactional devices <b>of</b> <b>metadiscourse,</b> i. e. the representation of scientific and non-scientific ‘actors’ (cf. Calsamiglia 2003, Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) through a range of acts of reporting as evidentials, i. e. the most explicit form of inclusion of other-discourse/voice in one’s discourse, {{as well as through}} a selection of self-mention and engagement markers lending themselves to quantitative along with qualitative evaluation. Altogether, the variety of items under analysis can be viewed as representing the three axes (third person reference vs. I/we vs. you) for the construction and evaluation of the roles of different identities (including text producer and implied target receiver) in scientific popularisation. Language diversification, then, is here tackled both from the intra-linguistic standpoint of the different construction of identities within a form of media discourse, and from a cross-linguistic viewpoint, i. e. the extent to which such constructions differ in the two language samples in question, in the attempt to ultimately detect possible preferential metadiscourse strategies that are specific to each language represented in the corpus. The macro-analytical background presupposed by the works here referred to (in particular Calsamiglia and López Ferrero 2003) is that of Critical Discourse Analysis, although the implications of the present research are also relevant for the perspective of Language Variation (and, to some extent, for Translation too) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{effectively}} teach university lecturers {{or students}} to write a good research article (RA) abstract for publication in international journals, instructors {{need to know the}} present characteristics of abstracts written published in such journals. This study examines the discourse structure and linguistic features of RA abstracts written in English by Indonesian academics published in national journals. The corpus for this study consists of 30 selected RA abstracts published mainly in university-based journals in Indonesia in social science and humanities disciplines. Analyses were conducted using genre-based procedures with a clause or a simple sentence as the smallest unit of analysis. The results show 1) unlike the common discourse structure of English abstracts found in RAs published in intenational journals, the majority English RA abstracts written by Indonesian speakers have only three moves (i. e. purpose, method and results); 2) the abstracts are mostly written in active sentence using present tense except for Move 3 (methods) in which a half of them are written in past tense and that-complement sentences are mostly found in Move 4 (results or findings); and 3) the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> interactional <b>metadiscourse</b> devices are dominated by hedges found in Move 4 while the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> attitudinal stance markers of the writers and self-reference words is rarely found in the abstracts...|$|R
