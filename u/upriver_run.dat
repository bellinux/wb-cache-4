5000|$|Demand {{for passage}} and freight {{shipments}} up the Columbia was very {{great in the}} early 1860s. Although only a moderate sized vessel, {{it was not necessary}} to haul large amounts of cargo for a vessel to be profitable at that time on the river. [...] Tenino proved {{to be one of the}} most profitable boats yet to appear on the river. [...] As Professor Mills described it: The Tenino made money as fast as the purser could collect and stuff it into a carpetbag. On a single <b>upriver</b> <b>run</b> in May, 1862, when the gold rush was at its roaring best, the Tenino gathered in $18,000 for fares, meals, berths and incidentals -- the bar.|$|E
25|$|The {{total cost}} of the entire fishways project was $1,470,333 in 1966 which was shared by the US and Canadian governments equally. Adjusted for inflation, this is roughly $9,800,000 in 2010. Ultimately, the fishways were a {{successful}} endeavor as the <b>upriver</b> <b>runs</b> past Hells Gate had already increased fivefold in the short period between 1941 and 1945.|$|R
50|$|Eventually {{the pine}} timber <b>upriver</b> <b>ran</b> out. Northwestern Lumber started {{to cut back}} its {{operations}} at Porter's Mills in 1891, moving the offices to Stanley, Wisconsin, where Northwestern Lumber had another mill. The last mill in Porter's Mills was dismantled in 1899, and the population moved on, to Stanley, Eau Claire or elsewhere. By 1904, the town had ceased to be.|$|R

50|$|Grey Eagle was {{a wooden}} sternwheel-driven {{steamboat}} that operated on the Willamette and Yamhill rivers in the United States from 1894 to 1930. In 1903 Grey Eagle became the last commercial steamboat to <b>run</b> <b>upriver</b> to Junction City, Oregon.|$|R
25|$|Once loaded, the George Prince {{departed}} {{and made}} a short <b>run</b> <b>upriver</b> before turning to cross the river. She did not give any indication of her departure by radio or horn. When operating in tandem, the ferries operated by sight with each other.|$|R
50|$|The second tramway {{was located}} further <b>upriver.</b> It <b>ran</b> 5 mi in length, from Adela Lake, BC. south to Columbia Lake. The tramways were like {{railways}} {{except that the}} cars were horsedrawn, and the carts were much smaller than rail cars. The company had steamers on Columbia Lake and the Kootenay River, but {{did not use the}} Grohman Canal, portaging traffic over Canal Flats rather than using the canal, which in fact was only used twice by steamboats during its existence.|$|R
50|$|A main highway, unpaved and {{therefore}} in poor condition (extremely poor {{during the rainy}} season, November to April), runs alongside the Zambezi connecting Sesheke to Senanga and Mongu <b>upriver.</b> The road <b>runs</b> on the south {{bank of the river}} upstream from Sesheke. Zambian traffic must cross the bridge but does not have to enter Namibia, as the bridge is entirely located on Zambian territory.|$|R
50|$|Like in {{many other}} European regions, the medieval {{extension}} of agriculture increased erosion of soil in the Weser basin. Since about 1400, {{the bed of the}} lower Weser was choked with sand, dramatically. Laden sea vessels could no longer <b>run</b> <b>upriver</b> to Bremen city.Ships were discharged on riverboats in the open lower Weser. In 1622/23, Bremen's first outer harbour was founded in Vegesack, 20 km downstream of Bremen. Soon it was lacking depth, too.|$|R
5000|$|The Wolf River {{flows through}} the middle of the village, with Partridge Lake just <b>upriver.</b> A {{spawning}} <b>run</b> of white bass, or sand bass (Morone chrysops), also known as [...] "stripers", occurs twice a year - in May around Mother's Day and in late September to early October. Lake sturgeon from Lake Winnebago travel upriver to the Fremont area in spring to spawn. Fremont is known as [...] "the white bass capital of the world".|$|R
50|$|From the {{beginning}} Johnson & Company rates were considered excessive {{compared to those}} on other Western rivers. Additionally merchants at La Paz 280 miles up river objected to the $75 per ton charged by Johnson & Company, while Williamsport 80 miles down river paid only $25 per ton. Now {{in the summer and}} fall of 1863 as merchants <b>upriver</b> rapidly <b>ran</b> out of goods and prices rose astronomically. Steamboat captains and their officers took advantage of the situation by purchasing needed goods on their own account then carried them up river to sell for a quick profit at the now inflated prices, leaving behind identical shipments consigned to the merchants. However even these shipments ended in November when an extreme fall in the river left the Cocopah stranded on a sandbar thirty miles above La Paz.|$|R
50|$|Teaser {{was built}} in 1874 at The Dalles, Oregon, and was {{intended}} to run on the middle Columbia river, which was the stretch of navigable river that ran between the Cascades Rapids and Celilo Falls. At that time, all traffic proceeding upriver had to be offloaded onto a portage railroad that went around the impassable Cascades, then <b>run</b> <b>upriver</b> by rail to the Upper Cascades to be loaded onto another steamer to be carried to The Dalles, where another portage railroad existed around Celilo Falls. The reverse had to be followed for downriver traffic.|$|R
50|$|In 1971, the Air Force {{decided to}} {{preserve}} AVR 661 {{as one of}} the last remaining crash boats from World War II. She was to be placed on display at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, near Dayton, Ohio. That plan was scrapped as the boat was too large for the cargo plane. She was then donated to the PT Boat Museum in Memphis, Tennessee That, too, proved problematic. As she was being <b>run</b> <b>upriver</b> to Memphis, she struck a submerged obstruction and damaged her running gear. Once at Memphis, the boat sank at her moorings.|$|R
5000|$|The book Pacific Graveyard by James Gibbs Jr. {{states that}} the SS Great Republic left San Francisco {{in the spring of}} 1879 and arrived off the mouth of the Columbia at midnight on the 18th of April, and was on the way to Portland, heading <b>upriver,</b> when it <b>ran</b> aground on Sand Island and was lost. This contradicts some {{accounts}} which claim the ship was traveling in the opposite direction, heading out to sea. Primary sources quoted in Gibbs' book support his version of the story, as follows: ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the first}} part of February 1910, Echo was {{operating}} on the run between Coquille City and Myrtle Point. [...] At this time, the interest of Chief Engineer C.I. Kime in the vessel was bought out by Allen Panter. [...] Allen Panter was the son of Capt. W.R. Panter, who owned the remaining interest in the steamer. [...] Part of the deal also included transfer of an interest in the steamer Myrtle, which was used on the south and north forks of the Coquille River, and on <b>runs</b> <b>upriver</b> from Coquille when the water was low.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1896, Miller shifted over to run Annerly as an {{associate}} of Armstrong's Upper Columbia Navig. & Tramway Co. In 1896, Armstrong and Miller built Ruth at Libby, Montana. Launched April 22, 1896, [...] Ruth at 275 tons was the largest steamer yet to operate on the upper Kootenay River. Ruth, like the second Duchess, was designed and built by a professional shipwright. For Ruth the shipwright Louis Pacquet, of Portland, Oregon. [...] Ruth made the runs downriver to Jennings and the smaller Gwendoline <b>ran</b> <b>upriver</b> with the traffic to Canal Flats and the portage tramway.|$|R

50|$|The {{power of}} its engines and cargo {{carrying}} capacity was illustrated by its May 27 - June 6, 1866 <b>run</b> <b>upriver</b> 365 miles to El Dorado Canyon from Yuma, {{under the command of}} Captain Issac Polhamus. She carried 225 tons of cargo in a record time of ten days and two hours despite being slowed for four days out of the ten, where the captain made only 41 miles against the strong current of the spring rise of the river. To do it Polhamus had to transfer the cargo off the two barges he was towing, on board his boat, and leave the barges behind.|$|R
50|$|With the tramways in place, the 300 mi {{transportation}} chain {{from the}} rail depot at Golden to Jennings Montana ran as follows. Freight {{would be taken}} on the tramway to the steamboat dock at Golden, and loaded on a steamer. The steamer <b>ran</b> <b>upriver</b> to {{the south end of}} Windermere Lake. The freight would then be portaged around Mud (or Adlin) Lake, to Columbia Lake. Once at Columbia Lake, the cargo would be loaded again on a steamboat, this time the Pert and run to the south end of Columbia Lake, where it was unloaded again, portaged across Canal Flats and loaded again on another steamer on the Kootenay river, and run down to Jennings, passing through Jennings Canyon.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{steamboat}} {{built and}} launched on the Willamette was Lot Whitcomb, launched at Milwaukie, Oregon, in 1850. Lot Whitcomb was 160 ft long, had 24 ft beam, 5 ft of draft, and 600 gross tons. [...] Her engines {{were designed by}} Jacob Kamm, built in the eastern United States, then shipped in pieces to Oregon. [...] Her first captain was John C. Ainsworth, and her top speed was 12 mph. [...] Lot Whitcomb was able to <b>run</b> <b>upriver</b> 120 mi from Astoria to Oregon City in ten hours, compared to the Columbias two days. She served on the lower river routes until 1854, when she {{was transferred to the}} Sacramento River in California, and renamed the Annie Abernathy.|$|R
5|$|Also in 1994, United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt first {{proposed}} {{the removal of}} several Pacific Northwest dams because of their impact on salmon spawning. The Northwest Power Planning Council approved a plan that provided more water for fish and less for electricity, irrigation, and transportation. Environmental advocates have called {{for the removal of}} certain dams in the Columbia system in the years since. Of the 227major dams in the Columbia River drainage basin, the four Washington dams on the lower Snake River are often identified for removal, for example in an ongoing lawsuit concerning a Bush administration plan for salmon recovery. These dams and reservoirs limit the recovery of <b>upriver</b> salmon <b>runs</b> to Idaho's Salmon and Clearwater rivers. Historically, the Snake produced over 1.5million spring and summer Chinook salmon, a number that has dwindled to several thousand in recent years. Idaho Power Company's Hells Canyon dams have no fish ladders (and do not pass juvenile salmon downstream), and thus allow no steelhead or salmon to migrate above Hells Canyon. In 2007, the destruction of the Marmot Dam on the Sandy River was the first dam removal in the system. Other Columbia Basin dams that have been removed include Condit Dam on Washington's White Salmon River, and the Milltown Dam on the Clark Fork in Montana.|$|R
5000|$|Columbia held a {{monopoly}} on the river until December 25, 1850, when the side-wheeler Lot Whitcomb was launched at Milwaukie, Oregon. Lot Whitcomb was {{much larger than the}} Columbia (160 ft long, 24 ft beam, 5 ft of draft, and 600 gross tons). and far more comfortable. Her engines were designed by Jacob Kamm, built in the eastern United States, then shipped in pieces to Oregon. Her first captain was John C. Ainsworth, and her top speed was 12 mph. [...] Lot Whitcomb charged the same rates as the Columbia and readily picked up most of her business. Lot Whitcomb was able to <b>run</b> <b>upriver</b> 120 mi from Astoria to Oregon City in ten hours, compared to the Columbia's two days. She served on the lower river routes until 1854, when she was transferred to the Sacramento River in California, and renamed the Annie Abernathy.|$|R
40|$|This notice announces BPA`S`s {{decision}} {{to fund the}} Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW), the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), and the Clatsop Economic Development Committee for the Lower Columbia River Terminal Fisheries Research Project (Project). The Project will continue the testing of various species/stocks, rearing regimes, and harvest options for terminal fisheries, {{as a means to}} increase lower river sport and commercial harvest of hatchery fish, while providing both greater protection of weaker wild stocks and increasing the return of <b>upriver</b> salmon <b>runs</b> to potential Zone 6 Treaty fisheries. The Project involves relocating hatchery smolts to new, additional pen locations in three bays/sloughs in the lower Columbia River along both the Oregon and Washington sides. The sites are Blind Slough and Tongue Point in Clatsop County, Oregon, and Grays Bay/Deep River, Wahkiakum County, Washington. The smolts will be acclimated for various lengths of time in the net pens and released from these sites. The Project will expand upon an existing terminal fisheries project in Youngs Bay, Oregon. The Project may be expanded to other sites in the future, depending on the results of this initial expansion. BPA`S has determined the project is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969. Therefore, the preparation of an environmental impact statement is not required, and BPA`S is issuing this FONSI...|$|R
2500|$|Multnomah 's engines {{were first}} tested in June 1851, and in August 1851 the vessel was {{taken on the}} first <b>run</b> <b>upriver.</b> [...] On this trip, Multnomah reached Cressman's Bar, a point about [...] downriver from Salem, Oregon. [...] At Cressman's, the water was so shallow that even Multnomah, which needed only 18inches to run in, could only cross the bar with difficulty. [...] Multnomah was able to proceed [...] further {{upstream}} to Matheny's landing, (now {{the site of the}} Wheatland Ferry where the water was so shallow that no passage was possible. [...] Under political pressure, the territorial legislature authorized funds to excavate the bars, so that by September, 1851, a channel four feet deep extended all the way to Salem. [...] Multnomah was able to work further upriver from Salem, reaching the mouth of Rickreall Creek, according to Mills. [...] Historian Corning states that Multnomah went even further that fall, and became the first steamboat to reach Corvallis, then known as Marysville.|$|R
