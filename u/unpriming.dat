40|$|<b>Unpriming</b> is a {{decrease}} in the influence of primed knowledge following a behavior expressing that knowledge. The authors investigated strategies for <b>unpriming</b> the knowledge of an answer that is activated when people are asked to consider a simple question. Experiment 1 found that prior correct answering eliminated the bias people normally show toward correct responding when asked to answer yes–no questions randomly. Experiment 2 revealed that prior answering intended to be random did not unprime knowledge on subsequent attempts to answer randomly. Experiment 3 found that exposure to the correct answer did not influence the knowledge bias but that exposure to the incorrect answer increased bias. Experiment 4 revealed that merely expressing the answer for oneself was sufficient to unprime knowledge. Experiment 5 found that each item of activated knowledge needs to be unprimed specifically, in that correctly answering 1 question does not reduce the knowledge bias in randomly answering another...|$|E
40|$|When {{asked to}} {{randomly}} select answer choices on easy multiple choice questions, people select more correct answers than expected by chance. Sparrow and Wegner showed that this tendency was eliminated if participants answered questions correctly before answering randomly. They argued that answering a question correctly unprimes {{the tendency to}} choose the correct answer, thereby reducing the correct response rate close to the chance level of. 5. An alternative explanation, consistent with these results, is that answering questions correctly provides a baseline, which allows participants to strategize, i. e., to match and mismatch equal numbers of their purportedly random responses to the baseline response. Three studies showed {{that the presence of}} a baseline, even when <b>unpriming</b> is not feasible, led to lower correct response rates than those obtained in a condition in which no baseline was available. Furthermore, the presence of a baseline led to more nonrandom sequences of correct and incorrect responses. One specific sequence–alternating correct and incorrect answers–mediated the relation between the presence of a baseline and lower correct response rate. These findings suggest that strategizing, not <b>unpriming,</b> accounts for Sparrow and Wegner’s results...|$|E

The study aimed was to determine the effect of salicylic acid and gibberellin on seed reserve utilization, germination and enzyme activity of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) seeds under drought stress.

40|$|The energy {{required}} to fuse synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane ('activation energy') {{is considered a}} major determinant in synaptic efficacy. From reaction rate theory we predict that a class of modulations exists, which utilize linear modulation of the energy barrier for fusion to achieve supralinear effects on the fusion rate. To test this prediction experimentally, we developed a method to assess the number of releasable vesicles, rate constants for vesicle priming, <b>unpriming,</b> and fusion, and the activation energy for fusion by fitting a vesicle state model to synaptic responses induced by hypertonic solutions. We show that Complexinl/II deficiency or phorbol ester stimulation indeed affects responses to hypertonic solution in a supralinear manner. An additive versus multiplicative relationship between activation energy and fusion rate provides a novel explanation for previously observed non-linear effects of genetic/pharmacological perturbations on synaptic transmission and a novel interpretation of the cooperative nature of Ca 2 +-dependent release...|$|E

In order to investigate drought stress on seed reserve utilization and seedling growth of treated seeds of mountain rye (Secale montanum), an experiment was carried out. Factorial experiment {{was carried out in}} completely randomized design with three replications. The first factor was the seed treatments (<b>unpriming,</b> hydropriming and osmopriming) and the second factor was drought stress. To create drought stress, polyetylenglycol 6000 (PEG 6000) in osmotic levels at 0 (as control),- 0. 4,- 0. 8,- 1. 2 and- 1. 6 MPa were used. The results indicated that for these traits: germination percentage (GP), timson index (TI), energy of germination (EG), weight of utilized (mobilized) seed (WMSR), seed reserve utilization efficiency (SRUE), seedling dry weight (SLDW), and seed reserve depletion percentage (SRDP), was a significant treatment × drought interaction.

40|$|The {{migration}} pattern, tissue distribution, and {{turnover rate}} of <b>unprimed</b> and primed B lymphocytes {{involved in the}} adoptive anti-DNP response was studied. The adoptive primary response restored by <b>unprimed</b> spleen or thoracic duct cells passaged through an intermediate host (intravenous injection and subsequent collection in the thoracic duct lymph) was markedly diminished as compared with that restored by unpassaged cells. On the other hand, the adoptive response restored by passaged spleen or thoracic duct cells from DNP-primed donors was greater than or {{the same as that}} restored with unpassaged cells, respectively. This suggests that <b>unprimed</b> B cells change from nonrecirculating to recirculating lymphocytes after exposure to antigen. Studies of the adoptive anti-DNP response restored by <b>unprimed</b> or primed bone marrow cells showed little change in the time-course or amplitude of the response restored by either population of cells. The relative inability of marrow cells to carry immunological memory was related to the inability of recirculating memory cells to penetrate the marrow. The turnover rate of <b>unprimed</b> and primed B cells was investigated by treating the cell donors with [3 H]thymidine for 48 h before removal of thoracic duct or spleen cells. The adoptive anti-DNP response restored by <b>unprimed</b> or primed cells was not affected by [3 H]thymidine treatment. This indicates that both populations of cells turn over slowly. However, our previous studies show that <b>unprimed</b> B cells involved in the adoptive antibody response to ferritin turn over rapidly.

40|$|The {{influenza}} A virus polymerase transcribes and replicates {{the eight}} virion RNA (vRNA) segments. Transcription is initiated with capped RNA primers excised from cellular pre-mRNAs by the intrinsic endonuclease of the viral polymerase. Viral RNA replication occurs in two steps: first a full-length copy of vRNA is made, termed cRNA, {{and then this}} cRNA is copied to produce vRNA. The synthesis of cRNAs and vRNAs is initiated without a primer, {{in contrast to the}} initiation of viral mRNA synthesis, and requires the viral nucleocapsid protein (NP). The mechanism of <b>unprimed</b> viral RNA replication is poorly understood. To elucidate this mechanism, we used purified recombinant influenza virus polymerase complexes and NP to establish an in vitro system that catalyzes the <b>unprimed</b> synthesis of cRNA and vRNA using 50 -nucleotide-long RNA templates. The purified viral polymerase and NP are sufficient for catalyzing this RNA synthesis without a primer, suggesting that host cell factors are not required. We used this purified in vitro replication system to demonstrate that the RNA-binding activity of NP is not required for the <b>unprimed</b> synthesis of cRNA and vRNA. This result rules out two models that postulate that the RNA-binding activity of NP mediates the switch from capped RNA-primed transcription to <b>unprimed</b> viral RNA replication. Because we showed that NP lacking RNA-binding activity binds directly to the viral polymerase, it is likely that a direct interaction between NP and the viral polymerase results in a modification of the polymerase in favor of <b>unprimed</b> initiation...|$|R

An alternate interpretation is that Th cells with restricted activity for CTL. P do exist, but their activity is masked by allogeneic effects. Their presence may be revealed only after clonal expansion and selection during priming. Therefore, we have investigated the nature of Th-CTL.
