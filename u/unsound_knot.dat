40|$|Determining the defects {{that are}} {{located within the}} log is crucial to {{understanding}} the tree/log resource for efficient processing. However, existing means of doing this non-destructively {{requires the use of}} expensive X-ray/CT, MRI, or microwave technology. These methods do not lend themselves to fast, efficient, and cost-effective analysis of logs and tree stems in the mill. This study quantified the rela-tionship between external defect indicators and internal defect characteristics for yellow-poplar logs. A series of models were developed to predict internal features using visible external features, log diameter, indicator width, length, and rise. Good correlations and small prediction errors were observed with sound (sawn), overgrown, and <b>unsound</b> <b>knot</b> defects. For less severe defects such as adventitious buds/clusters and distortion type defects weaker correlations were observed, but the magnitude of prediction errors was small and acceptable...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presented}} {{the results of}} several years of testing the use of ultrasound to find structural defects in pallet parts and pallet cants used to produce pallet parts. To determine the magnitude of unsound defects, we inspected full length cants from seven saw mills from Virginia and West Virginia. Split, wane, shake, holes, decay, <b>unsound</b> <b>knots,</b> bark pocket, and mechanical defects were all considered as unsound defects. Regardless of mill and species, split {{accounted for the highest}} percentage of defect volume per cant. Decay: bark pockets, shake, and holes also contributed significantly to the total defect volume. The scanning results of deckboards, stringers and cants showed that ultrasound can be used effectively to locate, identify, and quantify the various pallet parts defects. Significant losses of ultrasound signals/energies were observed through these defects. Other ultrasound parameters, such as time of flight, pulse length can be used for characterizing defects. Reconstructed two-dimensional images were able to show the exact position and surface area of the defects. Defects can be classified/distinguished using classifying tools like multi-layer perceptron, probabilistic neural network, and k-nearest neighbor. Results demonstrated that real-time, online inspection and classification of defects in wooden pallet parts are possible by ultrasound scanning. Results also showed that pallet cants can be graded by unsound wood content and that processing full length cants to cut-to-size cants can be optimized with the knowledge of defect size and location provided by the ultrasound scanning...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} users of thin, unsurfaced {{hardwood}} lumber is the pallet manufacturing industry. Almost all manufactured products spend part of their life cycle on a pallet during transportation. This makes pallets {{a critical component of}} both the transportation and manufacturing sectors of the economy. Many newly constructed wooden pallets, however, are not currently manufactured to deliver the best performance (strength, durability, and safety) —despite interest by pallet users and pallet manufacturers—because manual grading and sorting of parts is impractical due to processing speeds and volume, labor costs, and laborer skill. This paper describes initial work aiming to create an automated grading/sorting system for hardwood pallet parts using ultrasonic. Experiments were conducted on yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera, L.) and red oak (Quercus rubra, L.) deckboards using pressurecontact, rolling transducers in a pitch-catch arrangement. Sound and <b>unsound</b> <b>knots,</b> cross grain, bark pockets, holes, splits, and decay were characterized using six ultrasound variables calculated from the received waveforms. Our scanning system shows good data-collection repeatability, and scanning rate has little effect on the calculated variables. For each defect type, at least one ultrasonic variable demonstrated significant capability to discriminate between that defect and clear wood. Energy loss variables exhibited the greatest sensitivity to many defect types. Based on the empirical relationships identified in this study, we are now developing models to classify defects using ultrasonic signal characteristics. Scanning properties of the prototype apparatus suggest that it can readily be translated into a commercial product.

40|$|The {{classification}} of round wood {{depends on the}} defects and other morphological features of a tree trunk. Various tree species growing on different forest sites and in different conditions eventually present a wood quality influenced by said factors. The objective {{of this paper was}} to find out: 1) the distribution of round wood qua-lity classes of beech in three different site conditions and 2) the frequency of the defects influencing timber grading. The research was carried out on 15 different sample plots of three site quality classes, on which 1389 beech logs were classified according to the existing grading scheme. The most common timber quality (by vo-lume) was WC 0 and then in decreasing order: WD, WB 0 and WA 0, in proportions of: 15 : 10 : 4 : 1. This order was the same for the assortments obtained from the trees in all the analysed site quality classes. The most frequent defects influencing wood quality were knots, among which sound knots were in the majority. The proportion of the appearance of knots was 7 : 3 : 2 for sound <b>knots,</b> <b>unsound</b> and dead <b>knots,</b> as well as covered knots, respectively. Sweep, red heart and scars were of a similar frequency to sound knots, approx. 20 %. Double pith, shakes, rot, top diameter an...|$|R
