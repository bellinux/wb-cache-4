5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{is named}} Northeastern Pennsylvania Salesman of the Year and {{must make a}} speech at an {{association}} meeting at the Radisson Lackawanna Station Hotel, getting some assistance from Michael Scott (Steve Carell). Before he leaves, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), in retaliation for Dwight's cocky attitude, gives him {{tips on how to}} give public speeches. Unknown to Dwight, Jim's tips are taken from a speech by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, the fascist dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. When Michael and Dwight make it to the convention, Dwight gets cold feet and Michael goes up and tries to relive his glory days of winning Salesman of the Year two years in a row, but ends up bombing. Dwight finally works <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> to give his speech and, using Jim's advice, wins over the crowd with a passionate yet unorthodox speech, which Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) videotapes from the back. Michael ends up leaving the convention room and later entertains Dwight with his tales at the bar.|$|E

25|$|Henry and Emma {{return to}} Regina's cave. Emma asks {{to speak with}} Regina alone, and tells {{her that if she}} tells Robin the truth about how she feels, {{everything}} will be fixed and they can both get their happy endings with the men they love, acknowledging that she herself never got the chance to tell Hook how she really felt before it was too late. The trio arrive at the chapel to stop the wedding, but before they can do so, Rumple suddenly appears to stop them. Emma and Henry try to distract Rumple as Regina tries to work <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> to interrupt the ceremony. Emma engages Rumple in a sword fight, until he is able to knock her out temporarily. He then aims his sword at Henry, but Regina jumps in front of him just in time to take the hit herself, opting to save Henry instead of pursuing Robin. Moments later, Robin and Zelena exit the chapel and Robin rushes to Regina's side as Zelena's envy starts to take over, causing her to start turning green. Robin tells Regina that she won't have to die alone.|$|E

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} is {{a disease}} that affects the central nervous system. Most doctors and scientists {{believe that it is}} an autoimmune disease. Simply put, the immune system attacks <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> in a person’s body, thereby causing myelin damage, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. The plaque that then builds <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> is scar tissue created when the wounds made by the immune system heal.

40|$|Radioactive {{triiodothyronine}} {{reaching the}} rat brain after intravenous administration is rapidly and selectively taken <b>up</b> in <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> ending fraction. A concentration gradient of radioactivity from brain cytosol to synaptosomes is observed at 5 min, increases linearly {{over the first}} hour, and is maintained for at least 10 hr. Radioactivity in the synaptosomes is due to triiodothyronine (90 %) plus a single unidentified metabolite (10 %). Approximately 85 % of the synaptosomal radioactivity is released by osmotic disruption of the particles. The process of selective uptake, concentration, and retention of triiodothyronine in <b>nerve</b> terminals of <b>the</b> rat brain {{may be related to}} the sympathomimetic and behavior-altering effects of the thyroid hormones...|$|R
50|$|The {{nervous system}} can be {{described}} as a control system that interconnects the other body systems.

It uses electrical and chemical signals to send out responses to different parts of the body, and it is made <b>up</b> of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> cells also called neurons. Through the system, messages are transmitted to body tissues such as a muscle. There are two major subdivisions in the nervous system known as the central and peripheral nervous system.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> median <b>nerve</b> {{is known}} to show {{variations}} in its origin, course, relations and distribution. But in almost all cases it passes through the cubital fossa. We saw a cubital fossa without a median <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> median <b>nerve</b> had a normal course in {{the upper part of}} front of the arm but in the distal third of the arm it passed in front of the medial epicondyle of humerus, surrounded by fleshy fibres of pronator teres muscle. Its course and distribution in the forearm was normal. In the same limb, the fleshy fibres of the brachialis muscle directly continued into the forearm as brachioradialis, there being no fibrous septum separating the two muscles from each other. The close relationship of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> to <b>the</b> epicondyle might make it vulnerable in the fractures of the epicondyle. The muscle fibres surrounding <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> might pull <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> and result in altered sensory-motor functions of the hand. Since the brachialis and brachioradialis are two muscles supplied by two different nerves, this continuity of the muscles might result in compression/entrapment of <b>the</b> radial <b>nerve</b> in it...|$|R

The results show that the fibres constituting <b>the</b> left <b>nerve</b> have a greater mean diameter but a lower mean density that those constitution <b>the</b> right <b>nerve.</b> This suggests that the diameter of the myelinated fibres and the density of both the myelinated and unmyelinated fibres do not vary from male to female. On the other hand, the G ratio and the diameter of the unmyelinated axons do, since <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> on <b>the</b> right side (in both sexes) have higher morphometric values, on average, than the contralateral ones...|$|R
5000|$|Instigated by {{the work}} of Luigi Galvani (1737-1798) on bioelectricity, Matteucci began in 1830 a series of {{experiments}} which he pursued until his death in 1865. Using a sensitive galvanometer of Leopoldo Nobili, he was able to prove that injured excitable biological tissues generated direct electrical currents, and that they could be summed up by adding elements in series, like in Alessandro Volta’s (1745-1827) electric pile. Thus, Mateucci was able to develop what he called a [...] "rheoscopic frog", by using <b>the</b> cut <b>nerve</b> of a frog’s leg and its attached muscle as a kind of sensitive electricity detector. His work in bioelectricity influenced directly the research developed by Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818-1896), a student of the great German biologist Johannes Peter Müller (1801-1858) in Berlin, who tried the duplicate Matteucci’s experiments and ended <b>up</b> discovering <b>the</b> <b>nerve's</b> action potential. In 1844, for these studies, Matteucci was awarded with the Copley medal by the Royal Society.|$|R

5000|$|The {{olfactory}} foramina, {{also known}} as the cribriform foramina (cribr- is [...] "a sieve" [...] in Greek), is the grouping of holes located on the cribriform plate. The cribriform plate forms the roof of the nasal cavity, and the olfactory foramina are in the two depressions lateral to the median blade of the cribriform plate called the crista galli. There is a pair of olfactory bulbs of the brain that rest in these two depressions. These holes that make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> olfactory foramina allow passage for about 20 bundles of nerve fibers that make <b>up</b> <b>the</b> olfactory <b>nerve,</b> {{also known as}} Cranial Nerve I (CNI), from the nasal cavity to meet with the olfactory bulbs. Therefore, the olfactory foramina are necessary for the human sense of [...] smell. These foramina vary in size and number with age.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that thymoleptics of the Imipramine type owe their anti-depressant activity to a blockade of a mechanism {{in the brain}} which usually is called the membrane pump.

Evidence for such a mem brane pump blocking effect by Imipramine and related drugs was first obtained in peri pheral sympathetic nerves.
