5|$|Diagnosis of MTBI {{is based}} on {{physical}} and neurological examination findings, duration of <b>unconsciousness</b> (usually less than 30minutes) and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA; usually less than 24hours), and the Glasgow Coma Scale (MTBI sufferers have scores of 13 to 15). Neuropsychological tests exist to measure cognitive function and the international consensus meeting in Zurich recommended {{the use of the}} SCAT2 test.|$|E
5|$|Mamie largely raised Emmett {{with her}} mother; she and Louis Till {{separated}} in 1942 after {{she discovered that}} he had been unfaithful. Louis later abused her, choking her to <b>unconsciousness,</b> to which she responded by throwing scalding water at him. For violating court orders to stay away from Mamie, Louis Till was forced by a judge in 1943 to choose between jail or enlisting in the U.S. Army.|$|E
5|$|Other bite {{symptoms}} {{that may occur}} in humans include edema, which may become extensive, shock, watery blood oozing from the puncture wounds, nausea and vomiting, subcutaneous bruising, blood blisters that may form rapidly, and a painful swelling of the regional lymph nodes. Swelling usually decreases after a few days, except for the area immediately around the bite site. Hypotension, together with weakness, dizziness and periods of semi- or <b>unconsciousness</b> is also reported.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, <b>unconsciousness,</b> anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (<b>unconsciousness),</b> life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} can cause seizures, brief periods of rigidity followed by convulsions and <b>unconsciousness,</b> and {{is of concern}} to divers who encounter greater than atmospheric pressures. Pulmonary oxygen toxicity results in damage to the lungs, causing pain and difficulty in breathing. Oxidative damage to the eye may lead to myopia or partial detachment of the retina. Pulmonary and ocular damage {{are most likely to}} occur when supplemental oxygen is administered as part of a treatment, particularly to newborn infants, but are also a concern during hyperbaric oxygen therapy.|$|E
5|$|Knights of the Old Republic II starts {{five years}} after the events of the first game and follows the story of The Exile, a Jedi Knight who was exiled from the Jedi Order. During this time, the Jedi Order has been almost {{completely}} wiped out by the Sith. The game begins with the protagonist waking up from <b>unconsciousness</b> on an asteroid mining facility. After he or she escapes with the help of their party members, they find the person who exiled them ten years ago, who sends the protagonist on a mission to seek out the remaining Jedi to fight against the Sith.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{convince}} Padmé about Anakin's {{turn to the}} dark side, Obi-Wan stows aboard her ship. Padmé travels to Mustafar and implores Vader to leave the dark side. He refuses, and upon witnessing Obi-Wan, chokes Padmé into <b>unconsciousness</b> {{in a fit of}} rage. Obi-Wan duels and defeats Vader, severing most of his limbs and leaving him at the bank of a lava river where he is horribly burned. On Coruscant, Yoda battles Palpatine until their duel reaches a stalemate. Yoda flees with Bail Organa while Palpatine, sensing that his apprentice is in danger, travels to Mustafar.|$|E
5|$|Dense gases such as xenon and {{sulfur hexafluoride}} can be breathed safely when mixed {{with at least}} 20% oxygen. Xenon at 80% {{concentration}} along with 20% oxygen rapidly produces the <b>unconsciousness</b> of general anesthesia (and {{has been used for}} this, as discussed above). Breathing mixes gases of different densities very effectively and rapidly so that heavier gases are purged along with the oxygen, and do not accumulate {{at the bottom of the}} lungs. There is, however, a danger associated with any heavy gas in large quantities: it may sit invisibly in a container, and a person who enters an area filled with an odorless, colorless gas, may be asphyxiated without warning. Xenon is rarely used in large enough quantities for this to be a concern, though the potential for danger exists any time a tank or container of xenon is kept in an unventilated space.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{impending}} divorce, Farrar initially declined {{to move out}} of the family home. He was concerned that Green, who had never been a heavy drinker of alcohol, was suddenly consuming large quantities of it while supervising the children. Though Green continued her routine of ferrying the children to after-school activities, she would spend her evenings drinking at home, sometimes to the point of <b>unconsciousness</b> and nearly always until she lost what inhibitions she had left about her language in front of the children. On one occasion, Farrar was called home from work by the children, who had found their mother unresponsive. Green had disappeared from the home by the time Farrar arrived there, and though he eventually discovered that she had been hiding in the basement while he searched for her, she claimed at the time to have been wandering the town, hoping to be hit by a car. Farrar moved out of the family home in early autumn due to concerns about his personal safety.|$|E
5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the electric chair and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee <b>unconsciousness.</b> However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|Methods of euthanizing {{laboratory}} {{animals are}} chosen to induce rapid <b>unconsciousness</b> and death without pain or distress. The methods that are preferred are those published by councils of veterinarians. The animal {{can be made}} to inhale a gas, such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, by being placed in a chamber, or by use of a face mask, with or without prior sedation or anesthesia. Sedatives or anesthetics such as barbiturates can be given intravenously, or inhalant anesthetics may be used. Amphibians and fish may be immersed in water containing an anesthetic such as tricaine. Physical methods are also used, with or without sedation or anesthesia depending on the method. Recommended methods include decapitation (beheading) for small rodents or rabbits. Cervical dislocation (breaking the neck or spine) may be used for birds, mice, and immature rats and rabbits. Maceration (grinding into small pieces) is used on 1 day old chicks. High-intensity microwave irradiation of the brain can preserve brain tissue and induce death in less than 1 second, but this is currently only used on rodents. Captive bolts may be used, typically on dogs, ruminants, horses, pigs and rabbits. It causes death by a concussion to the brain. Gunshot may be used, but only in cases where a penetrating captive bolt may not be used. Some physical methods are only acceptable after the animal is unconscious. Electrocution may be used for cattle, sheep, swine, foxes, and mink after the animals are unconscious, often by a prior electrical stun. Pithing (inserting a tool into the base of the brain) is usable on animals already unconscious. Slow or rapid freezing, or inducing air embolism are acceptable only with prior anesthesia to induce <b>unconsciousness.</b>|$|E
5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still hanging from his wrist, to beat the officers into <b>unconsciousness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oxygen {{toxicity}} is {{a catastrophic}} hazard in diving, because a seizure results in near certain death by drowning. The seizure may occur suddenly {{and with no}} warning symptoms. The effects are sudden convulsions and <b>unconsciousness,</b> during which victims can lose their regulator and drown. One {{of the advantages of}} a full-face diving mask is prevention of regulator loss {{in the event of a}} seizure. As there is an increased risk of central nervous system oxygen toxicity on deep dives, long dives and dives where oxygen-rich breathing gases are used, divers are taught to calculate a maximum operating depth for oxygen-rich breathing gases, and cylinders containing such mixtures must be clearly marked with that depth.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Paul Tillich {{argued that}} {{religious}} faith is best expressed through symbolism because a symbol {{points to a}} meaning beyond itself and best expresses transcendent religious beliefs. He believed that any statement about God is symbolic and participates in {{the meaning of a}} concept. Tillich used the example of a national flag to illustrate his point: a flag points to something beyond itself, the country it represents, but also participates in the meaning of the country. He believed that symbols could unite a religious believer with a deeper dimension of himself as well as with a greater reality. Tillich believed that symbols must emerge from an individual collective <b>unconsciousness,</b> and can only function when they are accepted by the unconscious. He believed that symbols cannot be invented, but live and die at the appropriate times.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms are {{dependent}} {{on the type of}} TBI (diffuse or focal) and {{the part of the brain}} that is affected. <b>Unconsciousness</b> tends to last longer for people with injuries on the left side of the brain than for those with injuries on the right. Symptoms are also dependent on the injury's severity. With mild TBI, the patient may remain conscious or may lose consciousness for a few seconds or minutes. Other symptoms of mild TBI include headache, vomiting, nausea, lack of motor coordination, dizziness, difficulty balancing, lightheadedness, blurred vision or tired eyes, ringing in the ears, bad taste in the mouth, fatigue or lethargy, and changes in sleep patterns. Cognitive and emotional symptoms include behavioral or mood changes, confusion, and trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking. Mild TBI symptoms may also be present in moderate and severe injuries.|$|E
5|$|The main {{manifestations of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning develop in the organ systems most dependent on oxygen use, {{the central nervous system}} and the heart. The initial symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include headache, nausea, malaise, and fatigue. These symptoms are often mistaken for a virus such as influenza or other illnesses such as food poisoning or gastroenteritis. Headache is the most common symptom of acute carbon monoxide poisoning; it is often described as dull, frontal, and continuous. Increasing exposure produces cardiac abnormalities including fast heart rate, low blood pressure, and cardiac arrhythmia; central nervous system symptoms include delirium, hallucinations, dizziness, unsteady gait, confusion, seizures, central nervous system depression, <b>unconsciousness,</b> respiratory arrest, and death. Less common symptoms of acute carbon monoxide poisoning include myocardial ischemia, atrial fibrillation, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, high blood sugar, lactic acidosis, muscle necrosis, acute kidney failure, skin lesions, and visual and auditory problems.|$|E
5|$|There is {{controversy}} {{concerning the}} safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, uncertainty remains {{as to whether they}} cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn. Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep <b>unconsciousness.</b> However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to her barrier city, Aki joins Sid and appears before the leadership council along with General Hein (James Woods), who is determined to use the powerful Zeus space cannon to destroy the Phantoms. Aki is concerned the cannon will damage Earth's Gaia (a spirit representing its ecosystem) and delays the use of it by revealing {{that she has been}} infected and the collected spirit signatures are keeping her infection stable, convincing the council that there may be another way to defeat the Phantoms. However, this revelation leads Hein to incorrectly conclude that she is being controlled by the Phantoms. Aki and the Deep Eyes squad succeed in finding the seventh spirit as Aki's infection begins to worsen and she slips into <b>unconsciousness.</b> Her dream reveals to her that the Phantoms are the spirits of dead aliens brought to Earth on a fragment of their destroyed planet. Sid uses the seventh spirit to bring Aki's infection back under control, reviving her.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of <b>unconsciousness</b> (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E
5|$|John's {{preparations}} have no effect, however, {{as he is}} tricked into {{killing the}} guardian that had been preventing the tragedy, freeing a beast which can control the collective <b>unconsciousness</b> of mankind. John Constantine cuts his own wrists, in order to free himself from consciousness, and plays a confidence trick on the beast, allowing his friends time to use the collective consciousness to rebuild the guardian that had kept the beast trapped. However, in this process, Swamp Thing has his human soul removed, setting up the fourth run of the comic, relaunched shortly afterward. In the process John loses his memory, setting up the {{events leading up to}} the 200th issue. Leading up to the landmark issue, John has little control over events, and is led along by a psychic serial killer, who threatens to kill Chas and his family, and a demon, Rosacarnis, who offers his memories back, at the cost of 24 hours in her service. John eventually gives into this offer, and the 200th issue shows how Rosacarnis manipulates his reality, making him raise three children with her, in the guise of Kit Ryan, from Garth Ennis's time on the title, Zed, from Jamie Delano's, and Angie, from the current run, with three different artists, Steve Dillon, Marcelo Frusin and Leonardo Manco each drawing one story, as the past, present and future of the title.|$|E
5|$|Mary's son by Darnley, James, {{was born}} on 19 June 1566 in Edinburgh Castle, but the murder of Rizzio led inevitably to the {{breakdown}} of her marriage. In October 1566, while staying at Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders, Mary made a journey on horseback of at least four hours each way to visit the Earl of Bothwell at Hermitage Castle, where he lay ill from wounds sustained in a skirmish with border reivers. The ride was later used as evidence by Mary's enemies that the two were lovers, though no suspicions were voiced {{at the time and}} Mary had been accompanied by her councillors and guards. Immediately after her return to Jedburgh, she suffered a serious illness that included frequent vomiting, loss of sight, loss of speech, convulsions and periods of <b>unconsciousness.</b> She was thought to be near death or dying. Her recovery from 25 October onwards was credited to the skill of her French physicians. The cause of her illness is unknown; diagnoses include physical exhaustion and mental stress, haemorrhage of a gastric ulcer, and porphyria.|$|E

25|$|Hypothermia, {{in which}} a person loses {{critical}} core temperature, can lead to <b>unconsciousness</b> or heart failure.|$|E
25|$|General {{anesthesia}} suppresses {{central nervous}} system activity and results in <b>unconsciousness</b> and total lack of sensation.|$|E
25|$|General anesthetics are a {{class of}} psychoactive drug used on people to block {{physical}} pain and other sensations. Most anesthetics induce <b>unconsciousness,</b> allowing the person to undergo medical procedures like surgery without the feelings of physical pain or emotional trauma. To induce <b>unconsciousness,</b> anesthetics affect the GABA and NMDA systems. For example, halothane is a GABA agonist, and ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist.|$|E
25|$|Episodic, {{characteristic}} definitive spells {{of vertigo}} lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours with no <b>unconsciousness,</b> vestibular nystagmus always present.|$|E
25|$|Sedation {{suppresses}} {{the central}} nervous system to a lesser degree, inhibiting both anxiety and creation of long-term memories without resulting in <b>unconsciousness.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to Heirens, {{he remembered}} {{drifting}} into <b>unconsciousness</b> under questioning. The police {{had taken him}} to Bridewell Hospital, which was adjacent to the Cook County Jail. The questioning became more violent.|$|E
25|$|Typically, three {{drugs are}} used in lethal injection. Sodium thiopental is used to induce <b>unconsciousness,</b> pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) to cause muscle {{paralysis}} and respiratory arrest, and potassium chloride to stop the heart.|$|E
25|$|When sodium pentobarbital, a {{barbiturate}} used {{often in}} single drug animal euthanasia, is administered in an overdose, it causes rapid <b>unconsciousness</b> followed by paralysis of the diaphragm. This drug may also kill via cardiac arrhythmia.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of acute non-medical exposure {{are similar to}} those of alcohol intoxication, beginning with headache, dizziness, and confusion and progressing with increasing exposure to <b>unconsciousness.</b> Respiratory and circulatory depression can result in death.|$|E
