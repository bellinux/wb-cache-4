Setting: Male and female recruits from a start-to-run (STR) program during a 10 -week training period. Participants: One hundred thirty one healthy subjects (20 men and 111 women), without a history of any lower-leg complaint, participated in the study. Interventions: Before {{the start of the}} 10 -week STR program, plantar force measurements during running were performed. During STR, lower leg injuries were diagnosed and registered by a sports physician. Main outcome measurements: Plantar force measurements during running were performed using a footscan pressure plate (RsScan International). Results: During the STR, 27 subjects (5 male and 22 female) developed a LLOI. Logistic regression analysis revealed that subjects who developed a LLOI had a significantly more laterally directed force distribution at first metatarsal contact and forefoot flat, a more laterally directed force displacement in the forefoot contact phase, foot flat phase and at heel-off.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 20 th Annual South African Transport Conference 16 - 20 July 2001 "Meeting the transport challenges in Southern Africa", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: The application of a non-destructive test method for the determination of elastic properties of pavement layers and soil layers is being discussed. This method makes use of the seismic wave theory through the analysis of surface waves S A S W (Spectral analysis of surface waves. The SASW method is based on generation and detection of elastic stress waves, known as surface waves. Surface waves have a unique characteristic that, if the wave length is varied, the velocity of propagation of the surface waves also varies. This phenomenon is called dispersion. The dispersion characteristic of surface waves can be utilised to determine the layering and modulus profiles of pavement systems quite accurately. The method is non-destructive. Measurements are made at strains below. 001 % where the elastic properties of the materials are independent of the strain amplitude. The method is such that both the source and the receivers are located on the ground surface. The source is simply a transient vertical impact, which generates a group of surface waves of various frequencies that the medium transmits. A pilot study was conducted on a test site, with different test sections, that was situated on the road D 2388 near Cullinan in Gauteng Province. These test sections were constructed with different base course materials {{as part of a}} labour intensive project. The aim was to find out how well the SASW method could be applied to obtain information on the deterioration of the pavement, in terms of the change in stiffness, with the increase in number of wheel load repetitions. The results obtained were such that a relatively complete picture of the status {{of the structure of the}} road could be obtained. The deterioration with the increase in load repetitions was well defined. The testing contributed to a better knowledge and understanding of what is happening <b>underneath</b> a <b>loaded</b> pavement structure.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess differences in plantar pressure measures, during a straight run, 45 ° and 90 ° cut, performed on each of these surfaces. Eight male university rugby players completed three trials of each movement on both a third generation artificial turf and natural grass surface. Speed was controlled, and pressure insoles were used to collect peak pressure, peak force, pressure-time integral and relative load data under the Medial Heel, Lateral Heel, Midfoot, Medial, Central and Lateral Forefoot, Hallux and Lesser Toes. No surface effect was found for any of the above variables. A significant movement effect was found, whereby cutting increased peak pressures, force and pressure-time integrals under the Medial Heel, Lateral Heel, Medial Forefoot, Central Forefoot and Hallux. Cutting reduced peak pressures, forces and pressure-time integrals under the Lateral Forefoot and Midfoot. Relative load data suggested a medial shift in <b>loading</b> <b>underneath</b> the foot during cutting compared to running; however larger increases in loading at the heel may have masked differences in loading at other foot regions.

40|$|In Rotterdam <b>underneath</b> {{the first}} <b>load</b> bearing sand layer is {{a layer of}} {{compressible}} soil, called the "Kedichem" layer. Under this layer of compresible soil is another load bearing sand layer located, at approximately - 50 m NAP, {{but most of the}} buildings in Rotterdam are foundated on the first loadbearing sand layer at approximately - 23 m NAP. Due to this most buildings undergo differential settlements caused by deformations in the Kedichem layer. This differential settlements causes an increase of internal forces in the structure. Highrise buildings are causing higher deformations in the Kedichem layer because a highrise building has a large weight on a relative small area. This thesis is a research of the behaviour of a highrise building on compressible soil. The main research question is: Can a structure be modified to reduce the differential settlements. As a case study the Cooltower will be used. The height of the building is 102 m, and the floorplan is 29 x 29 m. The structure of the building is modeled in the structural software Scia Egineer. The differential settlements caused by the deformations in the Kedichem layer are introduced in the structural model by forces on a stiff spring element. The deformations in the Kedichem layer are calculated by using a soil settlement program, called D-settlement. Due to the deformations in the Kedichem layer the force flow in the structure will change. The force flow describes how the forces in the structure are distributed to the foundation. To calculate the final force flow it is needed to perform some iterations between the soil settlement software and the structural computer program To answer the research question there are 2 D calculations made to investigate the influence of the connections between the precast elements on the differential settlements. Also the influence of the openings in the structure on the differential settlements is investigated in this part. After this step there are 3 D calculations made of the Cooltower. In this part the interaction between core and facade is studied. In this part it is tried to reduce the differential settlements in the facade by adjusting the stiffness of the facade, and it is investigated in which way the differential settlements between the core and the facade can be reduced. The main conclusion of this thesis is {{that it is difficult to}} create a general conclusion for the differential settlements due to the many factors that influence the differential settlements in the structure. Most of the researched topics in this thesis don't influence the differential settlements that much. The stiffness of the facade influences the behavior of the Cooltower on compressible soil the most. By making the facade twice as stiff, the differential settlements will be reduced by 37 % on average. The conclusion is only valid for the Cooltower. For the Cooltower the extra normal forces in the columns of the facade due to the differential settlement can be estimated to be 15 % of the forces in the structure due to the permanent and the variable load. In preliminary design phase the structure can be designed with a unity check of 0, 85. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural EngineeringStructural and Building Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) The {{fundamental}} {{mechanical behaviour}} of perlite composite foam is studied theoretically and experimentally for basic understanding {{and the development}} of predictive models and practical applications. The existence of plane stress/strain compressive properties and volume fractions of structural elements of perlite foam are conceptualised for the basic understanding, leading to the development of predictive models of compressive properties, and development of sandwich composites for practical applications. Novel composites made of expanded perlite particles and sodium silicate solution were developed. For the composites development, expanded perlite particles were characterised for various densities and porosities. Sodium silicate (as a binder) dehydration behaviour was characterised with phases formed during dehydration i. e. liquid, gel, and solid phases. The water-loss time curve for dehydration was found to have three distinctive parts—a linear part at an early stage for the liquid phase, followed by non-linear part during a period between the commencement of the gel and hydrated solid phase formations, and then another linear part for the hydrated solid phase. For the purpose of sandwich composite development, mechanical properties of Brown paper were investigated by coating the paper on one side with varying sodium silicate content in dilution. When Brown paper was coated with diluted or undiluted binder, its tensile properties were affected due to the sodium silicate content in dilution. The best performance of Brown paper was found when coated with undiluted binder. A novel mechanical behaviour of perlite/sodium silicate composites was studied with the benefits of a new manufacturing method based on perlite particle buoyancy. The objective was to develop perlite composites and to understand the quantitative relations between manufacturing parameters, volume fractions of constituents, and properties. Foams as composites were manufactured with diluted sodium silicate binder for a density range of 0. 2 – 0. 5 g/cm³. One of practical milestones achieved for composite properties without reinforcement was a density of 0. 3 g/cm³ at a compressive strength of 1 MPa. Manufactured perlite/sodium silicate composites were analysed and discussed for understanding from three different perspectives: manufacturing parameters (binder content, compaction pressure, and compaction ratio), properties (particle size, density, compressive strength, and modulus), and volume fractions of constituents. A rule of mixtures applicable for perlite composites for a constant compaction ratio was developed in comparison with that for particulate composites with non-compaction. This may be a basis for further development for variable compaction ratio. The mechanism of internal structure formation of perlite composite foams due to compaction was identified. Foam and particle envelope densities and volume fractions were theoretically modelled for prediction and practical evaluation. The volume fractions, as functions of manufacturing variables, include those affected by topological change of internal structure of foam after the compaction process, consisting of binder, perlite material, the porous zone of original particles, debris zone, and inter-particle voids. Predictions were validated against directly measured values for foam and particle envelope densities. A problem with the conventional method for obtaining volume fraction of binder was analytically addressed in terms of error sensitivity. Values for volume fraction of binder obtained from the conventional method were found to have errors up to about 300 % (or about three times validated errors). An example is given to show how the predictive models can be used for optimisation of manufacturing and properties. The applicability of formulas based on the new evaluative method is also shown for syntactic foams. Experimental results were obtained from a foam density range of 0. 16 – 0. 50 g/cm³ and a porosity range of 0. 79 – 0. 93 for expanded perlite particle sizes of between 3 – 4 mm, a compaction ratio range of 1. 00 – 3. 56, and a pure sodium silicate content range of 0. 05 – 0. 35 g/ml in dilution of water for binder. A predictive model for compressive strength based on the rule of mixtures was developed. A ternary system diagram for binder, debris, and porous particles was conceptualised {{as the basis for the}} modelling. Relationships between volume fractions of foam structural elements and binder, and manufacturing variables—binder content and compaction ratio—were quantified. The model prediction capability has been verified as follows: (a) predictions of compressive strength for varying compaction ratio with a constant binder content were made, and differences between prediction and experiment were found to be in a range of – 13 %– 6 %; and (b) predictions of compressive strength for varying binder content with a constant compaction ratio were made, and differences between prediction and experiment were found to be in a range of – 5. 2 %– 10 %. The accuracy of the model predictions may be regarded as being acceptable for understanding compressive strength of perlite composite foam and for practical applications. Novel compressive behaviour of perlite/sodium silicate composite foam was studied in relation to plane stress and plane strain conditions. Plane stress and plane strain conditions were theoretically conceptualised for compressive strength and modulus of perlite syntactic foams, and their existence as experimentally verified for practical characterisation. The highest compressive strength under plain strain and compressive modulus under plane stress were experimentally found to be about 50 % and 200 % higher than the lowest values under plane stress and plane strain, respectively. A new failure mode under plane strain was identified as the progressive densification. Flexural behaviour of perlite/sodium silicate composites was studied using a new manufacturing method based on flotation of lightweight particles for applications of sandwich foam core materials. The sodium silicate content in composites (a perlite particle size of 2 – 3 mm) was varied for a range of 0. 1 – 0. 3 g/ml, and compaction ratio for moulding for a range of 2. 0 – 3. 0. Cracking during three-point bending tests was initiated from the tension sides of specimens. Incidentally, no indentation damage was visually detected on the top surface <b>underneath</b> the <b>loading</b> point. This identification of failure cause may be useful for future improvement of mechanical performance. Under flexural loading, energy absorption in composites was found to be in operation after initial cracking, supporting their candidacy for wide applications where gypsum boards are dominant. It was deduced from both flexural testing results and fracture mechanism that compressive strength is higher than tensile strength, suggesting future directions of mechanical performance improvement. Finally, a sandwich structure consisting of perlite composite foam as core and Brown paper as skin was developed, and its flexural behaviour was studied in relation to properties of constituents and manufacturing variables (binder content and compaction ratio) of perlite composite foam core consolidated with sodium silicate binder by compaction. The sandwich structure was fabricated with the best-performed Brown paper and perlite composite foam core, made by varying binder content and compaction ratio. It was found that the performance of the sandwich structure for core shear strength, skin normal strength, and stiffness was significantly affected by manufacturing variables of perlite foam core. The load carrying capacity of perlite foam core reinforced with Brown paper for the sandwich structure was increased between 3 – 7 times an unreinforced core, depending on how binder content and compaction ratio were combined for manufacturing the perlite foam core. The flexural failure of perlite composite foam core was initiated from the tension side of the flexural specimen regardless of manufacturing variables. However, when the foam core was reinforced with Brown paper, the failure initiation site shifted to the mid-plane of flexural specimens when binder content and compaction ratio were lowered...|$|R
