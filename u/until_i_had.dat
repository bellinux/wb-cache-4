25|$|Upon {{watching}} {{the tape of}} the beating, LAPD chief of police Daryl Gates said: I stared at the screen in disbelief. I played the one-minute-50-second tape again. Then again and again, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> viewed it 25 times. And still I could not believe what I was looking at. To see my officers engage {{in what appeared to}} be excessive use of force, possibly criminally excessive, to see them beat a man with their batons 56 times, to see a sergeant on the scene who did nothing to seize control, was something I never dreamed I would witness.|$|E
500|$|As the Varner–Hogg {{restoration}} {{wound to}} a halt, Hogg refocused her attention on her Houston home, Bayou Bend, which housed {{some of her}} personal collection of antiques and artwork. The New York Times described her [...] "superb Early American furniture" [...] collection in 1953, {{and she had a}} large collection of Americana and colonial Mexican decorative arts, some of which are still in the house. In the late 1950s she said: [...] "I had been collecting American furniture. I collected, and collected, and collected, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> so much of it I didn't {{know what to do with}} it. I decided to give it to a museum." [...] She collaborated with the original architect John Staub on structural changes that would prepare the home to be a museum. She denuded the home of personal items and items that did not meet her concept; the only piece of non-American furniture in the home was her English dining table, which had too many memories for her to remove it.|$|E
500|$|Goldman's {{circle of}} radicals, socialists, and bohemians was joined in 1912 by a nurse, Margaret Sanger, whose {{mother had been}} through 18 pregnancies in 22 years, and died at age 50 of {{tuberculosis}} and cervical cancer.Engelman, pp. 29–30 (Goldman circle).Cox, p. 4 (pregnancies).Buchanan, p. 121 (tuberculosis and cancer).Chelsler, p. 41 (age 50). In 1913, Sanger worked in New York's Lower East Side, often with poor women who were suffering due to frequent childbirth and self-induced abortions.Kennedy, pp. 16–18. After one particularly tragic medical case, Sanger wrote: [...] "I threw my nursing bag {{in the corner and}} announced... that I would never take another case <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made it possible for working women in America to have the knowledge to control birth." [...] Sanger visited public libraries, searching for information on contraception, but nothing was available.Cronin, Mary (1996), [...] "The Woman Rebel", in Women's periodicals in the United States: social and political issues, Endres, Kathleen L. (Ed.), Greenwood Press, p. 448.Cronin cites Sanger, An Autobiography, pp. 95–96.Cronin cites Kennedy, p. 19, who points out that some materials on birth control were available in 1913. She became outraged that working-class women could not obtain contraception, yet upper-class women who had access to private physicians could.|$|E

50|$|<b>Until</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> You {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, with praise given to its cyberpunk-style {{depiction of the}} game, its solid voice-acting and nuanced story. The games synth-driven soundtrack was lauded for accentuating the already bleak and retro atmosphere. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the videogame 60% based on 2 reviews. In 2017, <b>Until</b> <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> You was nominated in for 9 AGS Awards, including Best Game Created with AGS, Best Gameplay, Best Music and Best Voice Acting.|$|R

2500|$|The Man {{received}} positive reviews – including 4 {{stars from}} Q Magazine; and 5 from Sounds Magazine {{who called the}} album a [...] "touching if idiosyncratic biographical statement". Drummond intended to focus on writing books once The Man had been issued but, as he recalled in 1990, [...] "That only lasted three months, <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{an idea for a}} record and got dragged back into it all".|$|E
2500|$|Hunter's next album, Overnight Angels (1977), was {{produced}} by Roy Thomas Baker and featured a heavier guitar sound courtesy of former Bowie sideman Earl Slick. Hunter's record label in America, Columbia Records, refused to release the album in the US due to issues concerning Hunter's management: [...] "Overnight Angels was not released in the US because I fired my manager, Fred Heller, during the English promotional tour – just before {{it was to be}} released in America. Columbia said they didn't want to release it <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> new management and that dragged on until it became too late." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ada {{was born}} at St Germans, Norfolk, the second child of Thomasine and Henry Cambridge, a gentleman farmer. She was educated by governesses, an {{experience}} she abhorred. She wrote in a book of reminiscences: [...] "I can truthfully affirm that I never learned anything which would now be considered worth learning <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> done with them all and started foraging for myself. I did have {{a few months of}} boarding-school at the end, and a very good school for its day it was, but it left no lasting impression on my mind." [...] (The Retrospect, chap. IV). It was, in fact, an unmarried aunt who most contributed to her intellectual development.|$|E

2500|$|.....in Buddhism {{the image}} of the mother as the {{embodiment}} of compassion is used a lot. She'll do anything for the children. As a mother I felt that depth of love and commitment and having somebody who I really would give my own life for—it was very powerful {{to have that kind of}} relationship. I also felt that I didn't really grow up <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my children. There were ways that maturity was demanded of me and having children brought forth that maturity. So I wouldn't say my children were an inspiration in the sense of what I thought would have been a spiritual inspiration before I had children. More so I think meeting the challenges of motherhood with what I had learned made my practice very rich.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{answered}} {{him that we}} had taken their fort and killed {{all the people in}} it," [...] wrote Menéndez to the King, [...] "because they had built it there without Your Majesty's permission, and were disseminating the Lutheran religion in these, Your Majesty's provinces. And that I, as Captain-General of these provinces, was waging a war of fire and blood against all who came to settle these parts and plant in them their evil Lutheran sect; for I was come at Your Majesty's command to plant the Gospel in these parts to enlighten the natives in those things which the Holy Mother Church of Rome teaches and believes, for the salvation of their souls. For this reason I would not grant them a safe passage, but would sooner follow them by sea and land <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> taken their lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{returning}} to Pine Ridge in 1905, Standing Bear {{was chosen as}} a chief of the Oglala Lakota on July 4, 1905. There was a great celebration. “In different places they started to sing songs of praise for me. [...] Frank Goings, {{the chief of the}} Indian Police and interpreter for the agency, had brought the Boys’ Band from the boarding school, with all their instruments. In between the Indian songs, the band would play. I then started giving away things I had brought along. I kept this up <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> given away everything I owned, and my wife and I walked away with practically nothing. [...] We figured that we gave away that day about a thousand dollars’ worth of goods ourselves, not counting all the presents that had been donated to be distributed.” ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the five}} songs she had written by for her seventh studio album, Clarkson co-wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] with {{frequent}} collaborator Greg Kurstin, who produced the track. Clarkson has said about writing the song: A lot {{of the reasons why}} I wrote [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] was I guess I didn't realize the gravity of the situation <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a child of my own, and until I experienced love like I do with Brandon (Blackstock) on the daily basis. I guess you don't realize something is missing until you feel it. I can't imagine walking away from my little girl. I can't imagine not having that love anymore. I didn't know it was missing because I never had it. It was a revelation and that's why I wrote that song. I {{think a lot of people}} go through that.|$|E
2500|$|Rogers {{possesses}} a full lyric soprano vocal range that spans 3 octaves. She {{is known for}} having an aggressive vocal delivery, incorporated with a soulful and emotive, distinct tone. Since the start of her career, Amerie has been heavily involved within the creative process of her music, receiving not only writing credits but production and instrumentation credits as well. In an interview with Myplay.com, she described her early process of recording music: [...] "I used to record songs that I wrote by using two different tape recorders and two separate tapes. I would start by recording myself on the first tape, singing the song down from top to finish. Then, I would play it back, while singing the harmonies and recording them onto the second tape. I'd just keep repeating the process, {{going back and forth}} between tapes <b>until</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a final version of the full song on one tape, with stacked harmonies, backgrounds and everything!".|$|E
