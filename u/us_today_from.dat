40|$|In this paper, we {{continue}} to examine the fundamental basis for the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and its application to cosmology, specifically addressing the question: What is the proper size of the visible universe? There are several ways of answering the question of size, though often with an incomplete understanding of how far light has actually traveled in reaching <b>us</b> <b>today</b> <b>from</b> the most remote sources. The difficulty usually arises from an inconsistent use of the coordinates, or an over-interpretation of the physical meaning of quantities such as the so-called proper distance R(t) =a(t) r, written {{in terms of the}} (unchanging) co-moving radius r and the universal expansion factor a(t). In this paper, we use the five non-trivial FRW metrics with constant spacetime curvature (i. e., the static FRW metrics, but excluding Minkowski) to prove that in static FRW spacetimes in which expansion began from an initial signularity, the visible universe today has a proper size equal to R_h(t_ 0 / 2), i. e., the gravitational horizon at half its current age. The exceptions are de Sitter and Lanczos, whose contents had pre-existing positions away from the origin. In so doing, we confirm earlier results showing the same phenomenon in a broad range of cosmologies, including LCDM, based on the numerical integration of null geodesic equations through an FRW metric.

As a group, Latinos continue to struggle academically and there is a large academic achievement gap between Latino students and White students. Using the lens of Latino Critical race theory, this narrative study was an attempt to understand the educational experience of five Latino students in a two-way immersion program within a racialized public education system in which negative stereotypes, such as lack of intellectual abilities, could create a threatening environment hindering their academic success. This narrative inquiry study sought to understand how, if at all, Latino students in a fifth grade two-way immersion program experienced anxiety about the ways they believe to be perceived in the classroom and school settings by their teachers and other classmates. Finding of this study confirmed the relative success of two-way immersion programs educating Latino students and highlighted the urgent need to conduct more research in bilingual settings trying to understand the role stereotype threat might play in the educational experience of Latino students. The fact that Latino students were still lagging behind their native English-speaking counterparts in the TWI program is a reality that must be researched further to understand the lived experiences of Latino students in bilingual programs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The task of {{preserving}} the Hadith was undertaken, according to the classical Muslim view, by the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad and, thereafter, the Tabicun (Successors), and then from generation to generation. Thus, we find this great amount of Hadith in front of <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> <b>From</b> amongst these Hadith we find as it is alleged a great proportion narrated by the Companion Abu Hurayra (d. 57 / 58 / 59 AH/ 681 / 682 / 683 CE). He has narrated various kinds of narration, from those on creed to those on the ethics of Islam. However, his narrations have been looked upon with certain scepticism and criticism, as has his own personality, in both Classical Hadith scholarship and Modern Hadith scholarship. This research, entitled: â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 Abu Hurayraâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 a Narrator of Hadith Revisited: An Examination into the Dichotomous Representations of an Important Figure in Hadith with special reference to Classical Islamic modes of Criticism, will discuss specifically Abu Hurayra the Companion of the Prophet Muhammad and his alleged status as a prolific narrator of the Hadith. The {{aim of this study}} is to highlight how Abu Hurayra is depicted and perceived by both Classical Hadith Scholarship and Modern Hadith Scholarship. Furthermore, the central argument of this thesis is that the charge of Abu Hurayra being a Mukthir (a prolifically active narrator who embellished his reports) is unfair for the simple reason that those traditions he uniquely transmits are rather small in number. Most of the other traditions with which his name is associated have concomitant and parallel isnads (Chains of Narration). This study therefore sets out to critically examine and analyse the life and narrations of Abu Hurayra in view of the academic debates on the wider issues of the authenticity of the sources and how they affect the arguments put forward by this research.

The theme of his lec-ture was creating a dialogical civilization, in which he mentioned the Axial Age as proposed by Karl Jaspers (1883 – 1969). He suggested that we are now in the Second Axial Age with globalization progressing rapidly. Jaspers himself refers to the coming of the Second Axial Age, as a time when “Mankind as a whole breathes together as one. ” 1 Professor Tu calls this new era “A Dialogical Civilization. ” Those of <b>us</b> here <b>today</b> <b>from</b> Japan are representatives from that semi-nar in March, and are overjoyed to have this chance for further exchange with Dr. Tu.
