40|$|This article argues that, while “small data” rules protect {{conventional}} {{health care}} data (doing so exceptionally, if not exceptionally well), big data facilitates {{the creation of}} health data proxies that are relatively unprotected. As a result, the carefully constructed, appropriate, and necessary model of health data privacy will be eroded. Proxy data created outside the traditional space protected by extant health privacy models will end exceptionalism, reducing data protection to the very low levels applied to most other types of data. The article examines big data and its relationship with health care, including the data pools in play, and pays particular attention to three types of big data that lead to health proxies: “laundered” HIPAA data, patient-curated data, and medically-inflected data. It then reexamines health privacy exceptionalism across legislative and regulatory domains seeking to understand its level of “stickiness” when faced with big data. Finally the article examines how health privacy exceptionalism maps to the currently accepted rationales for health privacy and discusses the relative strengths of <b>upstream</b> and <b>downstream</b> data <b>models</b> in curbing what is viewed as big data’s assault of health privacy...|$|R

40|$|Red Butte Garden {{is located}} on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City, UT. It is a {{non-profit}} arboretum and botanical garden. Red Butte Creek runs through the Garden as it transitions from a mainly undeveloped to an urbanized watershed. This study investigates some of the environmental benefits and impacts of the Garden on Red Butte Creek. In late August 2013, riparian Box elder (Acer negundo) foliage samples were collected <b>upstream,</b> <b>downstream</b> and within the Garden. The natural abundance of total leaf nitrogen isotope ratio was determined to assess nitrogen (N) sources and extent of fertilizer influence downstream. Red Butte Creek water was sampled biweekly from September through December 2013 (total of 7 sampling events) <b>upstream,</b> <b>downstream,</b> and within the Garden. Water samples were analyzed for ammonium, nitrate, chloride, orthophosphate, and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations as well as temperature and pH. Total suspended solids (TSS) was measured in Red Butte Creek <b>upstream,</b> <b>downstream,</b> and within the Garden at two flow rates, 0. 8 and 1. 1 cfs. The mean total leaf nitrogen del- 15 N downstream (1. 4 ‰) of the Garden is significantly (p= 0. 03) higher than the upstream mean (- 0. 1 ‰). Leaf del- 15 N in the Garden ranged from - 0. 2 to 6. 7 ‰ (µ= 2. 7 ‰) and is significantly higher than upstream (p= 0. 02). The mean C:N ratio of leaves <b>upstream,</b> <b>downstream,</b> and within the Garden is 28. 8, 20. 7, and 20. 0 respectively. Both the Garden and downstream leaves are significantly higher than upstream (p? 0. 05). There was no statistical difference between mean <b>upstream</b> and <b>downstream</b> ammonium (p= 0. 95) and nitrate (p= 0. 32) concentrations. Orthophosphate was below the laboratory reporting limit (0. 5 mg/l) for every sample. Average chloride concentrations were slightly higher downstream (14. 43 mg/l upstream and 14. 62 mg/l downstream) though not significantly (p= 0. 59). TSS concentrations in Red Butte Creek <b>upstream,</b> <b>downstream,</b> and within the Garden were measured three times throughout this experiment. The average TSS concentration <b>upstream,</b> <b>downstream</b> and within the Garden is 4. 33, 17. 47, and 13. 35 mg/l, respectively. The results indicate 15 N enrichment in Garden and downstream leaves which is likely caused by the use of organic fertilizer, fish activity, or net N losses. The leaf C:N is higher within the Garden and <b>downstream</b> than <b>upstream</b> but the source of this increased N cannot be directly associated with Garden activity because of the multiple non-point contributors (e. g., urbanization). Ammonium and nitrate concentrations up- and downstream show no change in stream water quality. Overall, the Garden has little impact to Red Butte Creek and is an example of sustainable landscape management...|$|R
