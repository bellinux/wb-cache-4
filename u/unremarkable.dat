5|$|The U.S. vice {{presidency}} did not carry many official duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, {{making him the}} first vice president to do so. He gave a number of <b>unremarkable</b> speeches around the country.|$|E
5|$|The ruler was {{succeeded by}} his grandson, Chikka Virappa, whose <b>unremarkable</b> rule lasted until 1768, when Coorg was conquered by Haidar Ali, the new sultan of Mysore.|$|E
5|$|Galileo also {{observed}} the planet Neptune in 1612. It appears in his notebooks {{as one of}} many <b>unremarkable</b> dim stars. He did not realise {{that it was a}} planet, but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it.|$|E
5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy {{the last vestiges of}} these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings in the area around the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and <b>unremarkable.</b> The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
5|$|Adams did {{not speak}} French, the {{international}} language of diplomacy at the time. He therefore assumed a less visible role, but emerged as the commission's chief administrator, imposing order and methods lacking in his delegation's finances and record-keeping affairs. His first stay in Europe, between April 1, 1778, and June 17, 1779, was otherwise <b>unremarkable,</b> and {{he returned to his}} home in Braintree in early August 1779. Back home, Adams became one of the founders and charter members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1780.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins to flower in April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, <b>unremarkable</b> brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, these characteristics give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Chopra starred with Uday Chopra in Jugal Hansraj's <b>unremarkable</b> {{romantic comedy}} Pyaar Impossible! as Alisha, a {{beautiful}} college girl (and later a working mother) who {{falls in love}} with a nerdy boy. Later that year, she co-starred with Ranbir Kapoor in Siddharth Anand's romantic comedy Anjaana Anjaani. The film, set in New York and Las Vegas, follows the story of two strangers, both trying to commit suicide, who eventually fall in love with each other. The film was a moderate commercial success, and received mixed reviews from critics.|$|E
5|$|In June {{he joined}} No. 66 Squadron RFC at Aire, {{equipped}} with the Sopwith Pup. He undertook a refresher course but his tenure there was <b>unremarkable.</b> He was ordered to fly with the group rather than fly solo patrols. He flew 47 hours in 66 Squadron and 21 patrols. He encountered the enemy six times but could not score. Finally on 21 and 26 July he shot down one Albatros D.V fighter for his 6–7th aerial victories.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely <b>unremarkable,</b> and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren. His penchant for wielding his power {{for his own}} interests did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed a favor, {{to the position of}} Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E
5|$|Krycek {{leads the}} agents to Dulles International Airport, where {{they try to}} {{apprehend}} a second courier carrying a diplomatic pouch from Russia. The courier leads the agents on a pursuit through the airport, but drops the pouch before escaping. The pouch is revealed to carry a seemingly <b>unremarkable</b> rock. Mulder has Krycek confined at the high rise apartment of Assistant Director Walter Skinner before having the rock analyzed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Dr. Sacks, a NASA scientist, tells Mulder and Scully that the rock is a prehistoric meteorite fragment that might contain fossilized alien bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Pediatricians {{are often}} the first health {{professionals}} to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18–24 months may present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be <b>unremarkable</b> barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's {{first three}} years in the Senate were <b>unremarkable.</b> McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many {{different}} organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|Several {{otherwise}} <b>unremarkable</b> {{bodies in}} the outer belt show cometary activity. Because their orbits cannot be explained through capture of classical comets, {{it is thought that}} many of the outer asteroids may be icy, with the ice occasionally exposed to sublimation through small impacts. Main-belt comets may have been a major source of the Earth's oceans, because the deuterium–hydrogen ratio is too low for classical comets to have been the principal source.|$|E
5|$|Under Spanish Crown rule, {{the town}} of Gibraltar fell into severe decline. The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the {{southern}} ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value. It derived some minor economic value from tuna-fishing and wine-producing industries but its usefulness as a fortress was now limited. It was effectively reduced {{to the status of}} an <b>unremarkable</b> stronghold on a rocky promontory and Marbella replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.|$|E
5|$|When the Tests {{started at}} Trent Bridge, Davidson was {{named in the}} playing XI. He {{supported}} the pace attack of Miller, Lindwall and Johnston in the five Tests. His debut in the First Test was <b>unremarkable.</b> As with most of Australia's batsmen, Davidson struggled against Alec Bedser, who broke the English Test wicket-taking record in the wet conditions, making only four and six. He took 2/22 in the first innings as the match ended in a rain affected draw. His first Test wicket was that of Hutton, caught by Benaud, and he added Evans {{in the latter part}} of the innings.|$|E
5|$|After an <b>unremarkable</b> school career, Eichmann briefly {{worked for}} his father's mining company in Austria, {{where the family}} had moved in 1914. He worked as a {{travelling}} oil salesman beginning in 1927, and joined both the Nazi Party and the SS in 1932. After returning to Germany in 1933, he joined the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), where he was appointed {{head of the department}} responsible for Jewish affairs—especially emigration, which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure. After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas. Eichmann drew up plans for a Jewish reservation, first at Nisko in south-east Poland and later in Madagascar, but neither of these plans were ever carried out.|$|E
5|$|Al-Tabari {{states that}} al-Mu'tasim fell ill on 21 October 841. His regular doctor, Salmawayh ibn Bunan, whom the Caliph had trusted implicitly, had died the {{previous}} year and the new physician Yahya ibn Masawayh did not follow the normal treatment of cupping and purging, which according to Hunayn ibn Ishaq worsened the caliph's illness and brought about his death on 5 January 842, after a reign of eight years, eight months and two days according to the Islamic calendar. He {{was buried in the}} Jawsaq al-Khaqani palace in Samarra. The succession of his son, al-Wathiq, was unopposed. Al-Wathiq's reign, through <b>unremarkable,</b> was essentially a continuation of al-Mu'tasim's own, as the government continued to be led by the men al-Mu'tasim had raised to power: the Turks Itakh, Wasif, and Ashinas, the vizier Ibn al-Zayyat, and the chief qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Chapman {{played for}} a variety of clubs, at Football League and non-League levels. His record was {{generally}} <b>unremarkable</b> as a player; he made fewer than 40League appearances {{over the course of a}} decade and did not win any major honours. Instead, he found success as a manager, first at Northampton Town between 1908 and 1912, whom he led to a Southern League title. This attracted the attention of larger clubs and he moved to Leeds City, where he started to improve the team's fortunes before the First World War intervened. After the war ended, City were implicated in an illegal payments scandal and were eventually disbanded. Chapman was initially banned from football but successfully appealed. He took over at Huddersfield Town, winning an FA Cup and two First Division titles in the period of four years.|$|E
5|$|Charles Atangana (c. 1880 – 1 September 1943), {{also known}} by his birth name, Ntsama, and his German name, Karl, was the {{paramount}} {{chief of the}} Ewondo and Bane ethnic groups {{during much of the}} colonial period in Cameroon. Although from an <b>unremarkable</b> background, Atangana's loyalty and friendship with colonial priests and administrators secured him successively more prominent posts in the colonial government. He proved himself an intelligent and diplomatic administrator and an eager collaborator, and he was eventually named paramount chief of two Beti-Pahuin subgroups, the Ewondo and Bane peoples. His loyalty and acquiescence to the German Empire was unquestioning, and he even accompanied the Germans on their escape from Africa in World War I.|$|E
5|$|Danny Bergara was {{appointed}} as manager in March 1989, quickly transforming the team, and automatic promotion was gained in 1990–91. The next three seasons saw Stockport make the play-offs, {{but failed to}} result in another promotion. In March 1995 Bergara was sacked after an altercation with then-chairman Brendan Elwood, and Dave Jones {{was appointed}} manager in April of that year. A new all-seater, Cheadle End, holding just over 5,000 in capacity, was opened {{at the start of}} the 1995–96 season. Although this particular season was <b>unremarkable,</b> the club reached the third round of the FA Cup, where they faced holders Everton. Stockport reached a 2–2 draw with Everton at Goodison Park, and for the replay ten days later over 11,000 gathered at Edgeley Park to witness Everton's late winner in a 3–2 victory.|$|E
5|$|Following Sean Connery's {{announcement}} {{that he would}} not play James Bond again, Eastwood was offered the role but turned it down because he believed the character should be played by an English actor. He next starred in the loner Western Joe Kidd (1972), based on a character inspired by Reies Lopez Tijerina, who stormed a courthouse in Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico in June 1967. During filming, Eastwood suffered symptoms of a bronchial infection and several panic attacks. Joe Kidd received a mixed reception, with Roger Greenspun of The New York Times writing that it was <b>unremarkable,</b> with foolish symbolism and sloppy editing, although he praised Eastwood's performance.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised to revolutionize radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both <b>unremarkable</b> and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
5|$|Michael was {{perceived}} as <b>unremarkable,</b> quiet and good-natured. He performed the usual public duties expected of an heir to the throne. In 1901, he represented Russia at the funeral of Queen Victoria and was given the Order of the Bath. The following year he was made a Knight of the Garter in King Edward VII's coronation honours. In June 1902, Michael transferred to the Blue Cuirassier Regiment and moved to Gatchina, where the regiment was based. Since coming of age, Michael had assumed financial independence. His assets included the largest sugar refinery in the country, capital amounting to millions of roubles, a collection of motor vehicles, and country estates at Otrovo in Russian Poland and Brasovo near Orel.|$|E
5|$|School Rumble is {{a romantic}} shōnen comedy {{revolving}} around {{the daily lives}} of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, an <b>unremarkable</b> second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} fiction in Galaxy had dipped {{towards the end}} of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's {{difficult}} editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he would almost invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but <b>unremarkable</b> science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in Galaxy throughout the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Tracy first {{discovered}} his talent for acting while attending Ripon College, and he later received a scholarship for the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He {{spent seven years}} in the theatre, working in a succession of stock companies and intermittently on Broadway. Tracy's breakthrough came in 1930, when his lead performance in The Last Mile {{caught the attention of}} Hollywood. After a successful film debut in Up the River, Tracy was signed to a contract with Fox Film Corporation. His five years with Fox were <b>unremarkable,</b> and he remained largely unknown to audiences after 25 films, most of them starring Tracy as the leading man. None of them were hits although The Power and the Glory (1933) features one of his most acclaimed performances.|$|E
5|$|After a long {{absence from}} politics, Marshall {{was called to}} one final act of public service. Upon the death of Martin D. Hardin who had been elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1823 but died before he could take office, Marshall pursued an {{abbreviated}} campaign for the vacant seat and defeated Jeptha Dudley {{by a margin of}} 3 votes. The primary issue of the day was the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the legislature to abolish the extant Court of Appeals {{and replace it with a}} new court in retaliation for overturning a replevin law passed in a previous legislative session. Marshall enjoyed a higher level of support in this election by virtue of his support for the Old Court, which was the prevailing sentiment in his district. His actions in the session, however, appear to have been <b>unremarkable,</b> and he did not seek reelection at the end of his term.|$|E
5|$|After the 1999 draft, the Rockets {{traded for}} the third overall pick Steve Francis from the Vancouver Grizzlies, in {{exchange}} for four players and a first round draft pick. However, after Houston traded a discontented Pippen to Portland (stating chemistry problems with old rival and now teammate Barkley), and Barkley suffered a career-ending injury, the rebuilt Rockets went 34–48 and missed the playoffs, {{for only the second}} time in 15 years. In the 2000–01 season, the Rockets worked their way to a 45–37 record, but still did not make the playoffs. In the following offseason, a 38-year-old Olajuwon requested a trade, and, despite stating their desire to keep him, the Rockets reached a sign and trade agreement, sending him to the Toronto Raptors. The proceeding season was <b>unremarkable,</b> as Houston's first season without Olajuwon in almost 20 years finished with a disappointing 28–54 record.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{the central}} Victorian town of Maldon, Woodfull was the third of four sons of Reverend Thomas Staines Brittingham Woodfull, a Methodist preacher. The Woodfulls moved to Melbourne when Thomas was given a {{transfer}} to Collingwood Methodist Mission, in an inner city suburb. The religious traditionalism stayed with the younger Woodfull throughout his life. He once refused to play an interstate match that was scheduled for Christmas Day. Woodfull's father installed a net in the backyard and taught him the emphasis on defensive technique and patience that were to become his hallmark. Woodfull attended Melbourne High School and his early career was <b>unremarkable.</b> He made his district cricket debut in 1916 for Essendon, {{at the age of}} 19, but did not distinguish himself. He played no further cricket at the level before he gained his qualification as a schoolteacher in 1919. Because of a bout of rheumatic fever in childhood, Woodfull had stiff muscles and as a result was rejected when he tried to join the First Australian Imperial Force to fight in World War I. He was posted to Maryborough High School, and it was in the rural cricket competition that he began to gain attention. In 1920 and 1921, he accumulated 1,335 runs at average of 225.83 in the local competition.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, {{the empire}} became divided in a {{struggle}} that was less a rebellion against the established government and more a contest for the throne between equal contenders. Michael held Constantinople and the European provinces, controlled the imperial bureaucracy, and had been properly crowned by the Patriarch, but {{he had come to}} the throne through murder, while Thomas gained support and legitimacy through his claim to avenge the fallen Leo, and he won the backing of themes both in Asia and later in Europe. Thomas was a well-known, popular, and respected figure in Asia Minor, where Leo V had enjoyed considerable support. Michael, on the other hand, was virtually unknown outside the capital; his military record was <b>unremarkable,</b> he was uneducated and coarse of manner, his stutter earned him ridicule, and he was reputed to sympathize with the heretical religious sect of the Athinganoi, to which his family had belonged.|$|E
5|$|In 1936 Mitchell-Innes {{was elected}} {{captain of the}} Oxford team. The side lacked the batting {{strength}} of the previous years, and {{he was forced to}} move himself from his preferred position of batting at number three or four, to open the batting during the season. The batting suffered a further blow just prior to the University match when Roger Kimpton suffered an injury and was unable to play. Along with Kimpton, Mitchell-Innes led the batting averages by a large margin, having scored 917 runs at 43.66. He also reached his highest score in first-class cricket against H. D. G. Leveson Gower's XI, scoring 207 runs. Oxford lost more matches than they won during the season, including an eight-wicket loss to Cambridge in the University match. Despite the loss, the match was Mitchell-Innes' most successful contest against Cambridge, as he scored 43 and 84. During this season, Mitchell-Innes had his most effective spell as a bowler, taking 22 wickets for Oxford at an average of 26.27, but Bolton described the team's bowling performances as <b>unremarkable.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the Ramones {{released}} ¡Adios Amigos!, their fourteenth studio album, {{and announced}} that they planned to disband {{if it was not}} successful. Its sales were <b>unremarkable,</b> garnering it just two weeks on {{the lower end of the}} Billboard chart. The band spent late 1995 on what was promoted as a farewell tour. However, they accepted an offer to appear in the sixth Lollapalooza festival, which toured around the United States during the following summer. After the Lollapalooza tour's conclusion, the Ramones played their final show on August 6, 1996, at the Palace in Hollywood. A recording of the concert was later released on video and CD as We're Outta Here!. In addition to a reappearance by Dee Dee, the show featured several guests including Motörhead's Lemmy, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, Soundgarden's Chris Cornell, Numskull's Ralph Foster and Rancid's Tim Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Rai {{featured}} as a thief in {{the action}} film Dhoom 2, her biggest commercial success since Devdas. She followed it by playing the leading lady opposite Abhishek Bachchan in Ratnam's drama Guru (2007), a box office hit. Also in 2007, Rai appeared in her first Hollywood productionthe <b>unremarkable</b> historical drama The Last Legionco-starring Colin Firth. Greater success came {{with the role of}} Jodhaa Bai opposite Hrithik Roshan's Akbar in the historical drama Jodhaa Akbar (2008). Rai had five film releases in 2010, including the -grossing science fiction film Enthiran co-starring Rajinikanth. She also played the nurse to a quadriplegic in Bhansali's acclaimed drama Guzaarish. After taking a sabbatical from film acting, Rai made a comeback in 2015 with the role of a lawyer in Jazbaa, a remake of the South Korean film Seven Days. In 2016, she took on the supporting part of a poetess in the romance Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which ranks as her highest-grossing Bollywood release.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{academic}} progress was <b>unremarkable,</b> and in July 1912 {{he became an}} apprentice to the carpenter at the mission. At Easter 1912, he professed his dedication to Christianity and began undergoing catechism. In 1913, he underwent the Kikuyu circumcision ritual; the missionaries generally disapproved of this custom, {{but it was an}} important aspect of Kikuyu tradition, allowing Kenyatta to be recognised as an adult. Asked to take a Christian name, he chose both John and Peter after the eponymous Apostles in the New Testament. The missionaries however insisted that he select only one, and so he chose Johnstone, the -stone being selected because it was a Biblical reference to Peter. Accordingly, he was baptised as Johnstone Kamau in August 1914. After his baptism, Kenyatta moved out of the mission dormitory and lived with friends. Having completed his apprenticeship to a carpenter, Kenyatta requested that the mission allow him to be an apprentice stonemason, but they refused. Kenyatta then requested that he be recommended for employment, but the head missionary refused because of an allegation of minor dishonesty.|$|E
5|$|More {{extensive}} coverage {{has been given}} by some sites. VentureBeat noted that, while comparable with other similar campaigns, Operation Rainfall was notable for maintaining civility during its efforts. Zach Kaplan of Nintendo Life said that the campaign {{needed to make a}} clear mark, showing that the success of the then-announced Xenoblade Chronicles was not a fluke. In a later feature for the same website, Thomas Whitehead said that the otherwise niche and slightly <b>unremarkable</b> Pandora's Tower had been granted a level of mystique and anticipation among fans through its inclusion in the Operation Rainfall campaign. In an interview feature conducted after the announcement of a North American release for Pandora's Tower, PC World noted that Operation Rainfall was going against the trend with its complete success in pushing to bring all three titles to North America. In particular, it compared them to the unsuccessful efforts by fans to bring Japan-exclusive entries of the Mother series to the West.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{plans for}} {{the facade of the}} dam, the power plant, the outlet tunnels and {{ornaments}} clashed with the modern look of an arch dam. The Bureau of Reclamation, more concerned with the dam's functionality, adorned it with a Gothic-inspired balustrade and eagle statues. This initial design was criticized by many as being too plain and <b>unremarkable</b> for a project of such immense scale, so Los Angeles-based architect Gordon B. Kaufmann, then the supervising architect to the Bureau of Reclamation, was brought in to redesign the exteriors. Kaufmann greatly streamlined the design, and applied an elegant Art Deco style to the entire project. He designed sculptured turrets rising seamlessly from the dam face and clock faces on the intake towers set for the time in Nevada and Arizona— both states are in different time zones, but since Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time, the clocks display the same time for more than half the year.|$|E
