500|$|Using Mendeleev's {{nomenclature}} for unnamed and undiscovered elements, copernicium {{should be}} known as eka-mercury. In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called <b>ununbium</b> (with the corresponding symbol of Uub), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who either called it [...] "element 112", with the symbol of E112, (112), or even simply 112.|$|E

5000|$|On 14 July 2009, the discoverers, {{from the}} Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung in Darmstadt, Germany, of {{chemical}} element 112 (temporarily named <b>ununbium)</b> proposed to the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry that its permanent name be [...] "copernicium" [...] (symbol Cn). [...] "After we had named elements after our city and our state, {{we wanted to}} make a statement with a name that was known to everyone," [...] said Hofmann. [...] "We didn't want to select someone who was a German. We were looking world-wide." [...] On the 537th anniversary of his birthday the official naming was released to the public.|$|E

50|$|He studied {{physics at}} Justus-Liebig-Universität in Giessen and Leopold-Franzens-Universität Innsbruck and {{completed}} his studies with a Ph.D. at the University of Giessen, Germany, in 1971. In 1976 {{he moved to}} the department of nuclear chemistry at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany, which was headed by Peter Armbruster. He played {{a leading role in the}} construction of SHIP, the 'Separator of Heavy Ion Reaction Products'. He was the driving force in the discovery of the cold heavy ion fusion and the discovery of the elements bohrium (Bh Z=107), hassium (Hs Z=108), meitnerium (Mt Z=109), darmstadtium (Ds Z=110), roentgenium (Rg Z=111) and copernicium (formerly eka-mercury or <b>ununbium)</b> (Uub Z=112). In 1984 he became head of the new GSI project, the fragment separator, a project which opened new research topics, such as interactions of relativistic heavy ions with matter, production and separation of exotic nuclear beams and structure of exotic nuclei. He directed the Nuclear Structure and Nuclear Chemistry department of the GSI and was professor of physics at the University of Mainz until he retired in March 2005.|$|E
