2500|$|The Quinnipiac/Quiripi {{were known}} as “grandfathers” in the Dawnland Confederacy, with their Lenape cousins. Although they were a people of peace and commerce, when forced into war, they were fierce warriors and {{outstanding}} soldiers. Eastern Connecticut, originally inhabited by the Quinnipiac Nation’s sub-sachemships of the Eastern Nehantic, Podunk, and Wangunk, {{as well as the}} Narragansett, suffered more losses than western Connecticut, and so in 1506, after 80% population losses due to epidemics, the Pequotoog moved into the area from the upper Hudson region and pushed the survivors of the Narragansett into what is now Rhode Island, and the Nehantic wedged in close to the Connecticut River (Old Lyme). A rogue sachem, named <b>Uncus,</b> angry for having been passed over to lead the Pequotoog, took his followers and struck out on his own, founding the Mohegan Band. <b>Uncus</b> and his warriors joined with Nepaupuck (a Quinnipiac War Captain) and entered into several treaties with the English. In the “Direful Swamp Fight,” 150 Quinnipiac and Mohegan warriors joined with 350 English troops and, in December 1675, they defeated the powerful Pequotoog. Quinnipiac warriors served in many wars and battles as soldiers and sailors and as subsequent refugees, who migrated to Stockbridge, merged into an alliance to help the Sons of Liberty defeat the English in the American Revolution because of the betrayal by English allies in land dealings. [...] The Sons of Liberty changed their name to the Sons of King Tammany (a Munsee Grand Sachem whose title, Tamanend, means “The Affable One”). The original thirteen colonies adopted the socio-political structure of the Quinnipiac Wampano Confederacy, with each state having its own totem and calling their leader a sachem.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>uncus</b> {{can squeeze}} the oculomotor nerve (a.k.a.

Pupillary dilation often precedes the somatic motor effects of CN III compression called oculomotor nerve palsy or third nerve palsy. This palsy presents as deviation of the eye to a [...] "down and out" [...] position due to loss of innervation to all ocular motility muscles except for the lateral rectus (innervated by abducens nerve (a.k.a.

All spines are triangular and dissimilar in length; the outer and inner spines are longer than the middle one. The outer spine has a sigmoid outer margin. The anterior ventral margin of the lorica with two pairs of rounded lobules was located at {{both sides of the}} slender sinus. Inner lobes show a narrower base than the outer one.

40|$|Aspects of the systematics, {{ecology and}} {{distribution}} of New Zealand planktonic rotifers are examined in this thesis. Thirty-five lakes and two sets of ponds in the South Island were surveyed for rotifers during 1988 - 1991. Of 85 taxa identified, 32 were first records for New Zealand, bringing the rotifers recorded from the country to 332 taxa. Four species (Keratella australis, K slacki, Lecane herzigi and L. tasmaniensis), previously recorded as endemic to Australia, {{are added to the}} New Zealand checklist. Species composition, seasonal abundance, and vertical distribution of planktonic rotifers were investigated in Lake Grasmere, South Island, based on a biweekly sampling program from November 1988 to January 1990. Of the 44 species identified in the lake, 17 were planktonic with Polyarthra cf. dolichoptera, Keratella cochlearis, and Pompholyx sulcata dominant. Maximum rotifer densities occurred in May (1600 ind. 1 - 1) and October (1500 ind. 1 - 1), and numbers were lowest in July (120 ind. 1 - 1) and March (250 ind:- 1). The majority of species were most abundant in midwater (5 - 9 m depth), although some showed depth preferences near the surface or the bottom. A simple, rapid technique for the preparation of rotifer trophi for scanning electron microscopy is described. The method permits careful visual monitoring of trophi during the extraction process and does not require critical point drying of specimens. Subsequently, trophi of Filinia species from 16 South Island lakes and three North Island lakes were examined and compared with specimens from Australia, Austria, Belgium, Turkey, and Yemen. Five species of Filinia (brachiata, longiseta, cf. pejleri, novaezealandiae, and terminalis) were positively identified from the New Zealand samples. Numbers of <b>unci</b> teeth were considered to be the most reliable features for identification within the genus. Numbers obtained from SEM are listed for the first time. Experiments on the influence of temperature (5 °- 25 °C) on morphology, life history, and growth rate of F. terminalis and F. cf. pejleri were performed in replicated individual cultures with Oocystis sp. as food. Some morphological characteristics previously used in identification of both species were found to be affected by temperature and also by life cycle stage. However, numbers of <b>unci</b> teeth were not affected. Body and setal lengths, life spans, all stages of development, and growth rates of both species decreased with increasing temperature. Offspring number per female of both rotifers was highest at 20 °C, but the maximum growth rate of F. telminalis was at 25 °C, whereas that of F. cf. Pejleri was at 20 °C. Finally, I examined the effect of salinity on survival and growth of Hexarthra fennica, a species found normally in saline waters but also found in freshwater Lake Grasmere. The freshwater euryhaline H. fennica was able to survive and reproduce at salinities up to 13 %, whereas a related species H. mira (found only in freshwaters) was unable to survive at > 1 %...|$|R
