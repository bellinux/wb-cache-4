50|$|At 3:30 in {{the morning}} of April 6, 1909, an {{accident}} occurred when engineer Jesse Burton fainted against the controls, releasing the brake. As the upbound car reached the top, it slammed into the <b>upper</b> <b>support,</b> bounced away and rolled freely back down the grade. The impact had knocked both cables from their drums, so the car at the lower station did not provide a counterbalance on the move. The night turn had ended shortly before at D.O. Cunningham Glass on Jane St. near the lower station, and the upbound car was taking some passengers home. After the impact at the top, three young men jumped during their descent. One, Frank Bredl, 17, jumped early and survived. The others, Albert Klingenberger, 16, and Arthur Miller, 17, died from their injuries. A postcard of the era showed the aftermath of the accident.|$|E
50|$|In 2007-08, the {{building}} was demolished {{to make way for}} a new development. The demolition was undertaken by McGee Group Ltd, with Bovis Lend Lease acting as construction manager. The contract value was £16 million. The first phase of demolition was conventional: after securing the site, the contractors performed a soft strip of the interior and an asbestos survey prior to demolishing the low level structures up to podium level. After this, the suspended structure of {{the building}} required an unconventional demolition approach that successively dismantled each office floor from the lowest upwards. To achieve this, the contractors installed a structural deck that acted both as a work platform for the demolition work and as a safety barrier. This was jacked upwards as each successive office floor was removed. When all the office floors and <b>upper</b> <b>support</b> trusses had been removed, the concrete core was de-stressed and demolished. Concurrently, the 25,000 cubic metre basement was propped and excavated. The contract took just over two years to complete.|$|E
5000|$|To {{raise the}} bridge an initial lift {{to the inner}} end of the bridge is required. This raises the inner wheels back up the {{inclines}} of the granite slabs. At {{the same time the}} outer ends are pulled from the lip of the granite slab, the wheels rolling down the sprung metal guides. When the inner wheels are pulled up onto the metal trays the weight of the lifting arms assists the raising of the bridge to a point where the centre of gravity of the arms is over the pivot of the <b>upper</b> <b>support</b> stays. From here on the pull necessary to raise the centre wheels is negligible. Once the lifting arms are in the fully retracted position the centre wheels are on top of the metal trays and the axles disengage from the cups. The bridge now sits on its inner two axles. From here it is necessary to pull the bridge in until the outer two wheels arrive at the trays. The bridge is then pulled within the gates on all six wheels.|$|E

The gyroscope is formed using substrate material having lower and upper layers sandwiching a sacrificial insulating layer. An exemplary gyroscope comprises a low-resistivity single-crystal silicon substrate having a lower support layer and an <b>upper</b> flexible <b>support</b> layer. Two opposed proof masses that {{are separated from}} the lower support layer lie in and are <b>supported</b> by the <b>upper</b> flexible <b>support</b> layer. Two drive electrodes are disposed adjacent to the proof masses and are insulatably supported by the lower support layer and are separated from the <b>upper</b> flexible <b>support</b> layer. Sense, balance and tuning electrodes are disposed adjacent to the proof masses and are insulatably supported by the lower support layer and are separated from the <b>upper</b> flexible <b>support</b> layer. The operational mode shapes are in-plane with the substrate surface and only measures angular motion that are orthogonal to {{the plane of the}} substrate. The microstructure flexural design enables the sense and the drive resonant frequencies to occur in close proximity of one another. This enables matched-mode operation of the device thereby ensuring maximum sensitivity. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R

5000|$|Francis' {{music is}} in the pop / R&B category, {{characterized}} by a heavy use of electronically produced beats and melody and live vocal. In live performances, Francis' vocal is backed by his pre-produced tracks {{with the assistance of}} a DJ while he uses a synthesizer at times. The stage on which Francis performs is largely empty allowing him space to move and dance in a jubilant and energetic manner that he choreographs to correspond with the rhythm of his music. Chance the Rapper joined Francis live on stage at the May 2017 Boston Calling music festival and they performed [...] "May I Have This Dance feat.

40|$|The {{merits and}} demerits of the movable balance-weight schemes in the {{existing}} tower crane are summarized and analyzed. The new design of rotatable balance-arm, latticed crane head, platform and rotational <b>upper</b> <b>support</b> is put forward for top of crane SXD 50. The rotatable balance-arm is composed of two parallel truss structures, platform, luffing mechanism and balance-weight. The balance-arm can be pulled to rotate around the rotational <b>upper</b> <b>support</b> by luffing mechanism under amplitude control system. The forward torque is equaled to the backward torque from the balance-arm to realize the moment equilibrium of crane body during working.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{estimation of}} the upper boundary point "F"-super- - 1 (1) of a distribution function "F" with finite upper boundary or 'frontier' in deconvolution problems, primarily focusing on deconvolution models where the noise density is decreasing on the positive halfline. Our estimates {{are based on the}} (non-parametric) maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of "F". We show that (1) is asymptotically never too small. If the convolution kernel has bounded support the estimator (1) can generally be expected to be consistent. In this case, we establish a relation between the extreme value index of "F" and the rate of convergence of (1) to the <b>upper</b> <b>support</b> point for the 'boxcar' deconvolution model. If the convolution density has unbounded support, (1) can be expected to overestimate the <b>upper</b> <b>support</b> point.

40|$|Do current wages {{depend on}} past labour market conditions? Wage posting models suggest so, Nash {{bargaining}} models do not, Bertrand competition between employers is somewhere in between. Recent evidence suggests Nash bargaining {{to be an}} adequate description of the data. We re-evaluate this evidence, using a more precise analytical framework and more efficient estimation techniques. Our evidence is easily squared with wage posting, but not with Nash bargaining, while Bertrand competition is clearly rejected. In wage posting models firms can pay hiring and retention premiums. Our evidence is consistent retention premiums, {{but it is more}} difficult to square with hiring premiums. Finally, our methodology allows two important side conclusions.

40|$|An {{important}} {{cause of}} bulk carrier loss is ingress of sea water owing to {{cracks in the}} side shell {{as a consequence of}} main frame deterioration and the subsequent failure of transverse bulkheads adjacent to the flooded hold. When the hold is flooded the stresses in the bulkhead are known to exceed yield and the bulkhead to have undergone slight distortion. The vertical bulkheads are corrugated and have <b>upper</b> <b>support</b> from cross deck strips. Typical initial damages are cracks in the joint between bulkhead corrugations and deck plating due partly to corrosion. These can lead to portions of the cross deck strip becoming detached from the bulkhead. Pressure on the ship sides can then cause the bulkhead and cross deck strip to buckle, with minor and local buckles on the bulkhead leading to shear buckling of the whole structure. The purpose of the Study Group will be an investigation of this cracking and buckling process...|$|E

Results : According to the literature research an administrative institution, such as hospital does not include only one culture but on the contrary many different cultures that interact since health professionals have their own background. Hospital as a place of special care, that has its' own culture, is expected to fulfill patients' needs (family, social, occupational), health and disease.

40|$|Hold down spring(HDS), {{clamped between}} the <b>upper</b> <b>support</b> plate flange and the core barrel flange inside a {{pressurized}} reactor vessel, {{is used to}} provide a downward force to keep the core barrel stable and from being lifted off from the vessel ledge during reactor normal operation. Spring designer used to think under certain extreme operating conditions, the spring could be lifted off from the ledge because the spring is not stiff enough to prevent the “lift-off”. Therefore, the spring was designed as stiff as it practically can be. However, finite element study indicated that the magnitude of preload is a strong function of friction coefficient. To find {{the magnitude of the}} friction coefficient, a series of tests were conducted on 1 / 10 scale hold down spring samples of three different spring designs. From the test results, {{it was found that the}} friction coefficient increases rapidly as the number of loading cycles increases.

Therefore, it is concluded that, because of the strong frictional effect, not only the current design is more than adequate, but also should be made even softer...|$|E
