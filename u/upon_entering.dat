5|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed near Diego Garcia on April3 and subsequently moved westward, intensifying into a moderate tropical storm two days later. Given the name Kamisy, the storm gradually intensified into an intense tropical cyclone by April9. Kamisy reached winds of 170km/h (105mph) before making landfall in extreme northern Madagascar near Diego Suarez. It weakened <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> the Mozambique channel, but briefly re-intensified on April10. That day while passing near Mayotte, the cyclone {{turned to the}} southeast, striking Madagascar again near Majunga.

5|$|A weak {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 7. It tracked across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea without development due to strong wind shear. The wave then split into two, with the northern portion dissipating over Cuba on August 15 and the southern portion continuing westward. The wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean on August 16. Deep convection increased over the wave <b>upon</b> <b>entering</b> the Pacific, and early on August 19 it started to become better organized. After the development of a low-level circulation, the system organized into Tropical Depression Fourteen-E on August 20 while located about 275miles (445km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima.|$|E

The hurricane crossed western Cuba on July 3. High winds {{on the island}} destroyed hundreds of houses, and the storm's rainfall damaged the tobacco crop. <b>Upon</b> <b>entering</b> the Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane turned {{to the west and}} attained peak winds of 110mph (175km/h) on July 5. It struck northeastern Mexico on July 8 and quickly dissipated. Upon its final landfall, the storm caused heavy damage in Mexico, and in southern Texas the storm ended a prolonged drought.|$|E

After bypassing northern Somalia, Chapala weakened further {{and turned to the}} west-northwest. Early on 3November, the storm made landfall near Mukalla, Yemen, as a very severe cyclonic storm, making it the strongest storm on record to strike the nation. The storm dissipated the next day.|$|E
