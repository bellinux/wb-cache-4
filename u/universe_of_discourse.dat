25|$|In every discourse, {{whether of}} the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined. The most unfettered discourse is that in which the words we use are understood in the widest possible application, and for them the limits of discourse are co-extensive {{with those of the}} universe itself. But more usually we confine ourselves to a less spacious field. Sometimes, in discoursing of men we imply (without expressing the limitation) that it is of men only under certain circumstances and conditions that we speak, as of civilised men, or of men in the vigour of life, or of men under some other condition or relation. Now, whatever may be the extent of the field within which all the objects of our discourse are found, that field may properly be termed the <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> <b>discourse.</b> Furthermore, this <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> <b>discourse</b> is in the strictest sense the ultimate subject of the discourse.|$|E
25|$|An object either (1) is {{immediate}} to a sign, {{and that}} is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a dynamic object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> <b>discourse,</b> the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) immediate to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) dyanamic, an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) final or normal, a question's true settlement, which would be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.|$|E

2500|$|An object (or {{semiotic}} object) is {{a subject}} matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything thinkable, a quality, an occurrence, a rule, etc., even fictional, such as Prince Hamlet. All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the <b>universe</b> <b>of</b> <b>discourse</b> to which the partial or special object belongs. For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto. An object either (i) is immediate to a sign and is the object as represented in the sign or (ii) is a dynamic object, the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded [...] "as on bedrock".|$|E

Now weaken V to V*: a [...] "concept" [...] F and a [...] "concept" [...] G have the same [...] "extension" [...] if and only if neither F nor G is small or ∀x(Fx ↔ Gx).

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} general study of (I,T) -interval-valued fuzzy rough sets on two <b>universes</b> <b>of</b> <b>discourse</b> {{integrating}} the {{rough set theory}} with the interval-valued fuzzy set theory by constructive and axiomatic approaches. Some primary properties of interval-valued fuzzy logical operators and the construction approaches of interval-valued fuzzy T-similarity relations are first introduced. Determined by an interval-valued fuzzy triangular norm and an interval-valued fuzzy implicator, a pair of lower and upper generalized interval-valued fuzzy rough approximation operators with respect to an arbitrary interval-valued fuzzy relation on two <b>universes</b> <b>of</b> <b>discourse</b> is then defined. Properties of I-lower and T-upper interval-valued fuzzy rough approximation operators are examined based on the properties of interval-valued fuzzy logical operators discussed above. Connections between interval-valued fuzzy relations and interval-valued fuzzy rough approximation operators are also established. Finally, an operator-oriented characterization of interval-valued fuzzy rough sets is proposed, that is, interval-valued fuzzy rough approximation operators are characterized by axioms. Different axiom sets of I-lower and T-upper interval-valued fuzzy set-theoretic operators guarantee the existence {{of different types of}} interval-valued fuzzy relations which produce the same operators...|$|R
