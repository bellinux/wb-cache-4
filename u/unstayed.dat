5000|$|An <b>unstayed</b> mast (also {{known as}} a {{freestanding}} mast) {{is a type of}} mast on a boat that is not supported by any stays. <b>Unstayed</b> masts are often seen with smaller sailing dinghies such as the Optimist, Topper and the Laser, but can also be used on larger vessels. Traditional American catboats and Dutch fishing vessels ranging up to 60 feet have been built with <b>unstayed</b> wooden masts and recently schooners in the 70 foot range have been built with <b>unstayed</b> carbon fibre masts. Freedom Yachts produced a large number of yachts up to 44 feet with <b>unstayed</b> masts. <b>Unstayed</b> masts may provide better aerodynamics but require careful design both as far as the mast itself is concerned {{and as far as the}} vessel deck and keel design is concerned. <b>Unstayed</b> masts themselves are often somewhat heavier, which raises the vessel center of gravity. The deck and hull that support the mast need to be specially designed for the installation of an <b>unstayed</b> mast. Remarkably, <b>unstayed</b> masts do reduce hull loads since the standing rigging does not induce compressive loads into the mast and tensile loads in the hull sides in way of the chainplates.|$|E

50|$|A balestron rig is a sailplan {{involving}} a boom that extends forwards of the mast and {{is pivoted on}} it. It is a balanced rig. It involves a mainsail and a smaller jib on an <b>unstayed</b> mast.|$|E
50|$|OceanPlanet had {{a narrow}} beam, {{seawater}} ballast, and an 80-foot <b>unstayed</b> and rotating carbon fiber mast. Schwab and Wylie discussed {{the factors that}} went into OceanPlanet's design {{in an interview with}} Latitude 38 Magazine in August 2001.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice between}} stayed and <b>unstayed</b> masts is {{inherently}} complex {{and needs to}} consider all naval architectural design aspects such as cost, weight, center of gravity, material availability, builder's experience, structural design, aerodynamics, human factors, and operational considerations.|$|E
50|$|The Freedom 28 Cat Ketch {{is a small}} {{recreational}} keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has an <b>unstayed</b> cat ketch rig, a transom-hung rudder and a swing-up centerboard. It displaces 7000 lb {{and carries}} 3800 lb of lead ballast.|$|E
5000|$|The Kite is an 11' 7" [...] cat-rigged {{sailing dinghy}} (class inactive) {{designed}} circa 1962 by Carter Pyle as an Olympic Finn class trainer. Like that era's Finns, the Kite's mast is flexible, <b>unstayed</b> Sitka spruce and spruce boom.|$|E
50|$|The Comet {{has a large}} uncluttered cockpit, rear {{mainsheet}} (with centre mainsheet permitted under class rules) and an unbattened sail with {{a sleeve}} luff on an <b>unstayed</b> rig. The hull and deck is manufactured from glass-reinforced plastic and available {{in a number of}} colour combinations.|$|E
50|$|Eventually the Swampscott dory {{developed}} into a recreational sailboat as well, known as the clipper dory, and then the alpha and beachcomber dory. These inexpensive sailboats were raced {{along the coast of}} Massachusetts during {{the early part of the}} 20th century. The sail rig was typically a Leg of Mutton and small jib on an <b>unstayed</b> mast.|$|E
50|$|The Nippa is {{a stable}} {{computer}} designed hull shape, constructed of very rigid Vacuum molded E Glass with PVC Foam Core for durability and with minimal fittings (Ronstan) for simplicity {{of learning and}} use, for instance, there is no mainsheet cleat. The rig is designed of lighweight carbon and anti-corrosive materials and the mast is <b>unstayed.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{boats were}} {{generally}} {{outfitted with a}} sprit or lug sailing rig and a small jib. The mast was generally <b>unstayed.</b> Early fisherman used an oar to steer with rather than bring a separate rudder. Modern sailing versions come with a separate rudder. But an oarlock can be mounted on the transom for use with an oar as a steering device.|$|E
5000|$|Freedom Yachts was {{the maker}} of the Freedom (sail) and Legacy (power) yacht brands. The Freedom sailboats have <b>unstayed</b> rigs, meaning that the mast is {{freestanding}} and {{not supported by the}} normal set of wires called standing rigging. Garry Hoyt, a champion sailor and noted maverick, created the <b>unstayed</b> rigs to give [...] "freedom" [...] from the inefficient sail shapes of traditional sloop rigs as well as to give [...] "freedom" [...] from the compression and maintenance issues associated with standing rigging. A known issue with this style of mast, however, is that in rough seas it can break loose, causing a potential holing (pounds through the bottom of the hull). This is commonly due to the tangs that hold it in place failing. The masts are made of carbon fiber and are set well forward on the boat. This means most of the sail area is contained in the mainsail. Jib sails can either be overlapping or self-tending.|$|E
50|$|The junk rig is {{a simple}} and {{effective}} rig. The rig contrasts starkly with the Bermuda rig which is prevalent on Western sail boats. In its most traditional form the junk rig is carried on an <b>unstayed</b> mast (i.e. a mast without shrouds or stays, supported only on the step at the keelson and the partners) however standing rigging of some kind is not uncommon.|$|E
50|$|The {{hull of the}} Ljungström {{boats are}} {{designed}} according to the circular arc, with a negative top line to create minimal wind turbulence around the hull, support the <b>unstayed</b> mast and simplify the production. To avoid wet timber ends the boards are applied from the bottom up. This way the longest board goes from stern to stern while the shortest ones are almost parallel to the railing midships.|$|E
5000|$|Stowage Cabin - The cuddy on SCAMP serves many purposes. The {{overhanging}} cabin top {{acts like}} a dodger and is large enough for an adult to sit athwartships out of the weather. Additionally, items in forward lockers can be accessed without water getting into storage area. Stowage cabin also houses a mast box that supports more of the mast than is possible with open boats. This in turn allows for an <b>unstayed</b> mast.|$|E
50|$|While younger lighter sailors {{begin in}} Optimists, {{competitive}} sailors usually weigh between 35 and 55 kg (or between 80 lbs. and 125 lbs.). Optimists can be sailed by children from age 8 to 15. This {{wide range of}} weights which is not typical of most dinghies is made possible by different cuts of sail. Due to its inherent stability, <b>unstayed</b> rig, robust construction and relatively small sail, the Optimist can be sailed in winds of up to 30 knots.|$|E
5000|$|Additional {{models were}} created in 22, 26, 33, 36 and 40 foot lengths, with the 26 and 30 both {{available}} in [...] "Classic" [...] and [...] "Ultra" [...] configurations. The original boats were built with an <b>unstayed,</b> two-piece aluminum mast and wishbone boom. In later years, under new ownership, the factory produced new versions of 3 of its models, all with shoal draft keels one-piece carbon fiber masts. By the time Hinterhoeller closed its doors in January 1996, a total of 975 Nonsuch boats had been built.|$|E
5000|$|The boat {{is quite}} {{different}} from the Jersey Skiff being more round-sided, with less freeboard, and the distinct [...] "box skeg" [...] that proved particularly useful when engines were adopted. The boat has a nearly straight stem, rounded sides, a narrow flat bottom that becomes the bottom of the skeg, and a heart shaped transom. The boat was usually rigged with a spritsail mainsail and small jib with an <b>unstayed</b> mast. The early fishing versions used an oar as the rudder, more modern versions, however, have a regular rudder & tiller.|$|E
50|$|A {{wingsail}} is a variable-camber aerodynamic {{structure that}} is fitted to a marine vessel {{in place of}} conventional sails. Wingsails are analogous to airplane wings, except that {{they are designed to}} provide lift on either side to accommodate being on either tack. Whereas wings adjust camber with flaps, wingsails adjust camber with a flexible or jointed structure (for hard wingsails). Wingsails are typically mounted on an <b>unstayed</b> spar—often made of carbon fiber for lightness and strength. The geometry of wingsails provides more lift, and a better lift-to-drag ratio, than traditional sails. Wingsails are more complex and expensive than conventional sails.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{bridge was}} built in 1620, and much of its structure remains, although the bridge was largely rebuilt in the mid 20th century. The original bridge was cranked open by hand, whereas the current bridge consists of two cantilevered half-spans, separated by an 46 cm gap bridged by a thick timber panel. The entire width of the drawbridge measures 81 centimetres. The panel is removed whenever a yacht wishes to pass beneath the bridge, allowing the <b>unstayed</b> mast {{to pass through the}} gap. A captain must wait for a passer-by to assist in opening the drawbridge.|$|E

50|$|Like dories, sharpies are {{initially}} tender {{since they}} have a shallow draft without a keel. They need large amounts of ballast stowed on the central floor before they become acceptable as sea boats: 600 to 900 lbs is normal in a 30 ft boat. Sharpies rely on their high flared topsides to provide stability when heeled on a reach or to windward. The twin <b>unstayed</b> masts makes rigging very easy and saves on cost. The <b>unstayed</b> flexible masts also allow wind to be spilled from the sails which helps with stability. The flat bottom, narrow water line and ample working sail means the boat is fast down wind where the flat bottom helps promote surfing or planing in stronger winds. The narrow beam, the high center of gravity, the low aspect ratio of the centre board and the longitudinal rudder shape do not help windward performance, but mostly these same features help in shallow waters or where the boat has to change direction often, such as in a tidal or rocky estuary. Cabin sharpies are an acquired taste due to the space {{taken up by the}} large central centerboard case and the restricted headroom. Even a 30-foot traditional sharpie is only suited to a maximum of 2 people when cruising for a week. A sharpie does not have the strong self-righting ability of a more conventional deep keeled yacht, so it is best suited to sheltered waters. It needs an experienced skipper who understands the foibles of the design.|$|E
5000|$|Typical later log canoes were two-masted, {{resembling}} a modern ketch rig. The masts were always steeply raked and <b>unstayed,</b> and the jib was flown from a bowsprit. The rigging of the sails themselves took several characteristic and unusual forms called a [...] "sprit-boomed leg-of-mutton." [...] The main and fore sail were not {{attached to the}} boom at the foot, but instead attached only at the clew. A tackle attached to the mast provided the force necessary to shape the sail. One advantage of the sprit boom is that the sail is self-vanging, that is, the boom does not rise or fall depending {{on the set of}} the sail. The sheeting force is less, because the sheet does not have to supply downward pull to control the boom as with a gaff-rigged boat.|$|E
50|$|The patent Stülcken derrick is {{used for}} very heavy cargo. It stems from the German {{shipyard}} HC Stülcken & Sohn which has been taken over later by neighboring yard Blohm & Voss. This derrick can handle up to 300 tonnes. The Stülcken can be made ready in few minutes, dramatically faster than a traditional heavy derrick, doesn't require lots of space and is operated by four winches. Between two v-shaped, <b>unstayed</b> Samson-posts is the Stülcken secured. This {{makes it possible to}} let the derrick swing through the posts to reach another hatch. For each post is a hoisting winch, a span winch and a lever that is run by one man only. Bearings, swivels, sheaves and the gooseneck can be unattended for up to four years and create only a friction of about 2%. The span tackles are independent and the halyard is endless. With the revolving suspension heads on the posts it takes ten minutes to swing all the way through. In the double-pendulum block type, half of the cargo tackle can be anchored {{to the base of the}} boom. In order to double the hook speed, the halyard passes through the purchases since one end is secured which reduces the SWL to its half. Typical dimensions of a 275 tonne Stülcken are: 25.5 m length, 0.97 m diameter, 1.5 m to 3.4 m diameter of posts, 18 m apart the posts (upper end) and 8.4 m apart the posts (lower end). The hook of a full-loaded 275 tonne Stülcken can move 2.3 m per minute. If only one purchase is secured and the derrick is loaded with 137 tonnes the hook gains velocity to 4.6 m per min. Even more speed can be gained when the winch ratios are reduced to 100 tonnes (triple speed) and 68 tonnes (quadruple speed). Detaching the union table the double-pendulum block type of Stülcken is able to swing through which allows the lower blocks to swing freely to each side of the boom. In this way the derrick reaches a vertical position. A bullrope easily pulls the derrick to the other side until the weight of the cargo tips the derrick over. The span tackles now have the weight on the other side. The union table is fixed again and the derrick can start its work on the other side. There are also Stülcken with single-pendulum blocks. At this type the cargo hook is detached and the lower and upper cargo block are hauled into the center of the Stülcken. To tip the derrick over the gravity is here used again. A derrick helps pump oil in most offshore rigs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a systematic study on the effects of the cross-arm size (cross sectional diameter and thickness) and the cable stay cross sectional diameter on the maximum load carrying capacity of single cross-arm prestressed stayed column system. As a result of the addition of cross-arms and prestressed cables, the traditional slenderness ratio definition for ordinary <b>unstayed</b> columns is not applicable for this type of structural system. Therefore, the effects of the cross sectional size of the additional cross-arm and stay on the load bearing capacity are studied for different lengths and cross sectional size of the main column. Nine different combinations of column length (short, intermediate and long) and column cross-section size (small, medium and large) are investigated. It is shown that the column cross section size has a negligible effect on the maximum load carrying capacity while the effect is much more significant with varying column length. An enhancement ratio, i. e. the ratio of maximum load carrying capacity of the stayed column to the critical buckling load of <b>unstayed</b> column is also presented. It is shown that optimum cross-arm and stay size leading to the maximum achievable enhancement ratio and maximum load bearing capacity is independent {{of the size of the}} column. The enhancement ratio varies from about 14 with a corresponding 27. 9 % added volume (material) to about 40 with a corresponding 15 % added volume (material) with increasing column length...|$|E
