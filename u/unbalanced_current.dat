50|$|In a {{three-phase}} linear circuit {{with three}} identical resistive or reactive loads, the neutral carries no current. The neutral carries current if the loads on each phase are not identical.

50|$|Two-phase motors draw {{constant}} power {{the same as}} three-phase motors, so a balanced two-phase load is converted to a balanced three-phase load. However if the two-phase load is not balanced (more power on one phase than the other), the Scott-T transformer (or any connection of transformers) cannot fix this. <b>Unbalanced</b> <b>current</b> on the two-phase side causes <b>unbalanced</b> <b>current</b> on the three-phase side. As the typical 2 phase load was a motor, equality of the current in the 2 phases was inherently presumed during the Scott development. In modern times people have tried to revive the Scott connection {{as a way to}} power single-phase electric railways from 3 phase Utility supplies. This will not result in balanced current on the 3 phase side as it is unlikely that 2 different railway sections connected as the 2 phases will at all times conform to the Scott presumption of being equal. The instantaneous difference in loading on the 2 sections will be seen as an imbalance in the 3 phase supply; there is no ability to smooth it out.|$|E

The series converters of the DPFC are single phase, the DPFC can compensate both active and reactive, zero and negative sequence <b>unbalanced</b> <b>currents.</b> To compensate the unbalance, two additional current controllers are supplemented to control the zero and negative sequence current respectively.

These form a common-mode choke which inhibit <b>unbalanced</b> <b>current</b> flow, without affecting the differential signal. This technique is equally valid for coaxial interconnects, and many camcorders have ferrite cores fitted to some of their auxiliary cables such as DC charging and external audio input, to break the high frequency current flow if the user inadvertently creates a ground loop when connecting external equipment.|$|E

50|$|This {{practice}} {{arose from}} the three-wire system used to supply both 120 volt and 240 volt loads. Because these listed appliances often have components that use either 120, or both 120 and 240 volts, there is often some current on the neutral wire. This differs from the protective grounding wire, which only carries current under fault conditions. Using the neutral conductor for grounding the equipment enclosure was considered safe since the devices were permanently wired to the supply and so the neutral was unlikely to be broken without also breaking both supply conductors. Also, the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>current</b> due to lamps and small motors in the appliances was small compared to the rating of the conductors and therefore unlikely to cause a large voltage drop in the neutral conductor.|$|E
5000|$|To save on {{the cost}} of copper conductors, a three-wire {{distribution}} system was used. The three wires were at +110 volts, 0 volts and &minus;110 volts relative potential. 100-volt lamps could be operated between either the +110 or &minus;110 volt legs of the system and the 0-volt [...] "neutral" [...] conductor, which carried only the <b>unbalanced</b> <b>current</b> between the + and &minus; sources. The resulting three-wire system used less copper wire for a given quantity of electric power transmitted, while still maintaining (relatively) low voltages. Even with this innovation, the voltage drop due to the resistance of the system conductors was so high that generating plants had to be located within a mile (1 - 2 km) or so of the load. Higher voltages could not so easily be used with the DC system because there was no efficient low-cost technology that would allow reduction of a high transmission voltage to a low utilization voltage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an online-correction method for current measurement errors for a pure-integration-based flux estimation {{down to a}} stator frequency of 1 Hz. A measurement-disturbance-observer (MDO) -based approach is taken as one pos-sible solution for eliminating the dc offset and the additional negative-sequence component due to <b>unbalanced</b> <b>current</b> mea-surement gains in the synchronous coordinate. From the motor parameter sensitivity analysis, an MDO gain selection method is proposed to remove the estimation error resulting from a parame-ter mismatch. At the same time, the positive-sequence component estimation is performed by creating an error signal between a motor model reference and an estimated q-axis rotor flux estab-lished by a permanent magnet in the synchronous coordinate. The compensator utilizes a PI controller that controls the error signal to zero. Experimental results confirm that the proposed scheme has great potential for applications to acquire the accurate motor flux at a low stator frequency.

50|$|However, if a {{piece of}} metal is located {{sufficiently}} close to a twin-lead line, within a distance comparable to the wire spacing, it will be significantly closer to one wire than the other. As a result, the RF current induced in the metal object by one wire will be greater than the opposing current induced by the other wire, so the currents will no longer cancel. Thus nearby metal objects can cause power losses in twin lead lines, through energy dissipated as heat by induced currents. Similarly, radio noise originating in cables or metal objects located near the twin-lead line can induce <b>unbalanced</b> <b>currents</b> in the wires, coupling noise into the line.|$|R

The purpose of this prototype is to redistribute current between the three phases of a distribution system.

The UCSC consists of three separate single-phase H-bridge inverters that all share the same dc-link capacitor. Each of these inverters performs independently using a single-phase rotating reference frame controller. Each either draws or injects current onto the distribution system lines to balance the active currents and performs power factor correction for voltage compensation.
