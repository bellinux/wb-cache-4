5|$|Umbrella: In all written records, {{the oldest}} {{reference}} to a collapsible <b>umbrella</b> dates to the year 21 AD, when Wang Mang (r. 9–23) had one designed for a ceremonial four-wheeled carriage. The 2nd-century commentator Fu Qian added that this collapsible <b>umbrella</b> of Wang Mang's carriage had bendable joints which enabled them to be extended or retracted. A 1st century collapsible <b>umbrella</b> has since been recovered from the tomb of Wang Guang at Lelang Commandery in the Korean Peninsula, illustrated in a work by Harada and Komai.

2500|$|Christo and Jeanne-Claude {{prepared}} {{for their next}} project, [...] "The Umbrellas." [...] The plan was to have yellow <b>umbrellas</b> set up in California and blue <b>umbrellas</b> in Japan at the same time. In December 1990, after much preparation, the first steel bases for the <b>umbrellas</b> were installed. At the bases 80cm long anchors were fastened to the ground to withstand tensions of 1,500 kgf (15 kN). In September 1991 the <b>umbrellas</b> were brought to their places by 2,000 workers. In California, some of the bases were transported to the site by helicopter. The final cost of the project totaled $26 US million, and it was completely financed by the artists themselves through sale of preparatory drawings etc. They do not take any form of sponsorship. By September 7, 1,340 blue <b>umbrellas</b> in Ibaraki and 1,760 yellow <b>umbrellas</b> at the Tejon Ranch in southern California had been set up; the exhibition opened on 9 October 1991. The <b>umbrellas</b> were positioned closely together in the limited space of Japan, whereas in California they were placed in all directions in its vast uncultivated land. In total, 3 million people saw the <b>umbrellas,</b> each measuring 6 meters in height and 8.66 meters in diameter. On October 27, they started the removal of this project and restored the land to earlier condition. The <b>umbrellas</b> were taken apart {{and most of the}} elements were recycled. The <b>umbrellas</b> became a huge tourist attraction, finding use as everything from picnic spots to wedding altars. On 26 October 1991, one of the <b>umbrellas</b> in California was toppled by high winds, killing one woman and injuring several others. The exhibit was ordered closed immediately. A second death occurred during the removal of the <b>umbrellas.</b>|$|R

Prior to the events of Resident Evil Zero, <b>Umbrella</b> used the Progenitor virus to create the Tyrant virus (T-virus), which they believe can be used to manufacture powerful organisms. A problem with the virus’ compatibility with humans set the project back, as only humans with a very rare genetic makeup are capable of mutating into potent and manageable life forms. <b>Umbrella</b> eventually overcame this setback by resorting to using clones of Sergei Vladimir, one of their executives who happens to be genetically compatible.|$|E
