2500|$|In {{a series}} of cases before the Texas Supreme Court in 2000, the court was asked to {{construe}} {{for the first time}} the 1999 Texas parental notification law forbidding a physician from performing an abortion on a pregnant, unaccompanied minor without giving notice to the minor's parents at least 48 hours before the procedure. However, Texas legislators adopted a policy to create a judicial bypass exception in those cases where (1) the minor is mature and sufficiently well informed to make the decision to have an abortion performed without notification to either of her parents; (2) notification will not be in the best interest of the minor or (3) notification may lead to physical, sexual or emotional abuse of the minor. The court was asked in these cases to discern legislative intent for the first time to these subjective standards, presumably included in the law as a matter of Texas policy and to make the law constitutional under U.S. Supreme Court precedents. In the seven parental notification decisions rendered by the court, Gonzales voted to grant one bypass. For In re Jane Doe 5 his concurring opinion began with the sentence, [...] "I fully join in the Court's judgment and opinion." [...] He went on, though, to address the three dissenting opinions, primarily one by Nathan L. Hecht alleging that the court majority's members had disregarded legislative intent in favor of their personal ideologies. Gonzales's opinion dealt mostly with how to establish legislative intent. He wrote, [...] "We take the words of the statute as the surest guide to legislative intent. Once we discern the Legislature's intent we must put it into effect, even if we ourselves might have made different policy choices." [...] He added, [...] "o construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly as to eliminate bypasses, or to create hurdles that simply are not to be found in the words of the statute, would be an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>act</b> of judicial activism," [...] and [...] "While the ramifications of such a law and the results of the Court's decision here may be personally troubling to me as a parent, it is my obligation as a judge to impartially apply the laws of this state without imposing my moral view on the decisions of the Legislature." ...|$|E

US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{issued a}} press release and stated that she was deeply saddened and outraged to learn of reports of yet another {{massacre}} committed by the Syrian government in Turaymisah. She added: [...] "Credible reports indicate that this <b>unconscionable</b> <b>act</b> {{was carried out by}} artillery, tanks, and helicopters - indisputable evidence that the regime deliberately murdered innocent civilians. Syria cannot be peaceful, stable, or democratic until Assad goes and a political transition begins." ...|$|E
5000|$|During the 2006 {{conflict}} between Israel and Hezbollah, the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation urged the Canadian {{government to take}} Hezbollah and Hamas off its list of designated terrorist organizations. CIC president Elmasry wrote that the Canadian Government should [...] "review its 2002 decision to place Hezbollah and Hamas on its list of banned alleged terrorist organizations" [...] because doing so [...] "is an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>act</b> of hypocrisy and a mockery of justice" [...] since Canada has not placed Israel on the same list. Elmasry also stated {{that the decision to}} place Hezbollah and Hamas on this list was [...] "dictated by special interest groups with agendas that are contrary to peace with justice." ...|$|E

[...] when someone is accused of a heinous crime ... Killing a child - especially your own - ranks high {{in the hierarchy of}} <b>unconscionable</b> <b>acts,</b> so I embarked on an archaeological dig in the Gutteridges' history, hoping to disinter whatever had caused them to kill their child.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The current situation, {{described}} as a [...] "principle of state neutrality" [...] rather than [...] "separation of church and state", has been criticised by both secularists and religious groups. On the one hand, secularists have argued that government neutrality to religions leads to a [...] "flawed democrac" [...] or even a [...] "pluralistic theocracy" [...] as the government cannot be neutral towards the religion {{of people who do}} not have one. On the other hand, religious groups and others have been concerned that state governments are restricting them from exercising their religion by preventing them from criticising other groups and forcing them to do <b>unconscionable</b> <b>acts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, writer Nathan Rabin {{posted a}} {{retrospective}} on Wired for his series [...] "My Year of Flops" [...] on The A.V. Club. Rabin wrote, [...] "To call Wired an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>act</b> of grave robbery/defilement {{would be an}} insult to the good name of grave-robbers everywhere. There are snuff films with more integrity... Watching Wired, the two questions that pop up constantly are 'What the hell were they thinking?' followed by 'What the hell were they smoking, and where can I get some?'... I will give Rauch's screenplay this much: it sure is audacious... Rauch apparently set out to write a biopic as irreverent, wild, and unconventional as Belushi himself. The stakes were high. Had the filmmakers succeeded, they would have reinvented the biopic by injecting it with vast ocean of gallows humor, magic realism, and postmodern mindfuckery. The filmmakers took enormous chances, none of which paid off. They shot for the moon and fell flat on their asses." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ghost Reveries was {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a concept album, with numerous tracks linking together a story of a man's turmoil after committing an <b>unconscionable</b> <b>act,</b> symbolised by killing his own mother. However, Mikael Åkerfeldt commented: [...] "I had intended to do a occult concept piece lyrically and got off to a great start with some downright evil lyrics like [...] "The Baying of the Hounds" [...] and [...] "Ghost of Perdition", then I did [...] "Isolation Years" [...] which {{had nothing to do with}} the intended concept but I liked it so much I decided to ease up on the concept idea in favour of this one lyric. Why I decided on a occult theme? Well, I've always been intrigued by it, especially Satanism and stuff like that. I studied some books that oddly enough my wife had in her collection like [...] "Servants of Satan" [...] as well as [...] "Witchcraft and Sorcery" [...] + some more. I figured it'd be interesting to see what a mature 31 year old mind would make of this subject as opposed to the 16 year old kid who used to pose in front of his Bathory poster. I'm quite happy with them to be honest, and they're ... evil!" [...] The album only partly portrays a concept, not fully arranged in the poetic manner as previous releases such as Still Life and My Arms, Your Hearse.|$|E

40|$|Joseph Conrad, Francis Ford Coppola, {{and a host}} of {{professional}} peers as a commentator on the nature and origins of human evil. Dutton's volume, however, is neither fictional prose nor cinematic image; nor is it a study of a particular historical act. Rather, it is a carefully documented work that leads the reader on a journey into humanity's “heart of darkness ” through a chapter-by-chapter account of the brutal litanies of genocides, holocausts, military massacres, lynchings, prison riots, rapes, serial killers, and wars of the 20 th century. Each page in Dutton's volume is filled with description and analysis of horrible events of the 20 th century we choose to forget, distort, or deny because of their sheer brutality. In Dutton's volume, the “nobility ” of the human spirit is pitted against the reality of the 20 th century's <b>unconscionable</b> <b>acts</b> of murder, torture, and atrocity. Like the characters in Conrad's novel and Coppola's film, Dutton's compendium takes us on journey into the “heart of darkness ” within each of us. The tragedy of human history is that in spite of episode after episode of violence and brutality, we continue—as individuals, societies, and nations—to engage in genocides, massacres, and extreme violence even as we cloak our acts under the virtues of freedom, morality, and noblesse oblige. “We come to free you from your ignorance”; “We come to bring you the virtues of civilization”; “Arbeit Macht Frei ” read the signs above the entrances to Nazi concentration camps. “We come to bring you democracy, ” the U. S. government asserts in Iraq, Afghanistan, {{and a host of}} othe...|$|R

After the lock-in period the contract is automatically renewed for another 36 months {{subject to the same}} terms and conditions. As of now the Globe lock-in period is still 2 years with no pre-termination fee outside of the lock-in period. The PLDT TD-LTE contract allows PLDT to change the terms and conditions at any time with the only way left for subscribers to opt out of the altered service through paying the full pre-termination fee: [...] "8.3 Modification. SBI reserves the right at its discretion to modify, delete or add to any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time without further notice. It is the Subscriber’s responsibility to regularly check any changes to these Terms and Conditions. The Subscriber’s continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms and Conditions." [...] Even as the Consumer Act of the Philippines states [...] "Unfair or <b>Unconscionable</b> Sales <b>Act</b> or Practice ... the following circumstances shall be considered ... that the transaction that the seller or supplier induced the consumer to enter into was excessively one-sided in favor of the seller or supplier", the practice of inducing extremely long term contracts with the ultimate pre-termination penalty has not been legally challenged yet.|$|R
5000|$|Cape May Seashore Lines [...] {{is a short}} line {{railroad}} {{in southern}} New Jersey. It offers two excursion services; a 30-mile round trip between Richland and Tuckahoe, and a 14-mile round trip between Rio Grande, Cold Spring Village, and Cape May City. The track is owned by New Jersey Transit and leased to CMSL. Connections are provided with Conrail's Beesley's Point Secondary, owned jointly by CSX and Norfolk Southern, {{at the north end}} in Tuckahoe. Tony Macrie has been president of CMSL since he formed the railroad in 1984. The CMSL website has a statement regarding the suspension of Cape May service due to damage done by theft: [...] "Customer Notice: Rio Grande - Cape May City service is suspended due to the high volume theft of track material; specifically, tie plates and track spikes, along with the destruction of crossties, over a considerable distance of the Cape May Branch. These <b>unconscionable</b> and heinous <b>acts</b> of vandalism have caused extensive damage to the track structure, rendering the rail line impassable by any type of train movement. The Seashore Lines is actively exploring solutions to remediate this situation of ruinous proportions." ...|$|R
