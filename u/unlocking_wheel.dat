50|$|The Daniels escapement, however, {{achieves}} a double impulse with passive lever pallets serving only to lock and <b>unlock</b> the larger <b>wheel.</b> On one side, impulse {{is given by}} means of the smaller wheel acting on the lever pallet through the roller and impulse pin. On the return, the lever again <b>unlocks</b> the larger <b>wheel,</b> which gives an impulse directly onto an impulse roller on the balance staff.|$|R
40|$|Drug abuse relapse is a {{major issue}} in {{treating}} addictions. Physical activity decreases cocaine self-administration in lab rats. 1 Access to a wheel has been shown to significantly reduce cocaine-seeking behaviors in female rats, but not in male rats. 2 In humans, exercise has been shown to decrease drug craving 3 and reduce the probability of relapse 4. Objective To assess the effects of chronic wheel running on the incubation of cocaine-seeking behavior in female rats after extended forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration. 10 days self-administration in operant chamber Moved to wheel cage and separated into groups 3 Days locked <b>wheel</b> 3 Days <b>unlocked</b> <b>wheel</b> 30 days locked <b>wheel</b> 30 days <b>unlocked</b> whee...|$|R
50|$|A {{more modern}} and {{sophisticated}} {{method is to}} have multigauge bogies whose wheels can be moved inward and outward. Normally they are locked in place, but special equipment at the border <b>unlocks</b> the <b>wheels</b> and pushes them inward or outward to the new gauge, relocking the wheels when done. This can be done as the train moves slowly over special equipment.|$|R
5000|$|Reward Challenge: Both {{teams had}} to divide their members {{into two groups}} of eighth and three. The group {{consisting}} of eighth people shall dive {{into the water and}} bring a wooden cart to the shore undergoing through an obstacle course while bringing it. Next they had to <b>unlock</b> two <b>wheels</b> tied to a pole to make the carriage easy to run. Then they had to unlock the cart to reveal puzzle pieces which shall be joined together by the other three members awaiting them to form a board with their tribe name printed on it.|$|R
50|$|The impulse {{received}} by the entrance pallet as the tooth moves over the impulse face is transferred by the lever to the balance wheel via the ruby impulse pin on the roller of the balance wheel. The lever moves until it rests against the right banking pin; it is held in this position {{by the force of}} the exit tooth against the exit pallet jewel (called the draw). This means that in order to <b>unlock</b> the <b>wheel</b> it must be turned backwards by a small amount, which is done by the return momentum of the balance wheel via the impulse pin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{escapement}} {{has better}} performance than the deadbeat because the force from the pallets, with its variability, is applied {{not to the}} pendulum but to the bearer. [...] The escapement has no contact with the pendulum below the suspension spring. The pendulum is free of disturbance from the escape wheel for most of each swing and the only work {{it has to do}} is to <b>unlock</b> the escape <b>wheel</b> once per second. This operation is performed near the ideal place, at the center of each swing.|$|R
50|$|Two factors helped avert a {{potential}} disaster: {{the failure of}} the front landing gear to lock into position during the gravity drop, and the presence of a guardrail that had been installed along the centre of the decommissioned runway to facilitate its use as a racetrack. As soon as the wheels touched down on the runway, Pearson braked hard, blowing out two of the aircraft's tires. The <b>unlocked</b> nose <b>wheel</b> collapsed and was forced back into its well, causing the aircraft's nose to slam into, bounce off, and then scrape along the ground. This additional friction helped to slow the airplane and kept it from careening into the crowds surrounding the runway. After the aircraft had touched down, the nose began to scrape along the guardrail in the centre of the tarmac; Pearson applied extra right brake, which caused the main landing gear to straddle the guardrail creating additional drag that further reduced the speed. Air Canada Flight 143 came to a final stop on the ground 17 minutes after running out of fuel.|$|R
5000|$|October 2, 1941: Pennsylvania Central Airlines Trip 142, a Douglas DC-3 (NC25691), was {{involved}} in an accident at the Municipal Airport, Morgantown, West Virginia. After touchdown the Captain allowed the airplane to roll for approximately 1,500 feet and was within 700 feet of the runway end before applying the brakes. At that time the Captain found that the brakes were not working, or had no braking action. Then the captain <b>unlocked</b> the tail <b>wheel</b> and attempted a groundloop. The groundloop did not salvage the situation and the airplane slid sideways over a 25-foot embankment. The landing gear was sheared off and the airplane {{came to rest on}} its belly. Subsequent testing showed no problems with the brakes. The probable cause [...] "was the failure of the captain to apply the brakes in time to permit a successful take-off when they were found to be ineffective." ...|$|R
40|$|Effects of Muscular Overexpression of PGC- 1 alpha on Hippocampal Neurogenesis Jonas Bergqvist, Master Thesis in Medicine 2017, Department of Neuroscience & Physiology, Gothenburg University, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg, Sweden Radiation {{therapy is}} an {{important}} treatment modality for tumors in the central nervous system. However, ionizing radiation (IR) gives rise to long-term cognitive deficits in patients, such as intellectual and memory impairments and this {{is believed to be}} partly due to irradiation-damage on adult neurogenesis, birth of new neurons, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in the brain. Studies on rodents have shown that voluntary running can restore adult hippocampal neurogenesis after IR. Further, one study have reported a potential link between exercise and adult neurogenesis through a PGC- 1 a/FNDC 5 pathway. Here, we examine if expression of the muscle exercise gene PGC- 1 a contributes to beneficial effects on recovery after cranial IR in mouse using a transgenic mouse model that constitutively overexpress PGC- 1 a in skeletal muscle. Male animals were subjected to whole brain IR (4 Gy) at 4 months age. Animals were given daily intraperitoneal injections of BrdU (50 mg/kg) from day 3 to 8 post IR. For voluntary exercise, female animals were single housed in cages with free access to running wheels. After 5 days of acclimatization, half of the running <b>wheels</b> were <b>unlocked</b> and animals were given daily intraperitoneal injections of BrdU (50 mg/kg) for 3 consecutive days. Animals were euthanized 4 weeks after IR, or <b>unlocking</b> of running <b>wheels,</b> for immunohistochemical analysis. We did not find any changes in baseline or exercise-induced levels of neurogenesis, or difference in baseline or irradiation-reduced levels of neurogenesis. In summary, we conclude that forced muscular expression of PGC- 1 a does not have a beneficial effect on hippocampal neurogenesis after IR in mice. This suggests that overexpression of PGC- 1 a in skeletal muscle is by itself not sufficient to mimic exercise-induced recovery after IR...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{exercise}} {{has repeatedly}} {{been shown to}} trigger positive effects on brain function including improved learning, memory, and executive functions. In addition, corresponding physiological changes have been observed, such as increased neurotrophic factors, changes in neurotransmitter concentrations, and increased dendritic spines. However, these changes have not been well described outside of the hippocampus, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and have not been directly compared at different points of development. Because the prefrontal cortex {{is one of the}} last brain areas to fully mature, considering the age at which intervention, such as exercise, takes place is particularly important. Additionally, in human studies the data suggest that exercise has the most profound effects on prefrontal-mediated cognitive functions, while there is considerably less evidence on how exercise affects these functions in animals. The experiments presented here draw upon several well-established methodologies to explore the behavioral and physiological changes due to exercise that take place during adulthood compared to adolescence, as well as the role of mPFC sub regions in instrumental extinction and renewal. To that end, these experiments employ conditioning paradigms using appetitive lever-pressing to assess renewal of extinguished instrumental responding following exercise or pharmacological manipulations. Additionally, because there are multiple reports suggesting that early experiences can affect prefrontal neuronal morphology, dendritic length, complexity, and spine density was examined in young or adult male rats that had access to a locked (no exercise) or <b>unlocked</b> (exercise) running <b>wheel</b> for two weeks. Furthermore, norepinephrine transporter (NET) protein expression in the mPFC was examined by Western blot. Collectively, these experiments suggest that exercise in developing, but not adult rats, reduces the expression of instrumental renewal. The precise role of the mPFC and its sub-regions (i. e., prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL)) in instrumental renewal was examined, providing evidence that the behavioral consequences of physical exercise may be due to modifications not only restricted to the mPFC, but also that exercise may have preferential effects on sub-regions, or change the balance of activation. The finding that when juvenile rats exercised they showed less ABA renewal than non-exercisers, paired with the reduction of ABA renewal when the PL was inactivated (and indeed, almost an identical reduction in the two experiments) points to the deduction that exercise is affecting the PL, perhaps more so than the IL or other mPFC regions...|$|R
