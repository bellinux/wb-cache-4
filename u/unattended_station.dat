50|$|An {{auxiliary}} station, {{most often}} used for repeater control or link purposes or to remotely control another station, is limited in the United States to operation on frequencies above 144.5 MHz excluding 144.0-144.5 MHz, 145.8-146.0 MHz, 219-220 MHz, 222.00-222.15 MHz, 431-433 MHz, and 435-438 MHz. Operation of such control links in the crowded 2-meter band is problematic and on many frequencies in that band expressly prohibited, leaving 1.25-meter band frequencies as the lowest available for remote control of repeaters and <b>unattended</b> <b>stations.</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{a review}} of sidings at <b>unattended</b> <b>stations</b> in 1953 it was noted of Clareville that inward goods {{comprised}} approximately 12 wagons of coal and 6 wagons of shooks for the Carrington Dairy Company, who consigned their outward goods at Carterton. Outward goods consisted primarily of hay and straw, amounting to approximately 12 wagons per year. It was considered that only minor inconvenience would be caused in closing Clareville to goods traffic and instead handling it at Carterton. In response to the review the District Engineer stated he had no objection to {{the lifting of the}} goods siding at Clareville. After the possibility of new business at Clareville from Airlift (N.Z.) was aborted on 11 June 1956, closure of the station to goods traffic was confirmed and a request to lift the goods siding was put in hand on 20 November 1957 with work being completed by 1 March 1958.|$|R
