40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is that the writer would like to {{investigate}} the kinds of errors specially reported speech made by first-year students at SMUN I Pamekasan. This research design is descriptive. The population of this research is all students of SMUN I Pamekasan-Madura in the first-Year students with seven classes and the samples are sixty-three students. Therefore, the sampling technique of this research is taken by using random-cluster sampling. The instrument used is the form of test. There are two categories of errors. They are global errors and local errors. The highest rank of grammar global errors made by the students is the <b>using</b> <b>of</b> tenses, followed by the <b>using</b> <b>of</b> pronoun, the <b>using</b> <b>of</b> adverb of time and place and the <b>using</b> <b>of</b> conjunction. The highest rank of grammar local errors made by the students is the <b>using</b> <b>of</b> diacritical mark and followed by the <b>using</b> <b>of</b> capital letters.
