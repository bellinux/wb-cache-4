5000|$|Peierls distortions in linear chains. In linear {{molecules}} {{with three}} or more atoms there may be PJTE distortions that do not violate the linearity but change the interatomic distances. For instance, {{as a result of}} the PJTE a centrosymmetric linear system may become non-centrosymmetric in the equilibrium configurations, as, for example, in the BNB molecule (see in [...] ). An interesting extension of such distortions in sufficiently long (infinite) linear chains was first considered by Peierls. In this case the electronic states, combinations of atomic states, are in fact band states, and it was shown that if the chain is composed by atoms with unpaired electrons, the valence band is only half filled, and the PJTE interaction between the occupied and <b>unoccupied</b> <b>band</b> states leads to the doubling of the period of the linear chain (see also in the books [...] ). Broken cylindrical symmetry. It was shown also that the PJTE not only produces the bending instability of linear molecules, but if the mixing electronic states involve a Δ state (a state with a nonzero momentum with respect to the axis of the molecule, its projection quantum number being Λ=2), the APES, simultaneously with the bending, becomes warped along the coordinate of rotations around the molecular axis, thus violating both the linear and cylindrical symmetry. It happens because the PJTE, by mixing the wavefunctions of the two interacting states, transfers the high momentum of the electrons from states with Λ=2 to states with lower momentum, and this may alter significantly their expected rovibronic spectra.|$|E

However, detailed understanding of their electronic structure and the mechanisms of the charge transfer processes is still lacking. Here, we use hybrid density functional theory calculations to analyse the electronic properties of the ideal rutile (110) -graphene interface, in order to understand experimentally observed trends in photoinduced charge transfer. We show that the potential energy surface of pristine graphene physisorbed above rutile (110) is relatively flat, enabling many possible positions of graphene above the rutile (110) surface. We verify that tensile and compressive strain has negligible effect on the electronic properties of graphene at low levels of strain. By analysing the band structure of this composite material and the composition of the valence and conduction band edges, we show that both the highest occupied states and the lowest unoccupied states of this composite are dominated by graphene, and that there is also a significant contribution of Ti orbitals to the two lowest <b>unoccupied</b> <b>bands.</b> We suggest that a transition from graphene-dominated occupied bands to mixed graphene and TiO 2 -based <b>unoccupied</b> <b>bands</b> is responsible for the experimentally observed photoinduced charge transfer from graphene to TiO 2 under visible light irradiation; however, the most stable state for an excess (e. g. photoexcited) electron is localised on the carbon orbitals, which make up the lowest-energy conduction band.
