50|$|Researchers {{have found}} that {{attempted}} suicide rates and suicidal ideation among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) youth is comparatively higher than among the general population. LGBT teens and young adults {{have one of the}} highest rates of suicide attempts. According to some groups, this is linked to heterocentric cultures and institutionalised homophobia in some cases, including the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> and protections for LGBT people as a political wedge issue like in the contemporary efforts to halt legalising same-sex marriages. Depression and drug use among LGBT people have both been shown to increase significantly after new laws that discriminate against gay people are passed.|$|E
50|$|Cassin {{compared}} the Declaration to the portico of a Greek temple, with a foundation, steps, four columns, and a pediment. Articles 1 and 2 {{are the foundation}} blocks, with their principles of dignity, liberty, equality, and brotherhood. The seven paragraphs of the preamble—setting out {{the reasons for the}} Declaration—represent the steps. The main body of the Declaration forms the four columns. The first column (articles 3-11) constitutes rights of the individual such as the right to life and the prohibition of slavery. Articles 6 through 11 refer to the fundamental legality of human rights with specific remedies cited for their defense when violated. The second column (articles 12-17) constitutes the rights of the individual in civil and political society (including such things as freedom of movement). The third column (articles 18-21) is concerned with spiritual, public, and political freedoms such as freedom of association, thought, conscience, and religion. The fourth column (articles 22-27) sets out social, economic, and cultural rights including healthcare. In Cassin's model, the last three articles of the Declaration provide the pediment which binds the structure together. These articles are concerned with the duty of the individual to society and the prohibition of <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> in contravention of the purposes of the United Nations Organisation.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> issues of convertible debt in the Australian market. The Australian market is of interest as it has dissimilar features to the US market but similar features to many European markets. That is, the primary mode of issuing securities is through rights issues rather than public issues, a listed debt market does not exist for Australian firms and many stocks are severely thinly traded. The effect of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> to raise capital in the form of convertible debt has not been examined in any market. This paper has two aims, to examine {{the impact of the}} announcement of convertible debt on stock prices and to consolidate and test the numerous theories of price reaction that have been established in the literature. The results find that the announcement of convertible debt tends to be preceded by positive abnormal stock price performance, and followed by a negative drift in stock prices, similar to US markets.

40|$|Incumbent {{management}} has long enjoyed broad discretion in its <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> Plans in proxy contests and joint offers. Legal scholars {{have accepted the}} justifications for permitting incumbents such latitude with little comment. The courts also have largely deferred to management's decisions about how they use Rights Plans against dissident shareholder groups. The analysis presented here argues that courts should apply stricter standards. A more stringent balancing test that forces incumbents to justify the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> Plans by explaining how the Rights Plan prevents a specific harm to their shareholders would better protectshareholders from abusive defensive tactics. For any particular defensive tactic, a court must question the explanations offered by incumbents and place the burden of persuasion on management {{to show that they}} are acting in shareholders' best interest. The courts should invalidate without further judicial inquiry those provisions of Rights Plans that are directed primarily toward impeding dissidents' proxy campaigns. Courts should permit Rights Plans in proxy contests only when the incumbents can show that the contests are necessary parts of the company's tender offer defense, that their impact on the outcome of a proxy contest will be minimal, and that direct benefits to the target company shareholders justify their adverse effects on dissidents' election campaigns. To determine the impact of particular defensive measures on the outcome of proxy contests, the courts should demand that the parties submit statistical evidence and expert testimony about the effects of Rights Plans on the outcome of the proxy contest. Only after examining the impact of the defensive tactic on the outcome of the proxy contests, and finding it justified by the benefit to the target company's shareholders, should a court approve any <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> Plans in proxy contests. When the incumbents fail to carry this burden, then the court should strike down these defenses and permit shareholders to exercise their vote in corporate elections freely and without restraint...|$|E
40|$|The {{resulting}} {{social and}} economic transformations of marketization and democratization have {{had a significant impact}} on the employment terrain of post-socialist Russia. This has had particular effects on the forms and structures of work available for women. Our article argues that as a result of these {{social and economic}} transformations, the metaphor of ‘choice’ inherent in current theoretical approaches to the study of women at work in western contexts can also be adapted to the post-socialist context. Building on existing research on women and work in the UK and in Russia, we seek to provide new insights into Russian women's own understandings of work and non-work choices grounded in an analysis of women's <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> discourses. Drawing on in-depth interview data with 49 women living in the provincial Russian city of Ul'ianovsk, we explore constructions of work in relation to narratives of discrimination; as a means of ‘samorealizatsiia’, and as ‘choice’ reflecting the continuing inseparability of public and private roles for women. Situating our work in wider global debates affecting the gendered nature of employment, the examination of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> discourses not only highlights the multiple ways in which women perceive their choices about work but also offers an alternative conceptual framewor...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> <b>Right</b> to Information Act, 2005 {{from the point}} of view of media {{professionals}} in Karnataka state. The media institutions provide a platform that enables government functionaries to operate efficiently, effectively and transparently and be accountable to the public who are the makers <b>of</b> democracy. <b>Right</b> to information is one of the core values of good governance and the media can make a real difference to the lives of poor and disadvantaged people in a civil society. The review of literature confirms the fact that not even a single study is carried out in India on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>right</b> to information by the members of the fourth estate in Karnataka state.

The study suggests that the best practices should be used to establish good rapport between the information seekers and information providers.

Further, we provide evidence that rights tend to be sold below their fair value. Our results, therefore, suggest that the lack of <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> offering, referred to as the rights offer paradox can be explained by indirect costs related to the nature of constraints confronting underwriters and shareholders but also to trading mistakes on the rights market...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to explore how constitutional rights figure in social controversies around new biomedical technologies and to highlight the possible advantages, problems and difficulties that the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> as benchmarks for their regulation involves.

To address this issue, this work is mainly based on a case study: the exploration of a social controversy around a technology known as preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in Italy. Exploring the different roles that rights have played in the Italian controversy, as well as the different ways in which they have been used, appealed to, shaped, and implemented, this work thus seeks to contribute to exploring the problems of using rights in social controversies around new biomedical technologies...|$|E

Significant economic gains could be achieved by eliminating excess capacity, in addition to attaining objectives of resource sustainability. In this paper, approaches to {{fishing capacity}} management are reviewed in the context of Indian fisheries. A rights based regulated access system under a co-management regime based on a strong inclusive cooperative movement of stakeholders with built-in transferable quota system and buy-back or rotational right of entry schemes seems to hold potential for capacity management in the shelf fisheries of Indian states, which need to be implemented in collaboration with the Union Government and the neighboring states with confluent ecosystems and shared fishing grounds. A key advantage of the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> based approaches for managing fishing capacity is that they provide a mechanism through which stakeholders can more easily and actively participate in the management process...|$|E
