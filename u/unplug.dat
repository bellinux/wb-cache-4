25|$|A fire {{occurred}} in a Tesla Model S charging at a Tesla Supercharger in Norway on January 1, 2016. The fire was slow, and the owner had time to <b>unplug</b> the car and retrieve possessions. An investigation by the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) indicated that the fire originated in the car, but was otherwise inconclusive. In March 2016, Tesla stated that their own investigation into the incident concluded that the fire {{was caused by a}} short circuit in the vehicle's distribution box, but that the amount of damage prevented them from determining the exact cause. Tesla stated that the Supercharger detected the short circuit and deactivated, and a future Model S software update would stop the vehicle from charging if a short circuit is detected.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Karaites {{refrained from}} using or {{deriving}} benefit from fire until the Sabbath ends, and accordingly their homes were not lit {{during the night}} of the Sabbath. Many modern Karaites today use a fluorescent or LED lamp powered by batteries, which is turned on prior to Shabbat. Many observant Karaites either <b>unplug</b> their refrigerators on Shabbat or turn off the circuit breakers. Karaites consider producing electricity to be a violation of Shabbat, no matter who produces it. Additionally, some Karaites view the purchasing of electricity that is charged on an incremental basis during the Shabbat as a commercial transaction that the Tanakh prohibits, no matter when the payment is made; the recording of the electric meter is considered by them to be a commercial transaction.|$|E

500|$|Tibbets was {{promoted}} to colonel in January 1945 and brought his wife and family along with him to Wendover. He felt that allowing married men in the group to bring their families would improve morale, although it put a strain on his own marriage. In order to disguise all the civilian engineers on base who {{were working on the}} Manhattan Project, Tibbets was forced to lie to his wife; he told her that the engineers were [...] "sanitary workers." [...] At one point, Tibbets found that Lucy had co-opted a scientist to <b>unplug</b> a drain.|$|E
500|$|As free jazz {{spread in}} the 1960s, so did the use of tone clusters. In {{comparison}} with what John Litweiler describes as Taylor's [...] "endless forms and contrasts," [...] the solos of Muhal Richard Abrams employ tone clusters in a similarly free, but more lyrical, flowing context. Guitarist Sonny Sharrock made them {{a central part of}} his improvisations; in Palmer's description, he executed [...] "glass-shattering tone clusters that sounded like someone was ripping the pickups out of the guitar without having bothered to <b>unplug</b> it from its overdriven amplifier." [...] Pianist Marilyn Crispell has been another major free jazz proponent of the tone cluster, frequently in collaboration with Anthony Braxton, who played with Abrams early in his career. Since the 1990s, Matthew Shipp has built on Taylor's innovations with the form. European free jazz pianists who have contributed {{to the development of the}} tone cluster palette include Gunter Hampel and Alexander von Schlippenbach.|$|E

Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever you take a celebrity into a commercial venture, which {{more and more people are}} doing, there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't take much to turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, like anything else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing in the world would be to <b>unplug</b> Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E
50|$|Throughout the 1980s, the {{acoustic}} scene did not exist, however, {{the appearance of}} the first <b>unplugged</b> concerts in the late 1980s introduced the popularity of acoustic music in the following decade. Bora Đorđević's and Arsen Dedić's 1987 <b>unplugged</b> performance in Terazije Theatre, released on the official bootleg album Arsen & Bora Čorba <b>Unplugged</b> `87, {{was one of the first}} <b>unplugged</b> concerts in Serbia and former Yugoslavia. However, it was in the 1990s that the Serbian rock acts started performing <b>unplugged</b> more often. The first official <b>unplugged</b> live album was released by the britpop band Eva Braun in 1993, and in the following year the Music Television of Serbia organized an <b>unplugged</b> festival in Belgrade Sava Centar. The recordings of Eva Braun, Rambo Amadeus, Laki Pingvini, Babe, Dejan Cukić, Milan Delčić, Du Du A, Del Arno Band, Kazna Za Uši, and others appeared on the various artists compilation Bez struje in 1995. During the 1990s, the <b>unplugged</b> concerts in Serbia were mainly organized by the Novi Sad television station NS Plus in Novi Sad Studio M. Influenced by the already popular MTV <b>Unplugged,</b> NS Plus <b>Unplugged</b> concerts of Dejan Cukić, Kerber, S Vremena Na Vreme, Električni Orgazam, Vlada Divljan & Old Stars Band and Garavi Sokak, all held in 1996, and Love Hunters, held in 1998, were released on live albums throughout the late 1990s. YU Grupa released only a part of their 1996 <b>unplugged</b> concert in Studio M, featuring Kornelije Kovač on piano, on their 2007 album Live. An <b>unplugged</b> album was also released by Generacija 5 in 2002, but their <b>unplugged</b> concert, held in 1995, was not a part of the NS Plus <b>Unplugged</b> series.|$|R

500|$|In early 2000, {{the clock}} {{started to run}} {{backward}} because the national debt was actually decreasing. It showed a national debt of $5.7 billion and an individual family share of almost $74,000. With the original purpose of the clock being to highlight the rising debt, the reversal of the figures gave a mixed message, added {{to the fact that}} the display not being designed to properly run backward. In May 2000, it was reported that the clock was planned to be unplugged on September 7, 2000, what would have been Seymour Durst's 87th birthday. Douglas said that the decision to <b>unplug</b> the clock was made because [...] "it was put up to focus attention on the increasing national debt, and it's served its purpose." [...] In September, the clock was unplugged and covered with a red-white-and-blue curtain, with the national debt standing at roughly 5.7 trillion dollars. However, less than two years later in July 2002, the curtain was raised and the clock once again picked up tracking a rising debt, starting at 6.1 trillion dollars.|$|E

2500|$|In 1960, Presley re-recorded [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] for {{the soundtrack}} {{of the film}} G.I. Blues. While Presley's {{character}} and his band, the [...] "Three Blazes", play a ballad at a Frankfurt nightclub ("Doin' the Best I Can", by Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman), a bored GI plays Presley's version of [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] on the jukebox, remarking that he wants [...] "to hear an original". When another soldier tries to <b>unplug</b> the jukebox, the audience erupts in a fight. This studio re-recording {{was one of the}} few occasions in Presley's career in which he agreed to re-record a previously issued song. He did it on this occasion because the rest of the soundtrack was recorded in stereo, and thus a stereo version of [...] "Blue Suede Shoes" [...] was required. The 1960 version uses virtually the same arrangement as the 1956 recording. This version was included on the soundtrack album to G.I. Blues but was never released as a single in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{well-known}} article [...] "A Defense of Abortion", Judith Jarvis Thomson {{argues that}} abortion is in some circumstances permissible even if the embryo is a person and {{has a right to}} life, because the embryo's right to life is overtrumped by the woman's right to control her body and its life-support functions. [...] Her central argument involves a thought experiment. [...] Imagine, Thomson says, that you wake up in bed next to a famous violinist. [...] He is unconscious with a fatal kidney ailment; and because only you happen to have the right blood type to help, the Society of Music Lovers has kidnapped you and plugged your circulatory system into his so that your kidneys can filter poisons from his blood as well as your own. [...] If he is disconnected from you now, he will die; but in nine months he will recover and can be safely disconnected. [...] Thomson takes it that you may permissibly <b>unplug</b> yourself from the violinist even though this will kill him. [...] The right to life, Thomson says, does not entail the right to use another person's body, and so in disconnecting the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of somethingthe use of your bodyto which he has no right. [...] Similarly, even if the fetus has a right to life, it does not have a right to use the pregnant woman's body and life-support functions against her will; and so aborting the pregnancy is permissible in at least some circumstances. [...] However, Thomson notes that the woman's right to abortion does not include the right to directly insist upon the death of the child, should the fetus happen to be viable, that is, capable of surviving outside the womb.|$|E
