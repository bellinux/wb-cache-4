40|$|The {{sovereignty}} {{of a country}} is the highest power state of that country how to govern and enforce {{the law in the}} territory. As one of the largest country in the world, Indonesia was not sovereign over the territory, in particular airspace. The airspace of Riau Islands and Natuna until 1946 is controlled by Flight Information Region (FIR) Singapore. It means that every flight in that airspace must received permission from Singapore, including Indonesia itself. Indonesia is supposed to be ruling all of Indonesia territory without delegating to any party. According to above description, The author is interested to doing research with the title Implication of the International law in Flight Information Region <b>Upper</b> the <b>Airspace</b> of Indonesia Againts Sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. This thesis aims to determine how the navigation settings in Indonesia. Furthermore, to determine the implications of the delegation the airspace of Riau Islands and Natuna to Singapore FIR against Indonesian sovereignty. In the thesis, the author uses the method of normative legal research. Data sources supported by the data source of primary, secondary and tertiary. While data collection techniques is the study of literature and study data using deductive method is to analyze the problems of a general nature and then drawn to a conclusion in particular based on existing theory. The results of the discussions in this thesis is, first, Flight navigation settings in Indonesian airspace divided into three, namely, Jakarta FIR which covers {{the western part of the}} Borneo island to the western part of Indonesia began western part of Central Java and Christmas Island belongs to Australia. Ujung Pandang FIR covers the eastern part of Indonesia, ranging from the eastern part of the island of Borneo, and East Java up to Papua, plus one FIR Singapore covering airspace Riau and Natuna Islands, which is divided into three sectors, namely A, B and C. Second, the implications of the delegation of airspace and Natuna the Riau Islands to Singapore FIR against Indonesia is divided into three, namely, the first in the fields of politics will affect the position of Indonesia in the civil aviation of world that have an impact on the public 2 ̆ 7 s view of the ability of Indonesia, especially in the flight will be low-cost. In economics, income from fee of airspace across Riau Islands and Natuna is not achieved by Indonesia as full as must be, because Singapore collects the fee does not provide the transparency of the number of flights across the region. Finally, in the field of defense and security, Indonesia must be vigilant because the area is also used by Singapore to conduct military exercises.

40|$|The {{discussion}} on the delimitation, and hence definition of 2 ̆ 7 outer space 2 ̆ 7 as an area, and subsidiary to that on the need or desirability {{to have such a}} delimitation and definition, harks {{back to the beginning of}} the space age. Until then, it had been quite clear that every state exercised full sovereignty over the sky above its territory and territorial waters, whilst no one felt the need for finding out how high upward such sovereignty would exactly extend. With Sputnik, for the first time the practical question arose however whether there indeed was an <b>upper</b> limit to <b>airspace,</b> and if so, where it would lie. The debate since then has mainly been a theoretical one, partly because several important space-faring nations did not consider it necessary or even appropriate to establish a legally relevant fixed boundary between 2 ̆ 7 outer space 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 airspace 2 ̆ 7 as 2 ̆ 7 geographical 2 ̆ 7 areas for human activities. It is the main thrust of this paper, firstly, that this situation is changing. It is contended that in particular the recent adventures of SpaceShipOne which for a brief moment 2 ̆ 7 dipped 2 ̆ 7 into outer space - if one agrees that outer space begins at an altitude of 100 km - bring the question of where 2 ̆ 7 outer space 2 ̆ 7 begins back on the table. Consequently, wherever that question is indeed considered relevant, in the absence of any international agreement on such a delimitation or definition, viz. the need or desirability to establish one, other legally relevant means are sought to deal with the issue. Secondly, such development of alternate means has, in turn, its own indirect impact at the international legal plane. Such various developments as Australian national law referring to a lower boundary for outer space and the need to choose for certification of SpaceShipOne and crew may, in the end, through the mechanism of formation of international custom and opinio juris, lead to a customary legal rule. The current paper thus, firstly, briefly recapitulates the discussion of the last decades on delimitation and definition of outer space, secondly, refers to a few events which directly touch upon this issue, thirdly, tries to analyse the legal aspects of the solutions chosen to deal with that, including the vexing question of formation of customary law, and finally tries to draw some conclusions with respect to the overarching question: if the sky is the limit, where does it end...|$|R

One month of traffic data (more than 200, 000 flights) from 12 countries in the Middle East was analyzed for collision risk estimates, and the airspace network was characterized for several complex network indicators. Results show that intermediate waypoint leads to {{a significant increase in}} collision risk estimates. Results also show the correlation between estimated collision risk and specific network complexity measures. From an operational per- spective this means that in airspaces with a highly structured airspace, collision risk may be underestimated when using the widely accepted direct route model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In an {{analysis}} of flight data, we found {{a relationship between the}} planned number of sector entries and the average realized number. It suggests that there are systematically more aircraft than planned arriving for few planned traffic and less for high numbers of planned traffic. This is counter-intuitive since one would expect random fluctuation around the planned number if the planning procedure were accurate. The relationship we found can be described concisely by logarithmic, square root or reciprocal functions. Moreover, we show that it {{can be seen as the}} mean values of Poisson distributions. Taking both together, the uncertainty about the real number of aircraft arriving at a sector can be characterized. We validate the findings on a large number of sectors, randomly chosen from the Central European <b>Upper</b> <b>Airspace.</b> The results are empirical but they give insight into how con-trollers deal with their workload.

40|$|Abstract—As {{acknowledged}} by the SESAR programme, current ATC systems must be drastically improved {{to accommodate the}} predicted traffic growth in Europe. In this context, the Episode 3 project aims at assessing the performance of new ATM concepts, like 4 D-trajectory planning and strategic deconfliction. One of the bottlenecks impeding ATC performances is the hourly capacity constraints defined on each en-route ATC sector to limit the rate of aircraft. Previous works were mainly focused on optimizing the current ground holding slot allocation process devised to satisfy these constraints. We propose to estimate the cost of directly solving all conflicts in the <b>upper</b> <b>airspace</b> with ground holding, provided that aircraft were able to follow their trajectories accurately. We present a Constraint Programming (CP) model of this large scale combinatorial optimization problem and the results obtained with the FaCiLe constraint library. We study the effect of uncertainties on the departure time and estimate the cost of improving the robustness of our solutions with the CATS simulator. Encouraging results were obtained without uncertainty but the costs of robust solutions are prohibitive.

40|$|Respiratory muscles with dual {{respiratory}} and non-respiratory functions (e. g. the pharyngeal and intercostal muscles) show greater {{suppression of}} activity in sleep than the diaphragm, a muscle almost entirely devoted to respiratory function. This sleep-related suppression of activity is most apparent in the tonic component of motor activity, which has functional implications of a more collapsible <b>upper</b> <b>airspace</b> {{in the case of}} pharyngeal muscles, and decreased functional residual capacity in the case of intercostal muscles. A major source of tonic drive to respiratory motoneurons originates from neurons intimately involved in states of brain arousal, i. e. neurons not classically involved in generating respiratory rhythm and pattern per se. The tonic drive to hypoglossal motoneurons, a respiratory motor pool with both respiratory and non-respiratory functions, is mediated principally by noradrenergic and glutamatergic inputs, these constituting the essential components of the wakefulness stimulus. These tonic excitatory drives are opposed by tonic inhibitory glycinergic and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) inputs that constrain the level of respiratory-related motor activity, with the balance determining net motor tone. In sleep, the excitatory inputs are withdrawn and GABA release into the brainstem is increased, thus decreasing respiratory motor tone and predisposing susceptible individuals to hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnoea...|$|E
40|$|A {{majority}} of aircraft {{are now using}} Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) for navigation. This {{has led to an}} effect of reducing the magnitude of lateral deviations from the route center line and, consequently, increasing the probability of a collision, should a loss of vertical separation between aircraft on the same route occur. The International Civil Aviation Organiza- tion (ICAO) has introduced Strategic Lateral Offset Procedures (SLOP) that allow suitably equipped aircrafts to fly with 1 nmi or 2 nmi lateral offset to the right of airway centerline in oceanic airspace. Very few aircraft, how- ever, are using the SLOP procedure {{because of the lack of}} understanding of its safety benefits and implementation issues in identifying correct lateral offset that can reduce the collision risk. This paper proposes an Evolution- ary Computation framework using Differential Evolution process to identify optimal lateral offsets for each airway in a given airspace such that it reduces the overall collision risk. Airway specific lateral offsets are then correlated with airway-traffic features using Multiple Regression models to identify which features can explain the optimal lateral offset. The proposed approach establishes a generic mapping that can suggest optimal lateral offsets for a given airspace based on airway-traffic features to mitigate colli- sion risk. The proposed methodology is applied to Collision Risk assessment of one-day traffic data (710 flights) in Bahrain <b>Upper</b> <b>Airspace</b> (FL 290 -FL 410) o estimate optimal lateral offset that resulted in significant reduction of collision risk.

40|$|Congestion {{severely}} affects {{air traffic}} in the US and Europe. To protect air traffic controllers from overloads a planning activity, Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM), emerged during the 1970 s. ATFM control actions range from departure delays to the re-routing of flights. This research explores how models {{can be used to}} support decision-making in European ATFM. To date, most research into this subject has been directed at ATFM in the US, which differs from European ATFM both in terms of decision-making and time scales. Fieldwork was carried out at the EUROCONTROL Central Flow Management Unit, the organisation that manages traffic flows in most of the European airspace. The fieldwork was an OR intervention aimed at identifying suitable decision support models for re-routing flights. The research described here contributes by: 1) describing the European ATFM field and identifying decision support needs; 2) structuring the problems involved in re-routing flights in Europe; 3) providing a framework for the development of re-routing decision support systems (DSS) and 4) assessing the usefulness of optimisation approaches to re-routing flights. A demonstrator is developed to illustrate different re-routing decision support possibilities to the users. This leads to conclusions on the feasibility of various decision support functions including an identification of models and algorithms which can be used for each of the functions. Conclusions on levels of automation and complexity for re-routing DSS are also taken. Three integer models for re-routing flows are presented. They differ in the way congestion is represented. The models are tested on data of traffic crossing the whole French <b>upper</b> <b>airspace.</b> The test reveals that the models can be of use in re-routing flows and can provide significant savings in delays. It also shows that an 'intelligent' component to define the scope of the optimisation problem and a component to process all the data for the models, are needed in a re-routing DSS. The models are compared in terms of impact on congestion, size and execution time and conclusions on their feasibility taken. Extensions to the models are suggested...|$|E
40|$|In sectorless {{air traffic}} {{management}} (ATM) concept, air traffic controllers {{are no longer in}} charge of a certain sector. Instead, the sectorless airspace is considered as a single unit and controllers are assigned certain aircraft, which might be located anywhere in the sectorless airspace. The air traffic controllers are responsible for these geographically independent aircraft all the way from their entry into the airspace to the exit. In order to support the controllers with this task, they are provided with one radar display for each assigned aircraft. This means, only one aircraft on each of these radar displays is under their control as the surrounding traffic is under control of other controllers. Each air traffic controller has to keep track of several traffic situa-tions at the same time. In order to optimally support controllers with this task, a color-coding of the information is necessary. For example, the aircraft under control can be distinguished from the surrounding traffic by displaying them in a certain color. Furthermore, conflict detection and resolution information can be color-coded, such that it is straightforward which controller is in charge of solving a conflict. We conducted a human-in-the-loop simulation in order to compare different color schemes for a sectorless ATM controller working position. Three different color schemes were tested: a positive contrast polarity scheme that follows the current look of the P 1 /VAFORIT (P 1 /very advanced flight-data pro-cessing operational requirement implementation) display used by the German air navigation service provider DFS in the Karlsruhe <b>upper</b> <b>airspace</b> control center, a newly designed negative contrast polarity color scheme and a modified positive contrast polarity scheme. An analysis of the collected data showed no significant evidence for an impact of the color schemes on controller task performance. However, results suggest that a positive contrast polarity should be preferred and that the newly designed positive contrast polarity color scheme has advantages over the P 1 /VAFORIT color scheme when used for sectorless ATM...|$|E
40|$|Background Apnoea is a {{breathing}} disorder {{marked by the}} absence of airflow at the nose or mouth. in children, risk factors include adenotonsillar hypertrophy, obesity, neuromuscular disorders and craniofacial anomalies. the most common treatment for obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) in childhood is adenotonsillectomy. This approach is limited by its surgical risks, mostly in children with comorbities and, in some patients, by recurrence that can be associated with craniofacial problems. Oral appliances and functional orthopaedic appliances have been used for patients who have OSAS and craniofacial anomalies because they change the mandible posture forwards and potentially enlarge the upper airway and increase the <b>upper</b> <b>airspace,</b> improving the respiratory function. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of oral appliances or functional orthopaedic appliances for OSAS in children. Search strategy A sensitive search was developed for the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, Issue 3); PubMed (January 1966 to September 2005); EMBASE (1980 to September 2005); Lilacs (1982 to September 2005); BBO-Bibliografia Brasileira de Odontologia (1986 to September 2005); and SciELO (1997 to September 2005). There was no restriction of language or source of information. Selection criteria All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing all types of oral and functional orthopaedic appliances with placebo or no treatment, in children 15 years old or younger. Primary outcome: reduction of apnoea to less than one episode per hour. Secondary outcomes: dental and skeletal relationship, sleep parameters improvement, cognitive and phonoaudiologic function, behavioural problems, drop outs and withdrawals, quality of life, side effects (tolerability), economic evaluation. Data collection and analysis Data were independently extracted by two review authors. Authors were contacted for additional information. Risk ratios with 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for all important dichotomous outcomes. Main results the initial search identified 384 trials. One of them, reporting results from a total of 23 patients, was suitable for inclusion in the review. Data provided in the published report did not answer all the questions from this review, but some of them were, and the presented results favour treatment. Authors' conclusions At present there is no sufficient evidence to state that oral appliances or functional orthopaedic appliances are effective in the treatment of OSAS in children. Oral appliances or functional orthopaedic appliances may be helpful in the treatment of children with craniofacial anomalies which are risk factors for apnoea.
