40|$|Abstract Background The {{ability to}} manipulate, edit and process DNA and protein {{sequences}} has rapidly become a necessary skill for practicing biologists {{across a wide}} swath of disciplines. In spite of this, most everyday sequence manipulation tools are distributed across several programs and web servers, sometimes requiring installation and typically involving frequent switching between applications. To address this problem, here we have developed BioWord, a macro-enabled self-installing template for Microsoft Word documents that integrates an extensive suite of DNA and protein sequence manipulation tools. Results BioWord is distributed as a single macro-enabled template that self-installs with a single click. After installation, BioWord will open as a tab in the Office ribbon. Biologists can then easily manipulate DNA and protein sequences using a familiar interface and minimize the need to switch between applications. Beyond simple sequence manipulation, BioWord integrates functionality ranging from dyad search and consensus logos to motif discovery and pair-wise alignment. Written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) as an open source, object-oriented project, BioWord allows users with varying programming experience to expand and customize the program to better meet their own needs. Conclusions BioWord integrates a powerful set of tools for biological sequence manipulation within a handy, user-friendly tab in a widely <b>used</b> <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> package. The <b>use</b> of a simple scripting language and an object-oriented scheme facilitates customization by users and provides a very accessible educational platform for introducing students to basic bioinformatics algorithms. </p...|$|R

A growing number of people in today’s society realize the importance of education and the increasing need to return to school. As the number of adult learners continues to rise, so too does the need to reach out to this population {{to make sure they are}} being presented with the appropriate tools and resources needed to succeed. Because it is theorized that adults (those age 25 +) who return to school are likely to enroll in a community college, rather than a four year university, this study looks specifically at community colleges in Massachusetts in an effort to judge what is being done to help this often overlooked population, as well as what could be improved. To make this determination, a brief survey was sent to 25 reference librarians at 13 different Massachusetts community colleges.

The purpose of the study was to produce research results to assist business communication teachers, budget administrators, and business writers. The results will assist them in determining the extent to which they will integrate computer-related composition activities into their business communication courses and offices. The study, which was conducted during fall semester, 1987, at the University of North Texas, used a posttest-only control group design, with a pretest to equate groups. It included 104 students enrolled in the introductory business communication course. Half of the students composed a business letter by hand and half did so <b>using</b> WordPerfect <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software.</b> The students' letters were then graded using a letter evaluation form containing 17 business writing quality categories. T-Tests were conducted to determine if significant differences existed at the. 05 level in the 17 quality categories when: (1) handwritten letters were compared to those composed <b>using</b> <b>word</b> processing; (2) letters composed by students <b>using</b> <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> with previous <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> experience were compared to letters composed by students <b>using</b> <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> with no previous <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> experience; (3) letters composed by students <b>using</b> <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> with previous <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> experience were compared to handwritten letters; and (4) letters composed by students <b>using</b> <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> with no previous <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> experience were compared to handwritten letters.

40|$|Research studies {{conducted}} where <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> programs were <b>used</b> for composition and revision indicate that computers {{affect the way}} writers at all maturity levels compose and revise.

However, when student writers are able to <b>use</b> <b>word</b> <b>processing,</b> research indicates they are motivated to spend more time writing, they have a better attitude about revising, and they begin to understand that one draft does not represent a finished product. These three findings would indicate that <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> is a positive alternative to the traditional paper and pencil composition instruction used to teach writing and revising. Encouraged by the positive results of previous research findings, this study was constructed to provide a group of young writers with intensive writing practice <b>using</b> the APPLEWORKS <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> system. The goal {{of the study was to}} build on the motivational aspects of computer use and to determine if combining it with <b>use</b> of <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> <b>software</b> would encourage higher level revision strategies to develop in student writers. A variety of writing topics were presented to two groups of seventh grade students and three levels of revisions (mechanical, structural and conceptual) were monitored during one school semester. The importance of revising was stressed to both groups, and students were encouraged to revise often and get feedback on each revision. A higher incidence of structural and/or conceptual revisions to a composition would indicate a shift in revision strategy, since student writers primarily focus on mechanical revision. Structural revisions made by the <b>word</b> <b>processing</b> group showed a significant change that was not evident in the group writing with paper and pencil.

Furthermore, in a collaborative editing/review setting it is not only necessary for each user to understand their own context, but also to have an awareness of the contexts of the other participants. Although systems have been developed that provide awareness in collaborative settings, they usually rely on multiple windows, which use valuable screen real-estate. We have developed a system called DeepDocument using a two-layered LCD display in which both focussed and document-wide views are presented simultaneously. The overview is shown on the rear display and the focussed view on the front, maintaining full screen size for each. The physical separation of the layers takes advantage of human depth perception capabilities to allow users to perceive the views independently without having to redirect their gaze.

Upon completing the typing of the SOAP note, each therapist was requested to print a copy of the document from the WordPerfect software program. Attitude surveys were provided to members of each group immediately following the training period to ascertain therapist perceptions concerning the use of computerized patient care documentation. The attitude survey was presented again one week later to each participant in the control and experimental groups. The results of the study indicated no significant differences in performance between the control (lecture) group and the experimental (video) group regarding the time required to complete the typing task and the number of errors committed at a. 05 level of significance. An attitude survey investigated therapist perceptions toward the computerized documentation system in six key job performance areas. Results indicated that therapists were generally positive in their attitudes concerning the computerized documentation system.
