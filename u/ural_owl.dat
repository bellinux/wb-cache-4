5|$|The {{tawny owl}} {{is a member}} of the wood-owl genus Strix, part of the typical owl family Strigidae, which {{contains}} all species of owl other than the barn owls. Within its genus, the tawny owl's closest relatives are Hume's owl, Strix butleri, (formerly considered to be conspecific), the Himalayan owl, Strix nivicolum, (sometimes considered conspecific), its larger northern neighbour, the <b>Ural</b> <b>owl,</b> S. uralensis, and the North American barred owl, S. varia. The Early–Middle Pleistocene Strix intermedia is sometimes considered a paleosubspecies of the tawny owl, which would make it that species' immediate ancestor.|$|E
25|$|However, it is {{the forest}} species which are the most notable of the park, {{especially}} the woodpeckers and owls. Concerning woodpeckers, the great spotted woodpecker is the most common, but the black woodpecker, the European green woodpecker and the lesser spotted woodpecker are also themselves common. The population of white-backed woodpecker, a species classified as very endangered in Sweden with only 16 individuals {{in the whole country}} in 2004, has diminished in the park. Of 7 pairs observed in 1976, one sole individual was observed in 2003, and then a new couple in 2010. This species especially likes old forests with lots of dead trees and the species is thus a good indicator of the richness of the forest. In contrast, the grey-headed woodpecker is becoming more common. Regarding owls, the most common species are the Eurasian pygmy owl and the <b>Ural</b> <b>owl.</b> The latter is in addition the symbol of the park. Apart from these species, there are the common buzzard, the Eurasian hobby, or even, among others, the European honey buzzard.|$|E
40|$|Animals {{are thought}} to adjust their {{behavior}} optimally to any given environment. So-called behavioral syndromes, or consistent patterns of behavior across environments, contradict this assumption of unlimited plasticity. We studied nest defense aggressiveness of female <b>Ural</b> <b>owls</b> (244 females with 482 breeding attempts) breeding in a highly variable environment created by fluctuations in the abundance of their main prey (field and bank voles) across years. <b>Ural</b> <b>owls</b> were more aggressive when voles were increasing in density as well as when the <b>Ural</b> <b>owls</b> had large brood sizes and laid early in the season. Aggressive nest defense was highly repeatable between breeding attempts (r = 0. 52 � 0. 05 standard error), but individuals also differed in their plasticity (the {{extent to which they}} adjusted the level of their aggression to the varying food conditions). Fierce nest defenders produced more recruits to the local breeding population, but a female's survival was not affected by her intensity of nest defense. A path analysis revealed that nest defense aggressiveness, rather than its correlates vole abundance, brood size, or laying date, best explained offspring recruitment. Our findings provide an ultimate explanation for the <b>Ural</b> <b>owl's</b> extremely aggressive nest defense. Copyright 2009, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl {{is a very}} {{formidable}} bird of prey but its diet broadly {{overlaps with}} other European owls. All species of owl in the Europe and northern Asia hunt rodents, as does the eagle-owl, and in many the very same microtine rodents such as voles and lemmings will be favored. Even the [...] Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum), at a whooping one-fortieth {{of the weight of}} an eagle-owl, will take much the same rodent prey as eagle-owls in adjacent habitats. The only European owls to favor non-rodent prey are the [...] European scops owl (Otus scops) and [...] little owl (Athene noctua), both of which most regularly consume invertebrates. However, little owls also take rodents and small mammals, especially in the winter months (while scops owl migrate to Africa for the winter). The European owls with the most similar diets to eagle-owls are [...] tawny (Strix alucco) and [...] Ural owls (Strix uralensis), although both are considerably smaller and less powerful and more specialized to hunt in wooded environments. These two Strix species are highly territorial and sedentary like the eagle-owl and capable of taking a broad range of prey, including good numbers of birds and larger prey such as rabbits (for the tawny owl) and hares (for the <b>Ural</b> <b>owl)</b> of up to at least twice their own weight. Studies have indicated that even while selected similar prey species as the eagle-owl, smaller owls including the long-eared, tawny and Ural owls select smaller individual prey items, being more likely to take small, juveniles rather than optimal, large adults as does the eagle-owl. Similar rodent prey is also often taken by many diurnal birds of prey, especially buzzards, harriers and small falcons. However, due its greater size and power than overlapping owls and smaller diurnal raptors, it generally takes more diverse and larger prey than most overlapping raptorial birds.|$|E

5|$|Predators of the {{tawny owl}} include large birds such as <b>Ural</b> <b>owls,</b> eagle owls, {{northern}} goshawks, golden eagles, and common buzzards. Pine martens may raid nests, especially where artificial nest boxes make the owls easy to find, and several instances {{have been recorded}} of Eurasian jackdaws building nests {{on top of a}} brooding female tawny owl leading to the death of the adult and chicks. A Danish study showed that predation by mammals, especially red foxes, was an important cause of mortality in newly fledged young, with 36% dying between fledging and independence. The mortality risk increased with fledging date from 14% in April to more than 58% in June, and increasing predation of late broods may be an important selective agent for early breeding in this species.|$|R
5|$|The {{tawny owl}} flies with long glides on rounded wings, less undulating and with fewer wingbeats than other Eurasian owls, and {{typically}} at a greater height. The {{flight of the}} tawny owl is rather heavy and slow, particularly at takeoff. As with most owls, its flight is silent because of its feathers' soft, furry upper surfaces and a fringe {{on the leading edge}} of the outer primaries. Its size, squat shape and broad wings distinguish it from other owls found within its range; great grey, eagle and <b>Ural</b> <b>owls</b> are similar in shape, but much larger.|$|R

40|$|Amateur bird ringers {{can collect}} data at a {{geographic}} and temporal scale that is rarely possible with professional field crews, thus allowing truly national analyses of population dynamics and dispersal. Since the early 1970 s, bird ringers in Finland have been strongly encouraged {{to focus on}} birds of prey, especially cavity-nesting owls. In addition to ringing nestlings and adults, ringers also provide data on population trends and breeding success. The resultant data indicate that numbers of breeding pairs fluctuated with the 3 - 4 year microtine cycle, but without any long¿term trend. Mean productivity per nest varied from 2. 18 to 3. 33 fledglings per active nest in Tawny Owls, 1. 56 to 2. 87 in <b>Ural</b> <b>Owls</b> and 1. 78 to 4. 32 in Tengmalm's Owls. Survival and breeding propensity also varied with the vole cycle and explained much of the observed variation in breeding populations. Observed median dispersal distances were 24 and 18 km for <b>Ural</b> and Tawny <b>Owls</b> respectively, but increased to 36 and 48 km, using a method presented here to adjust for uneven sampling effort, highlighting the importance of considering sampling effort when estimating dispersal...|$|R
40|$|The {{loss and}} {{fragmentation}} of forest habitats {{have been considered}} to pose a worldwide threat to the viability of forest-dwelling animals, especially to species that occupy old forests. We investigated whether the annual survival of sedentary male Tengmalm’s owls Aegolius funereus {{was associated with the}} cover of old coniferous forests in Finland. Survival and recapture probabilities varied annually with density changes in populations of the main prey (Microtus voles). When this variation was controlled for, and relationships between survival and proportions of the three different forest age classes (old-growth, middle-aged, and young) were modeled separately, the old-growth model was the most parsimonious. Survival increased with the cover of old forest, although the extent of old forest within owl territories was relatively small (mean ∼ 12 %, range 2 – 37 %). This association, however, varied among years and appeared especially in years of increasing vole abundance. At such times, old forests may sustain high populations of bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus, shrews and small passerines. In addition, old forests may serve as refuges against large avian predator species, such as <b>Ural</b> <b>owls</b> Strix uralensis and goshawks Accipiter gentilis. Our results suggest that changes in habitat quality created by agriculture and forestry may have the potential to reduce adult survival, an essential component of fitness and population viability. ...|$|R
50|$|The black {{woodpecker}} {{is a fairly}} widely distributed woodland species and can successfully breed in most areas where extensive woodland is left. At one point, when much of Europe and Asia was deforested, this species declined and in some areas are still struggling today, including the Pyrenees. They normally require mature trees and ample stands of dead trees to be to have a viable breeding population. However, with the restoration of some forested areas, {{black woodpecker}}s have increased {{in some parts of}} Europe. They are occasionally considered a nuisance species due to their damage to power lines and communication poles and to house, occasionally resulting in woodpecker mortality due to electrocution or being culled by humans. The main cause of nesting failures appears to be predation. Their main natural predator is the pine marten (Martes martes), which feeds on eggs, nestlings and brooding females and then often takes over the nest hole of the woodpecker for its own. Other than the marten, there are notably few known natural predators of black woodpeckers. Western jackdaws (Corvus monedula) are notably regular usurpers of this species nest holes and a potential predator of eggs and small nestlings. A few of the larger birds of prey that can hunt in woodlands may prey on black woodpeckers. Among those recorded are <b>Ural</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix uralensis), Eurasian eagle-owls (Bubo bubo), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), and common buzzards (Buteo buteo).|$|R

25|$|Owls, {{which may}} have {{dissimilar}} periods of activity, are not entirely exempt from golden eagle predation either. Several species have been recorded as prey, especially in Northern Europe, Slovakia (where owls make up 2.4% of prey remains) and {{some parts of the}} Western United States. Species hunted have ranged in size from tiny Eurasian pygmy owl (Glaucidium passerinum) and little owl (Athene noctua) to the formidable, large great horned, Eurasian eagle and great gray owls (Strix nebulosa). Barn owls (Tyto alba) have been predated by golden eagles in both North America and Eurasia. On Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz Islands, barn owls made up 4.5% of the diet, the largest known occurrence of that species in the eagles' diet. However, the great horned owl is the owl species that occurs most regularly in the diet of North American golden eagles. In Europe, golden eagles are relatively minor predators of owls compared to Eurasian eagle-owls and northern goshawks. The primary owls hunted by European eagles are <b>Ural</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix uralensis) and short-eared owls (Asio flammeus).

40|$|Hatching {{asynchrony}} (HA) is a ubiquitous {{phenomenon in}} birds with generally profound consequences for offspring development. We here define HA relative to clutch or brood size, which {{allows us to}} use all available data and which removes the intrinsic relationship between these traits that has affected some of the previous examinations of patterns within (and across) study systems. Assuming constant laying interval (2 days) and equal developmental time for the eggs, we show that in 108 female <b>Ural</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix uralensis) {{the timing of the}} onset of incubation (the causal reason underlying HA) varies across individuals and is moderately repeatable of 25 % (n = 161 broods). HA was not related to ambient temperature at incubation or to food supply (ambient or supplemented). Second, analysis of 215 broods with carefully monitored hatching shows that it is the timing of the onset of incubation together with the hatching success of the eggs that affect the final hatching patterns of the brood. Hence, these 2 causal and general reasons for the emerging hatching patterns should be clearly separated in further studies. We find clear evidence that synchronous hatching is detrimental for the survival of the nestlings, especially in the late hatching broods. Our study is the first to show, to our knowledge, that timing of the onset of incubation varies across individuals. In combination with the here documented selection on HA implies that timing of the onset of incubation may evolve. We discuss issues for future work concerned with HA.

50|$|The <b>Ural</b> <b>owl</b> has an {{extended}} distribution area in Europe and Asia, from Sakhalin, Japan and Korea {{in the east}} to Scandinavia in the west.

50|$|This species {{measures}} 45 to 65 cm {{in length}} and spans 112 to 135 cm across the wings. Unlike in {{a vast majority of}} owl species, the male is slightly larger than the female on average. Most owls and raptors have reverse sexual dimorphism (RSD) whereas the powerful owl is considered to have normal sexual dimorphism (NSD) as do a majority of living (non-raptorial) birds. Body mass in males have been reported at 0.99 to 2.22 kg, with 13 males averaging 1.45 kg, while females can weigh from 1.04 to 1.6 kg, with an average in 9 females of 1.25 kg. Among all the owls in the world, the powerful owl is the ninth longest from bill-to-tail, the tenth heaviest and the eighth longest winged. Its body mass is about the same on average as the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus) but has a proportionately much longer tail and wings than that species. The wing chord length further illustrates slight sexual dimorphism in favor of the male, with the male measuring 397 to 434 mm and the female measuring 381 to 410 mm. The tail can be 280 mm or more in length, the fifth longest of any owl with only the great grey (Strix nebulosa) and <b>ural</b> <b>owls</b> (Strix uralensis) having proportionately longer tails. As a relatively geographically restricted species, there are no subspecies and no known geographic variation in the powerful owl. In comparison to the barking owl (Ninox connivens) it is much larger and lacks that species' white-spotted smoky-brown coloration on the upperparts and dark grey to rusty streaks on a whitish background on the underside. The other larger and relatively powerful owl found in Australia, the rufous owl, is not found in the same range in the wild so poses no identification problem.|$|R
5000|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl {{is largely}} nocturnal in {{activity}}, as are most owl species, with its activity focused {{in the first}} few hours after sunset and the last few hours before sunrise. In the northern stretches of its range, partial diurnal behaviour has been recorded, including active hunting in broad daylight during the late afternoon. In such areas, full nightfall is essentially non-existent at the peak of summer, so eagle-owls must presumably hunt and actively brood at the nest during daylight. The Eurasian eagle-owl has a number of vocalizations that are used at different times. It will usually select obvious topographic features such as rocky pinnacles, stark ridges and mountain peaks to use as regular song posts. These are dotted along the other edges of the eagle-owl’s territory and they are visited often but only for a few minutes at a time. Vocal activity is almost entirely confined to the colder months from late fall through winter, with vocal activity in October through December mainly having territorial purposes and from January to February being primarily oriented towards courtship and mating purposes. The territorial song, which can be heard at great distance, is a deep resonant ooh-hu with emphasis on the first syllable for the male, and a more high-pitched and slightly more drawn-out uh-hu for the female. It is not uncommon for a pair to perform an antiphonal duet. The widely used name in Germany as well as some other sections of Europe for this species is uhu due to its song. At 250-350 Hz, the Eurasian eagle-owls territorial song or call is deeper, farther-carrying and is often considering [...] "more impressive" [...] than the territorial songs of the great horned owl or even that of the slightly larger Blakiston’s fish owl, although the horned owl’s call averages slightly longer in duration. Other calls include a rather faint, laughter-like OO-OO-oo and a harsh kveck-kveck. Intruding eagle-owls and other potential dangers may be met with a [...] "terrifying", extremely loud hooo. Raucous barks not unlike those of <b>ural</b> <b>owls</b> or long-eared owls have been recorded but are deeper and more powerful than those species’ barks. Annoyance at close quarters is expressed by bill-clicking and cat-like spitting, and a defensive posture involves lowering the head, ruffling the back feathers, fanning the tail and spreading the wings.|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{success for}} {{specialist}} avian predators in northern Fennoscandia is {{highly dependent on}} cyclic vole populations. The 3 - 4 year high amplitude vole cycles once regular to this region have shown significant long term declines in abundance since the 1970 s. The vole decline in Sweden, detected by the National Environmental Monitoring Program, is suggested to have negative consequences on breeding performance for specialist raptors. Complete, long term monitoring data to show this on particularly northern owls are scarce. I compared Tengmalm’s owl to the European kestrel, an increasing generalist, in northern Sweden, and used these as model species for comparing with other northern raptors. Diet compilation for 15 raptors revealed the snowy, great grey, hawk, long and short-eared owls are also small mammal specialists and were placed together with Tengmalm’s owl in an ‘owl’ predator category; the hen harrier, common buzzard, kestrel, and eagle, tawny, <b>Ural,</b> and pygmy <b>owls</b> are generalists and were placed in a ‘kestrel’ predator category; and the rough-legged buzzard is an intermediate placed in a combined owl/kestrel category. I predicted trends for species based on degree of small mammal specialization and model predator category. I suggested those in the owl category should decline, those in the kestrel category should not decline, and rough-legged buzzard should probably decline. Population data for raptors from Sweden, including migration counts from Falsterbo and breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl and kestrel in Västerbotten County, were analyzed against the spring and previous autumn vole food supply indices from Västerbotten County. Migration counts of the common and rough-legged buzzards showed a significant positive relationship with the spring vole index. Breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl and kestrel showed significant positive relationships with the previous autumn vole index (and also spring for Tengmalm’s owl), while mean annual brood size for kestrels was only dependent on the spring vole index. For species with data available from Sweden, only the kestrel showed an increasing population trend. However, breeding density of Tengmalm’s owl, a vole specialist, has declined in northern Sweden since the 1980 s. The specialists placed in the owl category are predicted show similar patterns as Tengmalm’s owl and {{are the most likely}} species that have been {{and will continue to be}} adversely affected by significant declines in vole abundance...|$|R

It nests in hollow tree trunks, occasionally in old raptor nests, and increasingly in nestboxes. It normally lays two to four eggs, which hatch after 27-34 days. The young leave the nest after about four weeks, but will not fly until about six weeks old. It is a very aggressive owl, chasing other birds of prey from its territory, and it will attack human intruders, especially when young are present.|$|E
