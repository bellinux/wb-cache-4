40|$|The {{increasing}} numbers of <b>undocumented</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in South Africa not only has affected the provision of services provided by the local municipalities and the Department of Home Affairs but is also a huge challenge to the services provided by the South African police. The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the police experiences of dealing with <b>undocumented</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in South Africa. A literature review was conducted to provide an overview of this problem nationally and internationally. Interviews, observations and document analysis were also considered to explore police experiences of dealing with <b>undocumented</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals.</b> The findings of this study show that the South African police are “caught between a rock and a hard place” when dealing with <b>undocumented</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> within the constitutional framework of this country. They receive little support from the government and the relevant stakeholders on this matter, while on the other hand they are exposed to constant threats and lack of compliance from the <b>undocumented</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> and the criminal syndicates that facilitate illegal cross-border movements and the pressure from advocates of human rights principles and the media. These factors lead to increased frustrations among police officials and self-protective measures such as turning a blind eye to this problem. To deal with the problem the Inclusive and Interactive Refugee Management Model, which focuses on constant interaction among stakeholders, is recommended. Inclusive strategies are also recommended for dealing with <b>undocumented</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals.</b> This model supports a Left Realism perspective, which advocates collective responsibility towards human concernsPolice PracticeD.

50|$|In the {{agriculture}} sector, {{the most common}} victims of trafficking are U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, <b>undocumented</b> immigrants, and <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> with temporary H-2A visas. Due {{to the nature of}} agricultural work as being seasonal and transient, the ability of employers to exploit these workers is high. Such exploitation may take the form of threats of violence and playing on vulnerabilities (i.e. immigration status). In some cases, workers are held in a state of perpetual debt to the crew leaders who impose mandatory transportation, housing and communication fees upon the workers which are high in relation to pay received, therefore further indebting the worker. Crew leaders may also provide workers with H-2A visas and transportation to the place of work from a home country.|$|R

40|$|This {{briefing}} {{looks at}} the startling increase {{over the last decade}} in the number of <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners and highlights their conditions and inconsistent treatment.

The Prison Service should implement a policy on <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> that sets out a coherent strategy to improve their predicament. Key Facts and Figures ■ There are 8, 937 <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners (defined as anyone without a UK passport), about one in eight ■ (12 per cent) of the overall prison population. One in five women in prison are <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals.</b> ■ They come from 168 countries, but over half are from just six countries (Jamaica, Irish Republic, Nigeria, ■ Pakistan, Turkey and India). A quarter are Jamaicans, by far, the largest single group. ■ There has been a 152 per cent increase in <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners {{in the last ten years}} compared to a 55 ■ ■ per cent increase in British nationals. ■ In two prisons, the Verne in Dorset and the women’s prison Morton Hall in Lincolnshire, <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> ■ make up half or more of the population. In sixteen prisons they make up a quarter or more. ■ Despite their number the Prison Service does not have a dedicated policy or strategy to deal with <b>foreign</b> ■ <b>national</b> prisoners. ■ A recent Prison Service survey found that nearly 90 per cent of prisons holding <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> are not ■ making regular use of the available translation service. ■ The vast majority of <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> prisoners, four out of ten sentenced men and eight out of ten ■ sentenced women, have committed drug offences, mainly drug trafficking.

40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} decade, {{the number of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in Spain has increased. Our aim was to report the trends in {{hospital}} admissions, differentiating between <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from high-income countries (HICs) and from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in a public hospital. A retrospective analysis of hospital admissions in patients aged ⩾ 15 years between 2000 and 2012 was performed by means of hospital information systems at a public hospital {{in the city of}} Alicante, Spain. During the period of the study, 387, 862 patients were admitted: 32, 020 (8. 3 %) were foreign, 22, 446 (5. 8 %) were from LMICs, and 9574 (2. 5 %) were from HICs. The number of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs, and <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from HICs admitted increased from 1019, 530, and 489 in 2000 to 2925, 2097, and 828, respectively in 2012. A total of 27. 5 % of patients were admitted for pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium, especially <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs (34. 3 %), and 14. 1 % of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> were admitted for cardiovascular diseases (14. 1 %), which were more common in those from HICs (26. 3 %). The number of admissions among <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs increased significantly in all the diagnoses, but in pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium, the increase was higher. In conclusion, nearly one out of 10 adult patients admitted to our hospital was foreign, mainly from LMICs, and the main reason for admission was diagnoses related to pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} of blaming foreigners for crime problems in England and Wales. The contemporary manifestation of this centres on suspicion about the involvement in crime of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> and irregular migrants. General descriptive terms like <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> encompass people in widely diverse circumstances and of different legal immigration statuses. Debates about crime and about the management of movement across national borders have become entangled in political debate, to the detriment of clear thinking about either matter. The rehabilitation principle has a different significance and application for <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> in practice if not in law. The limited statistics available concerning the involvement of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in crime and their treatment by judicial and criminal justice agencies, require more analysis. In criminal justice and sentencing, there are no formal requirements for agencies and courts to bring different principles to their decisions about <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> but in practice this group of offenders can be disadvantaged. The context of offending by <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> and their distinctive and individual needs are often insufficiently appreciated and too little is done to support rehabilitation and desistance. The perceived political imperative to remove <b>foreign</b> <b>national</b> offenders by deportation distorts any principled approach to policy and practice...|$|R
