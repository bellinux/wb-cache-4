25|$|Although the park's terrain {{may appear}} rugged and durable, it is {{extremely}} fragile. More than 1 million visitors each year threaten the fragile high desert ecosystem. The problem lies within the soil's crust which is composed of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, and lichens that grow in the dusty parts of the park. Factors that make Arches National Park sensitive to visitor damage include: semiarid region, and the scarce, unpredictable rainfall, lack of deep freezing, and lack of plant litter which results in soils that have both a low resistance to, and slow recovery from, compressional forces such as foot traffic. Methods of indicating effects on the soil are cytophobic soil crust index, measuring of water infiltration, and t-tests that are <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> values from the undisturbed and disturbed areas.|$|E
25|$|Anger treatments' {{success rates}} can be {{difficult}} to estimate because excessive, severe anger is not a recognized disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. This manual is used as a reference for mental health professionals. Some research does exist on comparing various treatments for anger, but they also describe methodological difficulties in making accurate comparisons. The most concrete evidence for anger treatment is that multiple techniques have proven to be more successful than a single technique. The relaxation approach had the highest success rate as a standalone treatment. The effectiveness of the CBT-based anger management therapies has been evaluated by a number of meta-analyses. In a 1998 meta-analysis with 50 studies and 1640 individuals, measures of anger and aggression were <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> effects of the anger management intervention with no treatment. A significant effect for anger management was found with a 67% chance of improvement for individuals having received the anger management as compared to the individuals without the therapy. In addition, a 2009 meta-analysis compared psychological treatments for anger across 96 studies. After an average of 8 sessions, a significant improvement in anger reduction resulted. Overall, the completion of an anger management program is likely to result in long lasting positive changes in behavior. Successful interventions can result in not only a reduction of the outward display of aggression, but also a decrease in the internal level of anger.|$|E
25|$|In Fascist Italy in the 1930s, aviation-themed {{films were}} used as {{propaganda}} tools to complement the massed flights led by Italo Balbo in promoting the regime domestically and abroad. One such film was the most successful Italian film of the pre-World War II era; Luciano Serra pilota (Luciano Serra, Pilot) was inextricably linked to the Fascist government via Mussolini's son Vittorio, who was {{the driving force behind}} the film's production. The film, set between 1921 and the Italo-Abyssinian War, was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>compare</b> <b>the</b> allegedly moribund state of aviation in pre-Fascist Italy with the purported power of the Regia Aeronautica and Italian aviation in general in the 1930s. However, by the time that Luciano Serra pilota was shown at the 1938 Venice Film Festival, the link between aviation and Fascism had already been firmly established in the minds of the Italian people through widespread depictions of aircraft in a variety of media. For example, there was an entire branch of the Futurist Art movement devoted to aviation, known as Aeropittura ("Aeropainting"). While many of the Aeropittura works were devoted to flight rather than aircraft per se, some did celebrate Italian aviation exploits, such as Alfredo Ambrosi's Il volo su Vienna (The Flight over Vienna) which depicted in Futurist style the World War I exploit of Gabriele d'Annunzio; although the city of Vienna is shown in abstract in accordance with the aims of Aeropittura – namely to show the dynamism and excitement of flight – the Ansaldo SVA aircraft are very carefully and accurately rendered.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficiency and}} complications of single lacrimal duct intubation versus annular lacrimal duct intubation with 5 -fluorouracil and tobramycin/dexamethasone eye ointment injection in lacrimal duct obstruction treatment. METHODS:A total of 74 patients(92 eyes) with lacrimal duct obstruction who received surgical treatment by Department of Ophthalmology in Qinhuangdao Haigang Hospital were consecutively recruited between August 2015 and September 2016. They were randomly allocated to Group A or Group B. After probing of lacrimal passage, Group A(46 eyes) were treated by using single lacrimal duct intubation. Group B(46 eyes) were treated by using annular lacrimal duct intubation combined with 5 -fluorouracil and tobramycin/dexamethasone eye ointment injection. Between the two groups, Mann-Whitney Rank sum test was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> operative effect, and Chi-square test was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>comparing</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of complications.
