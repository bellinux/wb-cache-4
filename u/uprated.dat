40|$|In recent years, <b>uprating</b> of {{existing}} {{overhead power line}} has become a popular option for electric utilities to address increasing demand for power. <b>Uprating</b> overhead line by increasing voltage allows considerable increase in power transfer capability. This paper initially examines technical issues and conventional methods of <b>uprating</b> the voltage of overhead transmission lines. It then considers a case {{of existing}} 275 kV line in L 3 tower to analyse these issues and propose appropriate process for its possible <b>uprating</b> to 400 kV system. In this case, phase-to-earth clearance {{was found to be}} a key issue for voltage <b>uprating.</b> Application of line surge arresters along the line was proposed for controlling overvoltage thereby reducing the minimum required clearance for 400 kV syste...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Constraints {{to power}} {{transfer}} {{in the network}} may limit the load that can be supported by the transmission lines. To overcome these constraints various current <b>uprating</b> methods can be used.

40|$|Voltage <b>uprating</b> is a {{reliable}} method {{for increasing the}} power transfer capability of an existing overhead line. It is essential to meet the primary air clearance requirements for power frequency, switching and lightning overvoltages while evaluating the suitability to <b>uprate</b> the line to a higher voltage level. In this paper, a method is discussed to establish the necessary clearance envelopes for power frequency, switching and lightning overvoltages. The results are based on {{an investigation into the}} clearance requirements for IEC- 60071. A case study based on <b>uprating</b> a 275 kV overhead line with L 3 towers design to 400 kV is presented. Finally, issues and opportunities associated with <b>uprating</b> the L 3 tower to 400 kV are explored...|$|R
5|$|Six of {{the eight}} {{surviving}} evaluation aircraft (the three allocated to the U.S. plus those allocated to Germany) were transferred to the U.S. for evaluation by the Army, Air Force, and Navy as the XV-6A Kestrel. After Tri-Service evaluation they were passed to the USAF for further evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base, except for two that were assigned to NASA.

5|$|The Tupolev OKB {{began work}} in September 1946 on a {{military}} transport version of the Tupolev Tu-70 airliner and this was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947 with state trials to begin in August 1948. To expedite the process, maximum use was made of components of the Tu-70. Its engines were the <b>uprated</b> Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear cargo hatch, a vehicle loading ramp and paratroop exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator).|$|E

40|$|Reactor {{thermal power}} <b>uprate</b> (Power <b>uprate)</b> of {{operating}} light water reactors has long successful experiences in many {{nuclear power plants}} in the United States of America and European countries since late 1970 ’s.

40|$|The {{economic}} incentives for low-cost electricity generation {{will continue to}} drive more plant owners to identify safe and reliable methods to increase the electrical power output of the current nuclear power plant fleet. A power <b>uprate</b> enables {{a nuclear power plant}} to increase its electrical output with low cost. However, power <b>uprates</b> brought new challenges to plant owners and operators. These include equipment damage or degraded performance, and unanticipated responses to plant conditions, etc. These problems have arisen mainly from using dated design and safety analysis tools and insufficient understanding of the full implications of the proposed power <b>uprate</b> or from insufficient attention to detail during the design and implementation phase. It is essential to demonstrate that all required safety margins have been properly retained and the existing safety level has been maintained or even increased, with consideration of all the conditions and parameters that have an influence on plant safety. The impact of the power <b>uprate</b> on plant life management for long term operation is also an important issue. Significant capital investments are required to extend the lifetime of an aging nuclear power plant. Power <b>uprates</b> can help the plant owner to recover the investment costs. However, plant aging issues may be aggravated by the power <b>uprate</b> due to plant conditions. More rigorous analyses, inspections and monitoring systems are required...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- Advances in materials, cooling {{technology}} and design techniques have allowed MS 7001 turbines {{to be operated}} with higher firing temperatures and airflows, which result in higher turbine output and efficiency. Improvements in combustion technology have also made significantly lower emission levels a reality. Advanced design technology is usually introduced for new unit production and subsequently applied to customer-operated gas turbines by a gas turbine <b>uprate</b> program. Many new <b>uprate</b> programs have been introduced for installed GEdesigned heavy duty gas turbines, including the MS 7001 A, B, C, E, and EA models. Each <b>uprate</b> program provides increased output, improved heat rate and efficiency, improved reliability, reduced maintenance costs, longer inspection intervals, and longer expected parts lives. Additional benefits result because <b>uprates</b> are based on current production components parts that are not specifically unique to older machines and thus readily available.
