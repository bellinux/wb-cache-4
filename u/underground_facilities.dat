5|$|In the game's single-player mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} {{a series of}} levels where different types of AI-controlled enemies will try to hinder the player's progress. The game primarily takes place inside labyrinthine <b>underground</b> <b>facilities,</b> but the player can occasionally travel {{over the surface of}} the planets where the facilities are buried to reach other nearby areas. The <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> are composed of a set of tunnels and rooms separated by doors. Most of them can be opened by either firing weapons at them or bumping into them, but others require special actions to be performed first before entry is allowed. For instance, some doors require special keys to open them. To finish a level and proceed to the next one, the player must complete a certain set of objectives, ranging from collecting items to activating switches, defeating enemies, and destroying objects, among others. Some levels also feature optional objectives that are not critical but add to the player's overall completion score.|$|E
5|$|Like other London termini, steam trains were {{phased out}} of Victoria by the 1960s, to be {{replaced}} by suburban electric and Diesel Multiple Unit services. Despite the end of international services following the opening of the Channel Tunnel, Victoria still remains an important London station, and its <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> in particular suffer from overcrowding. The Gatwick Express service provides easy access between Central London and Gatwick Airport for international travellers.|$|E
5|$|In {{neutrino}} astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III for {{the detection}} of neutrinos. The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A. Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories. Some future neutrino detectors may also be sensitive to the particles produced when cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Underground</b> Ammunition <b>Facility</b> is an {{ammunition}} depot in Singapore. It is the world's first large-scale <b>underground</b> containerised <b>facility</b> to {{be designed}} and developed within a densely developed urban area. This <b>underground</b> <b>facility</b> for storing ammunition requires 90% less land to be sterilised when compared with a traditional above-ground ammunition depot of similar capabilities.|$|R

25|$|After the war, Kerfent's combat blocks {{were mostly}} left in their damaged state, but the <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> were cleaned and maintained. From 1958 to 1961, prior to France's {{withdrawal}} from the NATO integrated command structure in the mid-1960s, Kerfent's <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> and open surface areas were used by the Canadian 601st Communications Squadron as a communications center, supporting RCAF Station Grostenquin. A microwave antenna was erected on Block 2. By 1970, Kerfent was listed for disposal, and was acquired by the commune of Zimming. The military antenna {{was replaced by a}} civil television antenna.|$|E
25|$|It {{can detect}} {{specific}} types of foliage supporting drug-crop identification; disturbed soil supporting the identification of mass graves, minefields, caches, <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> or cut foliage; and variances in soil, foliage, and hydrologic features often supporting NBC contaminant detection. This was done previously with false-color infrared photographic film, but electronics are faster and more flexible.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most parts}} of its borough, Ewell has {{telephone}} numbers using the London 020 area code. Ewell also has an unusually large telephone exchange, beside The Spring pub, fitted with <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> designed to survive a nuclear conflict during the late years of the Cold War. It was transferred in 2000 from the Metropolitan Police, in whose district it had been placed since 1839, to the jurisdiction of Surrey Police.|$|E

These centers are the Americas Center, the Asia/Pacific Center, the Europe/Eurasia Center, the Middle East/Africa Center, and the Defense Combating Terrorism Center. DIA also manages Community-wide centers such as the National Center for Medical Intelligence, the Missile and Space Intelligence Center, the National Media Exploitation Center, and the <b>Underground</b> <b>Facilities</b> Analysis Center (UFAC).|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, indoor maps {{were added}} to Google Maps for Android, giving users the ability to {{navigate}} themselves within buildings such as airports, museums, shopping malls, big-box stores, universities, transit stations, and other public spaces (including <b>underground</b> <b>facilities).</b> In July 2013, a revised version of Google Maps added support for Apple iOS devices, including iPads and iPhones. Google encourages owners of public facilities to submit floor plans of their buildings in order to add them to the service. Map users can view different floors of a building or subway station by clicking on a level selector that is displayed near any structures which are mapped on multiple levels.|$|E
25|$|Given the {{existing}} facilities and the site's strategic importance, {{the site was}} selected for a Maginot ouvrage in 1926. Work began in 1931, abandoning {{some of the older}} work and creating new <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> to the Maginot Line standard. A gallery connected the new position to the Séré de Rivières works. Work stopped in July 1935 {{as a result of the}} Stresa Front agreement with Italy, but restarted in 1938 as relations with Italy and Germany deteriorated. The cost of the new work amounted to 10.3 million francs (not including armament). When the position was occupied in 1938, numerous deficiencies in heat, ventilation and optical sighting equipment were uncovered.|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} was considered impracticable due to rising passenger {{figures in the}} 19th century, so plans were laid out as early as 1866. At first, a large scale station with up to 34 platforms was considered, then the number got reduced to 18. Post and baggage handlings had their own <b>underground</b> <b>facilities,</b> and the city council demanded the station to be moved further away from the city. In the end, in 1881, the German architect Hermann Eggert won the design contest for the station hall, his runner-up in the contest, Johann Wilhelm Schwedler was made chief engineer for the steel-related works. The new station was placed about 1km {{to the west of}} the first three stations. The platforms were covered by three iron-and-glass halls.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Kerfent's combat blocks {{were mostly}} left in their damaged state, but the <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> were cleaned and maintained. From 1958 to 1961, prior to France's {{withdrawal}} from the NATO integrated command structure in the mid-1960s, Kerfent's underground portions and open surface areas were used by the Canadian 601st Communications Squadron as a communications center, supporting RCAF Station Grostenquin. A microwave antenna was erected on Block 2. By 1970, Kerfent was listed for disposal, and was acquired by the commune of Zimming. The military antenna {{was replaced by a}} civil television antenna. Bambesch was stabilized after the war by military engineers and was acquired by the community of Bambiderstroff. The site was opened to the public on 31 August 1973. Einseling, Téting and Laudrefang were in poor condition and were not chosen for renovation.|$|E
500|$|The {{government}} {{said that the}} in-situ preservation, though apparently viable on paper, would risk irreversible damage to the pier. Furthermore, it argued that important <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> such as the Airport Railway Extended Overrun Tunnel would be affected, saying a natural curvature of the track was required. [...] "Setting aside the technical difficulties and the huge risk involved in the works, underpinning {{for the construction of}} the extended overrun tunnel would cost about HK$500 million and take more than two years to complete".|$|E

500|$|The ten-corner {{track is}} [...] long and was {{designed}} by Rodrigo Nunes. It was constructed in eight days and was completed on the Friday before the event because the local authorities denied permission for the streets to be closed to traffic before that day. US$2.6 million (HK$20 million) was spent on relocating street lighting and cutting down trees, lowering <b>underground</b> <b>facilities</b> covers and converting existing roadside infrastructure. The circuit received positive feedback from drivers. Ma called the track [...] "very exciting" [...] and felt that the race would see {{a large amount of}} overtaking manoevures. Rosenqvist felt the track appeared [...] "incredible" [...] which went beyond his expectations. It reminded him more of race circuits in the United States than Macau and noted that the track was bumpy. However, concerns were raised over the turn three chicane which had no kerbs or any visible markings. Heidfeld felt there was an risk of a driver crashing his car in the area with António Félix da Costa backing up the latter's view and stated that tyres needed to be installed along with observation of the turn's run-off area.|$|E
