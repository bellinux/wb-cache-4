5000|$|While the Citizens Theatre {{building}} retains some of {{the original}} Victorian architectural features, it has undergone additional renovations and expansions over the years. It now includes the 500-seat main auditorium, and two studio theatres. The main auditorium contains the original (1878) proscenium arch stage, which is raked (slopes down towards the auditorium); it has three seating levels: the stalls, the dress circle and the upper circle (or [...] "gods"). The building contains the oldest original (1878) working <b>understage</b> <b>machinery</b> and paint frame in a working theatre in the United Kingdom. The paint frame is still used for scenic painting and its original glass roof remains.|$|E
