5|$|Kauri gum {{was used}} commercially in varnish, {{and can be}} {{considered}} a type of copal (the name given to resin used in such a way). Kauri gum was found to be particularly good for this, and from the mid-1840s was exported to London and America. Tentative exports had begun a few years earlier, however, for use in marine glue and as fire-kindlers; gum had even made <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an export cargo to Australia in 1814.|$|E
5|$|The Royalist {{commander}} of the castle, William Edgecumbe, retreated from the castle on 19 April and the defenders blew <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the site as they left, leaving the remains to the Parliamentary commander Colonel George Fleetwood. Some of the castle's stonework {{appears to have been}} reused {{in the construction of the}} new Cromwell's Castle by the Parliamentarians, just beneath King Charles's Castle, the new fortification being sited in a much better position to defend the harbour.|$|E

5|$|The {{specimen}} NIGP127587 was preserved {{with the}} remains of a lizard in its gut region, indicating that small, fast-moving animals made <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the diet of Sinosauropteryx prima. Numerous lizards of this type have been found in the same rocks as Sinosauropteryx. These lizards have been interpreted as most likely belonging to the genus Dalinghosaurus. Dalinghosaurus was probably a fast-running lizard adapted to living in open habitats, much like Sinosauropteryx itself.|$|E
5|$|The terete leaves readily {{distinguish}} Isopogon anethifolius {{from other}} members of the genus, which have flat leaves and are greater than 1mm (in) across. On a microscopic level, the supporting ground tissue of I.anethifolius differs from some of its genus by its irregular misshapen sclereids (thick-walled cells that make <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the ground tissue) and contorted cell body.|$|E

5|$|Although {{above the}} horizon and hence visible to the Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any ancient constellations. The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the classical depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|CR106 {{originated}} in 1824, when {{the road was}} chartered for the New Turnpike and headed from Monroe to Haverstraw. Back in the 1820s, what is now Southfields was known as Monroe. The New Turnpike started at a nail factory in Monroe to a crossing over the Ramapo River, and progressed eastward, passing Lake Stahahe (then known as Car Pond). The turnpike continued eastward, meeting the Old Turnpike at {{a fork in the}} road. At the fork, part of the road became NY210 in the 1930 New York State Route renumbering. In 1910, when the park opened, the road became known as the Southfields Road. Three years later, it became part of the Seven Lakes Drive. Three more years later, the route became known as County Highway416. In 1919 and 1920, the western section of the road was reconstructed. After a bridge was built to cross a river in 1923, a new route, making <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the original Warwick Turnpike, became NY17A.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages tales {{originating}} from Brythonic traditions entered English folklore—the Arthurian myth. These {{were derived from}} Anglo-Norman, Welsh and French sources, featuring King Arthur, Camelot, Excalibur, Merlin and the Knights of the Round Table such as Lancelot. These stories are most centrally brought together within Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae (History of the Kings of Britain). Another early figure from British tradition, King Cole, may {{have been based on}} a real figure from Sub-Roman Britain. Many of the tales and pseudo-histories make <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the wider Matter of Britain, a collection of shared British folklore.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{surrender}} of the High Seas Fleet {{at the end of}} the war, Princess Royal and the 1st BCS made <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the guard force in Scapa Flow. Princess Royal was reassigned to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1919. The battlecruiser was placed in reserve in 1920, and an attempt to sell her to Chile later that year was unsuccessful. She became the flagship of the Commander-in-Chief of the Scottish Coast on 22 February 1922. She was sold for scrap in December 1922 to meet the tonnage limitations set on the Royal Navy by the Washington Naval Treaty, and arrived at the breakers on 13 August 1923.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs listed Germany as host to {{the second-highest}} number of {{international}} migrants worldwide, about 5% or 12million of all 244million migrants. Germany ranks 7th amongst EU countries and 37th globally {{in terms of the}} per centage of migrants who made <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the country's population. , the largest national group was from Turkey (2,859,000), followed by Poland (1,617,000), Russia (1,188,000), and Italy (764,000). 740,000 people have African origins, an increase of 46% since 2011. Since 1987, around 3million ethnic Germans, mostly from the former Eastern Bloc countries, have exercised their right of return and emigrated to Germany.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus, {{best known}} through L. lambei, was {{quite similar to}} Corythosaurus in {{everything}} but {{the form of the}} head adornment. Compared to Corythosaurus, the crest of Lambeosaurus was shifted forward, and the hollow nasal passages within were {{at the front of the}} crest and stacked vertically. It also can be differentiated from Corythosaurus by its lack of forking nasal processes making <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the sides of the crest, which is the only way to tell juveniles of the two genera apart, as the crests took on their distinctive forms as the animals aged.|$|E

5|$|NY414 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY352 (Denison Parkway) in the Steuben County city of Corning. It initially heads north on Cedar Street, following it past two largely commercial blocks that make <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the Market Street Historic District. Past the district, the route changes names to Centerway and crosses over the Chemung River, which flows east–west {{through the center}} of Corning. Across the river, the route traverses more commercial neighborhoods to reach Pulteney Street, designated as NY415 west of this point. Along this stretch, NY414 passes the former Corning Armory and the Corning Museum of Glass, the latter located on the southwest corner of the junction with NY415.|$|E
5|$|Rice, pasta, and potato-based foods (french {{fries and}} mashed potato) also make <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Zimbabwean cuisine. A local {{favourite}} is rice cooked with peanut butter, which is taken with thick gravy, mixed vegetables and meat. A potpourri of peanuts known as nzungu, boiled and sundried maize, black-eyed peas known as nyemba, and bambara groundnuts known as nyimo makes a traditional dish called mutakura. Mutakura {{can also be}} the above ingredients cooked individually. One can also find local snacks, such as maputi (roasted/popped maize kernels similar to popcorn), roasted and salted peanuts, sugar cane, sweet potato, pumpkin, and indigenous fruits, such as horned melon, gaka, adansonia, mawuyu, uapaca kirkiana, mazhanje (sugar plum), and many others.|$|E
5|$|Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen {{ignored the}} {{confusion}} {{as their own}} troops struggled in the wheeling pivot. From their vantage point, it appeared to the Allied commanders that the Prussians were moving eastward; Soubise and Saxe-Hildburghausen presumed that the Prussians were about to retreat {{in order to avoid}} being taken in their flank and rear. The Allied generals hurried the march, sending on the leading (right wing) cavalry towards Reichardtswerben. They also called <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the left wing cavalry from the tail of the column and even the flank guard cavalry to take part in what they presumed would be the general chase. Any semblance of the wheeling pivot was lost in these fresh maneuvers, and the remaining columns lost all cohesion and order.|$|E
50|$|Block Mountain is a {{mountain}} {{located in the}} Sawback Range in Alberta. It was named so in 1958 because vertical fractures, which make <b>up</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the mountain, look like they are composed of giant blocks.|$|R

5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached {{a position on the}} open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery gun from a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E
5|$|The nasals make {{up most of}} the crest. Brown {{assumed that}} they {{extended}} from the beaks' tip to the highest spot along the crest and that, unlike those in other genera, the nasals meet in the centre and are not separated in front by an ascending premaxillary process. Brown however, mistook the praemaxillae for the nasals; the snout is actually largely formed by them and they do separate the nasals. Brown also thought that on the top and back of the crest, the whole external face is covered by the frontals. Again he made a mistake: what he assumed to be the frontals are in fact the nasals. The nasals end {{at the back of the}} squamosals in a hooked, short process. The prefrontals also make <b>up</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the crest; however, Brown mistook the lower upper branch of the praemaxilla for the prefrontal. The actual prefrontal, triangular in shape, is located at the side of the crest base; it was by Brown seen as a part of the frontal. The real frontals, largely internal to the crest base structure, are not visible from the side.|$|E
