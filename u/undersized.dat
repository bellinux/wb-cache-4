5|$|There {{is little}} {{development}} within the main canyon, although the El Toro Creek area is primarily residential. There is also some {{residential and commercial}} development downstream of State Route 73. The concrete channel {{in this area is}} small and <b>undersized</b> for major floods, which caused it to overflow in the late 1990s and again in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Whitlock had a {{standout}} high school career at Wylie High School, earning AP Defensive Player of the Year honors in 2008. After playing defensive tackle and linebacker throughout {{high school and}} college, the <b>undersized</b> Whitlock switched to fullback in the NFL. He won the starting fullback job for the Giants in 2015 after strong special teams work in the pre-season.|$|E
5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even {{under normal}} circumstances, {{the mix of}} carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the <b>undersized</b> alleys was subject to frequent traffic jams and gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.|$|E
5|$|As {{a senior}} Pressey earned TABC All-state {{recognition}} and Dallas Morning News first team All-area recognition. The All-area team included Perry Jones, Le'Bryan Nash, Marcus Smart and Kyan Anderson. During the 2010 SPC championship game, Pressey tallied 32 points, 9 assists, 8 rebounds and 3 steals against Greenhill School. Videos of him dunking {{in high school}} have made him a YouTube sensation. During the 2010 TABC All-star game, he dunked over Tony Mitchell, {{who at the time}} was a player approximately a foot taller than Pressey. , this video has about 800,000 views. Because of his diminutive stature, he is often compared to another <b>undersized</b> Dallas basketball player, Spud Webb.|$|E
5|$|Barkley also possessed {{considerable}} defensive talents led by {{an aggressive}} demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position {{and leader of the}} highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being <b>undersized</b> for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability {{made him one of the}} few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block.|$|E
5|$|Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although {{he played}} {{football}} as a child, Brown was <b>undersized</b> {{for the game}} at less than 150 pounds and at first focused his athletic energies on the pole vault. Harry Stuhldreher, {{who went on to}} be one of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen, was then the high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown's determination to be a good vaulter despite his small size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took over as the starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win-loss record of 15â€“3 in Brown's junior and senior years as the starter.|$|E
5|$|The Wytheville Raid or Toland's Raid (July 18, 1863) was {{an attack}} by an <b>undersized</b> Union brigade on a Confederate town during the American Civil War. Union Colonel John Toland led a brigade of over 800 men against a Confederate force of about 130 {{soldiers}} and 120 civilians. Wytheville, the county seat of Wythe County in southwestern Virginia, had strategic importance because of a nearby lead mine and the railroad that served it. The mine supplied the lead for about {{one third of the}} Confederate Army's bullets. The Virginia & Tennessee Railroad transported Confederate troops and supplies, and telegraph wires along the railroad line were vital for communications. In addition to moving the lead to bullet manufacturing facilities, the railroad also served an important salt works in an adjacent county.|$|E
5|$|According to Newman and Bressett, {{the manner}} in which the 1804 dollars were {{produced}} is proof that none were struck in 1804. They note that the Castaing machine's edging dies utilized an 'H' that was <b>undersized</b> in relation to the other letters, the same as those used on Draped Bust dollars throughout the regular production of those coins. However, the edge lettering on all Class I 1804 dollars is deformed and partially obliterated, meaning that they were not struck in an open-collared coinage press as was used in 1804, but one which used a steel collar that was not introduced to the Mint until 1833. The deformation of the edge lettering was caused by pressure pushing the coinage metal against the steel collar containing the coin blank. Additionally, many 1804 dollars were struck in proof finish, a technique which was first employed at the Mint in 1817.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} caught throughout its habitat, with sand flats, tidal gutters in estuaries and surf beaches commonly having producing good catches. Excessively shallow water, especially in proximity to Zostera beds may produce numerous <b>undersized</b> fish, {{and may be}} avoided if the young fish are too prevalent. Due to their preferred habitat, light lines with minimal weight added are employed to avoid spooking the fish, with a small running bean or ball sinker commonly rigged above a size 4 or 6 hook. Specialist whiting fishermen often use a red piece of tubing or beads to attract the whiting; whether this works {{has yet to be}} proved, but anecdotal evidence shows the fishermen's catches don't suffer. Baits used resemble the species natural prey, with prawns, nippers, a variety of bivalves and beach worms most often used, with more successful catches obtained using live bait.|$|E
5|$|On-set computer-generated {{effects for}} the pilot were done by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because of time and money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse {{for the pilot}}, but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the <b>undersized</b> corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Rod Jones {{was known}} as a hard hitter and a {{world-class}} track star, but was a controversial selection because, coming from the run-heavy Southwest Conference, his pass-coverage skills were unknown. At 5'11", 165lbs., he was considered <b>undersized</b> for the NFL. Jones was the first defensive back selected, but was rated no better than fifth-best by most scouting services. The Buccaneers were criticized for taking linebacker Jackie Walker with their third pick, when Kevin Murphy of the national champion Oklahoma Sooners was still available. The Buccaneers did eventually draft Murphy, who they were surprised to find still available with their 40th overall selection. Murphy was believed to have fallen due to rumors of a knee injury. The Buccaneers had rated both Walker and Murphy among the top 15 players in the draft. Craig Swoope was rated as the best safety in the draft, but fell to the fourth round because of a previous charge (and acquittal) of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Swoope was eventually the only Buccaneer to achieve any kind of postseason honors in 1986, being selected to the Football Digest All-Rookie team. The team went for big offensive linemen in the later rounds. One of them was J.D. Maarleveld, the first cancer patient drafted by the NFL. Maarleveld was considered to have been a second-round talent, but fell {{all the way to the}} fifth round. Belief that Maarleveld was worth much more money than the average fifth-rounder caused his agent, Greg Marotta, to advise him to reject the Buccaneers' offer and sign with the USFL Baltimore Stars. Maarleveld was eventually able to reach agreement with the Buccaneers.|$|E

25|$|Between 1977 and 1983, Hvalur Hf (the Icelandic whaling company {{owned and}} {{operated}} by KristjÃ¡n Loftsson) had taken hundreds of <b>undersized</b> fin and sei whales and exported the meat to Japan, according to an IWC report.|$|E
25|$|Even {{trees were}} thought to be ridden by the mare, {{resulting}} in branches being entangled. The <b>undersized,</b> twisted pine-trees growing on coastal rocks and on wet grounds are known in Sweden as martallar ("mare-pines") or in German as Alptraum-Kiefer ("nightmare pine").|$|E
25|$|At the 1950 general election, Hutchison {{found his}} <b>undersized</b> {{constituency}} expanded to the east, taking in mostly Labour voters, {{but he was}} thought to be in much more difficulty from the abolition of the vote for business premises. Hutchison ended up losing by 3,004 votes.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{has been}} widened several times (the first in 1799 and {{recorded}} works in 1808, 1830 and 1852), but is <b>undersized</b> for modern traffic; {{in several places}} it is scarcely two-lanes and cars are unable to pass at several points. Though there is a weight limit of 7.5 tonnes, {{the walls of the}} bridge often take damage from traffic.|$|E
25|$|Another {{planetary}} nebula in Lyra is Abell 46. The central star, V477 Lyrae, is an eclipsing post-common-envelope binary, {{consisting of a}} white dwarf primary and an oversized secondary component due to recent accretion. The nebula itself is of relatively low surface brightness compared to the central star, and is <b>undersized</b> for the primary's mass for reasons not yet fully understood.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} flowers on a peach tree are {{typically}} thinned out, {{because if the}} full number of peaches mature on a branch, they are <b>undersized</b> and lacking in flavor. Fruits are thinned midway in the season by commercial growers. Fresh peaches are easily bruised, and do not store well. They are most flavorful when they ripen on the tree and are eaten the day of harvest.|$|E
25|$|While {{powerful}} in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks. All used 2 bolt main bearing caps; the oiling system was <b>undersized</b> for high-rpm use (including Stage 1 engines) and thin {{walls in the}} lifter valleys promoted cracking. The magic of the Stage 1, it would seem, was primarily attributable to its advanced (for the period) cylinder heads and the relatively high mid-range horsepower they produced.|$|E
25|$|Bradley Hunt (born August 24, 1988) is a Canadian {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} defenceman currently {{playing for the}} Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously played in the NHL with the Edmonton Oilers, St. Louis Blues and Nashville Predators after beginning his professional career in the American Hockey League (AHL) with the Chicago Wolves, where he was an All-Star in the 2012â€“13 season. He is considered <b>undersized</b> for a defenseman, but has a hard slapshot.|$|E
25|$|Another {{product of}} John Wooden's UCLA program, Bill Walton, {{appeared}} poised {{to join the}} ranks of great centers. He led UCLA to back-to-back NCAA titles in 1972 and 1973, he also led the Portland Trail Blazers to the NBA championship in 1977, and won the NBA MVP the following year. However, his career was plagued with injuries, most infamously a broken bone in his left foot suffered during his MVP season that he never fully recovered from, and he spent most of the following decade on the bench, although he eventually did win a second NBA title as a backup for the Boston Celtics in 1986, when he received the Sixth Man Award. Willis Reed won two championship with the New York Knicks in 1970 and 1973, teamed with Point guard Walt Frazier; although <b>undersized</b> for the center position at 6'9", he had the strength to play inside, was a highly skilled jump shooter, and was effective at setting picks, a key element in the Knicks motion-oriented offense. The <b>undersized</b> but scrappy Dave Cowens, drafted at the recommendation of Bill Russell, helped the Boston Celtics win two more NBA titles, in 1974 and 1976.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{techniques}} may {{be altered}} to minimize bycatch and reduce impacts on marine habitats. These techniques include using varied gear types depending on target species and habitat type. For example, a net with larger holes will allow <b>undersized</b> fish to avoid capture. A turtle excluder device (TED) allows sea turtles and other megafauna {{to escape from}} shrimp trawls. Avoiding fishing in spawning grounds may allow fish stocks to rebuild by giving adults a chance to reproduce.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, Emory {{announced}} that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman, Jr., {{to house the}} university's main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolinaâ€“based Duda Paine Architects. Reasons given for the replacement included inconvenience of food delivery to the dining hall, <b>undersized</b> kitchen facilities, and inadequate fenestration in the Commons.|$|E
25|$|The Army was {{interested}} and awarded Bell a proof-of-concept contract in December 1962. Bell modified a Model 47 into the Model 207 Sioux Scout which first flew in July 1963. The Sioux Scout {{had all the}} key features of a modern attack helicopter: a tandem cockpit, stub wings for weapons, and a chin-mounted gun turret. After evaluating the Sioux Scout in early 1964, the Army was impressed, but also felt the Sioux Scout was <b>undersized,</b> underpowered, and generally not suited for practical use.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{the coins}} issued by any state have always {{reflected}} {{the current political}} or economic situation. Many ancient and pre-modern coins certainly commemorate events in contemporary times. For instance, Roman coins often have references to military campaigns and the defeat of foreign powers. These reverse types often symbolically represent the subordination of recently conquered territories to Roman authority. Such coins are examples of ancient political propaganda. The Roman Empire may be represented by a proud warrior 'raising' an <b>undersized</b> figure, representing the defeated enemy.|$|E
25|$|The {{horizontal}} stabilizers were seemingly <b>undersized,</b> {{and mounted}} {{below the line}} of the wing. The larger vertical fin was supplemented by a ventral fin for high-speed stability. This fin folded to the right, as seen from behind, during takeoff and landing to avoid hitting the ground. Two petal-style air brakes were mounted directly behind the horizontal surfaces, opening out and up at about a 45Â° angle into the gap between the horizontal and vertical surfaces. A provision for a braking parachute is not evident on the mock-up or the various artwork, although this was common for aircraft of the era.|$|E
25|$|The third-generation iPod had a weak bass response, {{as shown}} in audio tests. The {{combination}} of the <b>undersized</b> DC-blocking capacitors and the typical low impedance of most consumer headphones form a high-pass filter, which attenuates the low-frequency bass output. Similar capacitors {{were used in the}} fourth-generation iPods. The problem is reduced when using high-impedance headphones and is completely masked when driving high-impedance (line level) loads, such as an external headphone amplifier. The first-generation iPod Shuffle uses a dual-transistor output stage, rather than a single capacitor-coupled output, and does not exhibit reduced bass response for any load.|$|E
25|$|Applewhite was {{a quarterback}} for the Texas Longhorns from 1998 to 2001. Recruited from Catholic High School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana by then Texas coach John Mackovic, he was later coached by Mack Brown. While at Texas, the <b>undersized</b> Applewhite's tenure was noted both for his often gritty heroics {{as well as his}} battle for playing time with the heralded blue chip recruit Chris Simms, son of New York Giants legend Phil Simms. Applewhite led Texas to two Big 12 Championship games, to victory in 2 Bowl games, and set 48 school records along the way.|$|E
25|$|Auckland Civic Theatre, 1929. Bohringer, Taylor & Johnson architects. 269 Queen St. This {{is one of}} {{the best}} {{remaining}} examples of an atmospheric theatre. The monumental Art Deco stripped-classical facade hides a lavish Hollywood inspired interior. The lobby is a reproduction of an Indian rock temple decorated with 500 elephants. The auditorium is decorated as an open courtyard in ancient Baghdad, the ceiling imitating the night sky with hundreds of electric stars placed as they appear in the southern sky. Extensively renovated in 1994 it is now part of a larger entertainment and retail complex. The renovation fixed several problems including the <b>undersized</b> stage and inadequate backstage facilities.|$|E
25|$|This {{point of}} view argues that {{management}} (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop. Factors cited include the filling of the MIC tanks beyond recommended levels, poor maintenance after the plant ceased MIC production {{at the end of}} 1984, allowing several safety systems to be inoperable due to poor maintenance, and switching off safety systems to save moneyâ€” including the MIC tank refrigeration system which could have mitigated the disaster severity, and non-existent catastrophe management plans. Other factors identified by government inquiries included <b>undersized</b> safety devices and the dependence on manual operations. Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate emergency action plans.|$|E
