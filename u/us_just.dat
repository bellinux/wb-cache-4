500|$|In a mixed {{review of}} the song, Daryl Nelson from The Boombox thought that Azalea seemed [...] "pissed" [...] on the track, and {{questioned}} the over-usage of the term [...] "hater". Jake Rickun, {{a writer for the}} Badger Herald, panned Reclassified. In his review, he described [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] as an ironic statement, [...] "but it’s on 'Heavy Crown,' in a candid moment of irony, where Azalea is most telling. 'Get rid of the makeup let <b>us</b> <b>just</b> see who you is,' she raps. For an Australian-born rapper who denies her roots and sits comfortably in American culture, Azalea seems to forget how much proverbial makeup she cakes on herself".|$|E
500|$|Nine days later, Senator Brien McMahon, who {{within a}} year would write the Atomic Energy Act and {{organize}} and chair the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, made the first public proposal for such a test, but one designed to demonstrate the vulnerability, rather than survivability, of ships. He proposed dropping an atomic bomb on captured Japanese ships and suggested, [...] "The resulting explosion should prove to <b>us</b> <b>just</b> how effective the atomic bomb is when used against the giant naval ships." [...] On September 19, the Chief of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), General of the Army Henry H. Arnold, asked the Navy to set aside ten of the thirty-eight captured Japanese ships {{for use in the}} test proposed by McMahon.|$|E

500|$|The Who {{starting}} {{touring the}} <b>US</b> <b>just</b> before {{the album was}} released. The group used the Lifehouse PA, though soundman Bob Pridden found the technical requirements of the equipment to be over-complicated. The set list was revamped, and while it included a smaller selection of numbers from Tommy, several new numbers from the new album such as [...] "My Wife", [...] "Baba O'Riley" [...] and [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] became live favourites. The latter two songs involved the band playing to a backing track containing the synthesizer parts. The tour moved to the UK in September, including a show at The Oval, Kennington in front of 35,000 fans, and the opening gig at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, before {{going back to the}} US, ending in Seattle on December 15. The group then took eight months off touring, the longest break of their career at that point.|$|E
500|$|Also {{appearing}} in the film was Alan Rickman, who portrayed Colonel Brandon. Thompson was pleased that Rickman could express the [...] "extraordinary sweetness [...] his nature," [...] as he had played [...] "Machiavellian types so effectively" [...] in other films. Greg Wise was cast as Marianne's other romantic interest, John Willoughby, his most noted role thus far. Twelve-year-old Emilie François, appearing as Margaret Dashwood, {{was one of the}} last people cast in the production; she had no professional acting experience. Thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries, [...] "Emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement – she creates spontaneity in all of <b>us</b> <b>just</b> by being there." [...] Other cast members included Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood, James Fleet as John Dashwood, Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, Imogen Stubbs as Lucy Steele, Richard Lumsden as Robert Ferrars, Tom Wilkinson as Mr. Dashwood, and Lone Vidahl as Miss Grey.|$|E
500|$|Charlie Jane Anders of io9 {{believed}} that {{some elements of}} the film were deliberate self-references to Michael Bay's own sense of under-appreciation after the backlash to the second film: [...] "After {{a few hours of}} seeing Shia get dissed, overlooked and mistreated, the message becomes clear: Shia, as always, is a stand-in for Michael Bay. And Bay is showing <b>us</b> <b>just</b> {{what it felt like to}} deal with the ocean of Haterade—the snarking, the Razzie Award, the mean reviews—that Revenge of the Fallen unleashed." [...] She went on to say that the film's frequent, often jarring shifts in tone were an intentional endorsement of Michael Bay's own filmmaking style. [...] "Tone is for single-purpose machines. Consistency is for Decepticons. Michael Bay's ideal movie shifts from action movie to teen comedy to political drama with the same well-lubricated ease that his cars become men. By the time you've finished watching, you will speak Michael Bay's cinematic language." ...|$|E

500|$|In a four-star review, Allmusic editor Alex Henderson called Coltrane for Lovers [...] "an {{excellent}} {{collection that}} has no problem reminding <b>us</b> <b>just</b> how warm and expressive his ballad playing could be." [...] After discussing how Coltrane's ballad-playing has been undervalued in comparison to his more experimental recordings, in a December 21, 2001 article for The New York Times, writer Ben Ratliff wrote that [...] "This collection ... presents all the argument you need." [...] Some, however, have criticized the album and Verve negatively for repackaging Coltrane material for an unnecessary cash-in compilation. In [...] The Penguin Guide to Jazz on CD, Richard Cook and Brian Morton gave the album {{one out of four}} stars and commented, [...] "Oh, for goodness' sake! We're tempted to tell you that this contains a previously unreleased rehearsal of Ascension, which we have long regarded as excellent make-out music, but it does not. Needless to say, the music is fine ... It's the concept we have problems with. Avoid." ...|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Spins March Hogan wrote, [...] "'Some of <b>us</b> <b>just</b> like to read', she sings, and hey, that {{includes}} us. But it's easier to clap {{for something that}} moves or touches you, rather than serves as an advertisement for Gaga as incomprehensible high-end brand." [...] Consequence of Sound wrote in their review, [...] "Gaga's head appears on a black swan and she boogies down in a clam bikini. If this doesn't bump up her sales, I no longer believe in art." [...] Hilary Hughes of Esquire said that the video [...] "hits all the marks of Gaga-esque eccentricity: glitter, boob grabs, weird animals, space, severed limbs, devotional imagery, nudity, neon, etc. It just doesn't redefine those marks, as previous music videos of Gaga's— namely [...] "Bad Romance," [...] "Paparazzi" [...] and [...] "Judas"— have". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic believed that Gaga was parodying herself with the video and suggested that her aim was [...] "to make a video both celebrating and poking fun at her career thus far." [...] However, he considered it forgettable when compared to Gaga's previous efforts.|$|E
500|$|Emily Heward of Music OMH called [...] "Jai Ho" [...] an [...] "exuberant Bollywood dance number" [...] that [...] "encapsulates the film's feel-good-factor, and reminds <b>us</b> <b>just</b> {{how much}} this score deserves the accolades it has already won and the many it is sure still to receive– just as India's most treasured {{composer}} deserves the new-found global recognition it has earned him". In {{a review of the}} Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack, Joginder Tutej of Bollywood Hungama deemed [...] "Jai Ho" [...] the [...] "flagship number" [...] of the film. Tutej complimented Sukhwinder Singh's vocals as being [...] "energetic" [...] and concluded that the singer [...] "can comfortably add on another big chartbuster to his name". He also stated that the song, while [...] "boasting of an amazing mix of melody and rhythm" [...] remains [...] "Indian at heart" [...] and is [...] "instantly catchy". He concluded that: [...] "No wonder, it is the lone promotional song of the film and also sees a music video being dedicated to it. Gulzar saab celebrates the spirit of love and life with 'Jai Ho' and infuses enough power in it that justifies all the nominations it is receiving today".|$|E

500|$|For Stampede, {{the members}} went to drummer Vinnie Paul's Texas home studio, for a {{recording}} process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, {{surrounded by the}} obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. [...] "We were doing it at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," [...] Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. [...] "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is {{the main thing that}} I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," [...] Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed {{for the creation of a}} big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. [...] "We slept there, so if one of <b>us</b> <b>just</b> came up with an idea, we could jump on it," [...] guitarist Tom Maxwell said.|$|E
500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a douche, and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives <b>us,</b> <b>just</b> when you think you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson faced {{numerous}} {{disagreements with}} the song's co-producer. It {{has been reported}} that Quincy Jones did not want the song to appear on Thriller and that he felt that the song was too weak {{to be part of the}} collection, but Jones has stated this is a false rumor. The producer disliked the demo and did not care for the song's bassline. Jones wanted to cut Jackson's 29-second introduction. The entertainer, however, insisted that it be kept. [...] "I said, 'Michael we've got to cut that intro'" [...] Jones later recalled. [...] "He said: 'But that's the jelly! ... That's what makes me want to dance'. And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That's what makes me want to dance', well, the rest of <b>us</b> <b>just</b> have to shut up." [...] Jones also wanted to change the track's title to [...] "Not My Lover", as he believed that people would think the song referred to the tennis player Billie Jean King. Jackson refused to change the title and asked Jones to give him co-producing credits for the track, as he felt that the finished product sounded close to the demo. In addition, Jackson wanted extra royalties. Jones granted him neither and the two fell out for several days.|$|E
