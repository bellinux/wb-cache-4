2500|$|In October 2006 Straw {{attracted}} controversy {{by suggesting}} {{to a local}} newspaper, The Lancashire Evening Telegraph (now The Lancashire Telegraph), that Muslim women who wear veils that cover their faces (the niqab) can inhibit inter-community relations, though he denied the issue was raised for political gain, stating that he had raised it in private circles {{in the past and}} it had never progressed beyond discussions. Although he did not support a law banning a woman's right to choose to wear the veil, he would like them to abandon it altogether. Asked whether he would prefer veils to be abolished completely, Straw said: [...] "Yes. It needs to be made clear I am not talking about being prescriptive but with all the caveats, yes, I would rather." [...] He said that he had asked women visiting his constituency surgeries to consider <b>uncovering</b> <b>their</b> noses and mouths in order to allow better communication. He claimed that no women had ever chosen to wear a full veil after this request.|$|E
6000|$|In Germany {{this case}} did not occur: the {{reception}} of the work was beyond example flattering. The leading idea suited the German mind; the execution of it inflamed the hearts and imaginations of the people; they felt proud of their great poet, and delighted to enthusiasm with his poetry. At the first exhibition of the play in Leipzig, Schiller being in the theatre, though not among the audience, this feeling was displayed in a rather singular manner. When the curtain dropped {{at the end of}} the first act, there arose on all sides a shout of [...] "Es lebe Friedrich Schiller!" [...] accompanied by the sound of trumpets and other military music: at the conclusion of the piece, the whole assembly left their places, went out, and crowded round the door through which the poet was expected to come; and no sooner did he show himself, than his admiring spectators, <b>uncovering</b> <b>their</b> heads, made an avenue for him to pass; and as he waited along, many, we are told, held up their children, and exclaimed, [...] "That is he!"[36] ...|$|E

6000|$|All that thirteenth night, Miss Coleshaw, lying {{across my}} knees as I kept the helm, comforted and {{supported}} the poor mother. Her child, covered with a pea-jacket of mine, lay in her lap. It troubled me all night {{to think that there}} was no Prayer-Book among us, and that I could remember but very few of the exact words of the burial service. When I stood up at broad day, all {{knew what was going to}} be done, and I noticed that my poor fellows made the motion of <b>uncovering</b> <b>their</b> heads, though their heads had been stark bare to the sky and sea for many a weary hour. There was a long heavy swell on, but otherwise it was a fair morning, and there were broad fields of sunlight on the waves in the east. I said no more than this: [...] "I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord. He raised the daughter of Jairus the ruler, and said she was not dead but slept. He raised the widow's son. He arose Himself, and was seen of many. He loved little children, saying, Suffer them to come unto Me and rebuke them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven. In His name, my friends, and committed to His merciful goodness!" [...] With those words I laid my rough face softly on the placid little forehead, and buried the Golden Lucy in the grave of the Golden Mary.|$|E
60|$|Meantime, {{the exodus}} had begun. Carretas full of ladies and {{children}} rolled swaying across the Plaza, with men walking or riding by their side; mounted parties followed on mules and horses; the poorest were setting out on foot, {{men and women}} carrying bundles, clasping babies in their arms, leading old people, dragging along the bigger children. When Charles Gould, after leaving the doctor and the engineer at the Casa Viola, entered the town by the harbour gate, all those that had meant to go were gone, and the others had barricaded themselves in their houses. In the whole dark street {{there was only one}} spot of flickering lights and moving figures, where the Senor Administrador recognized his wife's carriage waiting {{at the door of the}} Avellanos's house. He rode up, almost unnoticed, and looked on without a word while some of his own servants came out of the gate carrying Don Jose Avellanos, who, with closed eyes and motionless features, appeared perfectly lifeless. His wife and Antonia walked on each side of the improvised stretcher, which was put at once into the carriage. The two women embraced; while from the other side of the landau Father Corbelan's emissary, with his ragged beard all streaked with grey, and high, bronzed cheek-bones, stared, sitting upright in the saddle. Then Antonia, dry-eyed, got in by the side of the stretcher, and, after making the sign of the cross rapidly, lowered a thick veil upon her face. The servants and the three or four neighbours who had come to assist, stood back, <b>uncovering</b> <b>their</b> heads. On the box, Ignacio, resigned now to driving all night (and to having perhaps his throat cut before daylight) looked back surlily over his shoulder.|$|E

50|$|The {{chemical}} and physical composition and properties of raw food materials {{are important for}} the transformations {{that occur in the}} food during preparation (heating, cooling, mixing, beating, fermenting, salting, drying, smoking, souring etc.). Flavour (taste and smell), mouthfeel, chemesthesis, astringency are all determinants for the sensory evaluation of food, and these characteristics are also related to the chemical properties and the physical texture of the food, and to how the food is transformed in the mouth. Gastrophysics deals with each of these components and aims at <b>uncovering</b> <b>their</b> mutual relations i.e. how the sensory input relates to the material composition and properties of food, and the absorption in the human body.|$|E

5000|$|In {{its earlier}} formulations, Hasidic thought had {{elevated}} the rebbe {{to a level}} above that of typical hasid. A rebbe was closer to God, his prayers were more amenable to Him, and a hasid should satisfy himself with attachment to the Rebbe and hence indirectly to God. A rebbe {{was to be a}} living example of perfection and would concern himself with intellectualism on behalf of the followers. According to Sacks, Chabad stressed the individual responsibilities of every Jew: [...] "The rebbe...became more of a teacher and adviser, recognising the vocation of each of his followers, guiding them towards it, <b>uncovering</b> <b>their</b> strengths, and rejoicing in their achievements." ...|$|E
50|$|In 320 BC, Maenius was {{appointed}} dictator, {{for the purpose}} of investigating a number of plots and conspiracies involving some of the most prominent of Roman noble families, together with the leading citizens of Capua. Maenius appointed Marcus Foslius Flaccinator as his magister equitum, and both men proceeded to investigate the matter thoroughly, to the point that many of the Roman nobility began to resent his <b>uncovering</b> <b>their</b> plots, while Capua proceeded to revolt against Rome in 319 BC. The situation soon reached crisis point, as the Roman nobility demanded that charges be laid against both Maenius and Foslius. Both men resigned their office and demanded that the consuls, Lucius Papirius Cursor and Quintus Publilius Philo give them a trial. The consuls agreed, and both men were acquitted.|$|E
5000|$|Barthes {{discusses}} the art patterns as narratives of cultural coexistence (for details see: Introduction to structural analysis of narratives). However, Spivey summarizes that cultural coexistence {{is not the}} single reason to explain the phenomenon of art being recursive. Chomsky at al. argued that the core property of human communication (in a [...] "narrow" [...] sense, including language) is recursion. According to Chomsky at al. recursion is attributed to limited syntax in the conception, with a finite set of elements to yield a potentially infinite array of discrete expressions. Thomas explains the art recursion (in a [...] "broad" [...] sense) with implosion of archetypal structures existing beyond the faculty of human communication. Studying Persian-Sassanide art patterns and possibly their early Nomadic conceptions is <b>uncovering</b> <b>their</b> symbols (symbolism) and creative imagination.|$|E
