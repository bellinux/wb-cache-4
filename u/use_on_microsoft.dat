Steam provides the user with installation and automatic updating of games, and community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud saving, and in-game voice and chat functionality. The software provides a freely available application programming interface (API) called Steamworks, which developers can use to integrate many of Steam's functions into their products, including networking, matchmaking, in-game achievements, micro-transactions, and support for user-created content through Steam Workshop. Though initially developed for <b>use</b> <b>on</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Windows operating systems, versions for OS X and Linux were later released.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is {{creation}} of an XML data editor. The editor contains functionality to simplify creation of syntactically and semantically correct XML documents. The main feature of the editor is automatic inference of XML schema {{for a set of}} input XML documents. User may edit XML data by either a text view or a tree view. It is possible to check well-formedness and validity of edited XML data. There is a code completion - overview of feasible elements on given level - feature in the text view available. Implemented solution facilitates an easy extension of its main feature - schema inference. The program is written in C# programming language and is designed for <b>use</b> <b>on</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Windows operating systems. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{a way we}} can more simply {{customise}} the start-up of a SAS ® session. The technique helps where some sessions are interactive and some are batch, and where the desktop system might be used {{by more than one}} login-user. Implementing this method does not require administrator rights on the machine where it is used. However, it requires some understanding of the SAS ® System and the operating system on which it runs, so this paper is suitable for intermediate and advanced SAS users and SAS developers. The technique has been extensively tested and <b>used</b> <b>on</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Windows platforms, and can be extended for UNIX platforms. The method is derived from: many years experience of installing many versions of SAS; on-line documentation research; examining the configuration of components of the SAS Business Intelligence Architecture; and from accidental discoveries made when starting SAS sessions. The key of the technique requires just one &quot;user environment variable&quot;. ...|$|R
