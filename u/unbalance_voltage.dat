The IEC Technical Report IEC/TR 61000 - 3 - 13 : 2008 incorporates the effects of <b>voltage</b> <b>unbalance</b> propagation in the <b>voltage</b> <b>unbalance</b> emission allocation methodology by introducing the <b>voltage</b> <b>unbalance</b> transfer coefficient, in order to evaluate the influence made by background <b>voltage</b> <b>unbalance</b> at the point of evaluation. However, no comprehensive approaches exist in the literature to evaluate these coefficients and the IEC work follows some approximations, which are deduced based on simulations and practical measurements. Recent work completed on <b>voltage</b> <b>unbalance</b> emission assessment at the post-connection stage of unbalanced installations allows separation of the <b>voltage</b> <b>unbalance</b> emission contribution made by upstream/surrounding unbalance sources as a constituent component of the resultant <b>voltage</b> <b>unbalance</b> emission level at the point of evaluation.

Approach: In order {{to overcome the}} non possibility of the default {{detection and}} localization in presence of noise, {{the use of the}} discrete wavelet transform and especially the MultiResolution Analysis algorithm, to remove efficiently the noise associated to the stator currents is proposed. Results: Simulation results show that the de-noised stator current is a good estimation of the non disturbed one.

Furthermore, the signal details which characterize the default are not smoothed and still characterize the default occurrence.

It can be deduced that the wavelet transform and particularly the MRA technique is a good and powerful solution for both non linear noise filtering and transient default detection.
