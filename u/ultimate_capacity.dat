A large-scale artificial groundwater recharge scheme exists in the area, providing a much-needed freshwater barrier to intruding seawater. Part of the injected water consists of recycled water, starting as of 1976 with Water Factory 21, which used RO and high lime to clean the water (production capacity of 19,000 m3 per day). This plant was de-commissioned in 2004 and has since made place for a new project with a higher capacity (265,000 m3 per day with an <b>ultimate</b> <b>capacity</b> of 492,000 m3 per day), {{under the name of}} Groundwater Replenishment System.|$|E

2500|$|In North America, a {{more pragmatic}} {{approach}} has been adopted and research into compressive membrane action has primarily stemmed {{from the work of}} Hewitt and Batchelor and Batchelor and Tissington in the 1970s. [...] They carried out an extensive series of field tests, which led to the introduction of an empirical method of design into the Ontario Highway Bridge Design Code in 1979. [...] This required minimum isotropic reinforcement (0.3%) in bridge deck slabs, provided certain boundary conditions were satisfied. [...] In the 1990s Mufti et al. extended this research and showed that significant enhancements in the durability of laterally restrained slabs can be achieved by utilising fibre reinforced deck slabs without steel reinforcement.

2500|$|While {{the table}} above compares the maximum {{capacity}} of each mode, the average {{use of a}} lane might be quite different, based {{on a number of}} factors. One line of light rail (requires 25' Right of Way) has a theoretical capacity of up to 8 times more than one 12' lane of freeway (not counting buses) during peak times. Roads have <b>ultimate</b> <b>capacity</b> limits that can be determined by traffic engineering. They usually experience a chaotic breakdown in flow and a dramatic drop in speed (colloquially known as a traffic jam) if they exceed about 2,000 vehicles per hour per lane (each car roughly two seconds behind another).

30|$|Also, the <b>ultimate</b> <b>capacities</b> are {{calculated}} with the method proposed by Elfgren et al. (1974) {{and with the}} method proposed by Luccioni et al. (1991). As {{can be seen from}} Table  5, according to the method proposed by Elfgren and Karlsson et al., the average ratio of test results and calculated results was 1.29, which should be attributed {{to the fact that the}} method based on the skew bending theory did not take into account the restrained torsion mechanism. For the calculation method proposed by Luccioni and Reimundin et al., as shown in Table  5, the average ratio of test results and predicted ultimate torques is 0.8. The reason for overestimating the <b>ultimate</b> <b>capacities</b> is that although the restrained torsion mechanism was considered, the effect of warping moment is underestimated.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of longitudinal reinforcement ratio, volume dosage of steel fiber and the beam height on flexural behavior of steel fiber reinforced high-strength concrete beams, a parametric experimental study has been conducted. Four longitudinal reinforcement ratios, 4 steel fiber volume dosages and 4 different beam heights were used. Results reveal that the bearing capacity and the measured deflection of the steel fiber reinforced high-strength beams are much larger and {{the breaking of the}} compression zone is not too serious compared with the reinforced concrete beam. A considerable increase for the <b>ultimate</b> flexural <b>capacity</b> of the beams was observed by increasing the steel fiber volume dosage. Besides, the longitudinal reinforcement ratio has great effect on the <b>ultimate</b> flexural <b>capacity</b> of steel fiber reinforced high-strength concrete beams and the <b>ultimate</b> flexural <b>capacity</b> is increasing gradually with the increase of the longitudinal reinforcement ratio. Furthermore, the effect of the height of the reinforced concrete beam on the <b>ultimate</b> flexural <b>capacity</b> of the steel fiber reinforced high-strength concrete beam is significant and there is a tendency of increase in the <b>ultimate</b> flexural <b>capacity</b> with the increase of the height of the reinforced concrete beam...|$|R

40|$|The <b>ultimate</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> is an {{essential}} requirement in design quantification for shallow foundations especially for structures built on large rock masses. In many engineering projects, structures built on foundation of heavily jointed rock masses may face issues such as instability and sudden catastrophic rock slope failure. Determination of the <b>ultimate</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> (Qult) of foundations resting on rock mass has traditionally been determined by employing several strength criterions. One of the accepted and widely implemented methods {{is to use the}} Hoek-Brown failure criterion 2002, where the required parameters are determined from a rock mass classification system, Geological Strength Index (GSI). This paper defines an assessment for <b>ultimate</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> (Qult) based on the Hoek-Brown failure criterion 2002 for a granitic rock slope beneath a 20 m diameter concrete water tank at Bandar Mahkota Cheras, Kajang, Selangor. Based on the Hoek-Brown failure criterion 2002, the <b>ultimate</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> (Qult) of rock mass was 7. 91 MPa. The actual stress acting on the rock mass was 0. 32 MPa.
