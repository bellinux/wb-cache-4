5000|$|XP-6A: Model 34K, same as XP-6 {{but with}} {{untapered}} <b>wings</b> and <b>wing</b> <b>radiators</b> to reduce drag ...|$|R
25|$|Supermarine 312: This was {{the basic}} Spitfire Mk I adapted to take four 20mm Oerlikon cannon mounted in {{modified}} <b>wings.</b> The <b>radiator</b> and oil cooler were moved from <b>under</b> the <b>wing</b> to a duct under the fuselage. This was R J Mitchell's last design {{before his death}} in 1937.|$|R
2500|$|The six prototypes {{were built}} as a single Mk.I, HM599, powered by a Sabre IV, two Mk.IIs (LA602 and LA607) {{equipped}} with the Centaurus IV, a Mk.III (LA610) with a Griffon IIB, a Mk.IV (LA614) with a Griffon 61, and a Mk.V (HM595) with the Sabre II. The Tempest Mk.I featured other new features, such as a clean single-piece sliding canopy {{in place of the}} car-door framed canopy, and it used <b>wing</b> <b>radiators</b> instead of the [...] "chin" [...] radiator. Due to development difficulties with the Sabre IV engine and its <b>wing</b> <b>radiators,</b> the completion of the Mk.I prototype, HM599, was delayed, and thus it was the Mk.V prototype, HM595, that would fly first.|$|R
25|$|Early {{examples}} of the D.V featured a large headrest, which was usually removed in service because it interfered with the pilot's field of view. The headrest was deleted from the second production batch. Aircraft deployed in Palestine used two <b>wing</b> <b>radiators,</b> {{to cope with the}} warmer climate.|$|R
25|$|XO-13A: Second XO-13, {{fitted with}} <b>wing</b> skin <b>radiators.</b>|$|R
25|$|The second {{prototype}} introduced upper <b>wing</b> <b>radiators</b> {{in lieu of}} {{the frontal}} radiator and large cut-outs in the lower wing roots, to improve the pilot's downward vision. These features proved unsuccessful and were omitted from subsequent aircraft. The third and fourth prototypes incorporated numerous modifications to the radiator, upper fuselage decking, fin and rudder. The fourth prototype was selected as the production standard. Series production commenced in October 1917, with 121 Dolphins delivered {{by the end of the}} year.|$|R
25|$|Because the {{intercooler}} {{required a}} radiator, the <b>radiator</b> <b>under</b> the starboard <b>wing</b> was halved {{in size and}} the intercooler radiator housed alongside. <b>Under</b> the port <b>wing</b> a new <b>radiator</b> fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside the other half-radiator unit. When the engine was running at low speed, one radiator section provided enough coolant; a thermostatic switch turned off the starboard radiator section until more power was called for and extra engine cooling was required.|$|R
50|$|The XA-7 was a two-seat low-wing {{all-metal}} monoplane design. It {{featured a}} thick cantilever <b>wing,</b> tunnel <b>radiator</b> and two closely spaced open cockpits.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>wing</b> <b>radiators</b> were {{shallower}} and set {{farther back}} on the wing. A new cooling system was introduced; this system was automatically regulated by a thermostat with interconnected variable position inlet and outlet flaps that would balance the lowest drag possible with the most efficient cooling. A new radiator, shallower but wider than that fitted to the E was developed. A boundary layer duct allowed continual airflow {{to pass through the}} airfoil above the radiator ducting and exit from the trailing edge of the upper split flap. The lower split flap was mechanically linked to the central [...] "main" [...] flap, while the upper split flap and forward bath lip position were regulated via a thermostatic valve which automatically positioned the flaps for maximum cooling effectiveness. In 1941 [...] "cutoff" [...] valves were introduced which allowed the pilot to shut down either <b>wing</b> <b>radiator</b> in the event of one being damaged; this allowed the remaining coolant to be preserved and the damaged aircraft returned to base. However, these valves were delivered to frontline units as kits, the number of which, for unknown reasons, was limited. These cutoff valves were later factory standard fitting for Bf 109 G and K series.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1918, the Idflieg (Inspektion der Fliegertruppen) {{distributed}} to German aircraft manufacturers a detailed engineering {{report on the}} SPAD S.VII, whose wing structure Idflieg considered to be well-designed. Pfalz accordingly produced several Pfalz D.III-derived prototypes with SPAD-type wings. [...] These developed into the Pfalz D.XII. The new aircraft was powered by the 180hp Mercedes D.IIIaü engine and continued the use of LFG-Roland's patented Wickelrumpf plywood-skinned monocoque fuselage construction. Unlike the earlier aircraft, the D.XII used a two-bay wing cellule. Furthermore, the flush <b>wing</b> <b>radiator</b> was replaced with a car-type radiator mounted {{in front of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|The D.III entered {{squadron}} {{service in}} December 1916, {{and was immediately}} acclaimed by German aircrews for its maneuverability and rate of climb. Two faults with the new aircraft were soon identified. Like the D.II, early D.IIIs featured a Teves und Braun airfoil-shaped radiator {{in the center of}} the upper wing, where it tended to scald the pilot if punctured. From the 290th D.III onward, the radiator was offset to the right on production machines while others were soon moved to the right as a field modification. Aircraft deployed in Palestine used two <b>wing</b> <b>radiators,</b> to cope with the warmer climate.|$|R

50|$|The TG183 was {{distinctive}} {{in that it}} had twin rear {{wings and}} front <b>wing</b> mounted <b>radiators.</b> Unfortunately the front wing configuration caused {{the front of the}} car to move about at high speed and was eventually replaced by a more conventional front wing set up.|$|R

5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an intercooler radiator; the <b>radiator</b> <b>under</b> the starboard <b>wing</b> was halved in size and the intercooler radiator housed alongside. <b>Under</b> the port <b>wing</b> a new <b>radiator</b> fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|R

2500|$|In August 1942, {{even before}} the first flight of the {{prototype}} Tempest V had been conducted, a production order for 400 Tempests was placed by the Air Ministry. This order was split, with the initial batch of 100 being Tempest V [...] "Series I"s, powered by the 2,235hp (1,491kW) Sabre IIA series engine, which had the distinctive chin radiator, while the rest were to have been produced as the Tempest I, equipped with the Sabre IV and leading-edge radiators. These 300 Tempest Is were intended to replace an order for a similar quantity of Typhoons for the Gloster Aircraft Company. As it transpired, the difficulties with the Sabre IV and the <b>wing</b> <b>radiators</b> led to this version never reaching production, the corresponding order was switched to 300 Tempest V [...] "Series 2"s instead.|$|R

50|$|The normal bomb load was 400 kg, {{maximum load}} was 600 kg. This could be small {{fragmentation}} or anti-tank bomblets, put in bomb bays, or four 50-100 kg bombs in bomb bays and externally <b>under</b> <b>wings,</b> or two 200-250 kg bombs attached <b>under</b> <b>wings.</b> Small bomblets were put directly on bomb bay floors, in piles. A typical load was 182 (maximum 200) 2 kg AO-2,5-2 fragmentation bombs, or 144 PTAB-2,5-1,5 anti-tank HEAT bombs. Apart from bombs, four unguided rockets RS-82 or RS-132 could {{be carried on}} rail launchers <b>under</b> <b>wings.</b> Avia B-33s were also fitted to carry other rocket types. Late Soviet aircraft could carry ORO-82 and ORO-132 tube launchers. In the tail section was a DAG-10 launcher with 10 anti-aircraft or anti-personnel grenades AG-2 (after being thrown, they would fall with parachutes and then burst, but were not widely used in practice).|$|R
