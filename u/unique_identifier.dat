5|$|SmarTrip cards {{comply with}} the ISO/IEC 14443 Type B standard. A {{microchip}} contained within the card stores its value, {{as well as the}} rider’s most recent entry and exit points, and a <b>unique</b> <b>identifier.</b> However, the <b>unique</b> <b>identifier</b> is not linked to a person’s name or identity, unless one registers the card online. Registering SmarTrip cards allows riders to recover their remaining balance (minus a $5 replacement fee), should the card be lost, stolen, or damaged. The <b>unique</b> <b>identifier</b> also allows workers enrolled in the SmartBenefits program, which allows employers to subsidize employee transportation costs tax-free, to credit their monthly benefits to their cards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The role of <b>unique</b> node <b>identifiers</b> in network {{computing}} is well understood {{as far as}} symmetry breaking is concerned. However, the <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> also leak information about the computing environment—in particular, they provide some nodes with information related {{to the size of}} the network. It was recently proved that in the context of local decision, there are some decision problems such that (1) they cannot be solved without <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers,</b> and (2) <b>unique</b> node <b>identifiers</b> leak a sufficient amount of information such that the problem becomes solvable (PODC 2013). In this work we give study what is the minimal amount of information that we need to leak from the environment to the nodes in order to solve local decision problems. Our key results are related to scalar oracles f that, for any given n, provide a multiset f(n) of n labels; then the adversary assigns the labels to the n nodes in the network. This is a direct generalisation of the usual assumption of <b>unique</b> node <b>identifiers.</b> We give a complete characterisation of the weakest oracle that leaks at least as much information as the <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers.</b> Our main result is the following dichotomy: we classify scalar oracles as large and small, depending on their asymptotic behaviour, and show that (1) any large oracle is at least as powerful as the <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers</b> in the context of local decision problems, while (2) for any small oracle there are local decision problems that still benefit from <b>unique</b> <b>identifiers.</b> ar X i...|$|R
25|$|One theory used to {{describe}} pronominal binding is to use index marking rules to determine possible bindings. Index marking rules are rules used to determine which parts of a sentence carry the same reference. Each element in a sentence is given an index, which is a <b>unique</b> <b>identifier</b> of that element. A set of rules can then be applied to modify the index of one element {{to be the same}} as the index of another. Those two elements will then share the same index, and so will refer to the same thing. This indexing theory was used as a way {{to describe}} pronominal binding by Noam Chomsky, and expanded upon by James Higginbotham. The theory holds that the binding of pronouns consists of three main parts.|$|E
25|$|UniProt Archive (UniParc) is a {{comprehensive}} and non-redundant database, which contains all the protein sequences from the main, publicly available protein sequence databases. Proteins may exist in several different source databases, and in multiple copies in the same database. In order to avoid redundancy, UniParc stores each unique sequence only once. Identical sequences are merged, {{regardless of whether they}} are from the same or different species. Each sequence is given a stable and <b>unique</b> <b>identifier</b> (UPI), making it possible to identify the same protein from different source databases. UniParc contains only protein sequences, with no annotation. Database cross-references in UniParc entries allow further information about the protein to be retrieved from the source databases. When sequences in the source databases change, these changes are tracked by UniParc and history of all changes is archived.|$|E
25|$|OpenID {{is a way}} to use {{a single}} set of user {{credentials}} to access multiple sites, while OAuth facilitates the authorization of one site to access and use information related to the user's account on another site. Although OAuth is not an authentication protocol, it can be used as part of one. The following drawing highlights the differences between using OpenID vs. OAuth for authentication. Note that with OpenID, the process starts with the application asking the user for their identity (typically an OpenID URI), whereas in the case of OAuth, the application directly requests a limited access OAuth Token (valet key) to access the APIs (enter the house) on user's behalf. If the user can grant that access, the application can retrieve the <b>unique</b> <b>identifier</b> for establishing the profile (identity) using the APIs.|$|E

25|$|From late 1970, British Railways {{started to}} apply new numbers to {{locomotives}} and multiple units {{based on the}} TOPS classification system, the first classes {{to be dealt with}} being the LNER-design EM1 type (TOPS class 76) and the AL3 and AL4 types of AC electric locomotives (TOPS classes 83 and 84). The format of these numbers is xxxyyy, where xxx is the class number and yyy the <b>unique</b> <b>identifier</b> for that locomotive or unit. All locomotive classes have unique identifiers that commence at xx001, except classes 43 (High Speed Train power cars, originally classified as multiple-unit vehicles), 97 and 98 (departmental and steam locomotives). Multiple unit classes are treated differently, because an attempt has been made to give units working within the same region or sector unique identifiers (for more information see British Rail Regional Multiple Unit Numbering). In recent years, unit numbers have also been tied in with the numbers of the carriages within a unit (e.g. 150201 is formed of carriages 52201 and 57201). As a result, very few multiple unit classes commence from xxx001.|$|E
