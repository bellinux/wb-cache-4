40|$|Continuing {{the work}} of the ‘Vienna Circle’, philosopher Carl Hempel created {{explanatory}} models to ground scientific inquiry in logic and empirical truth. Beginning with the physical sciences, he explored the application of these models to the social sciences as well. Terrestrial archaeologists incorporated Hempelian concepts by calling for global changes in archaeological methodology. These changes, explicitly designed to maximize data collection (a necessary first step to develop archaeological general laws crucial to Hempelian explanation and confirmation), were developed using particular idiosyncratic geographical cues that would undermine archaeology if implemented in other contexts. In this article, I argue that similarly unconscious artifacts of particular archaeologists’ goals and locations have also governed <b>underwater</b> <b>archaeology’s</b> growth as a discipline, much to its detriment. It is my hope that understanding the philosophical and archaeological issues that have led archaeology to this point will help to move archaeology (both land and sea) forward...|$|R

25|$|<b>Underwater</b> <b>{{archaeology}}</b> is archaeology practiced underwater. As {{with all}} other branches of archaeology, it evolved from its roots in pre-history and in the classical era to include sites from the historical and industrial eras. Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites, and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers. As a result, <b>underwater</b> <b>archaeology</b> initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research. The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub-discipline was firmly established. <b>Underwater</b> <b>archaeology</b> now {{has a number of}} branches including, after it became broadly accepted in the late 1980s, maritime archaeology: the scientifically based study of past human life, behaviours and cultures and their activities in, on, around and (lately) under the sea, estuaries and rivers. This is most often effected using the physical remains found in, around or under salt or fresh water or buried beneath water-logged sediment. In recent years, the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater aviation archaeology have also emerged as bona fide activity.|$|E

40|$|Archaeological {{data are}} usually {{inherently}} incomplete, heterogeneous, discontinuous and require frequent updates and possible adjustments. It {{is important to}} constantly create detailed documentation, which will precisely represent the actual situation. However, even the most precise figure is only an estimated representation of the documented object. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} collect fully metric documentation and its professional archaeological interpretation. Acquiring correct and valuable underwaterdigital images for the archaeology purposes is not easy due to specific shooting conditions. It should be noted a number of limitations are unique to this type of imaging environment — the apparent extension of the focal length, the “disappearance” of colours, as well as a significant reduction in the transparency of the water environment. Therefore, the authors have made attempts to describe changes, in a much broader sense, in the quality of photogrammetric images that had been taken in various shooting conditions. Underwater and aerial images of two test fields were tested. First, the ground sampling distance of the INTOVA IC 500 digital camera and the geometric accuracy of the acquired images were examined. Then, the impact of changes to the imaging conditions on the radio-metric resolution and colour projection were designated. In the last stage, the acquired images were used in practice — to assess the progress of the erosion process of an archaeological object, and also to comply its documentation in the form of vector drawing with the accuracy of mxy = ± 0. 5 mm.

40|$|Hunter-gatherers are {{foundational}} to anthropology. Ethnographic {{accounts of}} foragers have been essential in building classic anthropological theories of human evolution, kinship, social organization, and religion. From these studies, a normative view of foragers as simple, highly mobile, egalitarian band societies with limited or no property/ownership, emerged {{and continues to}} be pervasive in the discipline. 	This larger issue frames the central problems addressed in this dissertation. It concerns hunter-gatherer societies and how they are effected by hunting architecture, such as drive lanes, animal corrals, and fishing weirs. These comparable built elements are found across time, space, and cultures because they are conditioned by similar traits in animal behavior. Subsistence strategies adopting such hunting features present a fundamental shift in exploitation by actively modifying the landscape (i. e. niche construction) to increase the yield and predictability of natural resources. It is argued that the creation and use of hunting architecture is among the most significant subsistence innovations in prehistory prior to the origins of agriculture; as similar to large-scale food production, the adoption of hunting architecture has demonstrable social and economic repercussions. 	This dissertation investigates the global phenomenon of hunting architecture by drawing on a regional case study – caribou hunting in the Great Lakes, where some of the oldest hunting structures (9, 380 - 8, 830 cal yr BP) have been submerged beneath Lake Huron. The preservation of a virtually unmodified, culturally engineered landscape underwater is an ideal laboratory for investigating broader issues. New underwater research conducted for this dissertation provides an unprecedented view of forager societies and hunting architecture in the past, problematizing our normative characterization of prehistoric hunter-gatherers. 	Ultimately, this dissertation makes contributions to three core areas; the local archaeological problem of Great Lakes caribou hunters, the theoretical anthropological problem of hunting architecture and forager lifeways, and lastly, the global problem of conducting inundated archaeology. It provides a model for anthropological <b>archaeology</b> <b>underwater</b> and demonstrates that submerged prehistoric research can contribute to anthropology’s most significant questions...|$|R

Because plant and animal material can be preserved underwater, archaeobotany and archaeozoology have roles in <b>underwater</b> <b>archaeology.</b> For example, for submerged terrestrial sites or inland water, identification of pollen samples from sedimentary or silt layers can provide information on the plants growing on surrounding land and hence {{on the nature of the}} landscape.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} providing Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with long endurance capabilities from a twofold perspective. On one hand, the problem of long-term navigation is addressed exploiting acoustic positioning systems: the considered scenario {{is that of a}} vehicle equipped with an Ultra-Short BaseLine (USBL) system as main aiding sensor, navigating within an acoustic sensors network acting as a Long BaseLine (LBL) infrastructure. Two different approaches are followed, in both of which acoustics is oriented to bound the typical drift of the inertial-based estimation error; the peculiarity of the proposed strategies lies in the fact the acoustic positioning information are embedded in a net- worked communication scheme. In the first one, the navigation algorithm is composed of two consecutive steps: {{at the beginning of the}} mission, the vehicle combines its GPS signal with the USBL measurements to localise the fixed transponders of the network. Then, the estimated positions of the beacons are used as LBL spots and the acoustic measurements are combined with the inertial ones to perform autonomous navigation. The fusion algorithm is formally cast into an optimal stochastic filtering problem and the navigation status of the vehicle (namely its position, velocity and accelerometer biases) is estimated by relying on classic Extended Kalman Filter structure. The second technique, instead, aims at executing the two phases of the previous method at the same time, exploiting acoustic measurements to simultaneously determine both the navigation status of the vehicle and the topology of the network, initially supposed unknown. The previous estimation algorithm is augmented with a dynamic database of the discovered LBL anchors, which are considered as features in the classic Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) problems largely studied and developed in the visual navigation community: given this strong similarity, the presented approach is hence named Acoustic-based SLAM (A-SLAM). An extension of the A-SLAM algorithm to support the cooperative navigation of an heterogeneous team of AUVs is hence proposed, in which the vehicle equipped with the USBL acts as the team leader, while the other teammates are treated as mobile nodes of the acoustic network. Using the USBL measurements, the team leader can track the path followed by the mobile nodes, in addition to generate a map of the fixed nodes and self-localise within the network. Moreover, the navigation estimates are shared with the other teammates via acoustic communication to improve the localisation of the whole team. The performance of the proposed navigation algorithms are evaluated by post- processing of real data collected during several sea trials in the context of the THESAURUS (Italian acronym for “Techniques for <b>Underwater</b> Exploration and <b>Archaeology</b> through Swarms of Autonomous Vehicles”) project, devoted to the development of a team of cooperating underwater vehicles purposely designed for deep water archaeological search and documentation. On the other hand, the development of a novel device capable of recharging the batteries of an AUV exploiting energy from the wave motion as potentially unlimited power supply is presented. The energy recovery device is the core of the WAVE (Wave-powered Autonomous Vehicle for marine Exploration) project, which aims to further develop the technology for autonomous, long-term marine missions with the design and the prototypal realisation of a novel, hybrid oceanographic glider/AUV with power recharging capabilities from environmental renewable sources, such as solar and wave energy. Within the project, an energy recovery system from sea waves motion was first considered and conceived as a module, namely the WAVE module, to be installed on-board a generic carrier vehicle. The carrier vehicle was then identified as the hybrid glider/AUV eFolaga+, in order to guide the development of the system towards a realistic experimental solution without losing the generality of the methodology itself. Moreover, the prototype vehicle can be equipped with additional, mission-oriented payloads. Three further modules were thus defined, each one enabling the execution of a particular task: environmental monitoring, seafloor exploration and acoustic communication. A high-level software is designed and developed in order to provide the user with payload management and mission control and supervision functionalities while guaranteeing to the vehicle a certain level of decision-making autonomy. The designed systems are installed on-board the control units of the corresponding modules and their effectiveness is assessed with extensive bench tests conducted in laboratory and preliminary sea trials. Although there is plenty of space for further optimisation of the system performance, the results emerged after the first experimentations of the prototype show the practical feasibility of the proposed approach...|$|R
