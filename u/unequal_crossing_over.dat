25|$|Glycophorin C and D encode the Gerbich (Ge) antigens. There {{are four}} alleles, Ge-1 to Ge-4. Three types of Ge antigen negativity are known: Ge-1,-2,-3 (Leach phenotype), Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3. A 3.4 {{kilobase}} pair deletion within the gene, which probably arose because of <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> {{between the two}} repeated domains, {{is responsible for the}} formation of the Ge-2,-3 genotype. The breakpoints of the deletion are located within introns 2 and 3 and results in the deletion of exon 3. This mutant gene is transcribed as a messenger RNA with a continuous open reading frame extending over 300 nucleotides and is translated into the sialoglycoprotein found on Ge-2,-3 red cells. A second 3.4 kilobase pair deletion within the glycophorin C gene eliminates only exon 2 by a similar mechanism and generates the mutant gene encoding for the abnormal glycoprotein found on Ge-2,+3 erythrocytes.|$|E
25|$|One of the best-recognized {{theories}} {{that leads to}} copy number variations as well as deletions and inversions is non-allelic homologous recombinations. During meiotic recombination, homologous chromosomes pair up and form two ended double-stranded breaks leading to Holliday junctions. However, in the aberrant mechanism, during the formation of Holliday junctions, the double-stranded breaks are misaligned and the crossover lands in non-allelic positions on the same chromosome. When the Holliday junction is resolved, the <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> event allows transfer of genetic material between the two homologous chromosomes, and as a result, {{a portion of the}} DNA on both the homologues is repeated. Since the repeated regions are no longer segregating independently, the duplicated region of the chromosome is inherited. Another type of homologous recombination based mechanism that can lead to copy number variation is known as break induced replication. When a double stranded break occurs in the genome unexpectedly the cell activates pathways that mediate the repair of the break. Errors in repairing the break, similar to non-allelic homologous recombination, can lead to an increase in copy number of a particular region of the genome. During the repair of a double stranded break, the broken end can invade its homologous chromosome instead of rejoin the original strand. As in the non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism, an extra copy of a particular region is transferred to another chromosome, leading to a duplication event. Furthermore, cohesin proteins are found to aid in the repair system of double stranded breaks through clamping the two ends in close proximity which prevents interchromosomal invasion of the ends. If for any reason, such as activation of ribosomal RNA, cohesin activity is affected then there may be local increase in double stranded break repair errors.|$|E

40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of thymidylate in {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be inhibited by antifolate drugs. We {{have found that}} antifolate treatment enhances the formation of leucine prototrophs in a haploid strain of yeast carrying, on the same chromosome, two different mutant leu 2 alleles separated by Escherichia coli plasmid sequences. That this effect {{is a consequence of}} thymine nucleotide depletion was verified by the finding that provision of exogenous thymidylate eliminates the increased production of Leu+ colonies. DNA hybridization analysis revealed that recombination, including reciprocal exchange, gene conversion and <b>unequal</b> sister-chromatid <b>crossing</b> <b>over,</b> between the duplicated genes gave rise to the induced Leu + segregants. Although gene conversion unaccompanied by <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> was responsible for the major fraction of leucine prototrophs, events involving reciprocal exchange exhibited the largest increase in frequency. These data show that recombination is induced between directly repeated DNA sequences under conditions of thymine nucleotide depletion. In addition, the results of this and previous studies are consistent with the possibility that inhibition of thymidylate biosynthesis in yeast may create a metabolic condition that provokes all forms of mitotic recombination...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of repeated genes forming a multigene {{family in a}} finite population is studied with special reference to the probability of gene identity, i. e., the identity probability of two gene units chosen from the gene family.

The equilibrium properties of the means, the variances and the covariance of the two measures of clonality are investigated by using the diffusion equation method under the assumption of constant number of gene units in the multigene family. Some models of natural selection based on clonality are considered.

40|$|Immunoglobulin {{heavy chain}} genes {{were found in}} wild mice (Mus musculus) that could best be {{explained}} as recombinants of immunoglobulin genotypes. In wild mice from Kitty Hawk, N. C., two new heavy chain linkage groups, G 3, 5, 7, 8 H 9, 11 FfA- and G 3, 5, 8 H 9, 11 FfA-, were found, each of which genetically controls both the 3 and 5 distinct immunoglobulin determinants. In inbred strains the 3 and 5 determinants are found independently. The new heavy chain allotype G 3, 5, 7, 8 H 9, 11 FfA- probably arose from a homologous (intragenic) cross-over between G 3, 8 H 9, 11 FfA- and G 5, 7, 8 H 9, 11 FfA 14 heavy chain linkage groups. It was suggested that genes controlling G 3, 8 G 5, 7, 8, G 3, 5, 8, and G 3, 5, 7, 8 are alleles. Another homozygous wild mouse (Kyushu, Japan) showed a new heavy chain allotype, 2 G 1, 6, 7, 8 H 9, 16 FsA 15. The 2 and G 1, 6, 7, 8 determinants are also separated in inbred strains.

40|$|The genetic {{mechanism}} of the rare occurrence of Cis-AB expression, that is, AB and/or O offspring from AB X O parents, has not been fully understood. The synthesis of blood group A and B substances are controlled by N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (A-enzyme) and galactosyltransferase (B-enzyme). Therefore, the genetic {{mechanism of}} Cis-AB expression may be elucidated by examining the characteristics of A- and B-enzymes in Cis-AB plasma. In a previous study, we presented evidence that Cis-AB expression in one case examined was due to <b>unequal</b> chromosomal <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> producing a single chromosome with the genes for A. and B-enzymes, rather than to a structural mutation producing a single abnormal enzyme with bifunctional activity. In contrast to the previous case, the present two Cis-AB plasma contained a single abnormal enzyme that can transfer both N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) and galactose (Gal). Moreover, the subjects' plasma also contained an enzymatically inactive, but immunologically cross-reacting material.

40|$|Haplotype {{analysis}} was undertaken in 20 cases of 15 q 11 -q 13 deletion associated with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or Angelman syndrome (AS) {{to determine if}} these deletions arose through <b>unequal</b> meiotic <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> between homologous chromosomes. Of these, six cases of PWS and three of AS were informative for markers {{on both sides of}} the deletion. For four of six cases of paternal 15 q 11 -q 13 deletion (PWS), markers {{on both sides of the}} deletion breakpoints were inferred to be of the same grandparental origin, implying an intrachromosomal origin of the deletion. Although the remaining two PWS cases showed evidence of <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> between markers flanking the deletion, this was not more frequent than expected by chance given the genetic distance between proximal and distal markers. It is therefore possible that all PWS deletions were intrachromosomal in origin with the deletion event occurring after normal meiosis I recombination. Alternatively, both sister chromatid and homologous chromosome unequal exchange during meiosis may contribute to these deletions. In contrast, all three cases of maternal 15 q 11 -q 13 deletion (AS) were associated with <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> between flanking markers, which suggests significantly more recombination than expected by chance (p = 0. 002). Therefore, there appears to be more than one mechanism which may lead to PWS/AS deletions or the resolution of recombination intermediates may differ depending on the parental origin of the deletion. Furthermore, 13 of 15 cases of 15 q 11 -q 13 duplication, triplication, or inversion duplication had a distal duplication breakpoint which differed from the common distal deletion breakpoint. The presence of at least four distal breakpoint sites in duplications indicates that the mechanisms of rearrangement may be complex and multiple repeat sequences may be involved...|$|R

40|$|The {{herbicide}} glyphosate became {{widely used}} in the United States {{and other parts of}} the world after the commercialization of glyphosate- resistant crops. These crops have constitutive overexpression of a glyphosate-insensitive form of the herbicide target site gene, 5 -enolpyruvylshikimate- 3 -phosphate synthase (EPSPS). Increaseduse of glyphosate overmultiple years imposes selective genetic pressure on weed populations. We investigated recently discovered glyphosate- resistant Amaranthus palmer i populations from Georgia, in comparison with normally sensitive populations. EPSPS enzyme activity from resistant and susceptible plants was equally inhibited by glyphosate, which led us to use quantitative PCR to measure relative copy numbers of the EPSPS gene. Genomes of resistant plants contained from 5 -foldtomore than 160 -foldmore copies of the EPSPSgenethan did genomes of susceptible plants. Quantitative RT-PCR on cDNA revealed that EPSPS expression was positively correlated with genomic EPSPS relative copy number. Immunoblot analyses showed that increased EPSPS protein level also correlated with EPSPS genomic copy number. EPSPS gene amplification was heritable, correlated with resistance in pseudo-F 2 populations, and is proposed to be the molecular basis of glyphosate resistance. FISH revealed that EPSPS genes were present on every chromosome and, therefore, gene amplification was likely not caused by <b>unequal</b> chromosome <b>crossing</b> <b>over.</b> This occurrence of geneamplification as an herbicide resistance mechanism in a naturally occurring weed population is particularly significant because it could threaten the sustainable use of glyphosate- resistant crop technology.

50|$|Gene {{redundancy}} {{most often}} results from Gene duplication. When a gene is duplicated within a genome, the two copies are initially functionally redundant. Three {{of the more}} common mechanisms of gene duplication are retroposition, <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over,</b> and non-homologous segmental duplication. Retroposition is when the mRNA transcript of a gene is reverse transcribed back into DNA and inserted into the genome at a different location. During <b>unequal</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over,</b> homologous chromosomes exchange uneven portions of their DNA. This {{can lead to the}} transfer of one chromosome's gene to the other chromosome, leaving two of the same gene on one chromosome, and no copies of the gene on the other chromosome. Non-homologous duplications result from replication errors that shift the gene of interest into a new position. A tandem duplication then occurs, creating a chromosome with two copies of the same gene. Figure 1 to the left provides a good visual explanation of these three mechanisms. As the genome is replicated over many generations, the redundant gene's function will most likely evolve due to Genetic drift. This means that the gene will acquire mutations that change the overall function. The three mechanisms of functional differentiation in genes are nonfunctionalization (or gene loss), neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization.|$|E
