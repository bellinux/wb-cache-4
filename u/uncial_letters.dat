5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek <b>uncial</b> <b>letters,</b> arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves are}} unbound and {{are kept in}} loose quires. The text is written in late uncial script, in two columns per page, with mostly 19 lines per column, in large <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b> Palaeographically the writing {{is close to the}} Codex Seidelianus I.|$|E
5|$|The codex is an Alexandrian text-type {{manuscript}} {{written in}} the 4th century in <b>uncial</b> <b>letters</b> on parchment. Scholarship considers the Codex Sinaiticus {{to be one of}} the best Greek texts of the New Testament, along with the Codex Vaticanus. Until the discovery by Constantin von Tischendorf of the Sinaiticus text, the Codex Vaticanus was unrivaled.|$|E
2500|$|It is an ornamented codex, {{with full}} marginalia, as well illuminations such as {{pictures}} and golden ornaments. It {{is written in}} well rounded <b>uncials,</b> <b>Letters</b> are in general an imitation of those used before the introduction of compressed <b>uncials.</b> The <b>letters</b> are compressed {{only at the end}} of line. It is shown in Tregelles' facsimile, the oblong omicrons creep at the end of lines 2 and 4. Samuel Prideaux Tregelles found that the [...] "letters are in general an imitation of those used before the introduction of compressed uncials; but they do not belong to the age when full and round writing was customary or natural, so that the stiffness and want of ease is manifest".|$|R
5000|$|The text {{is written}} in one column per page, 35 lines per page, in about 36 letters per line. The <b>uncial</b> <b>letter</b> of the codex are written in a {{peculiar}} form with special attention. [...] "The uncials being of a peculiar kind, leaning {{a little to the}} right; they hold a sort of middle place between square and oblong characters.... The breathings and accents are primâ manu, and pretty correct..." ...|$|R
50|$|Often, {{in medieval}} manuscripts, old <b>uncial</b> <b>letter</b> forms were {{mixed in with}} the normal {{minuscule}} letters for writing titles or for emphasizing the initial letter of a word or sentence. Like in Latin, this became the root of the modern innovation of letter case, the systematic distinction between uppercase and lowercase letters in orthography. The uppercase letters of modern orthography are derived from the uncial script, while the lowercase letters are derived from minuscules.|$|R
5|$|The Codex Vaticanus (The Vatican, Bibl. Vat., Vat. gr. 1209; no. B or 03 Gregory-Aland, δ 1 von Soden) {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} extant manuscripts of the Greek Bible (Old and New Testament), one of the four great uncial codices. The Codex is named after its place of {{conservation}} in the Vatican Library, where it has been kept since at least the 15th century. It is written on 759 leaves of vellum in <b>uncial</b> <b>letters</b> and has been dated palaeographically to the 4th century.|$|E
5|$|The text is {{surrounded}} by a marginal commentary; it is the only codex that has both text and commentary in uncial script. The commentary is a catena of quotations of nine church fathers: Origen, Eusebius, Titus of Bostra, Basil, Isidore of Pelusium, Cyril of Alexandria, Sever from Antioch, Victor from Antioch, and Chrysostom. The commentary surrounds the single-column text of Luke on three sides. Patristic text is written in small <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b> Most of the quotations are those of Ciril of Alexandria (93 scholia); next comes Titus of Bostra (45 scholia). The commentary was written in a different kind of uncial script than the biblical text.|$|E
25|$|Ethiopian numerals were {{borrowed}} from the Greek numerals, possibly via Coptic <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|E
50|$|Similar {{developments}} {{have taken place}} in other alphabets. The lower-case script for the Greek alphabet has its origins in the 7th century and acquired its quadrilinear form in the 8th century. Over time, <b>uncial</b> <b>letter</b> forms were increasingly mixed into the script. The earliest dated Greek lower-case text is the Uspenski Gospels (MS 461) in the year 835. The modern practice of capitalising the first letter of every sentence seems to be imported (and is rarely used when printing Ancient Greek materials even today).|$|R
25|$|Desiderius Erasmus {{compiled}} {{the first}} printed {{edition of the}} Greek New Testament in 1516, basing his work on several manuscripts {{because he did not}} have a single complete work and because each manuscript had small errors. In the 18th century, Johann Jakob Wettstein was one of the first biblical scholars to start cataloging biblical manuscripts. He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used (uncial, minuscule) or format (lectionaries) and based on content (Gospels, Pauline letters, Acts + General epistles, and Revelation). He assigned the <b>uncials</b> <b>letters</b> and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.|$|R
50|$|The {{document}} {{was written by}} an unknown copyist. The measurements of the fragment are 232 by 183 mm. The text is written in an irregular <b>uncial</b> hand; <b>letter</b> epsilon tends to be very large, xi is written with three separate strokes.|$|R
25|$|New Testament lectionaries — usually written {{minuscule}} (but some in <b>uncial)</b> <b>letters</b> {{and generally}} contemporary.|$|E
25|$|Codex Marchalianus {{designated}} by siglum Q is a 6th-century Greek manuscript {{copy of the}} Greek version of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh or Old Testament) known as the Septuagint. The text was written on vellum in <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b> Palaeographically it has been assigned to the 6th century.|$|E
25|$|The text {{is written}} in <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b> It is well written in an {{informal}} book hand. There is no punctuation, no division between sayings. The nomina sacra are contracted in a usual way, the words {{at the end of}} each line are abbreviated and it uses ligatures, including staurograms.|$|E
50|$|The codex {{contains}} a small {{parts of the}} Gospel of Matthew 6:5-6,8-10,13-15,17, on one parchment leaf (25 cm by 20 cm). The text is written in two columns per page, 27 lines per page, in <b>uncial</b> letters.The <b>letters</b> are upright and carefully finished.|$|R

5000|$|Italian <b>uncial</b> has round <b>letters</b> ( [...] , , [...] etc.) with flatter tops, and a with a {{sharp bow}} (as in African uncial), an almost {{horizontal}} rather than vertical stem in , and forked finials (i.e., serifs in some letters such as , , [...] and [...] ).|$|R
25|$|Lectionary 183, {{designated}} by siglum ℓ 183 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering) is a Greek manuscript of the New Testament, on parchment, written in <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b> Westcott and Hort labelled it by 38e, Scrivener by 257e. Paleographically usually {{it has been}} assigned to the 10th century. The manuscript has some lacunae {{at the end and}} inside, but they were supplied by a later hand. It is faded in parts.|$|E
25|$|The {{handwriting}} {{found in}} New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often {{written in a}} distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between uncial script (or majuscule) and minuscule. The <b>uncial</b> <b>letters</b> were a consistent height between the baseline and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had ascenders and descenders that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Formerly it was bounded {{with the}} codex 566 in one manuscript. 556 {{contains}} Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Mark, {{it is written}} in minuscule letters. The {{two parts of the}} manuscript agree in form (two columns, 23 lines per column), in signatures, in the writing of the scholia, and text-type. The marginal notes are written in the same small <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b> The nomina sacra are abbreviated in the same way. Also errors (e.g. itacisms, N ephelkystikon, iota adscriptum, no iota subscriptum etc.) are of the same kind. It is sure that these two parts were written by the same hand. Alfred Rahlfs noted that codex E of the Septuagint was also written partly in uncials and partly in minuscules, in the ninth or tenth century when the change from one style of writing to the other was taking place.|$|E
5000|$|In later <b>uncial</b> scripts, the <b>letters</b> are {{sometimes}} drawn haphazardly; for example, [...] runs {{together at the}} baseline, bows (for example in , , [...] ) do not entirely curve in to touch their stems, and the script is generally not written as cleanly as previously.|$|R
50|$|The codex {{contains}} {{very small}} part of the Gospel of Mark 10:50.51; 11:11.12, on one parchment leaf (8 cm by 4,5 cm). The text is written in one column per page, 25 lines per page, 11-15 letters in line, in a calligraphic <b>uncial</b> hand. The <b>letters</b> A and M are not typical Egyptian.|$|R
50|$|The Oxyrhynchus Papyri have {{provided}} the most numerous sub-group of the earliest copies of the New Testament. These are surviving portions of codices (books) written in Greek <b>uncial</b> (capital) <b>letters</b> on papyrus. The first of these were excavated by Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt in Oxyrhynchus, {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. Of the 127 registered New Testament papyri, 52 (41%) are from Oxyrhynchus. The earliest of the papyri are dated to the middle of the 2nd century, so were copied within about a century of the writing of the original New Testament documents.|$|R
2500|$|The biblical text {{is written}} on 444 {{parchment}} leaves (...) in one column per page with 23 lines per page in large <b>uncial</b> <b>letters.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{supplied}} {{leaves are}} also written in <b>uncial</b> <b>letters,</b> {{but in a}} widely in different style, [...] "with thicker downstrokes and very thin upstrokes".|$|E
2500|$|The <b>uncial</b> <b>letters</b> of this codex are large, upright, not round, and compressed. In some of {{the pages}} letters are very large. It {{contains}} lectionary markings on the margin, Synaxarion (list of Saints) on pages 1–18, with Menologion (Saint days), and the Eusebian Canon tables on pages 19–28. It contains subscriptions after each of three first Gospels. In Matthew: ...|$|E
5|$|The lower {{text of the}} {{manuscript}} contains fragments of the chapters 1:1-11:33 of the Gospel of Luke. The codex comprises 86 thick, coarse parchment leaves and three partial leaves; it measures 36 x 29cm. The text was written in a single column with well-formed <b>uncial</b> script. The <b>letters</b> are large, round and narrow, without spiritus asper, spiritus lenis, or accents. The manuscript was written by two scribes.|$|R
25|$|The Cyrillic {{script was}} created in the First Bulgarian Empire. Its first variant, the Early Cyrillic alphabet, was created at the Preslav Literary School. It is derived from the Greek <b>uncial</b> script <b>letters,</b> {{augmented}} by ligatures and consonants from the older Glagolitic alphabet for sounds not found in Greek. Tradition holds that Cyrillic and Glagolitic were formalized either by Saints Cyril and Methodius who brought Christianity to the southern Slavs, or by their disciples. Paul Cubberley posits that although Cyril may have codified and expanded Glagolitic, it was his students in the First Bulgarian Empire under Tsar Simeon the Great that developed Cyrillic from the Greek letters in the 890s as a more suitable script for church books. Later Cyrillic spread among other Slavic peoples, as well as among non-Slavic Vlachs and Moldavians.|$|R
5000|$|Ligature {{is writing}} {{the letters of}} words with lines {{connecting}} the letters so that {{one does not have}} to pick up the pen or pencil between letters. Commonly some of the letters are written in a looped manner to facilitate the connections. In common American speech, when persons say [...] "cursive" [...] with reference to writing English, they mean ligature. But in common printed Greek texts, the modern small letter fonts are called [...] "cursive" [...] (as opposed to <b>uncial)</b> though the <b>letters</b> do not connect.|$|R
2500|$|The codex {{contains}} the complete {{text of the}} Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John on 157 parchment leaves ( [...] by [...] ). The leaves are arranged in quarto, that is four leaves folded in quires. The text is written in two columns per page, 23 lines per page. There are no spaces between letters, and the words are not separate but written in scriptio continua. The <b>uncial</b> <b>letters</b> are small, not beautiful and slanting. The letters are characterized by Slavonic uncials. The writing {{is similar to that}} of Codex Cyprius.|$|E
2500|$|The text {{is written}} in Greek <b>uncial</b> <b>letters,</b> in two columns per page, 22 lines per page. The margins are wide, the text {{measures}} 24.5 by 16.5cm. The first page is in red and gold, the rest pages in black ink, much faded in parts. The handwriting is large and elegant. The large initial letters are rubricated, the headpieces are decorated in colours and gold [...] (folios 1r, 64r, 95r, 132r, and 238r). The small initials in red ink. The breathings (rough breathing, smooth breathing), and accents in red, they are given correctly, without any pretensions to correctness. The words are written continuously without any separation. The nomina sacra are written in an abbreviated way.|$|E
6000|$|... 'One day Cyril {{left town}} {{to stay with}} his grandfather, I thought at the time, but I {{afterwards}} heard from Lord Crediton {{that this was not}} the case; and about a fortnight afterwards I received a telegram from him, handed in at Warwick, asking me to be sure to come and dine with him that evening at eight o'clock. When I arrived, he said to me, [...] "The only apostle who did not deserve proof was St. Thomas, and St. Thomas was the only apostle who got it." [...] I asked him what he meant. He answered that he had not merely been able to establish the existence in the sixteenth century of a boy-actor of the name of Willie Hughes, but to prove by the most conclusive evidence that he was the Mr. W. H. of the Sonnets. He would not tell me anything more at the time; but after dinner he solemnly produced the picture I showed you, and {{told me that he had}} discovered it by the merest chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had bought at a farmhouse in Warwickshire. The chest itself, which was a very fine example of Elizabethan work, he had, of course, brought with him, and in the centre of the front panel the initials W. H. were undoubtedly carved. It was this monogram that had attracted his attention, and he told me that it was not till he had had the chest in his possession for several days that he had thought of making any careful examination of the inside. One morning, however, he saw that one of the sides of the chest was much thicker than the other, and looking more closely, he discovered that a framed panel picture was clamped against it. On taking it out, he found it was the picture that is now lying on the sofa. It was very dirty, and covered with mould; but he managed to clean it, and, to his great joy, saw that he had fallen by mere chance on the one thing for which he had been looking. Here was an authentic portrait of Mr. W. H., with his hand resting on the dedicatory page of the Sonnets, and on the frame itself could be faintly seen the name of the young man written in black <b>uncial</b> <b>letters</b> on a faded gold ground, [...] "Master Will. Hews." ...|$|E
50|$|The Glagolitic {{alphabet}} {{was created}} by the monk Saint Cyril, possibly with the aid of his brother Saint Methodius, around 863. Cyrillic, on the other hand, may have been a creation of Cyril's students (most notable of which was Clement of Ohrid) in the 890s at the Preslav Literary School under Bulgarian Tsar Simeon the Great as a more suitable script for church books, though retaining the original Bulgarian symbols in Glagolitic. An alternative hypothesis proposes that it emerged in the border regions of Greek proselytization to the Slavs before it was codified and adapted by some systematizer among the Slavs; the oldest Cyrillic manuscripts look very similar to 9th and 10th century Greek uncial manuscripts, and the majority of <b>uncial</b> Cyrillic <b>letters</b> were identical to their Greek uncial counterparts. One possibility is that this systematization of Cyrillic was undertaken at the Council of Preslav in 893, when the Old Church Slavonic liturgy was adopted by the Bulgarian Empire.|$|R
50|$|Minuscule writing {{remained}} in use for handwriting throughout the Byzantine {{and into the}} post-Byzantine era. In the modern era, western printers used minuscule book hands {{as a model for}} developing early Greek print fonts. Like with Latin, it became common to mix minuscule writing with some <b>uncial</b> or capital <b>letters,</b> with the latter used for emphasis, in titles and initials. From this practice, the modern orthographic system of letter case for Greek arose. In modern Greek writing, the upper case letters are generally modeled on the letter shapes of ancient inscriptions, while the lower case letters are based on the tradition of minuscule handwriting.|$|R
5000|$|The {{letters are}} a little unusual, in form small, and their {{character}} is between uncial and minuscule, and in the 19th century the codex was classified as a minuscule manuscript (catalogue number 53). Tregelles argued {{that they are more}} uncial by character, they are almost entirely separate, and sometimes joined in the same word. [...] "They are certainly by no means cursive, in the common acceptation of the term". According to Scrivener they [...] "can hardly be called semicursive". According to Günther Zuntz it is an <b>uncial</b> manuscript, its <b>letters</b> are that kind of uncial script, which scribes of the 10th and later centuries used.|$|R
