50|$|An {{absolute}} discharge is an <b>unconditional</b> <b>discharge</b> {{where the}} Court finds that a crime has technically been committed, but that any punishment {{of the defendant}} would be inappropriate, and the case is closed. In some jurisdictions, an absolute discharge means there is no conviction on the defendant's record, despite the plea of the defendant.|$|E

Noting that the accused had turned his life around since the arrest, Mondor {{said that it would}} not be in society's interest to burden him with a criminal record.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Gilbert Rozon {{received}} an <b>unconditional</b> <b>discharge</b> from the Quebec Superior Court after pleading and being {{found guilty of}} a sexual assault on a 19-year-old woman, because a criminal record {{would have made it}} difficult for him to travel internationally for his work.

50|$|In October 2004, Dugas {{was charged}} with sexual assault and sexually {{touching}} an adolescent under his authority. Both charges stemmed from a single incident the previous year involving a seventeen-year-old boy. Dugas immediately resigned from MICU to sit as an independent and continued to serve on council until in the 2005 municipal election, {{in which he was}} not a candidate. On June 1, 2006, he was acquitted of the sexual assault charge but found guilty of sexual touching; he did not contest the charge and wrote a letter of apology to his victim that was read in court.

5000|$|Archuleta filed a pro se {{petition}} (a {{petition to}} represent himself) for habeas corpus relief (seeking relief for unlawful detention) in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Western District of Missouri in October, 2002 requesting an <b>unconditional</b> <b>discharge</b> and release from confinement {{in the prison}} hospital. He argued that the statute under which he was committed is unconstitutional because only a judicial unit, not an administrative one, can determine the length and conditions of his sentence and also whether his confinement after his successful NGRI defense could exceed the sentence he would have received if found guilty under the law. He further argued that his confinement in the prison facility far from the court was equal to [...] "banishment and exile" [...] and that [...] "forced treatment" [...] violated the Eighth Amendment. He also contested the finding that he had violated the terms of his conditional release, saying {{that he did not}} refuse the forced treatment [...] "but for the exception of being late on taking his anti-psychotic medication... one day". He also requested to withdraw his insanity defense.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the distant}} future, long after mankind has {{discovered}} faster-than-light flight and has since colonized most of the inhabitable worlds across the galaxy. F.U.B. was once a pretty uncultured and incapable catering officer with questionable sanity in the Sector Marines, often screwing up the field kitchens and dropping jars of Plusgrial fnart jiz powder into the cooking pot. F.U.B. (which stands [...] "fat ugly boy", a name he was never able to escape) finally lost his mind on a barren desert front during a relatively minor skirmish of the last 40 years. Not wanting to let [...] "the boys" [...] down and unable to find any meat, F.U.B. amputated his own legs, cooked them and served them up to the soldiers in a hot broth. Despite it being the best dish he had ever created, F.U.B. was given an <b>unconditional</b> <b>discharge</b> and asked never to show his face again. Vowing to get revenge on the worlds of man for his banishment and exile, F.U.B. replaces his legs with mechanical, hydraulic-powered replacements and becomes a feared and egotistical space pirate, attracting other fragile minds to his cause. He undertakes a dramatic, bizarre and insane appearance; wearing furry dice, smoking Havana cigars and tattooing a target on his portly belly.|$|E
40|$|If no {{attempts}} {{are made}} to determine the monetary and non-monetary reasons for bankruptcy or its recurrence, debtors {{may be more likely}} to choose bankruptcy, or remain in the cycle of bankruptcy. Credit counselling is one mechanism that can assist consumers in paying back debts without resorting to bankruptcy, thereby preventing repeat bankruptcies and heavy debt loads in the future. Canada passed a major milestone in 1992, becoming the first country to make financial counselling mandatory prior to the granting of an <b>unconditional</b> <b>discharge</b> from personal bankruptcy. This article describes the history of the policy analysis involved in making consumer education an integral part of insolvency counselling...|$|E
