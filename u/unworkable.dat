5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the topsoil. Previously <b>unworkable</b> low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
5|$|The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (or CLASS Act) {{was enacted}} as Title VIII of the ACA. It {{would have created}} a {{voluntary}} and public long-term care insurance option for employees. In October 2011 the administration announced it was <b>unworkable</b> and would be dropped. The CLASS Act was repealed January 1, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Folding@home {{uses the}} Cosm {{software}} libraries for networking. Folding@home was launched on October1, 2000, {{and was the}} first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems. Its first client was a screensaver, which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use. In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with David P. Anderson to test a supplemental client on the open-source BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005; however, the method became <b>unworkable</b> and was shelved in June 2006.|$|E
5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters to work in an operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered <b>unworkable</b> as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and receiver in the interceptor aircraft.|$|E
5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} {{mezzanine}} floor {{into an area}} {{that could be used}} as an arts venue, cinema, music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150people. New plans cost £60,000. However this new design was deemed to be <b>unworkable.</b> A second design consisted of another six-storey building with a large ground-floor shop, a first-storey car park, and four floors of flats. This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design, and did not include the tower. The plan was initially rejected by the council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate. Several later applications for the site were also rejected, particularly due to concerns over parking, and the site was vacant as of June 2015.|$|E
5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would be that much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed <b>unworkable</b> by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E
5|$|Discovery {{procedures}} for defendants began with adoption of state {{laws in the}} 1920s. In the following decades, courts began instituting new procedures. In 1962, for example, the California Supreme Court ordered reciprocal discovery rules, without an initial law requiring it. However, a series of problems surfaced with this judicially imposed system. Not only did both sides refuse to share intended testimony, but no 'alibi notice rule' was fashioned, leading to an <b>unworkable</b> position for both sides. In 1974, the California Supreme Court ordered the legislature to create the discovery system, ending the state's experiment with judicial discovery rule-making.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the {{standard}} complement of each submarine was six officers and thirty-six sailors, with facilities to carry an additional twelve personnel (usually trainees). This number was minimised by the RAN during design, which insisted that functions be automated where possible; the RAN also requiring that each sailor {{have his own}} rack and {{did not need to}} 'hot bunk'. It was originally intended that multiple ship's companies be established per submarine, and that these be rotated to maximise the submarines' time at sea without adversely affecting personnel, but difficulties in maintaining submariner numbers made this plan <b>unworkable.</b> Enlisted submariners are accommodated in six-bunk cabins.|$|E
5|$|The Fifth Doctor's {{first story}} was {{originally}} intended to be the four-part Project Zeta Sigma, written by John Flanagan & Andrew McCulloch. It {{was not intended to}} follow on directly from the events of Logopolis; instead, the Doctor and his companions would have already left Earth. The story was to concern nuclear disarmament. Commissioned as Project '4G on 7 October 1980, the script proved <b>unworkable,</b> and producer John Nathan-Turner dropped the story on 19 February 1981. He then commissioned recently departed script editor Christopher H. Bidmead to write a replacement which became Castrovalva. This last minute change disrupted the shooting schedule, meaning that Castrovalva would be the fourth serial of the series filmed, though {{it would be the first}} transmitted.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of thermonuclear weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be <b>unworkable.</b> There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim thermonuclear design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true thermonuclear design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} {{as manager of}} Burton Albion in October 1962 after impressing the chairman with {{his knowledge of the}} game. He built a strong team and led the club to victory in the Southern League Cup in 1964. In 1965, Clough appointed him as his assistant at Hartlepools United, and Taylor helped Clough to rebuild the playing squad. The pair moved on to Derby County in May 1967, taking the club to the Second Division title in 1968–69, then the First Division title in 1971–72, and the semi-finals of the European Cup in 1973. The duo resigned in October 1973 after their strained relationship with the club's board of directors became <b>unworkable.</b> Clough and Taylor moved on to Brighton & Hove Albion in November 1973, and Taylor stayed on as manager after Clough left Brighton in July 1974.|$|E
5|$|Seattle filed {{a lawsuit}} on September 23, 2007 {{in an attempt to}} keep the Sonics from leaving before the end of their lease in 2010. The trial was set for June 16, 2008. On April 10, 2008, Seattle asked the Federal District Court to order the NBA to release {{documents}} related to the financial situation of each team, the claim that the SuperSonics' lease with KeyArena was financially <b>unworkable,</b> and the league's involvement in requiring PBC to make a good-faith effort to stay in Seattle. On April 28, the trial's presiding judge, Loretta Preska, ruled that the NBA must supply the internal documents about the possible relocation of the Sonics that the city of Seattle had requested. In addition, the judge said that Stern could be deposed at a later day should the need arise. The city hoped the documents would aid in building its legal case, and cited an email conversation among members of the ownership group that suggested they were privately discussing intent to move the team while publicly insisting that they would not attempt to do so.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1800s and early 1900s {{there were a}} number of {{resettlement}} plans for European Jews that were precursors to the Madagascar Plan. Paul de Lagarde, an Orientalist scholar, first suggested evacuating the European Jews to Madagascar in his 1878 work Deutsche Schriften ("German Writings"). Members of the Zionist movement in 1904–1905 seriously debated the British Uganda Programme, by which Russian Jews, who were in immediate danger from ongoing pogroms, would be settled in what today is Kenya. The plan was later rejected as <b>unworkable</b> by the Zionist Congress. Adherents of territorialism split off from the main Zionist movement and continued to search for a location where Jews might settle and create a state, or at least an autonomous area. The idea of Jewish resettlement in Madagascar was promoted by British antisemites Henry Hamilton Beamish, Arnold Leese, and others. With the cooperation of the French, the Polish government commissioned a task force in 1937 to examine the possibility of deporting Polish Jews to the island. The head of the commission, , felt the island could accommodate 5,000 to 7,000 families, but Jewish members of the group estimated that only 500 or even fewer families could safely be accommodated.|$|E
5|$|Only Lion was {{completed}} {{to the original}} design, which had the fore funnel placed between the forward superstructure and the tripod foremast. This meant that hot clinkers and flue gases from the boilers made the spotting top on the foremast completely <b>unworkable</b> when the ships were steaming at high speed, that the upper bridge could easily be rendered uninhabitable, depending on the wind, and that the signal flags and halyards were at risk of burning. Both ships were altered to correct this problem, Lion before being commissioned, and Princess Royal as she was fitting out, at a total cost of £68,170. The fore funnel was moved aft, the original fore and mainmasts exchanged position, and the foremast was now just a pole mast, not a tripod. The spotting tower {{at the rear of}} the conning tower was removed, the conning tower enlarged, the nine-foot Argo rangefinder was moved from the foremast spotting top to the roof of the conning tower, and all the funnels were raised to the same height. As part of these modifications, the two 4-inch guns mounted above the forward group of casemates were enclosed in casemates of their own to protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action.|$|E
25|$|The Bill's {{second reading}} debates in late March 1920 {{revealed}} that already {{a large number}} of Irish members of parliament present felt that the proposals were <b>unworkable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Southey was {{the first}} to reject the idea as <b>unworkable,</b> {{suggesting}} that they move the intended location to Wales, but when they failed to agree the plan was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|An {{agreement}} was signed between OMF Flugzeugwerk and Symphony Aircraft {{to produce the}} design on two production lines in North America and Europe. This soon proved <b>unworkable</b> and OMF Flugzeugwerk sold out their interests to SAI in February 2005.|$|E
25|$|The Vikings {{initially}} {{supported a}} Superfund site in Arden Hills, but costs of developing infrastructure made the site <b>unworkable.</b> A number of sites in Minneapolis were floated, before {{the team and}} state settled on a location adjacent to and including the current Metrodome site.|$|E
25|$|A {{proposal}} for non-stop express service between 59th Street and the World Trade Center {{was found to}} be <b>unworkable</b> due to existing lines running at capacity and the inclusion of the JFK Express on the IND Eighth Avenue Line south of West Fourth Street.|$|E
25|$|On February 9, 2006, the US Department of Defense (DOD) filed a brief {{stating that}} an {{injunction}} {{shutting down the}} BlackBerry service while excluding government users was <b>unworkable.</b> The DOD also stated that the BlackBerry was crucial for national security given {{the large number of}} government users.|$|E
25|$|His {{other major}} reason was practical: he {{considered}} the geographical dispersion of the English congregations made the operation of a separate classis <b>unworkable,</b> as the regular meetings required for effective supervision would be impossible. This was a problem, he maintained, had already vitiated the operation of a French or Walloon classis.|$|E
25|$|Flood waters {{typically}} inundate farm land, {{making the}} land <b>unworkable</b> and preventing crops from being planted or harvested, {{which can lead}} to shortages of food both for humans and farm animals. Entire harvests for a country can be lost in extreme flood circumstances. Some tree species may not survive prolonged flooding of their root systems.|$|E
25|$|In a {{separate}} concurrence, Antonin Scalia wrote for himself, Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy that adverse personnel actions for speech by public employees violate the First Amendment only when their purpose is clearly retaliatory, as {{he believed it}} had been in Pickering. He attacked the plurality opinion as creating a poorly defined procedural requirement that might well prove <b>unworkable</b> in practice.|$|E
25|$|Large {{droughts}} hit the Yucatán Peninsula and Petén Basin {{areas with}} particular ferocity, as thin tropical soils decline in fertility and become <b>unworkable</b> when deprived of forest cover, {{and due to}} regular seasonal drought drying up surface water. Colonial Spanish officials accurately documented cycles of drought, famine, disease, and war, providing a reliable historical record of the basic drought pattern in the Maya region.|$|E
25|$|In August 1969 Taoiseach Jack Lynch asked Irish Army Intelligence {{to draft}} {{proposals}} {{for a military}} intervention and guerilla operations in Northern Ireland {{in order to protect}} Irish nationalists there from sectarian attack from Ulster loyalist mobs, under a plan known as Exercise Armageddon. However it was deemed <b>unworkable</b> and was not adopted by the cabinet. Nationalist areas were later given a form of protection by British forces under Operation Banner.|$|E
25|$|He {{proposed}} {{a plan in}} 1984, known as the MacBride Principles, which he argued would eliminate discrimination against Roman Catholics by employers in Northern Ireland and received widespread support {{for it in the}} United States and from Sinn Féin. However the MacBride Principles were criticised by the Irish and British Governments and most Northern Ireland parties, including the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), as <b>unworkable</b> and counterproductive.|$|E
25|$|This {{demonstrates}} that for integrals on unbounded intervals, uniform convergence of a function is {{not strong enough}} to allow passing a limit through an integral sign. This makes the Riemann integral <b>unworkable</b> in applications (even though the Riemann integral assigns both sides the correct value), because there is no other general criterion for exchanging a limit and a Riemann integral, and without such a criterion it is difficult to approximate integrals by approximating their integrands.|$|E
25|$|The 1960 Constitution of the Cyprus Republic proved <b>unworkable</b> however, lasting {{only three}} years. Greek Cypriots {{wanted to end}} the {{separate}} Turkish Cypriot municipal councils permitted by the British in 1958, made subject to review under the 1960 agreements. For many Greek Cypriots these municipalities were the first stage {{on the way to}} the partition they feared. The Greek Cypriots wanted enosis, integration with Greece, while Turkish Cypriots wanted taksim, partition between Greece and Turkey.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, when Shindo was 91, he {{directed}} Owl (Fukurō) {{based on a}} true story of farmers sent back from Japanese colonies in Manchuria to <b>unworkable</b> farmland at the end of the Second World War. The entire film was shot on a single set, partly because of Shindo's mobility problems. The film was entered into the 25th Moscow International Film Festival where Shindo won a special award for his contribution to world cinema.|$|E
25|$|As the {{charterer}} {{was responsible}} for paying for the aircraft's entire capacity regardless of whether all seats were filled, {{there was a great}} temptation to let people, who were not eligible to travel under the affinity group rules, take the seats of other, eligible travellers who had cancelled their bookings. As a result, there were numerous occasions on which the airlines got into trouble with the authorities {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic. This made the system increasingly <b>unworkable.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1897, a {{group of}} {{building}} trades unions from the Midwest formed the National Building Trades Council (NBTC) to adjudicate jurisdictional battles and encourage the amalgamation of construction and building unions. But the NBTC structure also proved <b>unworkable.</b> Many national and international unions refused to join, few unions abided by its jurisdictional decisions, and membership {{on the local level}} was spotty. The (AFL) accused the group of dual unionism in 1899 and subsequently established its own building trades councils.|$|E
25|$|The {{proponents of}} {{industrial}} unionism, {{on the other}} hand, generally believed that craft distinctions may have been appropriate in those industries in which craft unions had flourished, such as construction or printing, but they were <b>unworkable</b> in industries such as steel or auto production. In their view, dividing workers in a single plant {{into a number of}} different crafts represented by separate organizations, each with its own agenda, would weaken the workers' bargaining power and leave the majority, who had few traditional craft skills, completely unrepresented.|$|E
25|$|The neutron was {{discovered}} in 1932. The concept of a nuclear chain reaction brought about by nuclear reactions mediated by neutrons was first realized shortly thereafter, by Hungarian scientist Leó Szilárd, in 1933. He filed a patent for his idea of a simple reactor the following year while working at the Admiralty in London. However, Szilárd's idea did not incorporate the idea of nuclear fission as a neutron source, since that process was not yet discovered. Szilárd's ideas for nuclear reactors using neutron-mediated nuclear chain reactions in light elements proved <b>unworkable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tongans {{no longer}} make an earth oven every day. Most daily cooking is done by women, who cook in {{battered}} pots over open fires in the village, in wood-burning stoves in some households, and on gas or electric ranges {{in some of the}} larger towns. The meal schedule has also changed, to more Westernized breakfast, light lunch, and heavy dinner. Tongans say that the old schedule is <b>unworkable</b> when household members have Western-style jobs, or attend schools at some distance from home; such family members cannot come home to eat, then have a doze after a heavy mid-day meal.|$|E
25|$|The mini-{{television}} {{series was}} written by Paul Abbott and aired on British television channel BBC One in MayJune2003 and on BBC America in April2004. Abbott was initially reluctant to sell the film rights to State of Play, fearing a compressed version of his mini-series would be <b>unworkable,</b> but in May2004 a seven-figure Paramount Pictures-backed bid led by producer Scott Rudin was accepted. The bid prevailed over an offer from Andrew Hauptman's Mission Pictures (backed by Warner Bros.), but the deal fell through before completion. After a second bidding war, Mission acquired the rights for Universal Pictures in December 2004.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the band}} was {{initially}} based in Cape Town (five of the group's six members came from the Eastern Cape), they came to prominence at the 1963 National Jazz Festival in Johannesburg. An album recorded after the festival was released as Jazz – The African Sound, {{but this was not}} a Blue Notes record per se, it was rather an album featuring some of the Blue Notes in a big band put together by McGregor. This big band was intended to continue touring, but proved <b>unworkable.</b> Instead, The Blue Notes continued as a quintet, then sextet.|$|E
