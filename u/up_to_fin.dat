50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{speciality}} surf kayak designs available. They are often equipped with <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four <b>fins</b> with a three fin thruster set up being the most common. Speciality surf kayaks typically have flat bottoms, and hard rails, similar to surf boards. The design of a surf kayak promotes the use of an ocean surf wave (moving wave) as opposed to a river or feature wave (moving water). They are typically made from glass composites (mixtures of carbon fiber, Kevlar and fiberglass) or rotomolded plastic.|$|R
50|$|Zeiform {{bodies are}} usually thin and deep. Mouths are large, with distensible jaws, {{and there is}} no orbitosphenoid.

40|$|Program LRCDM 2 was {{developed}} for supersonic missiles with axisymmetric bodies and <b>up</b> <b>to</b> two <b>finned</b> sections. Predicted are pressure distributions and loads acting on a complete configuration including effects of body separated flow vorticity and fin-edge vortices. The computer program is based on supersonic panelling and line singularity methods coupled with vortex tracking theory. Effects of afterbody shed vorticity on the afterbody and tail-fin pressure distributions can be optionally treated by companion program BDYSHD. Preliminary versions of combined shock expansion/linear theory and Newtonian/linear theory have been implemented as optional pressure calculation methods to extend the Mach number and angle-of-attack ranges of applicability into the nonlinear supersonic flow regime. Comparisons between program results and experimental data are given for a triform tail-finned configuration and for a canard controlled configuration with a long afterbody for Mach numbers <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2. 5.

Her ingenuous nature makes her the perfect prey for the cruel magnetism of the demonic musician Svengali, under whose spell she falls. Using hypnotic powers Svengali shapes her into a virtuoso singer and soon she becomes Europe's most captivating soprano. But her golden voice, and even her life, will become fatally tied to him.

5000|$|Surf kayaking {{comes in}} two main varieties, High Performance (HP) and International Class (IC). HP boats {{tend to have}} a lot of nose rocker, little to no tail rocker, flat hulls, sharp rails and <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four <b>fins</b> set <b>up</b> as either a three fin {{thruster}} or a quad fin. This enables them to move at high speed and maneuver dynamically. IC boats have to be at least 3 m long and until a recent rule change had to have a [...] hull; now flat and slightly [...] hulls are also allowed, although fins are not. Surfing on international boats tends to be smoother and more flowing, and they are thought of as kayaking's long boarding. Surf boats come in a variety of materials ranging from tough but heavy plastics to super light, super stiff but fragile foam-cored carbon fiber. Surf kayaking has become popular in traditional surfing locations, as well as new locations such as the Great Lakes.|$|R
40|$|New {{wind tunnel}} data have been taken, {{and a new}} {{empirical}} model has been developed for predicting base drag on missile configurations. The new wind tunnel data were taken at NASA-Langley in the Unitary Wind Tunnel at Mach numbers from 2. 0 to 4. 5, angles of attack <b>to</b> 16 deg, <b>fin</b> control deflections <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 20 deg, <b>fin</b> thickness/chord of 0. 05 to 0. 15, and fin locations from 'flush with the base' to two chord-lengths upstream of the base. The empirical model uses these data along with previous wind tunnel data, estimating base drag {{as a function of}} all these variables as well as boat-tail and power-on/power-off effects. The new model yields improved accuracy, compared to wind tunnel data. The new model also is more robust due to inclusion of additional variables. On the other hand, additional wind tunnel data are needed to validate or modify the current empirical model in areas where data are not available...|$|R

50|$|The P-16 was {{designed}} to be especially well-suited to the close-support role, and short-field performance was also emphasized. The resulting aircraft was a single-seat, single-engine design with intakes on the fuselage sides and a low wing. The horizontal stabilizer was mounted halfway <b>up</b> the <b>fin.</b> <b>To</b> ensure good performance from unprepared fields, heavy undercarriage and dual wheels and tires were fitted. The straight, low aspect ratio wing was of multi-spar construction with various high-lift devices including full-span Krueger flaps on the leading edge, large Fowler-type flaps on the inboard trailing edge, and ailerons which also operated as flaps. These devices allowed the aircraft to take off and land within 1,000 ft (330 m) at high altitude, allowing it to operate from the Alpine valleys characteristic of Switzerland.|$|R

40|$|Pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila {{bacteria}} {{was tested}} on the stinging catfish Heteropneustes fossilis. Before artificial infection the morphological, biochemical and physiological characters of Aeromonas hydrophila were studied. The infections were done by two different methods, viz., intramuscular (IM) and intraperitoneal (IP) injection. In infection experiment, {{each group of}} 10 fish were injected either intramuscularly or intra peritoneally with one dose higher than the LD 50 dose (9. 6 x 107 CFU/fish). All the fish tested died within 1 to 9 days. Both in cases of intramuscular and intraperitoneal injection, external pathology were found. Haemorrhagic lesions were evident {{at the site of}} injection. The posterior end of the body surface was found to develop greyish-white lesion that was extended <b>up</b> <b>to</b> caudal <b>fin.</b> Hyperemic anal region and the fin bases were also observed. Total bacterial loads in liver, kidney and intestine were determined. Aeromonas hydrophila could be isolated from liver, kidney and intestine of the experimentally infected fish. In case of intramuscular injection the highest and the lowest bacterial load was found to be 2. 4 x 107 CFU/g of liver and 2. 1 x 102 CFU/g of kidney and in case of intraperitoneal injection they were found to be 3. 6 x 106 CFU/g of kidney and 1. 2 x 104 CFU/g of kidney respectively.

500|$|The {{fourth and}} fifth {{aircraft}} of the parade batch were used in flight tests to eliminate the engine flameout problem from late 1947 through early 1948.

This allowed all three cannon to be fired simultaneously at altitudes <b>up</b> <b>to</b> , but the <b>fin</b> disintegrated after only 813 shots, which could be very dangerous if the debris from the fin was ingested by the engines. An additional problem was that the fin hampered the directional stability of the aircraft and caused it to yaw after 3–5 shots. Another attempt to fix the problem was made in the I-302 (izdeliye FP), a modification of a production aircraft, that moved the N-37 to the port side of the aircraft, but this was apparently not successful either. Other attempts to ameliorate the problem included fitting a muzzle brake on the N-37 as well as extending its barrel, but nothing worked.|$|R
