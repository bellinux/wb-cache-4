40|$|AbstractAbstractCOTIC 98 was {{the second}} {{workshop}} organized {{in the context of}} the ESPRIT Working Group COTIC. The previous one, COTIC 97, was held at RISC in October 1997. These workshops aim at stimulating research on timed extensions of (concurrent) constraint programming and more generally timed declarative languages. Additionally, they seek to investigate possible uses of concurrent logic and constraint programming languages in representing the reasoning and communication capabilities of intelligent agents. The programme of COTIC 98 included eight presentations selected by a programme committee consisting of: F. S. de Boer (co-chair, Univ. Utrecht), P. Bonatti (Univ. Torino), M. Gabbrielli (co-chair, <b>Univ.</b> <b>Pisa),</b> A. Maggiolo-Schettini (<b>Univ.</b> <b>Pisa),</b> J. Maluszynski (Univ. Linkoeping), J. -J. Meyer (Univ. Utrecht), L. Monteiro (Univ. Lisboa) and V. S. Subrahmanian (Univ. Maryland). Out of the eight presented papers four were selected for inclusion in this volume. Further information on the workshop can be found at the COTIC 98 web page. We would like to thank the authors of the submitted papers and the members of the program committee for their contribution to the meeting. We also would like to thank Michael Mislove for his help with the editing of the proceedings. November 1998, F. S. de Boer and M. Gabbriell...|$|E
40|$|I {{review the}} AdS/hydrodynamics correspondence, which {{provides}} a 1 - 1 map between large wavelength features of AdS black branes and conformal fluid flows. In this thesis I consider boundaries between nonrelativistic flows, applying the usual boundary conditions for viscous fluids. I find that a naive application of the correspondence to these boundaries yields a surface layer in the gravity theory whose stress tensor is not equal to that given by the Israel matching conditions. In particular, while neither stress tensor satisfies the null energy condition and both have nonvanishing momentum, only Israel's tensor has stress. The disagreement arises entirely from corrections to the metric due to multiple derivatives of the flow velocity, which violate Israel's finiteness assumption in the thin wall limit.

40|$|Block ramps are {{structures}} {{often used}} in river restoration projects. They generally ensure a stable streambed and produce high energy dissipation. This paper shows {{the results of an}} experimental investigation conducted at the Hydraulic Laboratory of the <b>Univ.</b> of <b>Pisa,</b> Pisa, Italy on ramps of different slopes characterized by different bed materials. Experiments have been carried out in three different rectangular channels, where block ramps with a slope varying between 1 V : 4 H and 1 V : 12 H have been tested. The results have been compared with the ones obtained for a smooth ramp, which can be considered as a limit case in which the diameter of the bed material tends to zero. The amount of energy loss of such structures is essentially a function of the relative submergence, the slope, and the ratio between the critical water depth and the length of the ramp. Viscous effects and air entertainment can be considered negligible in the experimental range. Tests were carried out to find the case of nonsubmerged ramp conditions...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of the iPad (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA) for two-dimensional (2 D) reading of CT angiography (CTA) studies performed for suspected acute non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding. Methods: 24 CTA examinations of patients with suspected acute gastrointestinal bleeding confirmed (19 / 24, 79. 2 %) or ruled out (5 / 24, 20. 8 %) by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were retrospectively reviewed by three independent readers on a commercial picture archiving communication system (PACS) workstation and on an iPad with Retina Display (R) 64 GB (Apple Inc.). the time needed to complete reading of every CTA examination was recorded, as well as the rate of detection of arterial bleeding and identification of suspected bleeding arteries on both devices. Results: Overall, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive-and negative-predictive values for bleeding detection were not significantly different while using the iPad and workstation (0. 774 vs 0. 847, 0. 947 vs 0. 895, 0. 6 vs 0. 8, 0. 9 vs 0. 944 and 0. 750 vs 0. 667, respectively; p > 0. 05). in DSA-positive cases, the iPad and workstation allowed correct identification of the bleeding source in 17 / 19 cases (89. 5 %) and 15 / 19 cases (78. 9 %), respectively (p > 0. 05). Finally, the time needed to complete reading of every CTA study was significantly shorter using the iPad (1696 74 vs 222670 s, respectively; p < 0. 01). Conclusion: Compared with a conventional PACS workstation, iPad-based preliminary 2 D reading of CTA studies has comparable diagnostic accuracy for detection of acute gastrointestinal bleeding and can be significantly faster. Advances in knowledge: the iPad could be used by oncall interventional radiologists for immediate decision on percutaneous embolization in patients with suspected acute gastrointestinal bleeding. <b>Univ</b> <b>Pisa,</b> Dept Diagnost & Intervent Radiol, Pisa, ItalyUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, Dept Imaging Diag, São Paulo, BrazilUniversidade Federal de São Paulo, Dept Imaging Diag, São Paulo, BrazilWeb of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{dangerous}} effects on health the industrial {{use of asbestos}} minerals is banned in Italy since 1992. As consequence, the risk of asbestos fibers exposure is no linked to industrial processes, but to the modifications of lithotypes containing them, whether {{as a result of}} natural phenomena (landslides, erosion, weathering) that as human activities (mining, earthworks, excavations, tunnels). To assess the real “natural” asbestos- related risk, the Tuscany Region administration has funded a project for the mapping and the characterization of the asbestos- bearing ophiolitic rocks cropping out in Tuscany. This project, (CaMAm: Caratterizzazione e Mappature Amianto), has been developed by a team among the Dip. Scienze della Terra (<b>Univ.</b> <b>Pisa),</b> Alitec s. n. c. and PivotConsulting s. p. a. Using the recent regional geological cartography, 66 sites of ophiolitic rocks containing asbestos minerals have been investigated using a multidisciplinary approach. Each outcrop has been initially investigated at mesoscopic scale. That has included the description of lithotypes and structures (i. e. faults, shear zones), the geometric characterization of asbestos-bearing veins (e. g. orientation, thickness, frequency, lateral extension [...] ) and the textural and mineralogical characterization of asbestos minerals within the veins (i. e. geometry of mineral, fibers orientation respect to the vein boundaries, color [...] .). In order to make the qualitative and quantitative assessment of contents of such asbestos minerals, representative samples of lithotypes and asbestos minerals have been collected. Overall, 410 samples have been collected. Petrographical analyses have been performed on 140 samples, XRpD analyses have been carried out on 143 samples, whereas 49 samples have been used to determine the Release Index (the only Italian legislative parameter used to assess the asbestos risk). Finally, in order to find alternative and innovative asbestos-risk assessment, new methodologies (i. e. image analyses on thin sections and the study of atmospheric particulate in area nearby inactive ophiolite quarries) have been tested. All these information have been used to elaborate an exhaustive and easily questioned GIS database...|$|E
40|$|Understanding how {{patterns}} and processes relate across spatial scales {{is one of}} the major goals in ecology. 1 /f models have been applied mostly to time series of environmental and ecological variables, but they can also be used to analyse spatial patterns. Since 1 /f noise may display scale-invariant behaviour, ecological phenomena whose spatial variability shows 1 /f type scaling are susceptible to further characterization using fractals or multifractals. Here we use spectral analysis and multifractal techniques (generalized dimension spectrum) to investigate the spatial distribution of epilithic microphytobenthos (EMPB) on rocky intertidal surfaces. EMPB biomass was estimated from calibrated colour-infrared images that provided indirect measures of rock surface chlorophyll a concentration, along two 8 -m and one 4 -m long transects sampled in January and November 2012. Results highlighted a pattern of spectral coefficient close to or greater than one for EMPB biomass distribution and multifractal structures, that were consistent among transects, implying scale-invariance in the spatial distribution of EMPB. These outcomes can be interpreted as a result of the superimposition of several biotic and abiotic processes acting at multiple spatial scales. However, the scale-invariant nature of EMPB spatial patterns can also be considered a hallmark of self-organization, underlying the possible role of scale-dependent feedback in shaping EMPB biomass distribution.

ALS/MND (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/MND) is an wide-ranging {{term used to}} cover several derangements of the motor neurons. ALS/MND brings to progressive degeneration of the motor neurons. The motor neurons control the muscles that consent us to move and act. Until some years ago, ALS/MND was thought not to affect language and higher-order cognitive functions, but at present it is acknowledged that about 3 - 5 % of patients affected by ALS/MND show cognitive impairments. Up to date, {{it is not possible}} to establish whether this subgroup is affected by ALS/MND and Fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD) or FTD/Aphasia syndrome or whether FTD/aphasia syndrome can be, in some cases, a consequence of ALS/MND. Furthermore, it is not clear whether MND/FTD syndrome brings to language breakdown or whether MND/Aphasia can be considered a self-standing syndrome. Lexical category-specific impairments affect more often than not verbs, while nouns appear to be by some means preserved. The verbs deficit is remarkable because it can place a new light on the link between actions, verbal and cognitive imagery, and ideomotor praxis. Language impairments detected in ALS/MND point largely to frontal and frontostriatal damages. Actually functional neuroimaging studies show reduced frontal activation. Alterations in Broca’s area, DorsoLateral PreFrontal Cortex (DLPFC) and fronto-striatal circuit have been all reported in ALS/MND: several functional studies link Broca’s area to syntactic processing and DLPFC to verbs production as well as language Short Term Memory (STM). A basic issue is the link between action and verbs and, as a result, between action syntax and speech syntax. This connection would be involved in the origin of language: it would be evolved passing from action to speech syntax. According to our point of view, verbs are pivotal in this system. In short, when actions are missing, verbs, ideomotor praxis and their neurocorrelates would deteriorate. A longitudinal study on the effect of massive motor derangement on the verb degeneration is at present carried out by our research group, so to date this is a working hypothesis waiting for further evidence.
