50|$|Any amounts {{received}} {{under an}} NPC {{must be recognized}} by the taxpayer {{in accordance with the}} rules governing recognition of such payments in the Treasury Regulations, which may override the taxpayers normal method of accounting for <b>U.S.</b> <b>federal</b> income tax purposes. (Treas. Reg. § 1.446-3(e)(2)(i)). In general, amounts paid or received under an NPC are treated as ordinary income (and not capital gain) for <b>U.S.</b> <b>federal</b> income tax purposes, and are sourced by the residence of the recipient (e.g., if a non-U.S. resident receives a payment under an NPC, that payment is, in general, treated as non-U.S. source income for <b>U.S.</b> <b>federal</b> income tax purposes). The usual result of this treatment is that non-U.S. persons can receive payments on an NPC without outbound <b>U.S.</b> <b>federal</b> income tax withholding tax being applied. However, the <b>U.S.</b> <b>federal</b> income tax rules governing NPCs, withholding tax and the taxation of financial products in general is an intricately complicated subject, and taxpayers as a general matter almost always seek the assistance of a competent adviser to assist them in these matters.|$|R
