5|$|He {{pulled me}} in {{and pointed to}} the bed. His whole body was {{trembling}} violently. He was screaming there were two Mexicans hiding under his bed with long daggers. To humor him, I looked <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and when I rose to assure him there was no one hiding there, he staggered and fell, a dead weight, in my arms. I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor, Dr. Haberski, to examine him. She pronounced him dead.|$|E
5|$|McLaughlin {{traveled}} to various destinations {{in order to}} record Industrial Zen; in New York City, he recorded at The Cutting Room Studios, <b>Under</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bed</b> Studios, Tony Grey Studio, and Winsome Farm Studio. He also had sessions at Metropolis Studios in London, Mediastarz Studio in Monaco, Saucer Sound Studio in Austin Texas, and Otmatic Sound and At Beatnik Studio in California.

5|$|Nuyts {{acquired}} some notoriety while Governor for apparently taking native {{women to}} his bed, {{and having a}} translator hide <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> to interpret his pillow-talk. He was also accused of profiting from private trade, something which was forbidden under company rules. Some sources claim that he officially married a native Formosan woman during this time, but as he was still legally married to his first wife Cornelia, this seems unlikely.|$|E
5000|$|When we {{came back}} to the barracks in the evening, tired after work, {{everything}} was all thrown together. The lockers were tipped over, preserves, margarine and any other food lay in a pile {{in the middle of the}} barrack with toothpaste, laundry, broken glass, etc. <b>The</b> iron <b>bed</b> frames were all knocked over, the straw sacks [...] emptied out...

Many never even went to bed at night, but slept on the floor so they wouldn't have to reconstruct a bed.

5|$|Mulder, Scully, Asekoff, and Fazekas are rescued, {{but there}} is no sign of Glaser or the other {{creature}}. Upon leaving the forest, Mulder states that the creature may, in fact, be an evolved version of the first Spanish conquistadors who had first settled in the forest 450 years before. Although Kinsley finds it ridiculous, Mulder believes that centuries of seclusion could be adequate for such drastic adaptations to happen. Afterwards, Mulder realizes that the creatures presume others' presence in their territory as threatening and rushes to the hotel room where Scully is packing her things. After ascertaining that she is finished packing, he firmly urges her to vacate the room, which she does. The camera then pans <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> where a pair of red eyes open.|$|E
5|$|The format {{was changed}} for this series, with the dual {{timelines}} {{and much of}} the flashbacks dropped for a more linear narrative. Moffat felt that the relationship had already been sufficiently established in the first series so there was little point returning to the start. Set two months after the end of series one, Mark meets Becky in a newsagent, where he is purchasing pornographic magazines. He discovers the location of Becky and Trevor's house and breaks in using Tracy's keys. However, he is forced to hide <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> when Becky and Trevor return home. Listening to them having sex, he becomes optimistic when he thinks that Becky begins to shout his name ("M..."). The name turns out to be Michael (Tony Gardner), Becky's solicitor with whom she is now cheating on Trevor.|$|E
5|$|In December 1831 Yagan and {{his father}} led the first {{significant}} Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia. Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, ambushed some natives who were raiding a potato patch, and killed one of Yagan's family group. A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began {{to break through the}} mud-brick walls. Inside were Butler's servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons Enion and Ralph. After hiding his sons <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo. Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer's tribal group, not necessarily the murderer. The Noongar considered servants and employees {{to be part of the}} settlers' groups. Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their tribal law. Not understanding tribal law (and unlikely to agree with its concepts), the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan's group, without success.|$|E

5|$|The {{next day}} the Grays returned, and Ann became {{suspicious}} when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left {{alone in the house}} in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b> Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.|$|E

25|$|An {{electric}} blanket is a blanket with an integrated electrical heating device usually placed above the top bed sheet.

In 1937, Electric 'overblankets which lie {{on top of the}} sleeping person were introduced in the United States.|$|E
25|$|After many further guest {{appearances}} in television series such as The Saint, Callan, and UFO, Beacham's first film roles were in The Games directed by Michael Winner, and Tam Lin directed by Roddy McDowall, both released in 1970. She {{would work with}} Winner again in 1971's The Nightcomers, in which she starred opposite Marlon Brando. Beacham appeared nude in one scene, during the filming of which Brando wore Y-fronts and wellington boots <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> clothes to ensure Winner did not film anything lower than was necessary. Horror would be a genre that Beacham appeared in often during this period, and she was subsequently cast as Jessica Van Helsing in Hammer's Dracula A.D. 1972 alongside Peter Cushing.|$|E

50|$|In 1960, the {{construction}} of the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) through Quebec from the Ontario border to Rivière-du-Loup was announced. In Montreal, to avoid having to build a huge bridge that would have disfigured the city and destroyed a neighbourhood, the engineers opted for {{the construction}} of a tunnel located <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Saint Lawrence River, and dug a trench <b>under</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed</b> and buried <b>the</b> tunnel sections 4.6 m to 6.1 m <b>under</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed.</b> <b>The</b> construction was completed in March 1967, just before the opening of Expo 67.

25|$|Detectives went to Simpson's Rockingham {{estate to}} inform {{him that his}} ex-wife had been murdered. In {{the back of his}} home, they found some blood {{scattered}} all over on a white Ford Bronco. Detective Mark Fuhrman climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances—specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to Chicago late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed Kato Kaelin, who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> at the murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Simpson.|$|E
25|$|After sacking Rome in 410, Alaric I (King of the Visigoths) went to Calabria {{with the}} {{intention}} of sailing to Africa. He contracted malaria and died in Cosentia (Cosenza), probably of fever. Legend has it that he along with the treasure of Rome were buried <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> of the River Busento. With the fall of {{the western part of the}} Roman Empire, Italy was taken over by the Ostrogoths and became part of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in the late fifth century. During the sixth century, under the Ostrogoths, Cassiodorus emerged as one of the most prominent men of his time. He was an administrator, politician, scholar and historian who was born in Scylletium (near Catanzaro). He spent most of his career trying to bridge the divides of East and West, Greek and Latin cultures, Romans and Goths, and official Christianity and Arian Christianity, which was the form of Christianity of the Ostrogoths and which had earlier been banned. He set up his Vivarium monastery (monastery school) in Scylletium. He oversaw the collation of three editions of the Bible in Latin. Seeing the practicality of uniting all the books of the Bible in one volume, he was the first who produced Latin Bibles in single volumes. The most well-known of them was the Codex Grandior which was the ancestor of all modern western Bibles.|$|E
