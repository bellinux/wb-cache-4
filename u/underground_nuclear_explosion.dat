500|$|Rumors {{that both}} sides are {{assembling}} nuclear weapons in space, and that a nuclear weapon has been detonated, increase public and international tensions.

2500|$|When {{negotiations}} {{began in}} the mid-1990s to develop a comprehensive test ban, the international community was reluctant to rely upon the detection capabilities of individual nuclear weapons states (especially the United States), and instead wanted an international detection system. The resulting International Monitoring System consists {{of a network of}} a total of 321 monitoring stations and 16 radionuclide laboratories. Fifty [...] "primary" [...] seismic stations send data continuously to the International Data Center, along with 120 [...] "auxiliary" [...] stations which send data on request. The resulting data is used to locate the epicentre, and distinguish between the seismic signatures of an <b>underground</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>explosion</b> and an earthquake. Additionally, eighty radionuclide stations detect radioactive particles vented by underground explosions. Certain radionuclides constitute clear evidence of nuclear tests; the presence of noble gases can indicate whether an underground explosion has taken place. Finally, eleven hydroacoustic stations and sixty infrasound stations monitor underwater and atmospheric tests.|$|E
