5|$|The s were {{designed}} as improved {{versions of the}} armored corvette , suited for foreign deployments. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> predecessor, the Alma-class ships were true central battery ironclads as they were fitted with armored transverse bulkheads. Like most ironclads of their era, they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.|$|E
5|$|In the American Azteca registry, horses with American Paint Horse (APHA) {{breeding}} {{are also}} allowed. However, horses {{with more than}} 25 percent Thoroughbred blood in their pedigrees (common in many Paints and Quarter Horses) within four generations cannot be registered. American Aztecas have four categories of registration based on the relative degree of blood from each foundation breed, seeking an ideal blend of 3/8 Quarter Horse and 5/8 Andalusian. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> Mexican counterparts, {{they do not have}} to go through physical inspections before being registered.|$|E
5|$|Like Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Ruby and Sapphire {{keep track}} of real-life time; this {{influences}} events like tides and berry plant growth. However, <b>unlike</b> <b>their</b> predecessors, Ruby and Sapphire do not differentiate between day and night. Also, due to {{the differences in the}} technical specifications of Game Boy link cables and Game Boy Advance link cables, Ruby and Sapphire cannot be linked with Pokémon games of previous generations; one cannot battle with or trade to the previous generations.|$|E
50|$|Infinity is {{the seventh}} album by the Bosnian rock band Plavi orkestar {{released}} in 1999. It contains a greater usage of keyboards <b>unlike</b> in <b>their</b> previous work.|$|R
50|$|The {{order of}} the Abbey was a House of Augustinian Canons Regular who {{followed}} the Premonstratensian rule. <b>Unlike</b> monks, <b>their</b> main duties were preaching and pastoral work.|$|R
50|$|When the Danish army {{returned}} to Copenhagen after this war, they received no cheering or other public acclaim, <b>unlike</b> on <b>their</b> victorious return after the First Schleswig War.|$|R
5|$|Market {{research}} had revealed {{that many of}} Concorde's existing business customers had their tickets purchased by their employers and thought {{that the cost of}} a journey on Concorde was higher than it actually was; thus ticket prices were progressively raised to match these perceptions. It is reported that British Airways then ran Concorde at a profit, <b>unlike</b> <b>their</b> French counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Nor, <b>unlike</b> <b>their</b> European counterparts, did American {{generals and}} admirals have {{influence}} on or involvement in foreign policy; but mainly {{because in the}} frontier Army of MacArthur's youth, there was no requirement to do so. This began to change after the Spanish-American War, when American military forces started to be deployed overseas in the Pacific, Asia and the Caribbean for extended periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The Blastocladiomycota were {{previously}} considered a taxonomic clade within the Chytridiomycota. Recent molecular data and ultrastructural characteristics, however, place the Blastocladiomycota as a sister clade to the Zygomycota, Glomeromycota, and Dikarya (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota). The blastocladiomycetes are saprotrophs, feeding on decomposing organic matter, {{and they are}} parasites of all eukaryotic groups. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> close relatives, the chytrids, most of which exhibit zygotic meiosis, the blastocladiomycetes undergo sporic meiosis.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly to the circus, {{medicine}} {{shows were}} groups of travelling performers that put on entertaining acts, but <b>unlike</b> circuses, <b>their</b> performances were [...] "interspersed with sales pitches peddling miracle cures, elixirs and other various products of a dubious nature." ...|$|R
50|$|Spondylidinae are insects characterised by cerambycine aspect, {{generally}} {{with a more}} or less flattened, dark body, oblique {{head and}} scarcely elongated antennae. Their sexual dimorphism is scarcely evident, that i,s males and females are scarcely distinguishable. <b>Unlike</b> Cerambycinae, <b>their</b> stridulitrum is divided.|$|R
50|$|Small traces {{were named}} Parabrontopodus by Casamiquela frenkii and Fasola in 1968. This is one {{case that was}} {{considered}} a titanosaur because <b>unlike</b> them, <b>their</b> limbs were less apart, {{leaving a trail of}} footprints close together. The discovery was named before Iguanodonichnus frenkii.|$|R
5|$|The {{compound}} had no Internet or landline telephone service. Its residents burned their refuse, <b>unlike</b> <b>their</b> neighbors, who {{set their}} garbage out for collection. Local residents called the building the Waziristan Haveli, {{because they believed}} the owner was from Waziristan. Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden, the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> {{previous}} albums, Daft Punk recruited session {{musicians to}} perform live instrumentation and limited {{the use of}} electronic instruments to drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album features collaborations with Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. It is the first Daft Punk album released by Columbia Records.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> {{toothed whale}} counterparts, baleen whales {{are hard to}} study because of their immense size. Intelligence tests such as the mirror test cannot be done because their bulk and lack of body {{language}} makes a reaction impossible to be definitive. However, studies on the brains of humpback whales revealed spindle cells, which, in humans, control theory of mind. Because of this, {{it is thought that}} baleen whales, or at least humpback whales, have consciousness.|$|E
50|$|Dichrostachys is an Old World genus of legumes in the Fabaceae family. Their Acacia-like {{leaves are}} bi-pinnately compound. <b>Unlike</b> Acacia <b>their</b> thorns are {{hardened}} branchlets rather than modified stipules. They are native from Africa to Australasia, but a centre of diversity {{is present in}} Madagascar.|$|R
50|$|This album, unlike Impending Doom's {{releases}} after, {{has a more}} goregrind/grindcore style behind it, {{with little}} to no deathcore influences in the album. Brooke Reeves used a vocal style known as pig squealing quite often in this album, <b>unlike</b> all <b>their</b> albums following Nailed. Dead. Risen.|$|R
25|$|Seyfert {{galaxies are}} one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of {{electromagnetic}} radiation) with very high surface brightnesses whose spectra reveal strong, high-ionisation emission lines, but <b>unlike</b> quasars, <b>their</b> host galaxies are clearly detectable.|$|R
5|$|Wenger {{appointed}} midfielder Patrick Vieira as captain after Tony Adams {{announced his}} retirement from football. Defender Lee Dixon left the club after 14 years, retiring {{at the age of}} 38. Arsenal did not spend big in the transfer market <b>unlike</b> <b>their</b> rivals and only made subtle additions to the squad: World Cup winner Gilberto Silva and defender Pascal Cygan. English duo Martin Keown and goalkeeper David Seaman extended their stay at the club for two and one more years respectively.|$|E
5|$|At about 01:25 on 13 November, in near-complete {{darkness}} {{due to the}} {{bad weather}} and dark moon, the ships of the Imperial Japanese force entered the sound between Savo Island and Guadalcanal and prepared to bombard Henderson Field with the special ammunition loaded for the purpose. The ships arrived from an unexpected direction, coming not down the slot but from {{the west side of}} Savo Island, thus entering the sound from the northwest rather than the north. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> American counterparts, the Japanese sailors had drilled and practiced night fighting extensively, conducting frequent live-fire night gunnery drills and exercises. This experience would be telling in not only the pending encounter, but in several other fleet actions off Guadalcanal in the months to come.|$|E
5|$|Destiny Fulfilled is {{the fifth}} and final studio album by American R trio Destiny's Child. It was {{released}} on November 16, 2004, by Columbia Records and Sony Urban Music. A comeback release, it marked the return of Destiny's Child after the group went into hiatus, which allowed each member to release solo albums. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> previous material, this record saw each member equally contributing to the songwriting and production. Destiny's Child further worked with frequent collaborators such as Rockwilder, Swizz Beatz and Rodney Jerkins {{as well as several}} new producers.|$|E
50|$|Houses are Mixed, {{and have}} no {{physical}} buildings associated to them within the Prep School, and <b>unlike</b> with <b>their</b> Senior School counterparts, they are more of an administrative tool than a community structure. The Houses are primarily used to promote and uphold friendly competitive spirit, especially through competitions.|$|R

50|$|Overall, European water voles are {{a uniform}} dark brown colour, with {{slightly}} paler coloration on the underside. Their pelage is quite thick {{and they are}} furred over their entire body, including <b>their</b> tail, <b>unlike</b> rats. <b>Their</b> dark colour allows them to blend in well in the densely vegetated areas they inhabit.|$|R
5|$|In 1382, the Mamluk emir Barquq usurped {{the throne}} in Cairo, {{establishing}} the Burji regime. The latter were ethnic Circassians <b>unlike</b> <b>their</b> Turkmen Bahri predecessors, {{which resulted in}} frayed relations between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the new rulers. The tensions between the Turkmens of Keserwan and the Burji authorities contrasted with the Turkmens' principal rivals in Mount Lebanon, the Druze Buhturids, who embraced Sultan Barquq. When the latter was briefly toppled in a Bahri revolt in 1389, the Buhturids fought against the Bahri rebels in Damascus, while the Turkmen tribesmen assaulted the Druze Tanukhi tribesmen in Beirut and the surrounding hills. In those engagements and the executions that followed, the Turkmens killed seven of the eight Tanukhi Abi al-Jaysh Arslan emirs, Druze allies of the Buhturids.|$|E
5|$|Nara period Buddhism was {{dominated}} by six state-controlled sects. They were introduced from the mainland and centred around the ancient capitals in Asuka and Nara. These schools were generally academic in nature, closely connected with the court and represented a doctrine that was {{far removed from the}} daily life of the people. In 804, two Japanese monks Kūkai and Saichō travelled to China; on their return they established Tendai and Shingon Buddhism respectively. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> predecessors both esoteric schools took into account the needs of the common people. Though their origins lay in China, with time they acquired local Japanese traits. Generally the 9th century was a time when Chinese learning thrived in Japan. Authors produced a wide variety of works in Chinese language, including commentaries and treatises on a variety of subjects.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{are thought}} to have evolved in Asia, where local multituberculate faunas were {{severely}} affected by the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event and never fully recovered, <b>unlike</b> <b>their</b> North American and European relatives. In the resulting ecological vacuum, rodents and other Glires were allowed to evolve and diversify, taking the niches left by extinct multituberculates. The correlation between the spread of rodents and the demise of multituberculates is a controversial topic, not fully resolved. American and European multituberculate assemblages do decline in diversity in correlation with the introduction of rodents in these areas, but the remaining Asian multituberculates co-existed with rodents with no observable replacement taking place, and ultimately both clades co-existed for at least 15 million years.|$|E

50|$|<b>Unlike</b> during <b>their</b> last comeback, Twice {{promoted}} actively on variety shows. They filmed {{their first}} variety {{show for the}} EP on April 26, 2017 as guests on I Can See Your Voice. On May 3, 4 and 9, Twice recorded an episode of Weekly Idol, Knowing Bros and Top 3 Chef King, respectively.|$|R
5|$|The 2010s have birthed {{a number}} bands {{influenced}} by grunge. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> forebears, {{some of these}} acts ascribe the label to themselves willingly. Many acts have been noted for affiliating and/or collaborating with prominent figures from the original alternative rock era. Steve Albini has produced for or worked with members of bands such as Bully, Vomitface, and Shannon Wright, while Emma Ruth Rundle of Marriages has toured with Buzz Osbourne of the Melvins. Other acts that have been labelled as grunge or as heavily influenced by the grunge era, include Courtney Barnett, My Ticket Home, Wolf Alice, Yuck, Speedy Ortiz, Mitski, , False Advertising, Slothrust, Ramonda Hammer, The Ghost Ease, Baby in Vain, Big Thief, Dilly Dally, Kagoule, and Torres.|$|E
5|$|The American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} written and {{recorded}} {{in two months}} while the band was still on tour in support of their previous record, Happiness... Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch, which had only been released 14 months prior. A combination of lead singer-songwriter Raine Maida's prolific songwriting {{at the time and}} lead-guitarist Mike Turner's discovery of The Age of Spiritual Machines in a bookstore hurried the completion of the album. The band only took a break from recording to organize and perform at Summersault in 2000. <b>Unlike</b> <b>their</b> previous releases, this one features a more organic, acoustic sound, and less obvious layering and electronic texturing.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{designed}} for Arkansas, Section 731 may {{also apply to}} Alaska and California whose constitutions provide for the same basic usury limit, though <b>unlike</b> Arkansas <b>their</b> legislatures can (and generally do) set different limits.
