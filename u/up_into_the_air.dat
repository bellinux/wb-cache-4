5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick the ball <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it {{is parallel to the}} ground. As the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms should be used for balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E

25|$|Rotting {{food and}} other {{decaying}} organic waste allows methane and carbon dioxide to seep {{out of the ground}} and <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and can itself be a danger because it is flammable and potentially explosive. In properly managed landfills, gas is collected and utilized. This could range from simple flaring to landfill gas utilization. Carbon dioxide is the most widely produced greenhouse gas. It traps heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.|$|E
25|$|Surfers' {{skills are}} tested by {{their ability to}} control their board in {{difficult}} conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and carving (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the floater (riding {{on top of the}} breaking curl of the wave), and off the lip (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the air whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.|$|E

25|$|Several predators {{dwell in}} the {{labyrinth}} of channels, branches and roots that poke <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> This is the only mangrove ecoregion that harbours the Indo-Pacific region's largest terrestrial predator, the Bengal tiger. Unlike in other habitats, tigers live here and swim among the mangrove islands, where they hunt scarce prey such as the chital deer (axis axis), Indian muntjacs (Muntiacus muntjak), wild boars (Sus scrofa), and even rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). It is estimated {{that there are now}} 180 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area. The tigers regularly attack and kill humans who venture into the forest, human deaths ranging from 30–100 per year.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, McDonald's {{pledged to}} stop using eggs from battery cage {{facilities}} by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch {{is expected to have}} a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.|$|E

Meanwhile, Marge accidentally severs Homer's thumb {{as she is}} cutting brownies.

Since Homer's thumb is starting to shrivel up, he stops by at Moe's, where he gets a pickle brine solution. He gets distracted when Moe offers him a beer. Homer rushes {{out the door and}} sees Marge is gone. He hitchhikes with Cletus who drives him to Dr. Nick's, but they discover the clinic is on fire. Homer asks Cletus to drive him to Shelbyville Hospital, but his truck gets stolen and Homer leaves for the hospital on foot. His thumb is almost completely shrivelled up now, and he is just about to throw it away when an explosion sends Linguo's severed head flying <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and it lands next to him.|$|E

25|$|As {{the green}} light signalled {{the start of the}} race, Hill and Schumacher both made brisk starts and led into Sainte Dévote, but behind them a {{multiple}} collision between Coulthard and the two Ferraris caused the race to be red-flagged to a halt. Coulthard was slightly slower away from the line and was challenged {{on the outside of the}} run to the first corner by Berger, and on the inside by Alesi. As the track narrowed at the entry to Sainte Devote, there was not enough space for the three cars to run side-by-side, and Alesi made contact with the rear-right quarter of Coulthard's car, which in turn pushed it into Berger. The Williams was launched <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and spun through 180 degrees before crashing down again and coming to a halt at the apex of the corner with broken suspension, whilst the two damaged Ferraris also made further contact with each other before coming to rest at the same point. Most of the pursuing drivers, led by Brundle, threaded their way through the stationary cars, but Irvine knocked off his front wing, Boullion sustained a broken diffuser, and Katayama, Salo, Morbidelli, Inoue and Schiattarella were all forced to come to a halt as they negotiated the obstacles. With the track now completely blocked, the race was halted and preparations were immediately made for a completely fresh start.|$|E
500|$|In 1965, the Long Shot {{nuclear test}} was {{executed}} by the Department of Defense.

However, this test set off a number of reactions in the surrounding area – the test triggered earthquakes and landslides, and sent water from lakes flying [...] <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|E
500|$|He {{was praised}} by Larwood, who spearheaded the Bodyline attack and totalled 10/128 for the match, {{which ended in}} a decisive 10-wicket victory for England. Wisden {{reported}} that McCabe [...] "scored off Larwood's bowling in a style which for daring and brilliance was not approached by any other Australian during the tour". Richard Whitington wrote in the 1970s that McCabe's innings [...] "still warms {{the blood of the}} dwindling number of Australians who watched it". McCabe received a thunderous standing ovation from the 46,000 spectators. Immediately after the innings, McCabe told his teammates that he {{would never be able to}} replicate the feat because it was too difficult to hook the ball consistently without hitting it <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and giving away catching opportunities.|$|E

He struggled in landing and on another occasion just four days later, his tyre burst on landing approach. The Moth bounced <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and Finucane barely recovered to make a heavy landing, although this time he was praised by his instructor. As they climbed out, they saw that the landing gear had been destroyed. Further heavy contact said Finucane, [...] " [...] there would have been no more Brendan or Mr. Morris!" ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{gameplay}} {{element that}} helps to distinguish the Marvel vs. Capcom series from other fighting game franchises is its emphasis on aerial combat. Every character in the Marvel vs. Capcom series is given a [...] "Launcher" [...] move, which sends the opponent flying <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The player can then choose to follow up immediately by using a [...] "Super Jump", which allows a character to jump much higher than normal, {{in order to continue}} their combo; these airborne combos are called [...] "Air Combos" [...] or [...] "Aerial Raves". Marvel vs. Capcom 3 introduced a gameplay feature known as the [...] "Team Aerial Combo" [...] or [...] "Aerial Exchange", giving players the opportunity to extend their Air Combos further by quickly tagging in their other characters while mid-air.|$|E
500|$|A {{miniature}} {{model of}} the Boeing 747 airplane was created for the explosion scene. [...] The model, {{one of the most}} detailed miniature scenes in the film, was about 10 feet long and 7 feet wide, and the landing gear was made from all machined metals. According to visual effects supervisor Ariel Velasco Shaw, the miniature had to be launched about 40 feet <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{to make it look like}} a real Boeing 747 exploded into a fireball. [...] If blowing up a four-foot plane, the explosion must be a minimum of eight feet in the air. [...] To film the explosion in detail, the crew used three cameras running 120 frames per second and one camera running 300 frames per second (if they had filmed using a real-time camera, the succession of the explosion would not be filmed in a particular order).|$|E
60|$|Parson Jones held <b>up</b> {{both hands}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and Tom stared {{at what he}} saw, {{wondering}} whether it was all so, and whether he was really awake. It seemed to him {{as though he was}} in a dream.|$|R
60|$|The flag-ship {{was well}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bay, {{steaming}} at a four-knot speed, when from the smoke-stack {{of the little}} McCulloch a column of sparks shot <b>up</b> high <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> In <b>the</b> run her fires had fallen low, and it became necessary to replenish them. The firemen, perhaps fearing lest {{they should not be}} in at the death, were more energetic than prudent, and thus a signal was given to the sleepy garrison of Corregidor.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{large number}} of reflectors on the ground at these {{elevation}} angles. Prevailing winds of about 15 mile/hour cause these reflectors to move, and this wind stirs <b>up</b> smaller objects <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> This interference is called clutter.|$|R
500|$|L'Estrange {{wrote to}} the Council again, this time asking for {{permission}} to use Belmore Park for a second attempt. Much like his first attempt, the second ended in failure. Once again the balloon took {{much of the day}} to fill, with the lift going ahead at 5 pm on the afternoon of 7 December 1878. The first attempt dragged him approximately [...] through the crowd. Returning to the start point, L'Estrange tried again, shooting <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> approximately [...] and sailing away towards the south, before descending again and being dragged across the park. The crowd feared the balloon would crash but once more it lifted, up and over the roof of Carters' Barracks. L'Estrange, realising that the balloon was not going to lift higher, threw out the anchor, which caught in the spouting of a building and threw the balloon into the drying yard of the Benevolent Asylum, where it caught in the washing lines and wires and was practically destroyed. Still, L'Estrange's place in Sydney hearts had been established and a well-attended benefit was held at the Theatre Royal on 19 December 1878.|$|E
500|$|The game {{features}} {{a variation of}} the series' Linear Motion Battle System, where players are able to freely move their characters around the battle area and engage enemies in real-time, known as the [...] "X-LiMBS" [...] (Crossover Linear Motion Battle System), which was specifically designed to resemble a traditional fighting game. Despite playable characters and enemies being rendered in 3D, battles are limited to a two-dimensional plane where combatants can only move forward, backward, or jump straight <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> In addition to normal attacks, players can attack enemies using special skills called [...] "Eres", which involve spending Tech Points (TP), and can be chained together to create combos. A total of eight playable characters can be recruited as the game progresses, with up to four of them making up a player's party at any time. As players attack enemies, they fill up a [...] "Climax" [...] gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen that can be expended to freeze all enemies in place for a short period. Whenever battles are completed, players are awarded both experience points that allow characters to gain levels and grow stronger, as well as items called [...] "Eres Stones" [...] that allow them to purchase additional skills.|$|E
500|$|The game's combat {{focuses on}} velocity, and {{encourages}} players to defeat enemies in a fast-paced way. As a result, players can employ different moves including wall running, air-dashing, zip lining, performing parkour, acrobatics, and water traversal. Players use grind rails to deftly navigate city streets, {{and are able}} to switch direction instantly at will. The city is also filled with items for players to bounce <b>up</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> Players may utilize their weapons while performing these movements and slow down time for players to take aim. On-foot, players cannot walk, take cover, or take out enemies silently, but instead must rely on agility to survive as they will be overwhelmed quickly by enemies if they choose to walk on the ground. The game also features a Style Meter. Shown in the head-up display (HUD) of the game, the Meter increases as players perform stylish moves like killing enemies and grinding on-rails without touching the ground. When players are killed, {{they do not have to}} wait for the game to load. Players can respawn and return to the world by different methods, such as descending with a rocket or exiting a golden sarcophagus. Insomniac named this system [...] "Next-Gen Respawning".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now I {{must also}} {{give them a}} treat,' thought the merchant's son. And so he bought rockets, crackers, and all the kinds of {{fireworks}} you can think of, put them in his trunk, and flew <b>up</b> with them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b>|$|R
60|$|So it was {{all agreed}} to.

The flames spread rapidly, and flashed <b>up</b> high <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> and soon there was nothing left of the poor wigwam but a few smoking and blackened sticks lying on the ground.|$|R
50|$|At {{the close}} of night a red flame appeared, {{throwing}} <b>up</b> tongues <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> It was <b>the</b> celebrated volcano (Stromboli). We were told that a fiery blast of great violence bursts out from air-holes in the two mountains and makes the fire. Often a great stone is cast <b>up</b> and thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> by <b>the</b> force of the blast and prevented thereby from falling and settling at the bottom. This {{is one of the}} most remarkable of stories, and it is true.As for the great mountain in the island, known as the Jabal al-Nar of Fire, it also presents a singular feature in that some years a fire pours from it in the manner of the `bursting of the dam'. It passes nothing it does not burn until, coming to the sea, it rides out on its surface and then subsides beneath it. Let us praise the Author of all things for His marvelous creations. There is no God but He.|$|R
