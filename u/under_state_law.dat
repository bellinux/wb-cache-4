The court found that it is unconstitutional to deny a church the option to incorporate <b>under</b> <b>state</b> <b>law</b> when other groups can incorporate.

5|$|The Engineering Experiment Station {{was renamed}} the Georgia Tech Research Institute in 1984. A {{separate}} organization, originally called the Industrial Development Council, {{changed its name}} to the Georgia Tech Research Institute in February 1946, and finally to the Georgia Tech Research Corporation in 1984. There are legal difficulties when an American university wishes to accept contracts from some entities, especially the federal government, so the second organization is a contracting organization. Most importantly, it allows the university to perform multi-year contracts that are not possible <b>under</b> <b>state</b> <b>law,</b> which requires that money received must be spent in the same fiscal year. The name change coincided with a shift in focus toward obtaining industrial research contracts in addition to its contracts with the federal government. GTRI expanded its footprint in the mid to late 1980s: the Centennial Research Building opened on {{the north end of the}} Georgia Tech campus in 1985, providing expanded lab and office space, and the electromagnetic radiation measurement range was established at GTRI's Cobb County research facility.|$|E

The Student Body President and Student Body Vice President are elected in annual elections held in the spring and both receive a paid salary that ranges from $18,000 to $21,000 per year. The legislative branch is composed of 59 senators elected each fall, who serve one-year terms representing their respective colleges. Student senators annually elect a Speaker of the Senate, who receives an annual salary between $17,000 and $20,000 per year, and a Senate President Pro Tempore. <b>Under</b> <b>state</b> <b>law,</b> the Student Senate has sole jurisdiction over the approval and allocation of the university's activity and service fee budget, which was $17.4 million in fiscal year 2014.

25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made in the U.S. to charge pornographic-film {{producers}} with pandering <b>under</b> <b>state</b> <b>law.</b> The case of California v. Freeman in 1989 is one of the most prominent examples where a producer/director of pornographic films was charged with pandering under the argument that paying porn actors to perform sex on camera was a form of prostitution covered by a state anti-pandering statute. The State Supreme Court rejected this argument, finding that the California pandering statute was not intended to cover the hiring of actors who would be engaging in sexually-explicit but non-obscene performances. It also stated that only in cases where the producer paid the actors for the purpose of sexually gratifying themselves or other actors, could the producer be charged with pandering <b>under</b> <b>state</b> <b>law.</b> This case effectively legalized pornography in the State of California. In 2008, the New Hampshire Supreme Court would issue a similar ruling (New Hampshire v. Theriault) which declared that producing pornography was not a form of prostitution <b>under</b> <b>state</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
