40|$|The {{canonical}} {{models for}} studying the <b>unjamming</b> scenario in systems of soft repulsive particles assume pairwise potentials with a sharp cut-off in the interaction range. The sharp cut-off renders the potential non-analytic, but {{makes it possible to}} describe many properties of the solid in terms of the coordination number $z$, which has an unambiguous definition in these cases. Pairwise potentials without a sharp cut-off in the interaction range have not been considered in this context, but are of interest for understanding the relevance of the <b>unjamming</b> phenomenology to systems in which such a cut-off cannot be assumed. In this work we explore two systems with such interactions: an inverse power law and an exponentially decaying pairwise potential, with the control parameters being the exponent (of the inverse power-law) for the former and the number density for the latter. Both systems are shown to exhibit the characteristic features of the <b>unjamming</b> transition, among which are the vanishing of the shear to bulk modulus ratio and the emergence of an excess of low-frequency vibrational modes. We establish a relation between the hydrostatic pressure to bulk modulus ratio and the distance to <b>unjamming</b> in each of our model systems. This allows us to predict the dependence of other key observables on the distance to <b>unjamming.</b> Our results provide the means for a quantitative estimation of the proximity of generic glass forming models to the <b>unjamming</b> transition {{in the absence of a}} clear-cut definition of the coordination number, and highlight the general irrelevance of nonaffine contributions to the bulk modulus.

We show that internal variables, e. g., stress and fabric of the pile, exhibit hysteresis during these cycles due to the exploration of different metastable configurations. Interestingly, the hysteretic behaviour of the pile strongly depends on the maximal inclination of the cycles, giving evidence of the irreversible modifications of the pile state occurring close to the <b>unjamming</b> transition.

We record the penetration depth of the displacements and the critical force that is needed to make the system yield. These quantities are tested in two types of systems: in ideal homogeneous packings in zero gravity and in packings settled under gravity. The penetration depth and the critical force are sensitive to the interparticle friction coefficient. Qualitatively, the same nonmonotonic friction dependence is found both with and without gravity, however the location of the extrema are at different friction values.
