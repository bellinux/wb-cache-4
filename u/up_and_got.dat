Without {{knowledge}} of this, Sharon romanced and married Adam. After reuniting with Faith, Nick and Sharon grew even closer. Nick and Phyllis broke <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> a divorce, leading him to reunite with Sharon. He proposed to her, and she accepted. However, Sharon could not get Adam {{out of her head}} and slept with him in New Orleans.

2500|$|Gatecrashing a local talent {{night at}} the All Saints Hall, Notting Hill, they were so disorganised as to not even have a name, opting for [...] "Group X" [...] at the last minute, nor any songs, {{choosing}} to play an extended 20-minute jam on The Byrds' [...] "Eight Miles High." [...] BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel was in the audience and was impressed enough to tell event organiser, Douglas Smith, {{to keep an eye}} on them. Smith signed them <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> them a deal with Liberty Records on the back of a deal he was setting up for Cochise.|$|E
2500|$|The Winter Palace's wine cellars {{literally}} fuelled {{the weeks}} of looting and unrest {{in the city}} which followed. Arguably the largest and best stocked wine cellar in history, it contained the world's finest vintages, including the Tsar's favourite, and priceless, Chateau d’Yquem 1847. So keen were the mob to obtain the alcohol, that the Bolsheviks explored radical solutions to the problem, one of which involved piping the wine straight out into the Neva. This led to crowds clustering around the palace drains. Another proposal, deemed too risky, was exploding the cellars. Eventually, the problem was solved by the declaration of martial law. It {{has been said that}} Petrograd, [...] "perhaps with the biggest hangover in history, finally woke <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> back to some order." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dave Vanian (David Lett), Captain Sensible (Raymond Burns) and Rat Scabies (Chris Millar) {{had been}} {{members of the}} band Masters of the Backside, which also {{included}} future Pretenders frontwoman Chrissie Hynde. Brian James (Brian Robertson) {{had been a member}} of London SS, who never played live, but in addition to James included musicians who later found fame in The Clash and Generation X. Scabies knew James through a failed audition as drummer for London SS. When the two decided to start their own band, with James on guitar and Scabies on drums, they invited Sid Vicious and Dave Vanian to audition to be the singer. Only Vanian showed <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> the part. Sensible became the band's bassist, and the four called themselves The Damned. Chrissie Hynde would later write that [...] "Without me, they were probably the most musically accomplished punk outfit in town".|$|E
2500|$|On Monday, April 12, 1909, the Opening Day {{proceedings}} {{walked a}} fine line between festival and chaos. More than 30,000 fans showed <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> in; another 15,000 showed up and were turned away. Nervous officials closed the gates hours before game time, turning the outsiders into a [...] "howling mob of thousands" [...] whose pressure forced open one of the gates. Hundreds poured in without paying admission, and an estimated 7,000 standing-room only spectators saw that first game ringing the outfield up to seven-deep, held back by a rope stretched between the left field seats and the right field bleacher. Another 6,000 more looked in from various rooftops around the block. [...] "It seemed as if all of Philadelphia was there", wrote the Public Ledger. Mayor John E. Reyburn called the new facility a [...] "pride to the city" [...] and threw out the first ball. The A's beat the Boston Red Sox that day, 8–1.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly before halftime of the Saturday evening {{game between}} the Oklahoma Sooners and the Kansas State Wildcats, spectators inside the stadium heard an {{explosion}}. The explosion was reported as being heard up to five miles away, but people {{on the east side}} of the stadium heard only a rumble like a low-volume thunder, of the type that signals impending rain. A few heard nothing. [...] Spectators were not allowed to leave the stadium at half-time, which caused concern among fans who did hear the explosion. No stadium announcements were made until the third and fourth quarters of play, when bus drivers were asked to leave the stadium and meet at the northwest corner of the Asp Avenue Parking Facility. [...] During the last six minutes of the game, an announcement was made over the public address system in the stadium and over local radio to exit through the south and east gates and to avoid the area, known to students and fans as the South Oval, west of the stadium. [...] No further explanations were given to game attendees because university officials [...] "didn't want to start any kind of panic." [...] "Everyone in my [...] section heard it. We looked to the opposite side of the field though thinking it was thunder. Me and my family were gonna go to the university bookstore after the game but the direction we had to go was blocked by caution tape. We knew something was <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>got</b> out of there ASAP." [...] said a Sooner fan.|$|E
