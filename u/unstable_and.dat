40|$|We {{describe}} algorithms for computing hyperbolic invariant sets of diffeomorphisms {{and their}} stable <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> manifolds. This includes {{the calculation of}} Smale horseshoes and the stable <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> manifolds of periodic points in any finite dimension. Introduction In understanding the dynamics of a dynamical system, governed by some diffeomorphism, stable <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> manifolds play a crucial role. If the stable <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> manifolds of a hyperbolic periodic point have transverse intersections, this implies the existence of nontrivial hyperbolic sets (`horseshoes'). For a family of diffeomorphisms, the dynamics can alter profoundly if the family goes through a homoclinic tangency (where the stable <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> manifolds of some hyperbolic periodic point are tangent). However stable <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> manifolds are not easily available analytically. An algorithm implemented on a computer computing stable <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> manifolds of hyperbolic periodic points and detecting tangencies can [...] ...|$|R

5|$|A local architect, Thomas Fosbrooke, {{carried out}} the first archaeological {{investigation}} of the site in 1900, and extensive restoration work took place the following years.

The family found themselves unable to afford to maintain the castle, and by the early 1930s the walls had become <b>unstable</b> <b>and</b> dangerous.

5|$|According to the nebular hypothesis, stars form {{in massive}} and dense clouds of {{molecular}} hydrogen—giant molecular clouds (GMC). These clouds are gravitationally <b>unstable,</b> <b>and</b> matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps, which then rotate, collapse, and form stars. Star formation {{is a complex}} process, which always produces a gaseous protoplanetary disk, proplyd, around the young star. This may give birth to planets in certain circumstances, which are not well known. Thus the formation of planetary systems {{is thought to be}} a natural result of star formation. A Sun-like star usually takes approximately 1million years to form, with the protoplanetary disk evolving into a planetary system over the next10–100 million years.|$|E

We define <b>unstable</b> metric entropy <b>and</b> <b>unstable</b> topological entropy, <b>and</b> establish a variational principle for partially hyperbolic diffeomorphsims, which states that the unstable topological entropy is the supremum of the unstable metric entropy taken over all invariant measures. The unstable metric entropy for an invariant measure {{is defined as a}} conditional entropy along <b>unstable</b> manifolds, <b>and</b> {{it turns out to be}} the same as that given by Ledrappier-Young, though we do not use increasing partitions. The unstable topological entropy is defined equivalently via separated sets, spanning sets and open covers along a piece of <b>unstable</b> leaf, <b>and</b> it coincides with the unstable volume growth along unstable foliation. We also obtain some properties for the unstable metric entropy such as affineness, upper semi-continuity and a version of Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem...|$|R

As a consequence of the anarchy in central and northern Albania, sporadic armed conflicts continued to occur in spite of the Protocol of Corfu's ratification, and on September 3 Prince Wilhelm departed the country. In the following days, an Epirote unit launched an attack on the Albanian garrison in Berat without approval from the provisional government, managing to capture its citadel for several days, while Albanian troops loyal to Essad Pasha initiated small-scale armed operations.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate thermonuclear fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become <b>unstable</b> <b>and</b> explode in a supernova.|$|E

The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the topsoil on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely <b>unstable</b> <b>and</b> liable to crack.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got {{at least as far}} as breaking into the prison within the castle. As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327.

The SER were unhappy about the proposed line from Rye to Hastings via , which they viewed as too expensive compared to the alternative route via Whatlington. The LB objected to this route as it was longer, and consequently the SER dropped their proposals in November 1847. The land over Romney Marsh was <b>unstable,</b> <b>and</b> test trains were seen to tip over in heavy winds. The line was originally proposed to be single-track, though this was changed to double-track in June 1850.|$|E
