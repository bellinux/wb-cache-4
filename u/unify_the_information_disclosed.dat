40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the most important corporate social disclosure (CSD) as perceived by the Indonesian stakeholders and the disclosures in Indonesian listed companies' annual reports. Design/methodology/approach – Questionnaire and content analysis methods were applied for the purpose of the study. A total of 306 people from six primary stakeholder groups (shareholders, investors, customers, employees, suppliers, and communities) provided their opinions by ranking the importance of every theme of disclosure. Further, <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> by 119 Indonesian listed companies in their 2003, 2004, and 2005 annual reports was examined. Findings – The results show that there are gaps between <b>the</b> most important <b>information</b> perceived by <b>the</b> stakeholders and <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> by <b>the</b> companies. This result may indicate that <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> by <b>the</b> companies has not fulfilled the stakeholders' needs. Therefore, the stakeholder theory should be investigated further in this context. Research limitations/implications – The study is expected to assist Indonesian businesses to focus on <b>the</b> <b>information</b> they <b>disclose</b> in their CSD particularly as a consequence of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). Originality/value – The paper is based on an original study that addresses the current gap between the CSD needed by the stakeholders and the fact that CSD has been disclosed in the companies' annual reports. The study is particularly valuable for both stakeholders and companies. Corporate image, Disclosure, Indonesia, Social responsibility, Stakeholders...|$|R

The analysis is based on a case study of Total, a company that was affected in quick succession by two major environmental disasters - the 1999 Erika oil spill and the AZF factory explosion in Toulouse in 2001. Using the theory of organizational hypocrisy, the article demonstrates that Total uses double disclosure practices depending on the nature of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> after an environmental accident (i. e., voluntary or mandatory <b>information).</b> Total <b>disclosed</b> a very limited amount of mandatory <b>information,</b> while <b>the</b> voluntary <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> by <b>the</b> company was used as an instrument of legitimation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> relationship between <b>information</b> quality and expected earning price ratio. According to our approach, information quality is a very relevant intangible asset related to the management’s ability to meet <b>the</b> <b>information</b> requirements of <b>the</b> players involved in a company’s income and financial dynamics. Financial analysts are particularly important in this framework. Therefore, we identified an indicator to define the quality of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> to analysts. At a later moment, we verified {{the existence of a}} correlation between that indicator and the expected earning price ratio. Our research hypothesis seems to have found empirical evidence. We should also consider the importance of the results for the management.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to open the "black box" of the construction of financial disclosure by analyzing the internal reporting systems of firms with reference to <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed.</b> Design/methodology/approach - Using indexes, the quality of the financial disclosure and the internal reporting systems are measured, and analyzed with a view to finding some links between them. It is expected that the quality of disclosure is dependent on the quality of the internal reporting. Findings - Complex interactions between internal reporting and financial disclosure are revealed, which leads to the identification of a typology of practices. The dependence of the relationship may be troubled by the willingness of the firm to communicate, or by the internal methods of control.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to study the incentives of firms to <b>disclose</b> their environmental <b>information</b> and examine <b>the</b> reliability of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed.</b> To achieve this objective, {{there is a need}} to first understand what constitutes environmental disclosures. The first essay, a review of prior disclosure studies, provides a classification of the different types of environmental disclosures and a synopsis about the motivation to disclose each type of <b>information,</b> <b>the</b> reliability and the relevance of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> to different stakeholders. The outcome of this research shows that many types of environmental information are relevant to the financial and non-financial stakeholders; however, there are still other types of information that needs to be researched to finally achieve a comprehensive framework of environmental disclosures. The second essay examines the association between environmental disclosures and firms’ environmental performances. The study provides a framework to explain the disclosure process demonstrating the effect of economic and legitimacy factors, environmental performance, and the media communicating these disclosures on the amount and type of <b>information</b> reported. <b>The</b> results suggest that environmental reporting is biased; where firms with higher levels of environmental performance <b>disclose</b> more voluntary <b>information</b> while firms with low-environmental performance tend to meet the mandatory disclosure requirements. There is little evidence to suggest that firms with low-environmental performances use their environmental disclosures to maintain the legitimacy of their environmental operations. The third essay examines the reliability of environmental performance indicators disclosed. The results suggest that the reporting of firms’ EPIs might be free of bias as the study finds no association between <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>disclosed</b> and firms’ environmental performance. In general, the dissertation provides assurances over the reliability of environmental <b>information</b> <b>disclosed.</b> There is no denial that firms are subject to pressures from non-financial stakeholders to justify the impact of their operations on the environment. This dissertation shows that firms attempt to use their environmental disclosures to mitigate the effects of these pressures; however, it also suggests that the need to legitimize their operations is not the main driver behind the reporting of environmental information. ...|$|R
