40|$|Weathering has a {{negative}} effect on both physical and engineering properties of rock specimens and rock masses. When rock masses are weathered {{it is often difficult to}} obtain core segments that are the correct size for <b>unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> testing. Thus engineers must use index testing to estimate the strength of specimens for design purposes. This thesis relates the <b>unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> to index strength tests of Ocala limestone. The relationships developed include weathering states of the specimens and proximity of <b>unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> specimens to index specimens. One hundred and ninety five specimens were classified using International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) weathering designations, had their unit weight determined, and were tested under unconfined compression, point load, or indirect tensile conditions. Qualitative results show the average unit weight decreases with an increase in weathering state and the range of index strength values decreases with an increase in weathering state. The data also shows low index strength test results across a wide range of unit weights. Quantitative relationships were also developed with the strength data. All of the developed relationships were linear. Point load strengths have better correlations with unit weight than indirect tensile strengths. <b>Unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> was correlated to index strength and weathering using three different approaches. For all approaches, indirect tensile strength has a better correlation with <b>unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> than point load strength.

30|$|The American Concrete Institute (ACI) {{defines a}} CLSM as a self-leveling, self-compacting, and {{cementitious}} material primarily used to replace conventional backfill soil and structural fillings {{that result in}} <b>unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> of 1200  psi (8.3  MPa) or less [2]. CLSM {{should not be considered}} as a type of low-strength concrete, but rather as a structural backfill. CLSM is known by many different names such as flowable fill, controlled density fill, unshrinkable fill, flowable mortar, soil–cement slurry, and plastic soil–cement. There are various inherent advantages of using CLSM instead of compacted fill in these applications. These benefits include reduced labor and equipment costs (due to self-leveling properties and no need for compaction), faster construction, and the ability to place material in confined spaces [2]. If future excavation is anticipated, the maximum long-term <b>compressive</b> <b>strength</b> should generally be less than 2.1  MPa (i.e., general fill) [2]. It is advantageous due to the relatively low strength itself of CLSM. Another advantage of CLSM is that it possibly contains by-product materials, thereby reducing the demand on landfills, where these materials may otherwise be deposited and contributing towards the sustainable development [32]. In general, CLSM mixtures consist of standard materials such as Portland cement, fly ash, fine aggregate and water. However, other industrial by-products and recycled materials are also accepted and encouraged {{as long as they are}} considered to be available, cost-effective for specific application and the necessary characteristics of the mixture such as flowability, strength, excavatability, and density are acceptable [2].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{performance}} of cement mortar reinforced with varying percentages of treated bundled date palm fibers is investigated to appraise their feasibility for structural and non-structural applications. The study first entailed {{the evaluation of}} two different alkali pre-treatments at varying concentrations by subjecting treated and untreated bundled fibers to tensile testing. The suitable pre-treatment was then adopted while casting cement mortar mixes. The physical properties of fresh mortar was studied through setting times and, for mortar mixes cured up to 28 days, through parameters such as drying shrinkage and water absorption. The <b>unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths,</b> split tensile strengths {{as well as the}} flexural strengths of the cured mortar mixes at two different ages were undertaken to assess their mechanical properties; while the durability was gauged based on their sulfate resistance for up to a period of four months. Observed stress–strain behavior under tension led to the choice of 0. 173 % Ca(OH) 2 as the preferred pre-treatment for the bundled fibers used in the mortar mixes. This was further supported by the microstructural examination on the hardened mortars which, revealed that the integrity of treated fibers remained intact within the cement matrix without hindering the hydration processes. Results also indicated that inclusion of fibers improves the flexural strengths as well as the sulfate resistance of the mortar mixes. However, the cylinder and cube <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> decreased with the increase in treated fiber inclusion.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Cement {{stabilization}} {{has been}} widely used to improve soft soils and grounds. Many researches have focused on study of {{the properties of the}} stabilized soil. However, more researches have to be done in order to elucidate how soil properties have been improved. The main objective of this research was therefore to investigate major hydration products which contribute strength development of soil cement by using X-ray diffractometer (XRD). In addition, correlations between reaction products and the developed strengths were also observed. A clayey soil with moderate moisture content was used in this study. Ordinary Portland cement (Type I) was mixed with the soil at a mix proportion of 200 kg/m 3. Cylindrical specimens were prepared for unconfined compression strength tests at curing times of 3, 7, 14, 28 and 90 days, respectively. Subsequently, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed after strength tests. Experimental results showed that strengths of the soil significantly increased with curing time, especially at short term (before 28 days) while, strengths slightly changed at long term. This investigation elucidated that increase in strength was attributed to the cement hydration within soil mass, resulting in formation of reaction products as analyzed by XRD.

Hyaloclastite deposits which directly underlie ca. 1 km of subaerially-emplaced lavas are very poorly consolidated. But over a depth interval of ca. 500 m, compaction and, especially, precipitation of zeolitic, pore-filling cements associated with palagonitization of sideromelane, have eliminated porosity as well as promoted the consolidation of these hyaloclastites. The latter is reflected in <b>unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> which increase from mean values, respectively, of 2. 5 and 4. 6 MPa in weakly consolidated, smectite-rich hyaloclastites from the incipient (1080 to 1335 mbsl) and smectitic (1405 – 1573 mbsl) alteration zones, to a mean value of 10. 0 MPa in the more highly consolidated hyaloclastites of the palagonitic zone of alteration (from 1573 mbsl {{to the bottom of the}} drill hole).

The <b>unconfined</b> <b>compressive</b> <b>strengths</b> of soil in the first stage increased by up to 120 % compared to those of the natural untreated soil.

A simulated limestone material was developed based on over 200 cylinders cast for unconfined compression testing where the binder (cement or lime), water to binder ratio, aggregate types (sand, coquina, and oyster shells), and binder content were all varied. Results of the laboratory tests were used to establish simulated limestone mixes for 42 in. diameter specimen beds in which 1 / 10 th scale drilled shaft rock sockets were cast. Drilled shaft casing installation techniques were adapted to 1 / 10 th scale where driven casing and oscillated/rotated casing methods were simulated. Within each of the simulated limestone test beds, 5 shaft specimens were cast with and without temporary casing where at least one of the specimens was cast without temporary casing (control specimen). Pullout tests of each specimen revealed that the presence of temporary casing reduced the side shear by 25 to 28 percent depending on the casing installation/extraction method. However, in all cases representative of weaker limestone, the measured reduction did not affect the anticipated design side shear resistance...|$|R
