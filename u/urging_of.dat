5000|$|According to a 1996 study, {{the sexual}} <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> men is {{perceived}} by both Thai {{men and women}} as being very much stronger than the sexual <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> women. Where women {{are thought to be}} able to exercise control over their desires, the sexual <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> men is seen to be [...] "a basic physiological need or instinct". It is also thought by both Thai men and women that men need [...] "an occasional variation in partners". As female infidelity is strongly frowned upon in Thai society, and, according to a 1993 survey, sexual relationships for single women also meets disapproval by a majority of the Thai population, premarital sex, casual sex and extramarital sex with prostitutes is accepted, expected and sometimes even encouraged for Thai men, the latter being perceived as less threatening to a marriage over lasting relationships with a so-called [...] "minor wife".|$|R

5|$|All {{efforts to}} extend the church beyond Kent {{encountered}} difficulties due to the attitude of King Rædwald of East Anglia, who had become the leading king in the south after Æthelberht's death. Rædwald was converted before the death of Æthelberht, perhaps at the <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Æthelberht, but his kingdom was not, and Rædwald seems to have converted {{only to the extent}} of placing a Christian altar in his pagan temple. It proved impossible for Mellitus to return to London as bishop, although Justus did resume his duties at Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Although Philip {{considered}} Attalus' {{escape a}} bitter defeat, {{it proved to}} be the turning point of the war. Attalus was forced to return to Pergamon, when he learned at Opus that, perhaps at the <b>urging</b> <b>of</b> Philip, Prusias I, king of Bithynia and related to Philip by marriage, was moving against Pergamon. Sulpicius returned to Aegina. Free from the pressure of the combined Roman and Pergamene fleets, Philip was able to resume the offensive against the Aetolians. He captured Thronium, followed by the towns of Tithronium and Drymaea north of the Cephisus, controlling all of Epicnemidian Locris, and took back control of Oreus.|$|E

But change the mode. Let the urge be the <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> power. Then the great desire is not happiness, neither of the beloved nor of oneself. Happiness {{is only one of many}} states, and it is horrible to think of fixing us down to one state. The <b>urge</b> <b>of</b> power does not seek for happiness any more than for any other state. It urges from within, darkly, for the displacing of the old leaves, the inception of the new. It is powerful and self-central, not seeking its centre outside, in some God or some beloved, but acting indomitably from within itself.|$|R
