50|$|Evidence from burials {{shows that}} during the Early Migration Period until the late Sixth or early Seventh Century, women wore {{something}} similar to a Greek peplos. They were fastened by brooches at the shoulders, though they have sometimes been found as low as the breasts. The gown could be belted or girdled, and easily adjusted {{to changes in the}} woman's physiology (weight change, especially due to pregnancy). An undergown was worn underneath, made of wool for poorer people and linen for richer women. It is unknown what the Anglo-Saxons called the peplos style of overdress, or how long it was; in Grave 74 at Wakerley in Northamptonshire, the <b>underdress</b> appears to have been of patterned twill, suggesting that the peplos was short to allow the <b>underdress</b> to be seen. Archeological finds suggest the <b>underdress</b> had an aperture at the neck. Finds on belt buckles also show that there were three layers of material, opening up the possibility of women having worn underwear beneath the undergown, though that is speculative.|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 19th century women's dresses, {{particularly}} for summer or evening wear, often featured transparent fabrics. However, these were almost always lined or worn over opaque undergarments or an <b>underdress</b> {{so that the}} wearer's modesty was preserved.|$|R

5000|$|From the 16th {{century to}} the early 20th century, frock was applied to a woman's dress or gown, in the fashion of the day, often {{indicating}} an unfitted, comfortable garment for wear in the house, or (later) a light overdress worn with a slip or <b>underdress.</b>|$|R

5000|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether smock-frocks are [...] "frocks made like smocks" [...] or [...] "smocks made like frocks"—that is, whether the garment {{evolved from the}} smock, the shirt or <b>underdress</b> of the medieval period, or from the frock, an overgarment of equally ancient origin.

50|$|Italian {{fashion in}} the 15th and 16th centuries was mainly {{influenced}} by {{the art of the}} time, especially by the masterpieces of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael and Botticelli. Italian designs were well known for their extravagance, and their expensive accessories, such as velvets, brocades, ribbons and jewels. Also, Italian fashion for ladies changed dramatically around 1460, where skirts were gathered or pleated, and would often be split at the front and the sides to show a sleeved <b>underdress.</b>|$|R

The beads seems to be formed from coral or glass and are strung on brown cord (the cord may originally have been green). She holds a white cloth to her eye to wipe away tears, presumably those of repentance.|$|R

Alice did not deign to reply, but tossed her head superbly, and secretly considered whether people would, on comparison, think her overdressed or Lydia <b>underdressed.</b> Lord Worthington thought they both looked their best, and reflected for several seconds on the different styles of different women, and how what would suit one would not do at all for another.

The Reading Eagle ran a fashion column in November 1915 describing the polonaise of 1914/15 as a French design consisting of a long coat-like overdress of metallic lace or elaborately decorated sheer fabric worn over a plain <b>underdress.</b> Another version of the polonaise was described by the Meriden Daily Journal in September 1917: ...|$|R

500|$|The Virgin is in {{a frontal}} view; {{directly}} behind her the red-curtained bed {{acts as a}} framing device, similar to the traditional canopy-of-honor or baldachin. Unlike Memling's predecessors whose Virgins are garbed in heavily jeweled and costly robes, the plain white shift she wears beneath a blue mantle is minimally jeweled at the hem and at the open neckline. A purple <b>underdress</b> peeks out at her neck and wrists, indicating her royal status. Mary seems neither surprised nor fearful at the announcement; according to Blum the scene is rendered with {{a great sense of}} naturalism and successfully depicts [...] "the transformation of Mary from girl to God-bearer." ...|$|R
50|$|Women's dress {{consisted}} of fitted garments worn underneath a belted dress {{which was also}} called giornea. Unlike the men's version, the women's reached the ground and covered their feet. Women's giorneas, originally evolved from the houppelande, had separate skirts and bodices. The skirts were tight at the waist and {{the lower part of}} the dress was often pleated. They were cut at the front, and in later years at the sides, to display the rich undergarments. Underneath the giornea women wore a dress called gamurra, which was a high-waisted long dress which could have detachable sleeves. The <b>underdress</b> worn underneath this was a simple linen dress called camicia.|$|R

[...] Much of George Gershwin's early work appeared in the 1920-24 editions of Scandals. The Black Bottom, danced by Ziegfeld Follies star Ann Pennington and Tom Patricola, touched off a national dance craze.|$|R
