40|$|The pawning or {{mortgaging}} of land (diandi) was {{a popular}} institution in early twentieth-century rural China. A predominant view sees this as essentially an <b>usurious</b> <b>practice</b> employed by {{a small group of}} landlords who dominated the business of money-lending, whose ultimate objective was to accumulate land from the poor peasants through loan default and distress land sales. Conversely, land pawning is also viewed as merely a form of credit arrangement in an economic environment where formal credit markets were basically lacking. Drawing upon two detailed cases, this study sheds new light on the nature of this economic institution. There are three key findings. First, interest rates under land pawning are found to be actually lower those than other associated with forms of lending; this can be attributed to: (a) competition among the lenders, and (b) the higher default rates that would result from higher interest rates. Second, the ulterior motive of the landlords-cum-moneylenders lay not in accumulating more land, but rather in the huge profits made possible by speculations in the grain market in one instance, and higher interest incomes in the context of rising grain prices in another, respectively. In both instances, however, households were allowed to delay their rental or interest payment in times of poor harvests, an arrangement that served the important purposes of risk sharing and consumption smoothing. Finally, evidence suggests that rich peasants had also engaged in pawning activity. and distress land sales was by no means confined to the poor. Depending on the frequency and scale of the natural disasters, many poor households were able to redeem their land...|$|E

5000|$|Until 1911, the Qing dynasty {{maintained}} {{control of}} Mongolia {{with a series}} of alliances and intermarriages, as well as military and economic measures. Ambans, Manchu [...] "high officials", were installed in Khüree, Uliastai, and Khovd, and the country was subdivided into numerous feudal and ecclesiastical fiefdoms (which also placed people in power with loyalty to the Qing). Over the course of the 19th century, the feudal lords attached more importance to representation and less importance to the responsibilities towards their subjects. The behaviour of Mongolia's nobility, together with <b>usurious</b> <b>practices</b> by Chinese traders and the collection of imperial taxes in silver instead of animals, resulted in poverty among the nomads becoming widespread. By 1911 there were 700 large and small monasteries in Outer Mongolia; their 115,000 monks made up 21% of the population. Apart from the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, there were 13 other reincarnating high lamas, called 'seal-holding saints' (tamgatai khutuktu), in Outer Mongolia.|$|R
50|$|Milles's {{economical}} works {{show the}} relation of the doctrines of the mercantilist writers to those of the later canonists. An advocate of the staple system on the ground that, while it made possible exchange without usury, it was favourable to freedom of enterprise and the development of commerce, he denounced the <b>usurious</b> <b>practices</b> of the new school, and argued that the monopoly of the Merchant Adventurers led to the growth of London {{at the expense of the}} outports, deprived merchants of free traffic, and diminished the revenue. Two years' experience as customer of Sandwich convinced him of the desirability of reviving the staple system, and after consultation with Thomas Fanshawe, remembrancer of the exchequer, he prepared a statement of his views, which was brought to the notice of Lord Burghley. Failing in this attempt to influence the government, he published The Custumers Apology: that is to say, A generall Answere to Informers of all Sortes, c. 1601. Only fifty copies of this work were printed, and they were circulated among the members of the privy council.|$|R
5000|$|According to Hou Yuon (a {{veteran of}} the {{communist}} movement who was murdered by the Khmer Rouge after they seized power in 1975), usury vied with taxes as the chief burden upon the peasantry. Hou's 1955 doctoral thesis at the University of Paris {{was one of the}} earliest and most thorough studies of conditions in the rural areas during the French colonial era. He argued that although most landholdings were small (one to five hectares), poor and middleclass peasants were victims of flagrantly <b>usurious</b> <b>practices</b> that included effective interest rates of 100 to 200 percent. Foreclosure reduced them to the status of sharecroppers or landless laborers. Although debt slavery and feudal landholding patterns had been abolished by the French, the old elites still controlled the countryside. According to Hou, [...] "the great feudal farms, because of their precapitalist character, are disguised as small and mediumsized farms, in the form of tenancies and share-farms, and materially are indistinguishable from other small and medium-seized farms." [...] Whether or not the countryside was as polarized in terms of class (or property) as Hou argues is open to debate, {{but it is clear that}} great tension and conflict existed despite the smiles and the easygoing manner of Khmer villagers.|$|R

In particular, we suggest that existing regulatory frameworks do not adequately safeguard low-income consumers who often rely on the alternative consumer credit market as their sole means of credit making them particularly susceptible to <b>usurious</b> lending <b>practices.</b> We believe {{this to be a}} particularly timely issue that has, of yet, received limited scholarly coverage adopting an international approach...|$|R
50|$|The {{more the}} Christian {{religion}} is restrained from <b>usurious</b> <b>practices,</b> {{so much the}} more does the perfidy of the Jews grow in these matters, so that {{within a short time}} they are exhausting the resources of Christians. Wishing therefore to see that Christians are not savagely oppressed by Jews in this matter, we ordain by this synodal decree that if Jews in future, on any pretext, extort oppressive and excessive interest from Christians, then they are to be removed from contact with Christians until they have made adequate satisfaction for the immoderate burden. Christians too, if need be, shall be compelled by ecclesiastical censure, without the possibility of an appeal, to abstain from commerce with them. We enjoin upon princes not to be hostile to Christians on this account, but rather to be zealous in restraining Jews from so great oppression. We decree, under the same penalty, that Jews shall be compelled to make satisfaction to churches for tithes and offerings due to the churches, which the churches were accustomed to receive from Christians for houses and other possessions, before they passed by whatever title to the Jews, so that the churches may thus be preserved from loss. During the subsequent centuries a number of Roman Jewish families left Rome on their own, or were encouraged by the Church to go to different towns or villages to establish small usury banks (with the purpose to substitute Christians in that line of business). They traveled choosing the Via Salaria or the Via Flaminia, taking along with them their tradesman abilities (with the corresponding family names, respectively): Orefice, Tessitori, Tintori, Della Seta (Goldsmith, Weaver, Dyer, Silk).|$|R

40|$|Ever {{since the}} first wave of European armies reached the Mediterranean shores of the last Islamic empire in the late eighteenth century, Western {{influence}} has dominated many important aspects of Muslim life, most notably in the areas of trade and finance. Traditional Islamic contracts and financial instruments that once prevailed in Muslim commercial markets have been replaced by Western financial instruments and institutions. The wholesale adoption of the French civil code (or the Napoleonic Code) by most Middle Eastern countries is unambiguous evidence of the magnitude of such European influence. By {{the beginning of the twentieth}} century, many pro-independence political movements began to form strong resistance to Western influence and colonial insensitivity to Islamic culture and social values. Some movements, such as the Egyptian Muslim Brothers Movement (Harakat al-Ikhwan al-Muslimin), joined their demands for political independence with demands for adopting homegrown and Islamic-inspired social and economic reforms. One of these demands called for the abolishment of the Western banking system on the ground that it violated Islamic principles, most notably the prohibition of usury. The allegations that Western banking involved <b>usurious</b> <b>practices</b> stimulated important discussions and debates among Muslim jurists and economists over the legitimacy of Western financial institutions and the viability of Islamic financial alternatives. These discussions and debates constitute the underlying theoretical foundation for contemporary Islamic finance practices. Two main approaches to such discussions can be distinguished. While some writers focused on highlighting the social and economic benefits of an Islamic system (2 ̆ 2 socio-economic approach 2 ̆ 2), others adopted a more pragmatic approach aimed at finding the optimal structure of Islamic financial institutions (2 ̆ 2 lFIs 2 ̆ 2) that could efficiently function as lawful or permissible (ha/al) platforms for offering conventional banking and financial services (2 ̆ 2 legalistic approach 2 ̆ 2).

50|$|The {{researcher}} {{concludes that}} there are situations when an interest rate cap {{may be a good}} policy decision for governments. Where insufficient credit is being provided to a particular industry that is of strategic importance to the economy, interest rate caps can be a short-term solution. While often used for political rather than economic purposes, they can help to kick start a sector or incubate it from market forces {{for a period of time}} until it is commercially sustainable without government support. They can also promote fairness - as long as a cap is set at a high enough level to allow for profitable lending for efficient financial institutions to SMEs, it can protect consumers from usury without significantly impacting outreach. Additionally, financial outreach is not an end in itself and greater economic and social impact might result from cheaper credit in certain sectors rather than greater outreach. Where lenders are known to be very profitable then it might be possible to force them to lend at lower rates in the knowledge that the costs can be absorbed into their profit margins. Caps on interest rates also protect against <b>usurious</b> lending <b>practices</b> and can be used to guard against the exploitation of vulnerable members of society.|$|R

2500|$|Tenant {{farmers were}} {{predominantly}} young – {{the age group}} most impacted by conscription.

Many of these young [...] "dirt farmers" [...] found their economic prospects hopeless, squeezed between a <b>usurious</b> credit system <b>practiced</b> by stores and substantial crop liens inflicted by landlords. The depleted condition of Oklahoma's land forced the input of twice as much labor as the sharecroppers of Mississippi and Louisiana to generate comparable yields. Disaffection was rife and proposals for radical solutions found ready ears.

40|$|At {{the end of}} {{the middle}} Ages, {{financial}} savings institutions developed, largely in response to the increasingly <b>usurious</b> money-lending <b>practices</b> of the Jews and to the adaptation of church authorities to the by then well developed commercial and financial operations. It was the Franciscan Order that took the initiative to develop such institutions, first in Italy and later in other western European Mediterranean towns. These were the so-called Monte di Pieta, which lent money at low rates of interest taking objects in pawn as security. However, as they had to operate with circulating capital and on the principles of savings banks, they may be considered to be the predecessors of modern banks. Although charity was declared in the very names of these institutions, this was no longer {{in the sense of the}} medieval mercy towards the virtuous poor, but more a support for impoverished members of higher social strata, as loan applicants had to place valuable movable property in pawn, meaning that they first had to possess such property. In spite of this, the institutions had the character of the primeval accumulation of capital, although not so much for individuals as for a community or, in the latter's name, for a commune, i. e. the local authority, which at least in the cases of Koper and Piran was also the founder. However, the stagnation of trade with the hinterland and the decline in the economic power of the Venetian Republic, particularly in the late 17 th and early 18 th centuries, pushed pawnshops into a more miserable existence, with ups and downs linked with the irregularities of profit-making on behalf of the institution, particularly by its clerks...|$|R
40|$|The latest FDIC survey (2012) on Americans {{excluded}} from regular banking services reported that between 8 % and 20 % of American households have either {{little or no}} relationship with a bank, savings institution, credit union, or other mainstream financial service providers. The only option for these customers, {{many of whom are}} ethnic minorities and immigrant communities, is to turn to AFS - Alternative Financial Services-the official name of fringe banking. Fringe banks like Ace Cash Express, EZLoans, or Mr. Payroll deliberately target the low- to moderate-income inner-city residents, often because these neighborhoods have become deserted by regular banks, making it difficult for these groups to apply for loans, credit cards, and mortgages. The American banking industry has indeed become polarized between banks in the top tier of the system who cater to the wealthier and less risky customers located in the affluent suburbs, and a market of second and third tier outlets, ranging from pawnshops and payday lenders to check-cashing outlets and cash-and-carry agencies.
