40|$|This {{body of work}} {{dimensions}} the HCCI {{fuel economy}} benefits and required aftertreatment performance for compliance with emissions regulations in North America and Europe. The following parameters were identified as key factors influencing the benefit of implementing HCCI over driving cycle: * Power-to-weight ratio * Operation range of HCCI * Conditions of the <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> * Application of constraints that cause "un-natural" mode transitions * Application of transition penalties * Available after-treatment performance * Constraints imposed by emissions regulations This study shows that development priorities for attaining maximal fuel economy benefit during <b>urban</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> differ greatly in North America and in Europe {{due to differences in}} emissions regulations. The combined effect of increasing power-to-weight ratio, increasing the operation range of HCCI, removing operational constraints on HCCI implementation, and reducing fuel penalties associated with transitions into and out of HCCI mode is shown to double the emissions-constrained fuel economy benefit of HCCI during the new European <b>driving</b> <b>cycle.</b> These factors are shown to have modest impact on fuel economy benefit of HCCI during the North American city <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> when compliance with the more stringent emissions regulations is required. In order to attain maximal fuel economy benefit and comply with emissions regulations in California, improving conversion efficiencies in the aftertreatment of lean engine exhaust must be a primary focus. Fuel economy benefit of HCCI during the highway <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> is shown to be most responsive to the amount of time the engine spends in the speed and load range of HCCI operation.

40|$|The {{control of}} exhaust {{emissions}} from modern vehicles {{is based on}} the use of after-treatment devices typically consisting in different types of catalysts. The efficiency of catalytic systems however strictly depends on their temperature, achieving certain effectiveness in reducing emissions only above the light-off temperature. This generally leads to elevated emissions during cold-start operation, especially under low ambient temperatures. We investigated the gaseous emission performance of thirteen latest technology vehicles over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), at 22 °C and - 7 °C test cell temperatures. The test fleet included gasoline vehicles both Port Fuel Injection (PFI) and Gasoline Direct Injection (G-DI) as well as diesel vehicles, amongst which a fully Euro 6 compliant vehicle equipped with a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system.

Preliminary application of a Greek driving cycle on a chassis dynamometer for the estimation of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption in order to be compared to those of the European driving cycle and to be correlated with the physicochemical characteristics of the fuels used. 7.

Valuation of the effect of driving mode on exhaust emission and fuel consumption. 8. Load tests on laboratory engine installation, for fuels evaluation as far as exhaust emission and fuel consumption is concerned. For the on-road driving data recording, the following devices were used: The VBox main unit that uses GPS technology and combines vehicle’s geographic position, with vehicle’s dynamics data logging on a flash card. The CAN 01, which is a peripheral system for VBOX was used for the recording of engine parameters (revolutions per minute, throttle position, etc). Additionally, Global Positioning System devices were used, which are able to record a number of parameters (position and speed of the vehicle, distance travelled, hegight, etc). They were used either individually or in combination with the VBox system. The research field of the present thesis is the grater area of Athens city. This is because on the one hand Attica gathers the majority of the on road vehicles and on the other hand has the biggest problems as far as pollution and traffic are concerned. Many of the basic characteristics of the driving cycles resulted from the analysis of the road data, match the corresponding characteristics of the those data in a percentage of more than 99. Those cycles are: · Greek <b>Urban</b> <b>Driving</b> <b>Cycle</b> for passenger and light duty vehicles (GUDCycle), · Greek <b>Urban</b> <b>Driving</b> <b>Cycle</b> for motorcycles (GUDΜCycle), · Driving Cycle for Parking Procedure of passenger vehicles (PPDC), · Driving Cycle of Simple Transition which was developed in areas that PPDC is effective and · Special driving cycles: o National Technical University of Athens Driving cycle (NTUADC) and o Indicative Driving Cycle for Attiki Odos (AODC). The traffic monitoring and the possible changes in circulation conditions in the Greek cities, can be provided through the adopted procedure that starts from the on-road data recording, to the development of representative driving cycles.

Current developments in engine design and fuel quality are expected to reduce these emissions in the future, but many vehicles exceed 10 years of age and may make a major contribution to urban pollutant concentrations and related health impacts for many years. In this study, emissions of a range of toxic compounds are reported using in-service vehicles which were tested using <b>urban</b> <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> developed for Australian conditions. Twelve vehicles were chosen from six vehicle weight classes and, in addition, two of these vehicles were driven through the urban drive cycle using a range of diesel fuel formulations. The fuels ranged in sulphur content from 24 to 1700 ppm, and in total aromatics from 7. 7 to 33 mass%. Effects of vehicle type and fuel composition on emissions are reported. The results show that emissions of these toxic species were broadly comparable to those observed in previous dynamometer and tunnel studies. Emissions of VOCs and smaller PAHs such as naphthalene, which are derived largely from the combustion process, appear to be related, and show relatively little variability when compared with the variability in emissions of aldehydes and larger PAHs. In particular, aldehyde emissions are highly variable and may be related to engine operating conditions. Fuels of lower sulphur and aromatic content did not have a significant influence on emissions of VOCs and aldehydes, but tended to result in lower emissions of PAHs. The toxicity of vehicle exhaust, as determined by inhalation risk and toxic equivalency factor (TEF) -weighted PAH emissions, was reduced with fuels of lower aromatic content. 13 page(s...|$|R

This paper deals with sensor fault detection within a reconfigurable direct torque control of an induction motor-based electric vehicle. The proposed strategy concerns current, voltage, and speed sensors faults that are detected and followed by post faulttolerant control to allow the vehicle continuous operation. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on an induction motor drive and simulations on an electric vehicle using a European <b>urban</b> and extraurban <b>driving</b> <b>cycle.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of the range-extended electric bus (REEB) developed by Tsinghua University must be improved; currently, the energy management strategy is a charge-deplete-charge-sustain (CDCS) strategy, which exhibits low {{energy efficiency}} on the demonstration model. To improve the energy efficiency and reduce the operating cost, a rule-based control strategy derived from the dynamic programming (DP) strategy is obtained for the Chinese <b>urban</b> bus <b>driving</b> <b>cycle</b> (CUBDC). This rule is extracted by the power-split-ratio (PSR) from the simulation results of the dynamic powertrain model using the DP strategy. By establishing the REEB dynamic models in Matlab/Simulink, the control rule can be achieved, and the power characteristic of powertrain, energy efficiency, operating cost, and computing time are analyzed. The simulation {{results show that the}} performance of the rule-based strategy presented in this paper {{is similar to that of}} the DP strategy. The energy efficiency can be improved greatly compared with that of the CDCS strategy, and the operating cost can also be reduced...|$|R
5000|$|The American FTP-75, and the {{unofficial}} European Hyzem <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> are transient, whereas the Japanese 10-15 Mode and JC08 cycles are modal cycles. Some highly stylized modal <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> such as official European NEDC {{are designed to}} fit a particular requirement and bear little relation to real world driving patterns. On the contrary, the forthcoming WLTP is striving to mimic real word driving behavior. The most common <b>driving</b> <b>cycles</b> are probably the WLTP, NEDC, SORDS and the FTP-75, the later corresponding to <b>urban</b> <b>driving</b> conditions solely.|$|R
