One {{of the most important}} differences between accounts is whether the gold is held on an allocated (fully reserved) or unallocated (pooled) basis. <b>Unallocated</b> <b>gold</b> <b>accounts</b> are a form of fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of a}} run on the issuer's gold on deposit. Another major difference is the strength of the account holder's claim on the gold, in the event that the account administrator faces gold-denominated liabilities (due to a short or naked short position in gold for example), asset forfeiture, or bankruptcy.|$|E

25|$|Banks {{may issue}} gold {{certificates}} for gold that is allocated (fully reserved) or <b>unallocated</b> (pooled). <b>Unallocated</b> <b>gold</b> certificates are {{a form of}} fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of}} a run on the issuing bank's gold on deposit.

25|$|Many banks offer <b>gold</b> <b>accounts</b> where <b>gold</b> can be {{instantly}} bought or sold {{just like}} any foreign currency on a fractional reserve basis. Swiss banks offer similar service on a fully allocated basis. Pool accounts, such as those offered by some providers, facilitate highly liquid but <b>unallocated</b> claims on <b>gold</b> owned by the company. Digital gold currency systems operate like pool accounts and additionally allow the direct transfer of fungible gold between members of the service. Other operators, by contrast, allows clients to create a bailment on allocated (non-fungible) gold, which becomes the legal property of the buyer.|$|R

50|$|The total {{quantity}} of unallocated gold {{is estimated to}} be 15,000 tonnes at the end of 2008 which supports the 2,134 tonnes on average of spot gold trade through London every day representing 14.2% of the pool. This compares to average daily turnover in UK equities of between 0.34% and 0.63% for the 12 months ending September 2009. While members of the LBMA provide no information on the backing for unallocated gold the improbably high turnover is suggestive they are operating a fractional reserve system where unallocated accounts are only partially backed by physical gold. Similarly to a bank run this makes LBMA <b>unallocated</b> <b>gold</b> <b>accounts</b> susceptible to loss if a sufficient number of market participants request delivery of physical bullion.|$|E
50|$|Foreign-exchange {{reserves}} are called reserve {{assets in the}} balance of payments and are located in the capital account.

There is no counterpart for reserve assets in liabilities of the International Investment Position. Usually, when the monetary authority of a country has some kind of liability, this will be included in other categories, such as Other Investments. In the Central Bank’s Balance Sheet, foreign exchange reserves are assets, along with domestic credit.|$|E
