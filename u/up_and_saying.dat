The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job. For me it's about more than turning <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> the lines. It's about understanding it and trying to make it better. That's actually a lot of fun. What's great is nobody says, 'Just shut up.' They want you to work at it. [...] I surprise myself sometimes because after {{two and a half years}} sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think, 'do I want to do something else?' but I really like this job, I never get that awful ‘dread’ feeling when you really don’t want to go into work." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chief Justice Roberts {{asked if}} under the Foundation's {{interpretation}} of Flast a taxpayer could [...] "sue our Marshal for standing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> 'God save the United States and this honorable Court.' Her salary comes from Congress." [...] Pincus {{said he thought}} standing would not apply in that situation because [...] "We think that the limitations that are in this Court's opinions require the taxpayer to identify a discrete and identifiable non-incidental expenditure." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 22 November, Erdoğan {{said that}} Assad should {{learn from the}} fate of Muammar Gaddafi. Erdogan said that [...] "Assad is showing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> he would fight to the death. For God's Sake, against whom will you fight? Fighting against your own people is not heroism, but cowardice. If {{you want to see}} someone who has fought until death against his own people, just look at Nazi Germany, just look at Hitler, at Benito Mussolini, at Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania," [...] and [...] "If you cannot draw any lessons from them, then look at the Libyan leader who was killed just 32 days ago in a manner none of us would wish for and who used the same {{expression}} you used." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{race was}} {{widely viewed as}} neck-and-neck between Fenty and Cropp through the spring of 2006. Fenty ran on a {{platform}} of bringing a more energetic and hands-on approach to city government,, advancing bold ideas for change, and sticking to them. Fenty said he would take his uncompromising style to the mayor's office, and cited with approval, Margaret Thatcher's saying that, [...] "Consensus is the absence of leadership". Cropp stressed her 25 years of experience in city government and her desire to continue the progress made by Anthony Williams, who endorsed her candidacy. She also stressed her ability to cooperate with diverse groups and reach consensus. She criticized Fenty's proposed approach to governing; being mayor, saying the mayor's job is [...] "not just standing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> 'This is what I want done,' and miraculously it's going to happen." [...] Both candidates raised significant and nearly equal amounts of money– roughly $1.75 million through June 10, 2006– and neither gained any significant advantages from the numerous candidate debates and forums.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shame on you, Mopsey, for not {{speaking}} right <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> that you'll {{do as much}} as the others will," [...] cried Nelly, in great excitement, lest one of the party should frustrate the others in their good work.|$|E

6000|$|From less to more, I worked {{him up to}} {{considerable}} irritation; then, {{after he}} had retired, in dudgeon, quite {{to the other end}} of the room, I got <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "I wish you good-night, sir," [...] in my natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.|$|E
60|$|These {{words were}} {{followed}} by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of 'Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,' {{but she could not}} help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.|$|E
6000|$|But {{here the}} public showed an unaccountable disinclination to deal. It was gratifying to have acquaintances coming <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> admiringly: [...] "You are an ass, you know," [...] {{as if they}} were paying the highest of compliments--as, indeed, they {{probably}} imagined that they were. All this was magnificent, but it was not business. Dunstable and Linton felt that the whole attitude of the public towards the new enterprise was wrong. Locksley seemed to regard the Trust as a huge joke, and its prospectus as a literary jeu d'esprit.|$|E

60|$|As {{she stood}} there she noticed, also, that the slant sunbeams were heating Sandy's head to what she judged to be an {{unhealthy}} temperature, and that his hat was lying uselessly at his side. To {{pick it up and}} to place it over his face was a work requiring some courage, particularly as his eyes were open. Yet she did it and made good her retreat. But she was somewhat concerned, on looking back, to see that the hat was removed, and that Sandy was sitting <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> something.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." [...] She {{then sat}} still five minutes longer; {{but unable to}} waste such a {{precious}} occasion, she suddenly got <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> to Kitty, [...] "Come here, my love, I {{want to speak to}} you," [...] took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her entreaty that she would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and called out: ...|$|E
6000|$|As if {{to corroborate}} her words, {{a piece of}} rock nearly half a ton in weight fell on the sky-light at that moment, crashed {{completely}} through it, through the table below, and even sank into the cabin floor. Fortunately, no one was hurt, though Slag had a narrow escape, but that worthy was not easily intimidated. He rose <b>up,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>saying</b> that, [...] "it was as well to be killed on deck doin' somethin' as in the cabin doin' nothin'," [...] was about to ascend the ladder when Dr Hayward suddenly entered, all wet and dishevelled, and with blood trickling down his face.|$|E

60|$|Catherine {{heard all}} this, and quite out of countenance, could listen no longer. Amazed that Isabella could endure it, and jealous for her brother, she rose <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying</b> she should join Mrs. Allen, {{proposed}} their walking. But for this Isabella showed no inclination. She was so amazingly tired, {{and it was}} so odious to parade about the pump-room; and if she moved from her seat she should miss her sisters; she was expecting her sisters every moment; so that her dearest Catherine must excuse her, and must sit quietly down again. But Catherine could be stubborn too; and Mrs. Allen just then coming up to propose their returning home, she joined her {{and walked out of the}} pump-room, leaving Isabella still sitting with Captain Tilney. With much uneasiness did she thus leave them. It seemed to her that Captain Tilney was falling in love with Isabella, and Isabella unconsciously encouraging him; unconsciously it must be, for Isabella's attachment to James was as certain and well acknowledged as her engagement. To doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd. She wished Isabella had talked more like her usual self, and not so much about money, and had not looked so well pleased at the sight of Captain Tilney. How strange that she should not perceive his admiration! Catherine longed to give her a hint of it, to put her on her guard, and prevent all the pain which her too lively behaviour might otherwise create both for him and her brother.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{accepted}} the office you have elected me to, and have now the duty to return thanks for the great honour done me. Your enthusiasm towards me, I admit, is very beautiful in itself, however undesirable {{it may be in}} regard to the object of it. It is a feeling honourable to all men, and one well known to myself when I was in a position analogous to your own. I can only hope that it may endure to the end--that noble desire to honour those whom you think worthy of honour, and come to be more and more select and discriminate in the choice of the object of it; for I can well understand that you will modify your opinions of me and many things else as you go on. (Laughter and cheers.) There are now fifty-six years gone last November since I first entered your city, a boy of not quite fourteen--fifty-six years ago--to attend classes here and gain knowledge of all kinds, I know not what, with feelings of wonder and awe-struck expectation; and now, after a long, long course, this is what we have come to. (Cheers.) There is something touching and tragic, and {{yet at the same time}} beautiful, to see the third generation, as it were, of my dear old native land, rising <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Well, you are not altogether an unworthy labourer in the vineyard: you have toiled through a great variety of fortunes, and have had many judges." [...] As the old proverb says, [...] "He that builds by the wayside has many masters." [...] We must expect a variety of judges; but the voice of young Scotland, through you, is really of some value to me, and I return you many thanks for it, though I cannot describe my emotions to you, and perhaps they will be much more conceivable if expressed in silence. (Cheers.) ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{there are}} the tramp {{handicraft}} men. Are they not all over England, in this Midsummer time? Where does the lark sing, the corn grow, the mill turn, the river run, {{and they are not}} among the lights and shadows, tinkering, chair-mending, umbrella-mending, clock-mending, knife-grinding? Surely, a pleasant thing, if we were in that condition of life, to grind our way through Kent, Sussex, and Surrey. For the worst six weeks or so, we should see the sparks we ground off, fiery bright against a background of green wheat and green leaves. A little later, and the ripe harvest would pale our sparks from red to yellow, until we got the dark newly-turned land for a background again, and they were red once more. By that time, we should have ground our way to the sea cliffs, and the whirr of our wheel would be lost in the breaking of the waves. Our next variety in sparks would be derived from contrast with the gorgeous medley of colours in the autumn woods, and, by the time we had ground our way round to the heathy lands between Reigate and Croydon, doing a prosperous stroke of business all along, we should show like a little firework in the light frosty air, and be {{the next best thing to}} the blacksmith's forge. Very agreeable, too, to go on a chair-mending tour. What judges we should be of rushes, and how knowingly (with a sheaf and a bottomless chair at our back) we should lounge on bridges, looking over at osier-beds! Among all the innumerable occupations that cannot possibly be transacted without the assistance of lookers-on, chair-mending may take a station in the first rank. When we sat down with our backs against the barn or the public-house, and began to mend, what a sense of popularity would grow upon us! When all the children came to look at us, and the tailor, and the general dealer, and the farmer who had been giving a small order at the little saddler's, and the groom from the great house, and the publican, and even the two skittle-players (and here note that, howsoever busy all the rest of village human-kind may be, there will always be two people with leisure to play at skittles, wherever village skittles are), what encouragement would be on us to plait and weave! No one looks at us while we plait and weave these words. Clock-mending again. Except for the slight inconvenience of carrying a clock under our arm, and the monotony of making the bell go, whenever we came to a human habitation, what a pleasant privilege to give a voice to the dumb cottage-clock, and set it talking to the cottage family again! Likewise we foresee great interest in going round by the park plantations, under the overhanging boughs (hares, rabbits, partridges, and pheasants, scudding like mad across and across the chequered ground before us), and so over the park ladder, and through the wood, until we came to the Keeper's lodge. Then, would, the Keeper be discoverable at his door, in a deep nest of leaves, smoking his pipe. Then, on our accosting him in the way of our trade, would he call to Mrs. Keeper, respecting 't'ould clock' in the kitchen. Then, would Mrs. Keeper ask us into the lodge, and on due examination we should offer to make a good job of it for eighteenpence; which offer, being accepted, would set us tinkling and clinking among the chubby, awe-struck little Keepers for an hour and more. So completely to the family's satisfaction would we achieve our work, that the Keeper would mention how that there was something wrong with the bell of the turret stable-clock up at the Hall, and that if we thought good of going up to the housekeeper on the chance of that job too, why he would take us. Then, should we go, among the branching oaks and the deep fern, by silent ways of mystery known to the Keeper, seeing the herd glancing here and there as we went along, until we came to the old Hall, solemn and grand. Under the Terrace Flower Garden, and round by the stables, would the Keeper take us in, and as we passed we should observe how spacious and stately the stables, and how fine the painting of the horses' names over their stalls, and how solitary all: the family being in London. Then, should we find ourselves presented to the housekeeper, sitting, in hushed state, at needlework, in a bay- window looking out upon a mighty grim red-brick quadrangle, guarded by stone lions disrespectfully throwing somersaults over the escutcheons of the noble family. Then, our services accepted and we insinuated with a candle into the stable-turret, we should find it to be a mere question of pendulum, but one that would hold us until dark. Then, should we fall to work, with a general impression of Ghosts being about, and of pictures indoors that of a certainty came out of their frames and 'walked,' if the family would only own it. Then, should we work and work, until the day gradually turned to dusk, and even until the dusk gradually turned to dark. Our task at length accomplished, we should be taken into an enormous servants' hall, and there regaled with beef and bread, and powerful ale. Then, paid freely, we should be at liberty to go, and should be told by a pointing helper to keep round over yinder by the blasted ash, and so straight through the woods, till we should see the town-lights right afore us. Then, feeling lonesome, should we desire upon the whole, that the ash had not been blasted, or that the helper had had the manners not to mention it. However, we should keep on, all right, till suddenly the stable bell would strike ten in the dolefullest way, quite chilling our blood, though we had so lately taught him how to acquit himself. Then, as we went on, should we recall old stories, and dimly consider what it would be most advisable to do, in the event of a tall figure, all in white, with saucer eyes, coming <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>saying,</b> 'I want you to come to a churchyard and mend a church clock. Follow me!' Then, should we make a burst to get clear of the trees, and should soon find ourselves in the open, with the town-lights bright ahead of us. So should we lie that night at the ancient sign of the Crispin and Crispanus, and rise early next morning to be betimes on tramp again.|$|E
