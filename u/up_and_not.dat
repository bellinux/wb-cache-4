5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
5|$|While {{the rivalry}} was {{somewhat}} subdued by the lopsidedness {{of the two}} teams records, the rivalry did provide some moments. On April 15, Mets pitcher Matt Harvey drilled Chase Utley in the back, after a few Mets pitchers {{had been hit by}} the Phillies. On August 25, during a game at Citizens Bank Park Phillies coach Larry Bowa started yelling out of the dugout after a quick pitch by Mets reliever Hansel Robles while Darin Ruf was in the box not looking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> ready for the pitch. Bowa also yelled at Mets 1st baseman Daniel Murphy over a perceived slight by Murphy's bat flip earlier in the game during a home run. Benches cleared as Bowa threatened Murphy with retaliation and was ultimately ejected from the game.|$|E
25|$|Cattaro was a Yugoslavian {{passenger}} ship which was {{laid down in}} 1914 as Hunyad. Construction was delayed due to the First World War {{and she was not}} launched until 1920. The vessel was laid <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> completed until February 1932, entering service as Jugoslavija. She was seized by the Italians in 1941 and was put into service as the auxiliary cruiser Cattaro. She was scuttled in 1943 but was raised by the Germans, repaired and entered Kriegsmarine service. She was again scuttled in March 1944 and suffered further damage in June 1944. Raised in 1945 and returned to her former owners and name, the ship was scrapped at Split, Yugoslavia in 1947.|$|E

This system was introduced to address the revenue protection concerns of the rail companies, but it was criticised for its complexity, and was abolished on 22 May 2011.|$|E

500|$|While {{the film}} portrays Andy {{escaping}} to freedom through a sewer pipe {{described as a}} [...] "river of shit," [...] Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer Terence Marsh. Of the scene, Robbins said, [...] "when you're doing a film, {{you want to be}} a good soldier—you don't want to be the one that gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety." [...] As for the scene were Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), they were originally intended to be watching Billy Wilder's The Lost Weekend (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol.

500|$|In 1968 he {{ran against}} the 81-year-old {{incumbent}} Democratic Senator Ernest Gruening, a popular {{former governor of}} the Alaska Territory who {{was considered one of}} the fathers of Alaska's statehood, for his party's nomination to the U.S. Senate. Gravel's campaign was primarily based on his youth rather than issue differences. He hired Joseph Napolitan, the first self-described political consultant, in late 1966. They spent over {{a year and a half}} planning a short, nine-day primary election campaign that featured the slogans [...] "Alaska first" [...] and [...] "Let's do something about the state we're in", the distribution of a collection of essays entitled Jobs and More Jobs, and the creation of a half-hour, well-produced, glamorized biographical film of Gravel, Man for Alaska. The film was shown twice a day on every television station in Alaska and carried by plane and shown on home projectors in hundreds of Alaska Native villages. The heavy showings quickly reversed a 2–to–1 Gruening lead in polls into a Gravel lead. Gravel visited many remote villages by seaplane and showed a thorough understanding of the needs of the bush country and the fishing and oil industries. Gravel also benefited by being deliberately ambiguous about his Vietnam policy. Gruening had been one of only two Senators to vote against the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and his opposition to President Lyndon B. Johnson's war policies was harming him among the Democratic electorate; according to Gravel, [...] "...all I had to do was stand <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> deal with the subject, and people would assume that I was to the right of Ernest Gruening, when in point of fact I was to the left of him." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for 1984 were {{generally}} favorable. Robert Christgau rated the album a B+. He explained that [...] "Side one is pure <b>up,</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> only that, it {{sticks to the}} ears" [...] and that [...] "Van Halen's pop move avoids fluff because they're heavy and schlock because they're built for speed, finally creating an all-purpose mise-en-scene for Brother Eddie's hair-raising, stomach-churning chops." [...] He also called side two [...] "consolation for their loyal fans—a little sexism, a lot of pyrotechnics, and a standard HM bass attack on something called 'House of Pain'." [...] J.D. Considine, a reviewer for Rolling Stone, rated 1984 {{four out of five}} stars. He called it [...] "the album that brings all of Van Halen's talent into focus." [...] He stated that [...] ""Jump" [...] is not exactly the kind of song you'd expect from Van Halen", but that [...] "once Alex Van Halen's drums kick in and singer David Lee Roth starts to unravel a typically convoluted story line, things start sounding a little more familiar". Although he mentioned [...] "Jump" [...] as having [...] "suspended chords and a pedalpoint bass in a manner more suited to Asia", he went on to state that [...] "Eddie Van Halen manages to expand his repertoire of hot licks, growls, screams and seemingly impossible runs to wilder frontiers than you could have imagined." [...] He concluded that [...] "what really makes this record work is the fact that Van Halen uses all this flash as a means to an end—driving the melody home—rather than as an end in itself" [...] and that [...] "despite all the bluster, Van Halen is one of the smartest, toughest bands in rock & roll. Believe me, that's no newspeak." ...|$|E

Yunkin was ordered to hold the sweatpants up against his body, which were shown to be too short for him and of a different fabric than the pair shown in the 1992 trial. Further evidence and testimony was brought against Lambert such as a relative of Yunkin providing a poem that Lambert had written in jail that described the murder. Crime scene experts also testified that no evidence of Show writing out any initials in her blood was found and that other evidence discovered at the crime scene did not corroborate with Lambert's story.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, HaKohen {{helped found}} the Zionist Freedom Alliance to promote Jewish {{national}} rights on American college campuses and co-hosted a radio program called Jewish Campus Radio on Israel National Radio (channel seven). The program dealt with all issues facing Jewish college students in the West but focused primarily on political activism on American college campuses. In the summer of 2007, INR asked HaKohen to host their new program, The Struggle, which dealt with Jewish history and global issues that concern the State of Israel. HaKohen used his radio show {{to speak out against}} Islamophobia and to place blame for the Arab–Israeli conflict on third parties, particularly the United States and Europe. In December 2008, HaKohen told Israel National News that: [...] "It was the British who originally turned local Arabs and Jews against one another in order to further their own colonialist agenda for our region. And now Western governments arm both sides and then attempt to impose artificial diplomatic solutions. The Israeli government and PA leaderships today both behave as puppets to foreign regimes and both the local Jewish and Arab populations are suffering. The way to achieve real peace between peoples here is to work from the bottom <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> the top down. The Jewish and Arab peoples are both native to the Middle East. We have a great deal in common. But for efforts at genuine peace to succeed, Western governments and multinational corporations need to leave our region alone and let the indigenous Jews and Arabs settle things between ourselves." ...|$|E

Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the track's hip hop elements recalled Miley Cyrus' [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] (2013), and said: [...] "No one needs reminding of how well that worked to rebrand the former Hannah Montana.

Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson noticed that [...] "'Good for You' allows Selena to delve deeper than she has been allowed to before, but we wouldn't want her to ditch the polished pop gems altogether". Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine said that the song's approach to more serious subject matter embodied [...] "a newfound sophistication".

VH1's Alexa Tietjen said the track's hook lacked the catchiness of Gomez's previous singles [...] "Come & Get It" [...] (2013) and [...] "The Heart Wants What It Wants" [...] (2014), but described the song as [...] "well-crafted" [...] and its melody equally as [...] "surprising" [...] as Gomez's collaboration with Rocky. Harley Brown of Spin wrote, [...] "Slowness and simplicity work well for Gomez here, leaving room for Rocky's verse to feel like a natural inclusion". Wass found Rocky's rap [...] "a little forced", but [...] "tasteful (by his standards)", while New York Dee Lockett considered it [...] "lazy".|$|E

[...] I did not imagine life could be this amazing many years ago after being released from a horrid Nigerian prison for being different. Then all I could think was I could die in this prison and no one will know or care. [...] Being imprisoned felt justifiable, considering I was being punished for being 'gay' as they assumed due to my feminine features and mannerisms. [...] I wasn't gay, I am a woman born differently due to natural defects. What I felt did not match my outward appearance. Being assigned male at birth doesn't make me a man or a woman, nobody was born a man or a woman, you are born male or female, then you develop into your preferred gender as you grow up thus making you a man or a woman. For me that gender was female. I was born male but my brain, gestures, features and carriage functioned as that of a female. Growing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>not</b> knowing what was happening to my body made me confused and lost. I couldn't discuss it with my family because my femininity was frowned upon due to religion and I could not talk to my friends because they would not understand what I was going through.

Sumners was later pardoned based on his service in the war of 1812 and the recommendation of the jury, by President Andrew Jackson. When the workers found they no longer could carry even their own lunch into the Yard, many viewed the order as nothing more than a presumption that they were all thieves.
