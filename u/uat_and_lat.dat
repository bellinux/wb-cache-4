40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the usefulness of}} a rapid immunochromatographic pneumococcal urinary antigen test (UAT) for the diagnosis of pneumonia {{over a period of}} five years. The UAT was positive in 32 (2. 3 %) urine samples obtained from 1414 patients. In 46 of these 1414 patients results of UAT and/or sputum/pleural fluid culture and/or blood culture and/or procalcitonin levels were available and therefore the study was concentrated on these patients. A concordance between <b>UAT</b> positivity <b>and</b> the presence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in the sputum was observed in only 4 of 46 (8. 7 %) patients for which both urine and sputum samples were analyzed. A discordant result (<b>UAT</b> positive <b>and</b> absence of S. pneumoniae in sputum samples) was recorded in 8 of 46 (17. 4 %) patients. UAT negative results with sputum culture positive for S. pneumoniae were recorded in 28. 3 % of patients. In 20 patients, UAT tested positive but sputum culture was not performed. A concordance between <b>UAT</b> positivity <b>and</b> the isolation of S. pneumoniae from blood was seen in 2 of 46 patients whereas a discordant result (<b>UAT</b> positive <b>and</b> blood culture negative) was seen in 12 (26. 1 %) patients. A concordance between the <b>UAT</b> <b>and</b> high levels (≥ 2 ng/ml) of procalcitonin was observed in 4 out of 46 patients, whereas a positive <b>UAT</b> result <b>and</b> a procalcitonin negative result were observed in 2 patients. In our experience the UAT allows the detection of the etiological agent of pneumonia, and also when sputum and/or blood cultures are negative for S. pneumoniae, when the clinical picture is suggestive of alveolar pneumonia...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid hormone (TH) {{transporters}} facilitate cellular TH influx and efflux, {{which is}} paramount for normal physiology. The L-type amino acid transporters <b>LAT</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 2 {{are known to}} facilitate TH transport. However, the role of LAT 3, <b>LAT</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 5 is still unclear. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to further characterize TH transport by <b>LAT</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 2 <b>and</b> to explore possible TH transport by LAT 3, <b>LAT</b> 4, <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 5. FLAG-LAT 1 - 5 constructs were transiently expressed in COS 1 cells. <b>LAT</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 2 were cotransfected with the CD 98 heavy chain. Cellular transport was measured using 10 nM 125 I-labeled T 4, T 3, rT 3, 3, 3 '-T 2, and 10 μM [125 I] 3 μ-iodotyrosine (MIT) as substrates. Intracellular metabolism of these substrates was determined in cells cotransfected with either of the LATs with type 1 or type 3 deiodinase. LAT 1 facilitated cellular uptake of all substrates <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 2 showed a net uptake of T 3, 3, 3 μ-T 2, and MIT. Expression of LAT 3 or LAT 4 did not affect transport of T 4 and T 3 but resulted in the decreased cellular accumulation of 3, 3 μ-T 2 <b>and</b> MIT. <b>LAT</b> 5 did not facilitate the transport of any substrate. Cotransfection with LAT 3 or LAT 4 strongly diminished the cellular accumulation of 3, 3 μ-T 2 <b>and</b> MIT by <b>LAT</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 2. These data were confirmed by metabolism studies. <b>LAT</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 2 show distinct preferences for the uptake of the different iodocompounds, whereas <b>LAT</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 4 specifically facilitate the 3, 3 μ-T 2 and MIT efflux. Together our findings suggest that different sets of transporters with specific influx or efflux capacities may cooperate to regulate the cellular thyroid state...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if using a sensor-equipped tibial insert would reduce medial (MED) <b>and</b> lateral (<b>LAT)</b> gapping <b>and</b> create more equivalent compressive forces in the MED <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> compartments. Methods: 7 orthopedic surgeons each performed bilateral TKA on complete lower extremity cadaveric specimens. Left TKA was performed first without the use of the instrumented tibial insert. With trial components placed, the patella was reduced and joint capsule closed with towel clips. Surgeons performed varus and valgus stress tests on each knee and the mm of MED <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> gapping were recorded. Compressive forces in the MED <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> compartment were measured at 10 °, 45 °, and 90 ° of flexion. Sensor-assisted TKA was then performed on the right knee and compressive forces and gapping were again recorded. MED, <b>LAT,</b> <b>and</b> total mediolateral (ML) gapping <b>and</b> MED <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> compressive forces were compared between conventional TKA and sensor-assisted TKA with paired t-tests. Results: Sensor-assisted TKA resulted in significantly reduced MED (1. 2 vs. 1. 9 mm, p<. 001), LAT (0. 8 vs. 1. 4 mm, p = 0. 003), and total ML gapping (2. 0 vs. 3. 4 mm, p<. 001). There were no differences in the MED <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> compressive forces between conventional and sensor-assisted TKA. However, sensor-assisted TKAs demonstrated greater MED compartment forces as the knee was flexed whereas conventional TKAs had greater LAT forces. Conclusions: Sensor-assisted TKA significantly reduced MED <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> gapping with the knee in 20 ° of flexion. Future clinical studies are needed to determine the most appropriate compressive forces in the MED <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> compartments...|$|R

40|$|Fetal growth {{depends on}} placental {{transfer}} of amino acids from maternal to fetal blood. The mechanisms of net amino acid efflux across the basal membrane (BM) of the placental syncytiotrophoblast to the fetus, although vital for amino acid transport, are poorly understood. We examined {{the hypothesis that}} facilitated diffusion by the amino acid transporters TAT 1, <b>LAT</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 4 {{plays an important role}} in this process, with possible effects on fetal growth. Amino acid transfer was measured in isolated perfused human placental cotyledons (n = 5 per experiment) using techniques which distinguish between different transport processes. Placental TAT 1, <b>LAT</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 4 proteins were measured, and mRNA expression levels (measured using real-time quantitative-PCR) were related to fetal and neonatal anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measurements of neonatal lean mass in 102 Southampton Women's Survey (SWS) infants. Under conditions preventing transport by amino acid exchangers, all amino acids appearing in the fetal circulation were substrates of TAT 1, LAT 3 or LAT 4. Western blots demonstrated the presence of TAT 1, <b>LAT</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 4 in placental BM preparations. Placental TAT 1 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 3 mRNA expression were positively associated with measures of fetal growth in SWS infants (P < 0. 05). We provide evidence that the efflux transporters TAT 1, <b>LAT</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 4 are present in the human placental BM, and may play an important role in the net efflux of amino acids to the fetus. Unlike other transporters they can increase fetal amino acid concentrations. Consistent with a role in placental amino acid transfer capacity and fetal growth TAT 1 <b>and</b> <b>LAT</b> 3 mRNA expression showed positive associations with infant size at birth...|$|R
