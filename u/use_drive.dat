50|$|Launch lift hills {{are like}} launch tracks, {{but instead of}} having it flat, it is rather at an incline. Sometimes, launch lift hills serve the same purpose as lift hills but faster {{transport}} {{to the top of}} the lift hill; or they are sometimes used to power the train up into an element, like the Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal Orlando. Launch lift hills use mostly linear synchronous motors or linear induction motors but sometimes <b>use</b> <b>drive</b> tires.|$|E
50|$|The ride {{starts with}} a lift hill. Unlike the {{traditional}} chain lift, the Roller Coaster's lift hill <b>use</b> <b>drive</b> tires, which many coasters use to roll into a train station. At {{the end of the}} lift, riders face a swooping banked curve, leading to a camelback hill, then a highly banked curve to the right. Another hill appears, followed by a large turn, leading riders to a cave in middle of the air. Trains then bank for the last time and hit the brakes. A small curve leads riders to the station.|$|E

50|$|A <b>used</b> {{clothing}} <b>drive</b> is philanthropic {{activity that}} requests clothing donations from community members or {{a network of}} individuals {{for the benefit of}} a non profit group or group of vulnerable people. There are many benefits to organizing a <b>used</b> clothing <b>drive.</b> <b>Used</b> clothing <b>drives</b> divert waste from landfills by giving people an alternative disposal method for unwanted, ripped or stained items. Only 15% of textiles are recycled. Nearly 95% of textiles worn or torn can be recycled.A <b>used</b> clothing <b>drive</b> can be a fundraising effort for organizations or groups that lack funding such as, Schools, Religious organizations, clubs, Sports Teams and Associations, neighborhoods and, communities.Donated Items can be given for free to the needy.|$|R

50|$|The Multiplier Model {{is derived}} mathematically using the {{input-output}} model and Social Accounting formats. The Social Accounting System provides {{the framework for}} the predictive Multiplier Model used in economic impact studies. Purchases for final <b>use</b> <b>drive</b> the model. Industries that produce goods and services for consumer consumption must purchase products, raw materials, and services from other companies to create their product. These vendors must also procure goods and services. This cycle continues until all the money is leaked from the region’s economy. There are three types of effects measured with a multiplier: the direct, the indirect, and the induced effects. The direct effect is the known or predicted change in the local economy {{that is to be}} studied. The indirect effect is the business-to-business transactions required to satisfy the direct effect. Finally, the induced effect is derived from local spending on goods and services by people working to satisfy the direct and indirect effects.|$|E
50|$|A drive tire, or squeeze tire {{depending}} on its usage, {{is essentially a}} motorized tire used to propel a roller coaster train along a piece of track. Although they are most often used in station areas and brake runs, {{they can also be}} used to launch trains at greater speeds. However, they are generally used to propel the train at speeds between 5-8 mph. The Incredible Hulk Coaster at Universal's Islands of Adventure is notable for using drive tires to launch the train up an incline. Some roller coasters, most noticeably Vekoma Roller Skaters (Vekoma's version of a junior coaster) and Zierer Tivoli/Force (also junior coasters) also <b>use</b> <b>drive</b> tires instead of a chain on lift hills.Drive tires are also used to power other types of amusement rides, such as ferris wheels, Pirate Ships, and other spinning rides. The Olympia Looping traveling roller coaster at Barth,Alpina Bahn and Mindbender at Galaxyland at the West Edmonton Mall also feature a drive tire instead of a chain on their lift hill.|$|E

5000|$|The {{three good}} fairies {{also play a}} role in the Kingdom Hearts series of video games. They first appear in Kingdom Hearts II at Yen Sid's tower, giving Sora his new outfit after he wakes from his year-long sleep, as well as the Star Seeker Keyblade and the ability to <b>use</b> <b>Drive,</b> and later {{witnessing}} Maleficent's return to power. At first, they all argue over what colour Sora's new outfit should be, until agreeing to zap it all at the same time. The end result is a black outfit with colourful highlights all over. In Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, the fairies appear in their homeworld, the [...] "Enchanted Dominion", talking with Ventus about Aurora and Phillip and later assisting him in his battle against Maleficent. They also appear at the end of Aqua and Phillip's battle against Maleficent in her dragon form, again blessing Phillip's sword as he throws it into Maleficent's heart; however, the attack does not kill her and just defeats her. During the credits, while Aurora and Phillip are dancing, Flora and Merryweather continue their old argument over what color Aurora's dress should be.|$|E

40|$|Water {{is scarce}} in many countries. One {{instrument}} {{for improving the}} allocation of a scarce resource is (efficient) pricing or taxation. However, water is implicitly traded on international markets, particularly through food and textiles, so that the impacts of water taxes cannot be studied in isolation, but require an analysis of international trade implications. We include water as a production factor in a multi-region, multi-sector computable general equilibrium model (GTAP), to assess a series of water tax policies. We find that water taxes reduce water use and lead to shifts in production, consumption and international trade patterns. Countries that do not levy water taxes are nonetheless affected by other countries' taxes. Taxes on agricultural water <b>use</b> <b>drive</b> most {{of the economic and}} welfare impacts. Reductions in water use (welfare losses) are less (more) than linear with the price of water. The results are sensitive to the assumed ability to substitute other production factors for water. A water tax on production would have different effects on water use, production and trade patterns and the size and distribution of welfare losses than would a water tax on final consumption. © IWA Publishing 2008...|$|E

Those demographics can in turn influence the events covered by the media. Media outlets will cover what people want to see or hear so advertisers will pay for the coverage and contribute to the bottom line. The audiences are fractured because technology is changing, expanding and providing more choices than ever before. The analysis of studies, memoirs and interviews shows that the news consumers and the news providers are plunging ahead together, unevenly at times, but in a constant dance that will continue to evolve with the growing options for disseminating information. The Internet is playing a much larger role even with the older media such as newspapers. Weblogs are having a major impact in delivering information and dissecting large media outlets. The speed of some news delivery is challenging the standards of accuracy. What has remained very steady through this sea of change is Americans’ appetite for news...|$|E

40|$|The {{wild boar}} was reintroduced to Sweden in the 1970 ´s from {{enclosures}} {{that they had}} escaped from and by a government decision in 1988 they were considered {{a part of the}} natural fauna again. The purpose with this report is {{to examine the effects of}} the wild boars’ reintroduction both on their welfare and on other aspects, such as how their population growth affects Sweden. This was done by gathering information from scientific literature and by performing three interviews. Another purpose is to briefly overlook live trapping and other common regulation methods. After the wild boar was reestablished, local problems for landowners started to rise where the populations where substantial. Both landowners and hunters have been feeding the wild boars in attempts to help and feed up the population. As a result of this they have adjusted to an artificial resource and the population density has increased. A large population of wild boar demands regulation methods to minimize damage on agricultural crops and traffic accidents involving wild boars, and in Sweden we use feeding in averting purposes as well as carrion hunt. We also <b>use</b> <b>drive</b> hunting and live trapping as regulation methods. The question is if these types of regulation are suitable in consideration of the wild boars welfare. The wild boar lives in a matriarchate where the older male boars live nearby. The wild boar is a withdrawn animal that is nocturnal to avoid us humans, it also stays clear of big open areas. They are also opportunistic omnivores and eat what they can find in their environment. In the winter you can see an increase in animalistic feed and in the summer agricultural crops are especially vulnerable. Good access to food sources are the main reason to the rapid population growth. The wild boars’ ecology and behavior are the main factors that we need to take into consideration in the management of this species. The Swedish Hunting association, Lantbrukarnas Riksförbund and Sveaskog were asked what their opinion was in the matter of population growth and choice of suitable management for the wild boar. The wild boar population is wanted by both the Swedish Hunting association and Lantbrukarnas Riksförbund as well as Sveaskog. But their opinion on live trapping is what separates them most in the cause of the wild boar. Where LRF can see a continued use of live trapping, the Swedish Hunting association is against future use of this method. Regulation is needed and should be locally preformed, though information is needed on how we humans affect population growth and how our regulation methods affect the wild boars’ welfare...|$|E
