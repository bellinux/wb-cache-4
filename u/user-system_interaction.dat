40|$|The {{scope of}} 3 D geo {{information}} applications is broadening to include for instance crises management and training. These new applications {{are no longer}} restricted to expert users, but aimed at involving a multitude of (non-professional) stakeholders in a participatory design and decision process. This introduces new challenges for the <b>user-system</b> <b>interaction</b> that go beyond 3 D visualization. Based on two use-scenarios in urban planning and crisis management, we identify important user-system research areas: intuitive data access and manipulation, multi-stakeholder participatory design and decision, and multisensory experience. We argue that future 3 D geo information applications can benefit from the spin-in of Human Factors Engineering technology from domains such as medical visualization and serious gaming. We plead for starting a research community around <b>user-system</b> <b>interaction</b> for future 3 D geo information applications that sets the research agenda and ensures that new applications benefit from advanced <b>user-system</b> <b>interaction</b> technologies...|$|E

40|$|Information systems (IS) {{researchers}} have typically examined the user-system relationship as an isolated dyadbetween a single, independent user and an individual, freestanding information system. We {{argue that this}} conceptualization does not adequately represent most organizations today, in which multiple users interact with multiple information systems within a group. Relying heavily on the theory and methods behind social net-work analysis, we introduce the concept of multimodal networks to assess both users and information systems as equivalent nodes in a single social network. This perspective allows us to examine the influence of information systems on organizational outcomes {{as a function of}} all of the <b>user-system</b> and interpersonal <b>interactions</b> in a group. We explore two different possible mechanisms for this influence: (1) direct <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> by aggregating the strength of all the dyadic <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> in a group, and (2) indirect <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> by assessing the centrality of the information systems within the social network. We survey approxi-mately 600 individuals in 40 healthcare groups to test whether either or both of these mechanisms are associated with two types of organizational performance outcomesâ€”efficiency and quality of care. We find that the central-ity of the information systems within the network is significantly and positively associated with both efficiency and quality outcomes, but that the average strength of the <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> is not. Implications are that managers and researchers should examine the wider multimodal network of multiple users and multiple systems when assessing the role of IS in organizations in relation to organizational performance outcomes...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Previous research has established that virtual reality (VR) technology provides users a unique <b>user-system</b> <b>interaction.</b> However, little research has been conducted to understand how VR technology contributes to system usability within specific contexts. The current research investigates how users perceive desktop VR differently from conventional 2 D graphics and how system usability is affected by the <b>user-system</b> <b>interaction</b> process within a VR system. The impact of desktop VR on system usability was empirically examined from an integrated view of technology acceptance in information systems and human-computer interaction. This research tested a model of the <b>user-system</b> <b>interaction</b> process (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and presence) and outcomes measured by system usability dimensions (satisfaction and decision confidence) for a VR system. Data were collected to compare the process and outcomes of using a VR system and a conventional 2 D system to engage in a consumer survey. In addition, how user characteristics affect <b>user-system</b> <b>interaction</b> while using a VR system was examined. The results largely support the proposition that VR technology provides system usability with significantly higher perceived usefulness and presence than do the conventional 2 D formats. The current work provides new knowledge about usability, sense of presence and technology acceptance in desktop VR and provides insights for future research with and predicted applications of desktop VR...|$|E

However current methods fail at capturing the intrinsic dynamics of the system, and focus on evolution due to exogenous factors like day-night patterns. In order to capture the intrinsic dynamics of <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions,</b> we propose an innovative graph-based approach relying on a novel concept of time. We apply our method on a large real-world system (the Github. com social network) to automatically detect statistically signi cant events in a real-time fashion.

40|$|Background: Pharmacogenomic {{clinical}} {{decision support}} systems (CDSS) {{have the potential to}} help overcome some of the barriers for translating pharmacogenomic knowledge into clinical routine. Before developing a prototype it is crucial for developers to know which pharmacogenomic CDSS features and <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> have yet been developed, implemented and tested in previous pharmacogenomic CDSS efforts and if they have been successfully applied. We address this issue by providing an overview of the designs of <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> of recently developed pharmacogenomic CDSS. Methods: We searched PubMed for pharmacogenomic CDSS published between January 1, 2012 and November 15, 2016. Thirty-two out of 118 identified articles were summarized and included in the final analysis. We then compared the designs of <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> of the 20 pharmacogenomic CDSS we had identified. Results: Alerts are the most widespread tools for physician-system interactions, but need to be implemented carefully to prevent alert fatigue and avoid liabilities. Pharmacogenomic test results and override reasons stored in the local EHR might help communicate pharmacogenomic information to other internal care providers. Integrating patients into <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> through patient letters and online portals might be crucial for transferring pharmacogenomic data to external health care providers. Inbox messages inform physicians about new pharmacogenomic test results and enable them to request pharmacogenomic consultations. Search engines enable physicians to compare medical treatment options based on a patientâ€™s genotype. Conclusions: Within the last 5 years, several pharmacogenomic CDSS have been developed. However, most of the included articles are solely describing prototypes of pharmacogenomic CDSS rather than evaluating them. To support the development of prototypes further evaluation efforts will be necessary. In the future, pharmacogenomic CDSS will likely include prediction models to identify patients who are suitable for preemptive genotyping...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Occupant control {{actions in}} a {{building}} (i. e. user interactions with environmental systems for heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, etc.) can significantly affect both indoor climate in and the environmental performance of buildings. Nonetheless, relatively few systematic (long-term and high-resolution) efforts {{have been made to}} observe and analyze the means and patterns of such <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> with building systems. Specifically, the necessary requirements for the design and testing of hardware and software systems for user-system interfaces have not been formulated in a rigorous and reliable manner. This paper includes an exploration of the requirements of interfaces for <b>user-systems</b> <b>interactions</b> in sentient buildings. The outcome of this effort serves {{as a starting point for}} developing a new generation of user interface products to promote higher levels of connectivity between occupants and sentient environments...|$|R

To facilitate such consideration, this paper reviews the past, present, and future of CE as a discipline. The past, and in particular its shortcomings, is characterized in terms of an earlier description offered by Long (1987). The present is characterized in terms of the lessons assumed to have been learned by CE, since that publication. The future is characterized in terms of lessons which still remain to be learned. Possible challenges for USI are identified for all CE lessons. Last, the paper raises some general issues concerning CE and USI...|$|E

30|$|With the afore-mentioned data, user {{interests}} can {{be inferred}} and user profiles (models) can be created {{in a number of}} ways and various methods. Most of them use vector-space and probabilistic modeling approaches, some of them are based on neural networks or graphs.

Often user interest modeling is done specifically for the system it is applied to with regard to its application domain and based on the specific data that can be obtained from <b>user-system</b> <b>interactions</b> of this particular system. Consequently, modeling methods for user interests will be constrained to that type of systems, in contrast to other generic modeling approaches.|$|R
