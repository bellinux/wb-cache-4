Our journey is not {{complete}} <b>until</b> <b>our</b> gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.|$|E

25|$|As {{previously}} stated, Romanesque architecture style reached Portugal {{by the end}} of the 11th {{century by}} the hand of Cluniac, Cistercian and Augustinian orders, bringing with them the monastical reforms that were already underway in their countries of origin. Their influence and importance on the spreading of this new art form can be asserted by the large number of churches and monasteries, one of the kind of Romanesque buildings that survived <b>until</b> <b>our</b> days.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} wars, {{but it was}} the nineteenth century that marked its people, after they fought a long war for their {{independence}} from the Portuguese Empire. The Farrapos War started with the confrontation in Porto Alegre, near the Azenha bridge on 20 September 1835. Albeit terminated, this conflict etched in the pages of history the myth of the gaucho that is <b>until</b> <b>our</b> days praised in songs and celebrated in annual pageants and honored as names of streets and parks.|$|E
25|$|The bearing {{of these}} ideas on current {{thinking}} on speech origins remains unclear. One suggestion is that ape communication tends to resist metaphor for social reasons. Since they inhabit a Darwinian (as opposed to morally regulated) social world, these animals are under strong competitive pressure not to accept patent fictions as valid communicative currency. Ape vocal communication tends to be inflexible, marginalising the ultra-flexible tongue, precisely because listeners treat with suspicion any signal which might {{prove to be a}} fake. Such insistence on perceptible veracity is clearly incompatible with metaphoric usage. An implication is that neither articulate speech nor distinctively human abstract thought could have begun evolving <b>until</b> <b>our</b> ancestors had become more cooperative and trusting of one another's communicative intentions.|$|E

I therefore released Prinz Eugen at noon yesterday {{so that she could}} conduct commerce warfare on her own. She has managed to evade the enemy. We, on the other hand, because of the hits we have received, have been ordered to proceed to a French port. On our way there the enemy will gather and give us battle.

500|$|A {{significant}} number of the structures surviving the 1915 destruction were destroyed in the 1960s. As of 2006, the monastery's remains were used a barn. According to historian Ara Sarafian, as of 2012, [...] "good sections have just barely survived <b>until</b> <b>our</b> days." [...] Dr. Jenny B. White, a scholar on Turkey, wrote in 2013 that, on her visit, {{the remains of the}} monastery [...] "consisted of nothing more than a few brick vaults used to house goats amid a clutch of tumbledown Kurdish homes." [...] The best-preserved section of the monastery is the church of Surb Gevorg (St. George), which is now looked after by a caretaker. The dome is partly collapsed and contains some traces of surviving frescoes. The dome of the church of Surb Nshan is entirely gone.|$|E
500|$|Obviously we knew {{people were}} going to totally sensationalize it. They're {{beautiful}} girls, the scene is hot—I'm not afraid to say that. There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would talk on the phone <b>until</b> <b>our</b> ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup.

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament. He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, [...] "t would be madness {{for the country to}} stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort <b>until</b> <b>our</b> deficiencies had been made good." [...] However, later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich. Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes. However, Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord. Having considered a general election immediately following Munich Chamberlain instead reshuffled his Cabinet. By the end of the year, however, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that [...] "to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election" [...] would be [...] "suicidal".|$|E

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1842, two LDS missionaries, {{one of whom was}} Charles Wesley Wandell, were preaching in the area. Although {{forbidden}} by her Presbyterian preacher, James recorded that she [...] "had a desire to hear them. I went on a Sunday and was fully convinced that it was the true Gospel." [...] James was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the following Sunday, and later acquainted many friends and family members with her new beliefs as well. A year later, James and eight other members of her family, including her mother, three brothers, two sisters, and a brother and sister-in-law- decided to move from their home in Wilton to Nauvoo, Illinois, in order to live among other members of their new faith. The group of nine began their journey with other Latter Day Saints under the direction of Wandell, but got separated from the group at Buffalo, New York when they couldn't afford to pay the train fare from New York to Ohio. James and her family traveled the remainder of their journey (approximately 800 miles) on foot. In her Life Sketch, recorded in 1893, James recalled that [...] "We walked <b>until</b> <b>our</b> shoes were worn out, and our feet became sore and cracked open and bled until you could see the whole print of our feet with blood on the ground." [...] When James and her family arrived in Nauvoo, they were welcomed by Joseph Smith himself. Over the next year, her mother and siblings would establish their own homes. James, however, lived with the Joseph Smith family in Nauvoo until Smith's assassination in 1846.|$|E
500|$|Ripken spent 1960 {{with the}} Fox Cities Foxes of the Class B Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League, {{known as the}} Three-I League. He had his best season that year, batting a career-high [...]281 with 100 hits, nine home runs, and 74 RBI. Earl Weaver, {{eventually}} a Hall of Fame manager for the Orioles but manager of Fox Cities in 1960, recalled, [...] "He was hitting over [...]300 <b>until</b> <b>our</b> team bus driver quit and Cal started doing his job, too. The 15-hour bus trips were strenuous work, but Rip always was hard as nails -- toughness personified." [...] During spring training in 1961, he suffered an injury after several foul tips went off his shoulder. Initial X-rays showed nothing, but three months into the season {{it was discovered that}} Ripken had a dislocated shoulder, an atrophied deltoid muscle, and a tendon problem. He continued to play, but the injury was one which would take years to fully recover from, and his son, Cal Jr., wrote, [...] "Practically speaking, if my father wanted to stay in the game he'd have to shift his sights from playing to coaching and managing." [...] He played with three teams in 1961: the Class D Leesburg Orioles of the Florida State League, the Double-A Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, and the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings of the International League. The stint with Rochester came because the Red Wings were in desperate need of a catcher; although Ripken could catch and handle pitchers, the injury had robbed him of the ability to throw well. He appeared in 58 games with the Class D Appleton Foxes in 1962, and played his final games in 1964, when made two appearances for the Class A Aberdeen Pheasants of the Northern League.|$|E
