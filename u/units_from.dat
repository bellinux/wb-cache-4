5|$|After the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, the Seventh Army began sending infantry <b>units</b> <b>from</b> the divisions in West Germany on a rotating basis to reinforce the Berlin Brigade. The 24th Division's units participated in this action.|$|E

5|$|After the {{planning}} for the invasion, Dutton took command of 3 Commando Brigade, which was already serving in Afghanistan. In 2003, he led the brigade into the start of Iraq War, supported by <b>units</b> <b>from</b> the British Army {{as well as the}} United States Marine Corps, making Dutton the first British officer to command American troops since the Second World War. He commanded his men through heavy resistance from Iraqi forces {{in the early days of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it could}} not be {{considered}} a large air arm in the wider context of World War II, the ZNDH nonetheless had on its charge {{at one time or another}} some 650 aircraft between April 1941 and May 1945, as well as anti-aircraft and paratroop <b>units.</b> <b>From</b> humble beginnings in 1941, the ZNDH was still providing some measure of air-support (fighter, attack and transport) until the last days of World War II in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Another {{variation}} on the theme was produced later in the season. Like the BT46B, the BT46C removed the radiators from the front wing assembly leaving a clean aerodynamic wing and moving the centre of gravity further back again. The standard radiators were replaced by <b>units</b> <b>from</b> a Volkswagen Golf mounted behind the front wheels out of the airstream in a region of positive pressure.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Soviet Tartu Operation, the ratio of Soviet to German strength was 4.3:1 for troops, 14.8:1 for artillery and 4.1:1 for armour. The German forces were mostly battle groups from various formations and smaller <b>units</b> <b>from</b> different branches. A significant proportion of the German side was constituted of Omakaitse militia battalions with poor weaponry and little fighting ability.|$|E
5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the El Alamein fighting, the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion was withdrawn to Gaza in early December, remaining there {{with the rest of the}} 9th Division until embarking on the Queen Mary for Australia in late January 1943, as part of the final withdrawal of Australian ground <b>units</b> <b>from</b> the Middle East to the Pacific to fight the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|By 1799, the {{fortress}} of Mantua {{on the river}} Mincio in northern Italy was in poor shape. It was commanded by viscount lieutenant general François-Philippe de Foissac-Latour (1750-1804) and garrisoned by a diverse force of 10,000, including French, Polish (Polish Legionnaires under general Józef Wielhorski), Italian (Republic of Alba and Cisalpine Republic), Swiss and German <b>units.</b> <b>From</b> {{the beginning of his}} assignment, Foissac-Latour, an engineer, was convinced that {{the fortress}} would be indefensible in any serious siege.|$|E

5|$|By mid-March, Marine {{intelligence}} {{began to}} note an exodus of NVA <b>units</b> <b>from</b> the Khe Sanh sector. The 325C Divisional Headquarters {{was the first}} to leave, followed by the 95C and 101D Regiments, all of which relocated to the west. At the same time, the 304th Division withdrew to the southwest. That did not mean, however that battle was over. On 22 March over 1,000 North Vietnamese rounds fell on the base, and, once again, the ammunition dump was detonated.|$|E
5|$|Despite its continual {{merging with}} other <b>units</b> <b>from</b> 1881, {{the legacy of}} the 52nd remains. Many of the 52nd's battle honours are {{represented}} on the Belt Badge of The Rifles (being a rifle regiment, The Rifles do not carry colours). Various museums record the actions of the 52nd and hold collections of artifacts and memorabilia, including the Royal Green Jackets Museum, and the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Trust, whose archives are managed by the Oxfordshire County Council.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{high rates}} of {{desertion}} from 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed to disarm the Bosnians in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division, but Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to Bosnia and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support <b>units</b> <b>from</b> 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary.|$|E

5|$|Eta Apodis {{is a white}} main {{sequence}} star located 138 ± 1 light-years distant. Of apparent magnitude 4.89, it is 1.77 times as massive, 15.5 times as luminous as the Sun and has 2.13 times its radius. Aged 250 ± 200 million years old, this star is emitting an excess of 24μm infrared radiation, which {{may be caused by}} a debris disk of dust orbiting at a distance of more than 31 astronomical <b>units</b> <b>from</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the {{division}} remained as an active command in the National Guard, gradually expanding its command to contain <b>units</b> <b>from</b> other divisions which had been consolidated. However, {{the division}} was never called up to support any major contengencies or see major combat, and was eventually deactivated in 1993, reorganized as a brigade under the 29th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Göring met {{his staff}} at Karinhall the {{following}} day for a conference. Their assessments of the air battle verged on pure fantasy. They concluded the RAF had withdrawn all available fighter <b>units</b> <b>from</b> {{all over the country}} to concentrate on London. The fact that the Western afternoon raids against ports were uncontested led them to believe the enemy was breaking. Another four or five days, they thought, would be sure to break them.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, imaging of {{the inner}} region of the Beta Pictoris system with the Keck II {{telescope}} revealed the presence of several features which are interpreted as being belts or rings of material.

5|$|In April 1863, food {{shortages}} led to rioting in Richmond, as poor people robbed and looted numerous stores for food until Davis cracked down and restored order. Davis feuded bitterly with his vice president. Perhaps even more seriously, he clashed with powerful state governors who used states' rights arguments to withhold their militia <b>units</b> <b>from</b> national service and otherwise blocked mobilization plans.|$|E
