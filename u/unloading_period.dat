40|$|Farrugia et al (1993) have {{recently}} studied substorm activity {{driven by the}} passage of an interplanetary magnetic cloud during which the interplanetary magnetic field turned southward for approximately 18 hours. It was shown that both the epsilon and the VB(sub s) parameters varied slowly on the timescale of a substorm but changed considerably over the interval as a whole. The substorm occurrence rate did not reflect the variation in magnetospheric energy loading rate as measured by these parameters but, rather, remained roughly constant with a 50 -min average period. Klimas et al. (1992) showed that the Faraday loop analog model of geomagnetic activity predicts this single unloading rate under various constant loading rates. However, various model parameters were adjusted to yield a 1 -hour <b>unloading</b> <b>period</b> {{in agreement with the}} Bargatze et al. (1985) linear prediction filters and in approximate agreement with the Farrugia et al. (1993) results. It has since been found necessary to add a slow relaxation mechanism to the Faraday loop model to allow for its approach to a ground state during long periods of inactivity. It is proposed that the relaxation mechanism is provided by slow convection of magnetic flux out of the magnetotail to the dayside magnetosphere. In addition, a rudimentary representation of magnetotail-ionosphere coupling has been added to enable comparison of model output to measured AL. The present study is of the modified Faraday loop model response to solar wind input from the Bargatze et al. data set with comparison of its output to concurrent AL.

Fine-grained units in the basin, such as the Fish Scales Formation (Mowry equivalent) and the Early Turonian Second White Specks Formation (Greenhorn equivalent), have traditionally been attributed to deposition during episodes of high eustatic sea levels. However, facies, allostratigraphy, and isopach patterns of the latest Albian Westgate, Fish Scales, mid–late Cenomanian Belle Fourche and Second White Specks formations in southern Alberta suggest that strata were deposited alternately during orogenic loading periods and unloading periods. We interpreted the Fish Scales Formation, a deposit formed during the marine transgression of the Mowry Seaway in the latest Albian–earliest Cenomanian, to have been deposited in a wide shallow interior seaway during an orogenic <b>unloading</b> <b>period.</b> The Barons Sandstone, interbedded with the mudstone of the Fish Scales Formation, is interpreted as a regressive shoreface, distributary channel and barrier island sandstone deposited during the <b>unloading</b> <b>period.</b> We also tentatively interpreted the Second White Specks Formation, a regional stratigraphic marker deposited during the so-called peak eustatic sea level in the Early Turonian, to have been deposited in a wide shallow interior seaway during a period of regional orogenic unloading.

The nonlinear consolidation behavior of a vertical drain subjected to these two types of loading schemes was then investigated by a parametric study. The results show that the loading rate, the ratio of the compressibility index to the permeability index (CdCk) and the initial stress state have a significant influence on the consolidation rate.

40|$|The Load-Unload Response Ratio (LURR) {{method is}} an intermediate-term {{earthquake}} prediction approach that has shown considerable promise. It involves calculating {{the ratio of}} a specified energy release measure during loading and unloading where loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>periods</b> are determined from the earth tide induced perturbations in the Coulomb Failure Stress on optimally oriented faults. In the lead-up to large earthquakes, high LURR values are frequently observed a few months or {{years prior to the}} event. These signals may have a similar origin to the observed accelerating seismic moment release (AMR) prior to many large earthquakes or may be due to critical sensitivity of the crust when a large earthquake is imminent. As a first step towards studying the underlying physical mechanism for the LURR observations, numerical studies are conducted using the particle based lattice solid model (LSM) to determine whether LURR observations can be reproduced. The model is initialized as a heterogeneous 2 -D block made up of random-sized particles bonded by elastic-brittle links. The system is subjected to uniaxial compression from rigid driving plates on the upper and lower edges of the model. Experiments are conducted using both strain and stress control to load the plates. A sinusoidal stress perturbation is added to the gradual compressional loading to simulate loading and unloading cycles and LURR is calculated. The results reproduce signals similar to those observed in earthquake prediction practice with a high LURR value followed by a sudden drop prior to macroscopic failure of the sample. The results suggest that LURR provides a good predictor for catastrophic failure in elastic-brittle systems and motivate further research to study the underlying physical mechanisms and statistical properties of high LURR values. The results provide encouragement for earthquake prediction research and the use of advanced simulation models to probe the physics of earthquakes...|$|R

The selected study area was zoned into 20 sub-regions, in each of which the fault geometry and the focal mechanisms were very similar such that the stress fields were almost uniform. The loading and <b>unloading</b> <b>periods</b> were determined by calculating perturbations in the Coulomb failure stress in each sub-regions induced by earth tides. Earthquakes occurring in these sub-regions were identified as a loading or unloading type, and the re-sponse rate was chosen as the Benioff strain that can be calculated from earthquake magnitude M. With a time window of 1 year, a time moving step of 1 month, a space window of a circle region with a radius of 100 km, and a space moving step of 0. 5 latitudinally and longitudinally, snapshots of the evolution of Y/Yc were generated. Scanning results show that obvious Y/Yc anomalies can be detected near the epicenter of all big earthquakes larger than M 6. 5 in regions with reasonable seismic monitoring abilities. They also show Y/Yc anomalies occurred several years prior to the big earthquakes and the lasting time of the anomaly is from one year to several years. For some LURR anomalous regions, however, no earthquakes occurred. According to the characteristics of LURR anomalies, two regions with a high risk of big earthquakes were detected.

The contribution of calpain proteases to muscle wasting in any instance of muscle injury or disease has remained unknown {{because of the}} inability to specifically perturb calpain activity in vivo. We have generated a transgenic mouse with muscle-specific overexpression of calpastatin, which is the endogenous inhibitor of calpains, and induced muscle atrophy by unloading hindlimb musculature for 10 days. Expression of the transgene resulted in increases in calpastatin concentration in muscle by 30 - to 50 -fold, and eliminated all calpain activity that was detectable on zymograms. Muscle fibres in ambulatory, transgenic mice were smaller in diameter, but more numerous, so that muscle mass did not differ between transgenic and non-transgenic mice.

40|$|Microgravity-related {{bone loss}} in astronauts is a {{well-known}} consequence of space travel. These losses {{are a result of}} the catabolic reaction of the skeleton to unloading. Anti-catabolics like bisphosphonates (BPs) have been used to combat bone loss in osteoporosis patients. Their mechanism of action also makes them a possible treatment for preventing the microgravity induced bone loss experienced by astronauts. There are a variety of BPs on the market, and many choices in treatment administration schedule. In this study, the efficacy of pre-treatment with BPs was evaluated by observing changes in bone densitometry measures, geometry, and mechanical properties over different periods. The periods of interest were the hindlimb unloading (HU) period during which microgravity is simulated and the recovery period following HU. Simulating microgravity is achieved by hindlimb unloading adult rats using the model described by Morey-Holton. Six-month old Sprague-Dawley rats were split into four groups which were ambulatory controls (AC), hindlimb unloading controls (HUC), risedronate pre-treatment (RIS), alendronate pre-treatment (ALN). During the 28 day pre-treatment period, the ALN and RIS groups were administered their respective BP pre-treatments. Following that, all groups except the ambulatory controls underwent a 28 day <b>unloading</b> <b>period.</b> Rats were reambulated and recovered for 56 days after the <b>unloading</b> <b>period.</b> Bones were harvested at baseline (day 0), end of pre-treatment (day 28), end of unloading (day 56), end of recovery (day 112) and analyzed. Ex vivo scans of the distal femur metaphysis (DFM) were taken using both peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and micro computed tomography (?CT). Cross-section specimens of the DFM were isolated and compressed between two platens to estimate mechanical properties. The results of scans and tests were analyzed to determine if the pre-treatment approach prevented bone loss during HU and throughout recovery. A BP was considered protective if there were significant differences between the HUC group and AC group, but no difference between the AC group and the respective BP group. The resulting data demonstrated that both pre-treatments prevented (HU) related losses that the HUC group experienced in several densitometric and geometric parameters. HUC did not see statistically significant losses in mechanical properties; however, RIS did enhance them as compared to HUC after HU. The AC group experienced losses in cancellous bone at the end of recovery which were likely attributable to age-related decline. When AC was lowest, either both treatment groups or just RIS were significantly better. Both BP groups had enhanced intrinsic mechanical properties at the end of recovery as compared to AC. It was a reoccurring trend that RIS was significantly better than HUC while ALN would differ from neither HUC nor AC. This was true for all mechanical properties, trabecular number, and trabecular spacing after HU. After recovery, the control group (HUC or AC) with the lowest average value varied so this trend in indirect BP group differences becomes less clear. The RIS group had the lowest average densitometric and geometric results in the cortical region. Risedronate seemed to have the stronger effect on cancellous bone and total bone over the <b>unloading</b> <b>period.</b> However, the RIS group?s protection of the cortical region seemed to dissipate by the end of recovery. ALN was only slightly inferior to RIS and still protected bone during HU. Alendronate?s beneficial effects also seemed to persist better than RIS? effects did through the recovery period in both the cortical and cancellous regions. Risedronate was the more effective BP while it persisted, but this was at the cost of inferior retention in the cortical region during recovery. These results suggest that pre-treatment with either BP would be effective at combatting bone loss due to mechanical unloading. Comparisons with the results of other studies, though limited by differences in design, indicate that a pre-treatment approach is as effective in protecting bone as concurrent treatment. In some cases, it appears that the pre-treatment approach may be more effective. Their enhancement of mechanical performance makes BP pre-treatment a promising course of treatment for astronauts. Practical limitations would likely necessitate this BP pre-treatment approach to be tested in combination with aRED in a human spaceflight study. However, this pretreatment approach could first be assessed with a controlled human bedrest study...|$|E

Methods:Cyclic compressive pressure was introduced using a sinusoidal waveform of 0. 5 Hz-frequency with a peak stress of 0. 1, 0. 5 or 1. 0 MPa for a period of 10 s followed by an <b>unloaded</b> <b>period</b> lasting 10, 100 or 1000 s. Fibronectin and total proteins were radiolabeled with 10 μCi/ml [3 H]-phenylalanine during the final 18 h of the 1, 3 or 6 day experiments. The content of endogenous fibronectin was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), whereas the viability of explants was measured using sections of cartilage explants stained with fluorescein diacetate and propidium iodide. The deformation of loaded explants was determined using a load-displacement transducer system. Results:The mechanical factor time of intermittence significantly altered the synthesis and release of fibronectin by cartilage explants, whereas the tested range of load magnitudes, as well as the duration of loading, seemed to be of subordinate importance. Loading affected the viability of the superficial zone in the cartilage, whereas the chondrocytes of the intermediate and deep zone remained viable. The compression of loaded explants was dependent on the magnitude of stress, as well as on the duration of unloading between each loading cycle. Synthesis of fibronectin, the retention of newly synthesized fibronectin within the extracellular matrix, and the portion of newly synthesized proteins that were fibronectin was significantly increased in cartilage explants which were cyclically compressed with 0. 5 MPa for 10 s followed by a <b>period</b> of <b>unloading</b> lasting 100 s. Conclusions:Previous studies reporting that cartilage explants of human and animal osteoarthritic joints synthesize and retain elevated amounts of fibronectin imply that in our experiments mechanical stimuli can induce a fibronectin metabolism in vitro which mimics some of the osteoarthritic characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{clinical trial}} was to compare peri-implant clinical and radiographic parameters following the placement of nonsubmerged two- and one-stage implants. Materials and Methods: Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} the IMZ group (20 patients receiving two IMZ two-stage implants in a one-stage procedure) or ITI group (20 patients receiving two ITI implants in the conventional one-stage procedure). The healing period was defined as an 18 -week <b>unloaded</b> osseointegration <b>period</b> and a 1 -year functional period during which maturation of bone took place. Twelve weeks after implant placement, fabrication of an overdenture with a bar-clip attachment system was started; it was placed at 18 weeks. Results: None of the implants were lost during the osseointegration period; one IMZ implant was removed during the functional period because of mobility. There {{was no significant difference in}} Gingival Index between the two groups at all evaluation periods. The mean bone loss during the functional period was 0. 6 mm in both groups. A high number of healing abutments loosened in the IMZ group. Conclusion: Clinical and radiographic parameters of two-stage implants placed in a one-stage procedure and one-stage implants are comparable during the healing period. Healing abutments of the IMZ implant system loosen easily...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that rat soleus muscle fiber growth and changes in myosin phenotype during the postnatal, preweaning period would be largely independent of weight bearing. The hindlimbs of one group of pups were unloaded intermittently from postnatal day 4 to day 21 : the pups were isolated from the dam for 5 h during unloading and returned for nursing for 1 h. Control pups were either maintained with the dam as normal or put on an alternating feeding schedule as described above. The enlargement of mass (approximately 3 times), increase in myonuclear number (approximately 1. 6 times) and myonuclear domain (approximately 2. 6 times), and transformation toward a slow fiber phenotype (from 56 to 70 % fibers expressing type I myosin heavy chain) observed in controls were inhibited by hindlimb unloading. These properties were normalized to control levels or higher within 1 mo of reambulation beginning immediately after the <b>unloading</b> <b>period.</b> Therefore, chronic unloading essentially stopped the ontogenetic developmental processes of 1) net increase in DNA available for transcription, 2) increase in amount of cytoplasm sustained by that DNA pool, and 3) normal transition of myosin isoforms that occur in some fibers from birth to weaning. It is concluded that normal ontogenetic development of a postural muscle is highly dependent on the gravitational environment even during the early postnatal period, when full weight-bearing activity is not routine...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the importance of}} daily free activity in the cage and body weight gain during the recovering of bone structural and mechanical properties in growing rats after hindlimb unloading. Eight-week-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control (CG, n= 24) and suspended (SG, n= 24) groups. Animals from SG underwent a four-week hindlimb <b>unloading</b> <b>period</b> by tail-suspension. Animals from CG and those from SG after release were kept in collective cages and sacrificed {{at the age of}} 12, 16 and 20 weeks. Both femurs were removed and its area, bone mineral density (BMD), resistance to failure and stiffness were determined. Four-week hindlimb unloading decreased (p 0. 05) the body weight (CG, 472. 75 +/- 14. 11 vs. SG, 444. 75 +/- 18. 91 g), BMD (CG, 0. 24 +/- 0. 01 vs. SG, 0. 22 +/- 0. 01 g/cm(2)), bone resistance to failure (CG, 195. 73 +/- 10. 06 vs. SG, 178. 45 +/- 8. 48 N) and stiffness (CG, 0. 56 +/- 0. 02 vs. SG, 0. 47 +/- 0. 03 N/m) of SG animals. Body weight correlated strongly with bone structural and mechanical properties (p < 0. 0001). In conclusion, free activity in the cage associated with body weight gain restored bone structural and mechanical properties in growing rats after hindlimb unloading...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Previous {{findings}} have provided {{strong evidence that}} myostatin functions as a negative regulator of muscle mass during development and growth. In the present study, we test the hypothesis that myostatin may serve a similar function in fully differentiated muscle experiencing modified loading. Our findings show that myostatin expression can be modulated in fully differentiated, nonpathological skeletal muscle {{in a manner that}} is inversely related to changes in muscle mass. Atrophy of rat hind limb muscles induced by 10 days of unloading resulted in a 16 % decrease in plantaris mass, a 110 % increase in myostatin mRNA, and a 37 % increase in myostatin protein. Immunohistochemical observations showed a detectable increase in myostatin concentration at myotendinous junctions during muscle unloading. The concentration of myostatin mRNA and protein returned to values not significantly different from ambulatory controls after 4 days of reloading, during which time plantaris mass also returned to control values. However, the results also show that periods of 30 min of daily muscle loading during the <b>unloading</b> <b>period</b> were sufficient to prevent significant losses of muscle mass caused by unloading, although myostatin mRNA still showed a 55 % increase in concentration. Thus, significant increases in myostatin expression are not sufficient for muscle mass loss, although muscle mass loss during unloading is accompanied by increases in myostatin. —Wehling, M., Cai, B., Tidball, J.

40|$|Titanium {{implants}} {{are being}} used increasingly to provide support for prostheses replacing missing teeth in edentulous and partially dentate patients. There is good histological {{evidence to show that}} in satisfactory implants bone forms in intimate contact with the implant surface during the healing process following fixture placement [1]. Currently, fixtures are left <b>unloaded</b> for a <b>period</b> of 3 – 6 months following placement in order to allow this healing process to occur. It would be very valuable to be able to monitor the healing process non-invasively in order to determine more accurately when it is safe to load the implant. Similarly, during service, it would be beneficial to be able to detect the onset of problems such as an increase in the mobility of the implant due to infection, or to a decrease in the height of the bone surrounding the implant...|$|R
40|$|Failure {{of dental}} {{implants}} to achieve osseointegration is often attributed to patient baseline variables, such as smoking. This meta-analysis examines outcomes of clinical studies that monitored {{the performance of}} machined-surfaced and Osseotite, implants; the analysis also isolates the effect of smoking. The implant data for the machined-surfaced implants are derived from three prospective multicenter studies (n = 2, 614) and from six prospective studies (n = 2, 274) for the Osseotite implants. All implant placement surgeries followed a two-stage surgical approach with an <b>unloaded</b> healing <b>period</b> of 4 to 6 months. An evaluation of the data sets (i. e., smokers vs nonsmokers) was first performed to determine the existence of imbalance in baseline variables, including patient demographics, bone quality, location, dimensions, and types of prostheses. Analysis of the distributions of these baseline variables showed similar proportionalities and therefore qualified the data sets for comparison of the cumulative success rates (CSR) of the implants {{on the basis of}} smoking. For the 2, 117 nonsmoking, machined-surfaced implants, the 3 -year CSR is 92. 8 %; for the 492 implants in the smoking group, the CSR is 93. 5 %. The 3 -year CSR for 1, 877 nonsmoking Osseotite implants is 98. 4 %; for the 397 smoking implants it is 98. 7 %. No difference is observed between the smoking groups and the nonsmoking groups in these patient populations. There is, however, a clinically relevant difference observed between the two implant types...|$|R
30|$|The fall of IL- 1 β {{level at}} T 2 was {{observed}} at 3  weeks whereby miniscrew remained <b>unloaded</b> during this <b>period.</b> This decreased level suggests that at 21  days, {{there was no more}} cellular stress in the absence of load. A slight increase in the IL- 1 β level after loading {{can be explained by the}} fact that in orthodontics, mechanical stress appears to evoke biochemical and structural responses in a variety of cells in vivo and in vitro[28]. Alhashimi et al. [29] showed that the application of orthodontic force induces de novo synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β and IL- 6, which support the hypothesis that these proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in bone resorption during the application of orthodontic force. IL- 1 upregulates receptor activator of nuclear factor κ B ligand (RANKL) which leads to bone resorption [30]. Further, according to Kanzaki et al. [31], bone resorption is regulated by cytokines released in response to the orthodontic force.|$|R
