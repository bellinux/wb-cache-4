According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. In 2015, Daft Punk appeared alongside several other musicians to announce their co-ownership of the music service Tidal at its relaunch.|$|E
5|$|The native Britons had {{converted}} to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so {{the church in}} Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew so little about the British church that it was <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> schism in customs. However, Æthelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom Æthelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.|$|E
5|$|Sarah was {{completely}} oblivious to any friendship between Anne and Abigail, {{and was therefore}} surprised when she discovered that Abigail frequently saw the Queen in private. Sarah found out about Abigail's marriage several months after it had occurred, and immediately went to see Anne – {{with the intention of}} informing her of the event. It was at this interview that Anne let slip that she had begged Abigail to tell Sarah of the marriage; Sarah became suspicious about what had really happened. After questioning servants and Royal Household for a week about Abigail's marriage, Sarah discovered that Anne had been present and had given Abigail a dowry of £2000 from the Privy Purse. This proved Anne's duplicity to Sarah: as Keeper of the Privy Purse, Sarah had been <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> such payment.|$|E

5000|$|Today, the Circular Enclosure lies {{near the}} shore of Cowan Lake; the {{underwater}} site of the Cowan Creek Mound is only about 300 ft away, and the enclosure lies {{in the middle of}} a peninsula in the lake. The site is now located within Cowan Lake State Park, slightly less than 1 mi south of the present State Route 730. Officials have sought to allow the site and surrounding lands to return to the condition in which they existed before the region was settled. [...] As a result, the site has never been subjected to intensive professional testing; archaeologists accordingly are <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> whether <b>any</b> additional sites, such as a village location, might be nearby. [...] In 1974, the Cowan Creek Circular Enclosure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its value as an archaeological site. Four other Clinton County archaeological sites are listed on the Register: the Beam Farm Woodland Archaeological District, and the Hillside Haven, Hurley, and Keiter Mounds.|$|R

30|$|Because {{of their}} wide {{direct band gap}} (Eg = 3.37 eV) and large exciton energy (60 meV), zinc oxide (ZnO) {{nanostructures}} have diverse applications in light-emitting diodes[6], solar cells[7], gas sensors[8], photodetectors[9], and nanogenerators[10, 11]. In addition to high-temperature vapor transport growth[12], low-temperature hydrothermal growth is a facile means of growing ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays of high crystal quality; this method is not only feasible for tuning the semiconductor properties by doping during the growth process[13] but also has the flexibility to allow the growth of NWs {{on a variety of}} substances (e.g., polymers[14], cotton fibers[15], paper[1], wood[16]). The growth of uniform NW arrays is relatively difficult to achieve on substrates that have high surface roughness. ZnO nanostructures are among the most promising materials for practical photocatalysts {{that can be used for}} the removal of organic or toxic pollutants[17], sterilization[18], and water splitting[19]. The degradation of dyes is a common means of gauging the efficiency for photocatalysis[20]. We are <b>unaware,</b> however, <b>of</b> <b>any</b> previous reports <b>of</b> the incident angle-dependence of the photodegradation properties of ZnO NW arrays.|$|R
