40|$|Cells {{interact}} with mechanical environments by mechanotransduction, a cellular process that converts mechanical signals into biochemical signals. Umbrella cells respond to mechanical stimuli by increasing exocytosis, endocytosis, and ion transport, but how these processes are coordinated and the mechanotransduction pathways involved {{are not well}} understood. By manipulating different forces and force parameters applied on umbrella cells, the responses of electrophysiological parameters (TEV, TER, and Isc) and apical membrane capacitance (1 µF  1 cm 2 membrane surface area) are monitored through the modified Ussing chamber system. Stretch of the umbrella cells result in an acute change of electrical parameters, but not hydrostatic pressure. Further, the stretched response is sensitive to force direction, indicating that stretch of apical membrane causes <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> TEV hyperpolarization, TER decrease, Isc increase, and apical membrane exocytosis, while stretch of basolateral membrane causes opposite effects, and this observation can be modeled mathematically. Stretch speed, which {{is defined by the}} filling rate, is further defined to play the key role in modulating the degree and time course of stretched <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> responses, suggesting a mechnosensory function of umbrella cells. Use of channel blockers and openers established that the stretch of apical membrane is likely dependent on cation transport pathway, while stretch of basolateral membrane is dependent on K+ transport at the basolateral surface of the cells, indicating distinctive apical and basolateral membrane requirements for <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> mechanotransduction. These results indicate that mechanotransduction in umbrella cells depends on the sequential activity of its distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains, which act in a collaborative manner to regulate apical membrane dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{establish}} the cytological criteria {{to identify the}} urothelial cells in cervical smears {{in order to avoid}} mistakes in the cytological diagnosis. Materials and Methods: Cervical smears from 34 post menopausal women with vesicovaginal fistulas, advanced bladder prolapse and genital erosive lichen planes (vulvar kraurosis) (Group 1) and transitional cell metaplasia of the cervix (TCM, Group 2) were stained with Papanicolaou technique. The cervical samples were taken during the routine annual examination for prevention of the uterine cancer. Results: The smears of cervix from Group 1 showed urothelial cells from the three layers of the transitional epithelium. The <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> are the bigger ones with relatively large nuclei. Frequently, they are multinucleated with single or multiple nucleoli and a typical "frothy" cytoplasm (cytoplasmic vacuoles). The cells of the Group 2 showed nuclei with oval to spindled shapes, some tapered ends, less cytoplasm than squamous metaplastic cells, powdery chromatin, small nucleoli and nuclear grooves. Conclusions: The <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> may be mistaken for dysplastic cells originating in low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions lesions (LSILs) due to their nuclear and cytoplasm sizes. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} the possibility of their appearance in the cervical smears, especially in post menopausal patients in order to avoid a false diagnosis of an intraepithelial lesion. It is unlikely that deeper cells of urothelium would be confused with high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) cells. However, their presence might be a reason of mistake in the diagnosis. TCM is an under-recognized metaplastic phenomenon of the cervix and vagina, which is a mimicker of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion.

40|$|Background: The {{tightness}} {{of various}} membrane barriers to CO 2 is of unknown molecular origin. Results: The bladder tissue lacks carbonic anhydrase.

Significance: Enzymatic regulation of CO 2 abundance rules out that aquaporins significantly contribute to the maintenance of acid base homeostasis.

By using time-lapse fluorescence videomicroscopy to observe infected mouse bladder explants, we discovered that IBCs formed by uropathogenic E. coli progressed through four distinct developmental stages that differed with respect to growth rate, bacterial length, colony organization, motility, and its eventual dispersal. In the first phase, bacteria in the IBC were nonmotile, rod shaped, and grew rapidly in loosely organized colonies free in the cytoplasm of the bladder superficial <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells.</b> In the second phase, the loose collection of bacteria in the IBC matured into a slower growing, highly organized biofilm-like community consisting of coccoid bacteria that ultimately filled most of the cytoplasm. In the third phase, bacteria in the biofilm-like state in the IBC switched to a motile rod-shaped phenotype allowing detachment from the community and eventual fluxing out of the host cell.

40|$|AbstractUrinary bladder {{undergoes}} dramatic volume {{changes during}} filling and voiding cycles. In the bladder the luminal surface of terminally differentiated urothelial <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> is almost completely covered by plaques. These plaques (500 to 1000  nm) {{are made of}} a family of proteins called uroplakins that are known to form a tight barrier to prevent leakage of water and solutes. Electron micrographs from previous studies show these plaques to be interconnected by hinge regions to form structures that appear rigid, but these same structures must accommodate large changes in cell shape during voiding and filling cycles. To resolve this paradox, we measured the stiffness of the intact, living urothelial apical membrane and found it to be highly deformable, even more so than the red blood cell membrane. The intermediate <b>cells</b> underlying the <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> do not have uroplakins but their membranes are an order of magnitude stiffer. Using uroplakin knockout mouse models we show that cell compliance is conferred by uroplakins.

40|$|The uroepithelium {{sits at the}} {{interface}} between the urinary space and underlying tissues, where it forms a high-resistance barrier to ion, solute, and water flux, as well as pathogens.

This review examines our understanding of uroepithelial regeneration and how specializations of the outermost <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> layer, including tight junctions, surface uroplakins, and dynamic apical membrane exocytosis/endocytosis, contribute to barrier function and how they are co-opted by uropathogenic bacteria to infect the uroepithelium. Furthermore, we discuss the presence and possible functions of aquaporins, urea transporters, and multiple ion channels in the uroepithelium. Finally, we describe potential mechanisms by which the uroepithelium can transmit information about the urinary space to the other tissues in the bladder proper...|$|E
40|$|The apical {{surface of}} mouse urothelium {{is covered by}} {{two-dimensional}} crystals (plaques) of uroplakin (UP) particles. To study uroplakin function, we ablated the mouse UPII gene.

Although UPIII knockout yielded small plaques, UPII knockout abolished plaque formation, indicating that both uroplakin heterodimers (UPIa/II and UPIb/III or IIIb) are required for plaque assembly. Both knockouts had elevated UPIb gene expression, suggesting that this is a general response to defective plaque assembly. Both knockouts also had small superficial cells, suggesting that continued fusion of uroplakin-delivering vesicles with the apical surface may contribute to <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> enlargement. Both knockouts experienced vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis, renal dysfunction, and, in the offspring of some breeding pairs, renal failure and neonatal death.

40|$|Adaptive antenna {{technology}} is now {{regarded as one}} of the key system components in future generation cellular networks. This paper considers the performance of a DS-CDMA system which employs adaptive antennas at the base station sites of both microcell and mixed micro/umbrella cell operational environments. A microcellular ray tracing propagation tool has been employed in order to ascertain site specific propagation data. Results for a typical small cell environment highlight both the propagation characteristics and the behaviour of the adaptive antenna, as well as the sensitivity of the system upon parameters such as the mutual coupling effect. This work does not assume idealised propagation conditions or antenna radiation patterns for the small cell analysis. In summary, the results indicate that microcellular base stations employing adaptive antenna signal processing can offer a significant capacity enhancement and improved channel characteristics when compared with their omnidirectional counterparts. In addition, it is shown that umbrella cells overlaying microcells within the same RF bandwidth allocation, do not impact upon system capacity providing that adaptive antenna {{technology is}} employed at the <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> site...|$|E
40|$|The bladder is {{a complex}} organ that is highly {{adaptive}} to its mechanical environment. The <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> in the bladder uroepithelium are of particular interest: these cells actively change their surface area through exo- and endocytosis of cytoplasmic vesicles, and likely form a critical component in the mechanosensing process that communicates the sense of 'fullness' to the nervous system. In this paper we develop a first mechanical model for vesicle trafficking in <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> in response to membrane tension during bladder filling. Recent experiments conducted on a disc of uroepithelial tissue motivate our model development. These experiments subject bladder tissue to fixed pressure differences and exhibit counterintuitive area changes. Through analysis of the mathematical model and comparison with experimental data in this setup, we gain an intuitive understanding of the biophysical processes involved and calibrate the vesicle trafficking rate parameters in our model.

40|$|The uroepithelium {{lines the}} urinary bladder, urethra {{and the lower}} renal pelvis. It {{provides}} a tight blood-urine barrier that prevents the unregulated movement of solutes, ions and metabolites present in the urine. Apart from forming a robust barrier, {{a growing body of}} evidence supports the role of the uroepithelium as a sensory transducer that is sensitive to extracellular biochemical and mechanical stimuli. One of the mediators that is released from the uroepithelium and impacts bladder activity is adenosine. Adenosine is a well-known stress relieving hormone in other organ systems and the bladder lumen is a region of constant stress due to cyclical filling and voiding of urine, therefore I hypothesized that adenosine has an impact on urinary bladder function under stress. First I assessed the mechanism of adenosine turnover and how luminal adenosine affects bladder function. I report that adenosine is released from the mucosal and serosal surfaces of the uroepithelium when the tissue is maximally stretched. The released adenosine it actively turned over by distinct pathways at either surfaces of the uroepithelium. Further, enriching the luminal adenosine concentration by blocking its routes of turnover or by specific activation of apically localized A 1 AR by using CCPA, bladder function was modulated by decreasing the threshold pressure of bladder voiding. In the second study, I looked at the impact of adenosine on exocytosis and membrane trafficking in <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells.</b> I report that activation of A 1 AR at the apical surface of <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> increased apical exocytosis in <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells.</b> The apical exocytosis was similar to late phase stress-mediated exocytosis and required transactivation of EGFR. The pathway involved Gi-Gβγ-PLC-PKC and ADAM 17 which in-turn cleaved and released HB-EGF leading to EGFR transactivation and downstream ERK 1 / 2 MAPK. Further, Ser 811 in the cytoplasmic tail of ADAM 17 was important for A 1 AR-mediated activation of the protein. Finally, ADAM 17 was also involved in late-phase stretch-mediated apical exocytosis in rats but not in rabbits. In conclusion, my studies show that adenosine plays a protective role in the bladder both at the organ and cellular level. At the organ level, adenosine alleviates luminal stress by reducing the threshold pressure for voiding and at the cellular level, it triggers apical exocytosis and increase in membrane surface area of <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> thus mitigating the stress induced by mechanical stretching associated with bladder filling...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{the lower}} urinary tract, {{including}} the bladder, is lined by a stratified urothelium forming a highly differentiated, superficial <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> layer. The apical plasma membrane as well as abundant cytoplasmic fusiform vesicles of the umbrella cells is covered by two-dimensional crystals that are formed by four membrane proteins named uroplakins (UPs) Ia, Ib, II, and III. UPs are synthesized on membrane-bound polysomes, and after several co- and posttranslational modifications they assemble into planar crystals in a post-Golgi vesicular compartment. Distension of the bladder may cause fusiform vesicles to fuse with the apical plasma membrane. We have investigated {{the early stages of}} uroplakin assembly by expressing the four uroplakins in 293 T cells. Transfection experiments showed that, when expressed individually, only UPIb can exit from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and move to the plasma membrane, whereas UPII and UPIII reach the plasma membrane only when they form heterodimeric complexes with UPIa and UPIb, respectively.

40|$|An important, but {{not well}} understood, {{function}} of epithelial cells is {{their ability to}} sense changes in their extracellular environment and then communicate these changes to the underlying nervous, connective, and muscular tissues. This communication {{is likely to be}} important for tube- and sac-shaped organs such as blood vessels, the lungs, the gut, and the bladder, whose normal function can be modulated by stimuli initiated within the epithelium. We propose that the uroepithelium, which lines the renal pelvis, ureters, and inner surface of the bladder, functions {{as an integral part of}} a ‘sensory web. ’ Through uroepithelial-associated channels and receptors, the uroepithelium receives sensory ‘inputs’ such as changes in hydrostatic pressure and binding of mediators including adenosine triphosphate (ATP). These input signals stimulate membrane turnover in the outermost <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> layer and release of sensory ‘outputs’ from the uroepithelium in the form of neurotransmitters and other mediators that communicate changes in the uroepithelial milieu to the underlying tissues, altering their function.

We investigated membrane compartments {{involved in the}} formation of urothelial plaques in mouse umbrella cells. The Golgi apparatus did not contain uroplakins organized into plaques. In the post-Golgi region, three distinct membrane compartments containing uroplakins were characterized: i) Small rounded vesicles, located close to the Golgi apparatus, were labelled weakly with anti-uroplakin antibodies and they possessed no plaques; we termed them "uroplakin-positive transporting vesicles" (UPTVs). ii) Spherical-to-flattened vesicles, termed "immature fusiform vesicles" (iFVs), were uroplakin-positive in their central regions and contained small urothelial plaques. iii) Flattened "mature fusiform vesicles" (mFVs) contained large plaques, which were densely labelled with anti-uroplakin antibodies. Endoytotic marker horseradish peroxidase was not found in these post-Golgi compartments. We propose a detailed model of de novo urothelial plaque formation in post-Golgi compartments: UPTVs carrying individual 16 -nm particles detach from the Golgi apparatus and subsequently fuse into iFV. Concentration of 16 -nm particles into plaques and removal of uroplakin-negative membranes takes place in iFVs.

40|$|There are two morphologically {{distinct}} cell {{types in}} the normal urothelium: <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> and basal/intermediate cells. Immunohistochemical studies from our group suggest {{that there may be}} more than one urothelial progenitor. Bladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States and the second most prevalent genitourinary malignancy. Urothelial carcinoma accounts for 90 % of bladder cancers. Based on clinical and histological studies, urothelial carcinomas are thought to develop through two independent pathways and are classified into two main phenotypic variants: low-grade tumors (usually papillary and "superficial" with high recurrence), and high-grade tumors (usually flat carcinoma in situ lesions that are often associated with and progress to muscle invasion). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded non-coding RNA molecules, approximately 21 - 23 nucleotides in length, that regulate gene expression. Since their discovery in 1993, they have emerged as major mediators of cellular functions and tissue homeostasis. Importantly, distortion of their normal function is commonly observed in human malignancies, suggesting that they act as a new class of tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Despite the strong links reported between miRNAs and the pathogenesis of numerous human cancers, there are few studies centering on their characterization in normal urothelium and there is little consensus on which miRNAs contribute to urothelial tumor initiation and progression. Through a series of studies, we profiled the expression of miRNAs in distinct compartments of the normal bladder, including umbrella and basal-intermediate urothelial cells, as well as the muscularis propria; and bladder carcinoma in situ (CIS) lesions. We discovered and validated the expression of miR- 133 a and miR- 139 - 3 p in <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells,</b> and miR- 142 - 3 p in basal-intermediate cells. This study represents the first molecular characterization of miRNA expression in the normal urothelium. Strikingly, we found that miRNA expression levels of CIS most closely resembled the miRNA profile of <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells.</b> Finally, we examined well-established <b>umbrella</b> and basal-intermediate <b>cell</b> immunohistochemical biomarkers in an independent series of CIS samples. Once more, this analysis revealed that CIS lesions shared a common phenotype with <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> through the expression of umbrella-specific markers. Mechanistic studies were performed in parallel to further delineate the potential role of two critical miRNAs involved in cell invasion that were previously unassociated with urothelial carcinomas: miR- 198 and miR- 126. Overexpression of miR- 198 increased cell invasion in non-invasive bladder cancer cells, an effect that was magnified with concurrent down-regulation of the miR- 200 family. In contrast, elevated levels of miR- 126 suppressed cell invasion in invasive bladder cancer cells, possibly through regulation of gene expression of the matrix metalloproteinase ADAM 9. Correspondingly, knock-down studies of ADAM 9 in invasive bladder cancer cells also inhibited cell invasion. We further demonstrated preferential expression of ADAM 9 in muscle-invasive bladder tumors compared to non-muscle invasive tumors, and that ADAM 9 expression significantly correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with urothelial carcinoma. Our studies represent a comprehensive and accurate description of the different miRNAs expressed in distinct urothelial cellular compartments and CIS tumors. This study is also the first to provide evidence of the possible origin of CIS lesions from <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells.</b> Additionally, important translational results of our studies support the use of miR- 198, miR- 126, and ADAM 9 as clinical biomarkers of disease progression, and provide a rationale for the therapeutic inhibition of ADAM 9 in aggressive urothelial carcinomas. Overall, the findings reported here indicate that several miRNAs are differentially regulated in urothelium development and tumorigenesis, and may form a basis for clinical development of new biomarkers for urothelial carcinoma...|$|R

To study how the epithelium accommodates these volume changes, we mounted bladder tissue in modified Ussing chambers and subjected the tissue to mechanical stretch. Stretching the tissue for 5 h {{resulted in a}} 50 % increase in lumenal surface area (from ∼ 2900 to 4300 μm 2), exocytosis of a population of discoidal vesicles located in the apical cytoplasm of the superficial <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells,</b> and release of secretory proteins. Surprisingly, stretch also induced endocytosis of apical membrane and 100 % of biotin-labeled membrane was internalized within 5 min after stretch. The endocytosed membrane was delivered to lysosomes and degraded by a leupeptin-sensitive pathway. Last, we show that the exocytic events were mediated, in part, by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate, protein kinase A-dependent process. Our results indicate that stretch modulates mucosal surface area by coordinating both exocytosis and endocytosis at the apical membrane of <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> and {{provide insight into the}} mechanism of how mechanical forces regulate membrane traffic in nonexcitable cells...|$|R
40|$|Uroplakins (UPs) Ia, Ib, II, and III, transmembrane {{proteins}} constituting the asymmetrical unit membrane of urothelial <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells,</b> are {{the first}} specific urothelial differentiation markers described. We investigated the presence and localization patterns of UPs in various human carcinomas by applying immunohistochemistry (avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method), using rabbit antibodies against UPs II and III, to paraffin sections. Positive reactions for UP III (sometimes very focal) were noted in 14 of the 16 papillary noninvasive transitional cell carcinomas (TCCs) (88 %), 29 of the 55 invasive TCCs (53 %), and 23 of the 35 TCC metastases (66 %). Different localization patterns of UPs could be distinguished, including superficial membrane staining like that found in normal <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> (in papillary carcinoma), luminal (microluminal) membrane staining (in papillary and invasive carcinoma), and, against expectations, peripheral membrane staining (in invasive carcinoma). Non-TCC carcinomas of various origins (n = 177) were consistently negative for UPs. The presence of UPs in metastatic TCCs represents {{a prime example of}} even advanced tumor progression being compatible with the (focal) expression of highly specialized differentiation repertoires. Although of only medium-grade sensitivity, UPs do seem to be highly specific urothelial lineage markers, thus operating up interesting histodiagnostic possibilities in cases of carcinoma metastases of uncertain origin...|$|R
40|$|The {{umbrella}} {{cells that}} line the bladder are mechanosensitive, and bladder filling increases the apical surface area of these cells; however, the upstream signals that regulate this process are unknown. Increased pressure stimulated ATP release from the isolated uroepithelium of rabbit bladders, which was blocked by inhibitors of vesicular transport, connexin hemichannels, ABC protein family members, and nucleoside transporters. Pressure-induced increases in membrane capacitance (a measure of apical plasma membrane surface area where 1 μF ≈ 1 cm 2) were inhibited by the serosal, but not mucosal, addition of apyrase or the purinergic receptor antagonist PPADS. Upon addition of purinergic receptor agonists, increased capacitance was observed {{even in the absence}} of pressure. Moreover, knockout mice lacking expression of P 2 X 2 and/or P 2 X 3 receptors failed to show increases in apical surface area when exposed to hydrostatic pressure. Treatments that prevented release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores or activation of PKA blocked ATPγS-stimulated changes in capacitance. These results indicate that increased hydrostatic pressure stimulates release of ATP from the uroepithelium and that upon binding to P 2 X and possibly P 2 Y receptors on the <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell,</b> downstream Ca 2 + and PKA second messenger cascades may act to stimulate membrane insertion at the apical pole of these cells...|$|E
40|$|In the murine {{model of}} urinary tract infections (UTI), {{cystitis}} by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) occurs through {{an intimate relationship}} with the bladder superficial <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> entailing cycles of adherence, invasion, intracellular bacterial community (IBC) formation, and dispersal (fluxing) from the intracellular environment. IBC dispersal is a key step that results in the spread of bacteria over the epithelial surface to initiate additional rounds of IBC formation. We investigated the role of flagella in mediating adherence and motility during UTI, hypothesizing that the dispersion of the IBC would be incomplete {{in the absence of}} motility, thus interrupting the IBC pathway and attenuating the infection. Using gfp reporter fusions, the expression of the flagellar class I flhDC and class III fliC genes was monitored to track key points of regulation throughout the pathogenic cascade. In vitro, growth under conditions promoting motility resulted in the robust expression of both fusions. In contrast, only the class I fusion produced significant expression throughout early stages of IBC development including the dispersion stage. Thus, unlike in vitro modeling of motility, the regulatory cascade appeared incomplete in vivo. Throughout IBC formation, nonmotile �fliC mutants achieved the same number of IBCs as the wild-type (wt) strain, demonstrating that flagella are neither essential nor required for first- or second-generation IBC formation. However, in competition experiments between wt and �fliC strains, the wt was shown to have a fitness advantage in persisting throughout the urinary tract fo...|$|E
40|$|The TP 63 gene, {{a member}} of the TP 53 tumor {{suppressor}} gene family, can be expressed as at least six isoforms due to alternative promoter use and alternative splicing. The lack of p 63 isoform-specific antibodies has limited the analysis of the biological significance of p 63. We report a novel set of well-defined antibodies to examine p 63 isoforms in mouse and human urothelium during embryogenesis and tumor progression, respectively. We provide evidence that basal and intermediate urothelial cells express p 63 isoforms, with the TAp 63 variant the first to be detected during development, whereas umbrella cells are characterized by a p 63 -negative phenotype. Notably, we report that p 63 -null mice develop a bladder with an abnormal urothelium, constituted by a single layer of cells that express uroplakin II and low molecular weight cytokeratins, consistent with an <b>umbrella</b> <b>cell</b> phenotype. Finally, analysis of 202 human bladder carcinomas revealed a new categorization of invasive tumors into basal-like (positive for [Delta]Np 63 and high molecular weight cytokeratins and negative for low molecular weight cytokeratins) versus luminal-like (negative for [Delta]Np 63 and high molecular weight cytokeratins and positive for low molecular weight cytokeratins) phenotypes, with [Delta]Np 63 expression associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor prognosis. This study highlights the relevance of p 63 isoforms in both urothelial development and bladder carcinoma progression, with [Delta]Np 63 acting as an oncogene in certain invasive bladder tumors...|$|E
40|$|Annexin A 4 (Anx 4) is {{a member}} of the Ca 2 +-dependent membrane-binding family of {{proteins}} implicated in the regulation of ion conductances, Ca 2 + homeostasis and membrane trafficking. We demonstrate, in mice, that annexins 1 - 6 are present in whole bladder and exhibit differential expression in the urothelium. A knockout (KO, anxA 4 a-/-) mouse model deficient in Anx 4 a shows no protein in the urothelium by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. In wild type bladders, Anx 4 a in <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> showed uniform cytoplasmic staining and some association with the nuclear membrane. Application of a hydrostatic pressure to bladders mounted in Ussing chambers resulted in a redistribution of Anx 4 a from cytoplasm to cellular boundaries in the basal and intermediate cells but not in superficial <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells.</b> We hypothesized that Anx 4 a might be important for barrier function or for stretch-activated membrane trafficking. To test these hypotheses we conducted a series of functional and morphological analyses on bladders from control and anxA 4 a-/- animals. The transepithelial resistances, water permeabilities and urea permeabilities of anxA 4 a-/- bladders were not different from controls, indicating that barrier function was intact. Membrane trafficking in response to hydrostatic pressure as measured by capacitance increases was also normal for anxA 4 a-/- bladders. Cystometrograms performed o...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Urothelial bladder {{carcinoma}} (UBC) is heteroge-neous in its pathology {{and clinical}} behaviour. Evaluation of prognostic and predictive biomarkers is necessary, {{in order to}} produce personalised treatment options. The present study used immunohistochemistry to evaluate UBC sections containing tumour and non-tumour areas from 76 patients, for the detec-tion of p-mTOR, CD 31 and D 2 - 40 (blood and lymphatic vessels identification, respectively). Of the non-tumour and tumour sections, 36 and 20 % were scored positive for p-mTOR expression, respectively. Immunoexpression was observed in <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> from non-tumour urothelium, in all cell layers from non-muscle-invasive (NMI) tumours (including expression in superficial cells), and in spots of cells from muscle-invasive (MI) tumours. Positive expression decreased from non-tumour to tumour urothelium, and from pT 1 /pTis to pT 3 /pT 4 tumours; however, the few pT 3 /pT 4 positive cases had worse survival rates, with 5 -year disease-free survival being significantly lower. Angiogenesis occurrence was impaired in pT 3 /pT 4 tumours that did not express p-mTOR. In conclusion, p-mTOR expression in non-tumour <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells</b> is likely a reflection of their metabolic plasticity, and extension to the inner layers of the urothelium in NMI tumours is consistent with an enhanced malignant potential. The expression in cell spots in a few MI tumours and absence of expression in the remaining tumours is intriguing and requires further research. Additional studies regarding the up- and downstream effectors of the mTOR pathway should be conducted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The luminal {{surface of}} {{mammalian}} urothelium {{is covered with}} numerous plaques (also known as the asymmetric unit membrane or AUM) composed of semi-crystalline, hexagonal arrays of 12 -nm protein particles. Despite the presumed importance of these plaques in stabilizing the urothelial surface during bladder distention, relatively {{little is known about}} their protein composition. Using a mouse mAb, AE 31, we have identified a 27 -kD protein that is urotheliumspecific and is differentially expressed in superficial <b>umbrella</b> <b>cells.</b> This protein (pI ~ 5. 8) partitions into the detergent phase during Triton X- 114 phase separation. Pulse-chase experiments using cultured bovine urothelial cells showed that this protein is synthesized as a 32 -kD precursor that is processed through a 30 k...|$|R
