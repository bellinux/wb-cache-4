50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of Plant 9, the Special Products Plant was to process {{slightly}} enriched uranium and to cast larger ingots than those produced in Plant 5. The plant contains facilities for producing derbies, ingots, slugs, and washers of various enrichments. Construction of the plant as a thorium metal production process was completed in 1954 and the thorium process was begun in October 1954. Plant 9 was originally designed and constructed as a thorium metal production plant, yet had {{to be regarded as}} a semi-development works {{because of a lack of}} process information. The two basic processes, hydrofluoric acid precipitation of thorium fluoride and induction de-zincing and melting, which were used to start the plant, were not able to produce a pure metal. However, improvement in production techniques permitted the eventual development of an oxalate precipitation process capable of producing pure thorium metal.

5000|$|The Ames {{process was}} used on August 3, 1942 {{by a group}} of chemists led by Frank Spedding and Harley Wilhelm at the Ames Laboratory as part of the Manhattan Project. It is a type of thermite-based purification, which was {{patented}} in 1895 by German chemist Hans Goldschmidt. Development of the Ames process came at a time of increased research into mass uranium-metal production. The desire for increased production was motivated by a fear of Nazi Germany developing nuclear weapons before the Allies. The process originally involved mixing powdered uranium tetrafluoride and powdered magnesium together. This mixture was placed inside an iron pipe that was welded shut on one side and capped shut on another side. This container, called a [...] "bomb" [...] by Spedding, was placed into a furnace. When heated to a temperature of 1500 C, the contents of the container reacted violently, leaving a 35-gram <b>ingot</b> of pure <b>uranium</b> metal. The process was quickly scaled up; by October 1942 the [...] "Ames Project" [...] was producing metal at a rate of 100 lb per week. The uranium tetrafluoride and magnesium were sealed in a refractory-lined reactor vessel, still referred to as a [...] "bomb". The thermite reaction was initiated by furnace heating the assembly to 600 C; the large difference in density between slag and metal allowed complete separation in the liquid state, yielding slag-free metal. By July 1943, the production rate exceeded 130000 lb of uranium metal per month. Approximately 1000 tons of <b>uranium</b> <b>ingots</b> were produced at Ames before the process was transferred to industry.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} operational and criticality safety experience {{associated with}} the Idaho National Laboratory Fuel Conditioning Facility which uses a pyrometallurgical process to treat spent fast reactor metallic fuel. The process is conducted in an inert atmosphere hot cell. The process starts with chopping metallic fuel elements into a basket. The basket is lowered into molten salt (LiCl-KCl) along with a steel mandrel. Active metal fission products, transuranic metals and sodium metal in the spent fuel undergo chemical oxidation and form chlorides. Voltage is applied between the basket, {{which serves as a}}n anode, and the mandrel, which serves as a cathode, causing metallic uranium in the spent fuel to undergo electro-chemical oxidation thereby forming uranium chloride. Simultaneously at the cathode, uranium chloride undergoes electro-chemical reduction and deposits uranium metal onto the mandrel. The uranium metal and accompanying entrained salt are placed in a distillation furnace where the uranium melts forming an ingot and the entrained salt boils and subsequently condenses in a separate crucible. The <b>uranium</b> <b>ingots</b> are placed in long term storage. During the ten year operating history, over one hundred criticality safety evaluations were prepared. All criticality safety related limits and controls for the entire process are contained in a single document which required over thirty revisions to accommodate the process changes. Operational implementation of the limits and controls includes use of a near real-time computerized tracking system. The tracking system uses an Oracle database coupled with numerous software applications. The computerized tracking system includes direct fuel handler interaction with every movement of material. Improvements to this system during the ten year history include introduction of web based operator interaction, tracking of moderator materials {{and the development of a}} plethora database queries to assist in day to day operations as well as obtaining historical information. Over 12, 000 driver fuel elements have been processed resulting in the production of 2500 kg of 20 % enriched uranium. Also, over one thousand blanket fuel elements have been processed resulting in the production of 2400 kg of depleted uranium. These operations required over 35, 000 fissile material transfers between zones and over 6000 transfers between containers. Throughout all of these movements, no mass limit violations occurred. Numerous lessons were learned over the ten year operating history. From a criticality safety perspective, the most important lesson learned was the involvement of a criticality safety practitioner in daily operations. A criticality safety engineer was assigned directly to facility operations, and was responsible for implementation of limits and controls including upkeep of the associated computerized tracking files. The criticality safety engineer was also responsible for conducting fuel handler training activities including serving on fuel handler qualification oral boards, and continually assessing operations from a criticality control perspective. The criticality safety engineer also attended bimonthly project planning meetings to identify upcoming process changes that would require criticality safety evaluation. Finally, the excellent criticality safety record was due in no small part to the continual support, involvement, trust, and confidence of project and operations man...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} safeguarding nuclear facilities, {{nuclear material accountancy}} (NMA), faces many challenges when applied to pyroprocessing facilities. To aid in the safeguarding of these facilities, process monitoring (PM) is being investigated as a complementary method to NMA. PM takes general process data, such as density, current etc., and applies it to safeguards {{through the use of}} a statistical framework. Signature Based Safeguards (SBS), a proposed statistical framework for the application of PM techniques, identifies anomalous scenarios and subsequently identifies and detects their respective PM signatures from a system of sensors. This work focuses both on assisting SBS through identifying anomalous scenarios, and on the computer modeling of these failure modes and the PM signatures for them. The anomalous scenarios investigated were mechanical failure modes with potential safeguards-significance as they could lead to the deposition of plutonium and other actinides in the final <b>uranium</b> product <b>ingot.</b> The signatures of these anomalous scenarios were primarily radiation signatures from a coincidence counter that is used to analyze the final ingots. Several different failure modes were identified for both the electrorefiner and the cathode processor. The signatures for these failure modes were then determined by coupling two separate computer models. The first model is a FORTRAN-based electrorefiner code named ERAD capable of modeling the mass transport of metals within an electrorefiner. The second model was an MCNP-based simulation of the Canberra JCC- 31 High Level Neutron Coincidence Counter. First, the identified failure modes were simulated by changing ERAD inputs. ERAD calculated an elemental mass composition at the cathode which was then used as the final ingot composition. The final ingot composition was analyzed for single and double neutron coincidence count rates using the MCNP model. The results demonstrate significant radiation signatures for the presence of plutonium as a result of the electrorefiner failure modes. Signatures from cathode processor failure modes were weak and thus warrant future investigation of better detectors for integration into a SBS framework.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of two thin-walled outer tubes showed that more extensive alpha working of the billet core stock results in more uniform cladding on the extruded tube. In {{an effort to}} eliminate breakthrough and to reduce eccentricity, shift, and bending of the mandrel, two experimental coppernickel billets with Zircaloy sleeves were extruded to check a modified billet design. lt was observed that the final grain size of the unalloyed uranium core of a thin- walled outer tube is insensitive to small variations in the cooling rate from the beta-treatment temperature. An axia' load of 3000 pounds applied to a thin- walled outer tube during autoclaving was ineffective in preventing bowing of the tube. Shipping experiments demonstrated that current packaging methods of thin- walled inner tubes do not prevent bowing during transit. The fabrication of specimens for the capsule irradiation program was concluded with the shipment of sixteen specimens and excess extruded tube stock to Savannah River Laboratory. The following core compositions were represented: U- 1 wt. % Si, unalloyed dingot uranium, U- 0. 3 wt. % Al- 0. 5 wt. % Si, and U- 0. 3 wt. % Cr- 0. 3 wt. % Mo. All irradiation specimens were supplied in the beta-treated condition. The mechanical behavior of Zircaloy- 4 -clad dingot uranium tube sections was evaluated {{as a function of}} the cooling rate from the beta treatment temperature. The results indicate that the mechanical behavior is approximately independent of the cooling rate and that, in testing to failure, fracture initiates within the core. Also, in a eimilar test of a transient-melted <b>ingot</b> <b>uranium</b> tube, the uranium core appeared to be the most brittle component. Five tubular stainless steel- Zircaloy joints were extruded for use in an experiment to determine if such joints can withstand 30 and 40 % cold reductions. (auth...|$|R
