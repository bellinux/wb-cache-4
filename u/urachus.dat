He placed first in both the short program and free skating with a total score of 286.86 points, earning him his third {{consecutive}} Japan National Championships title and the first spot for Japan at the 2015 World Championships. He withdrew from the gala following the competition due to abdominal pain. Hanyu {{was diagnosed with a}} bladder problem related to the <b>urachus</b> and had surgery. He was hospitalized for two weeks, and was expected to resume training a month afterwards. But in the middle of February, he sprained his right ankle and once again, suspended on-ice training for two weeks. In March, his training restarted in Japan without his coach, Brian Orser.|$|E

5000|$|The human allantois is an endodermal evagination of the {{developing}} hindgut which becomes surrounded by the mesodermal connecting stalk. The connecting stalk forms the umbilical vasculature. The allantois becomes the <b>urachus</b> which connects the fetal bladder to the yolk sac. The <b>urachus</b> removes nitrogenous waste from the fetal bladder. The allantois is vestigial and may regress, yet the homologous blood vessels persist as the umbilical arteries and veins connecting the embryo with the placenta.|$|E
50|$|Other {{affected}} sites, confirmed on histology to be {{manifestations of}} IgG4-RD, include:heart; hard palate, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, rectum, adrenal gland, ovary, uterus, ureter, bladder, <b>urachus,</b> and synovium.|$|E

50|$|The <b>urachus</b> is a fibrous {{remnant of}} the allantois, a canal that drains the urinary bladder of the fetus that joins and runs within the {{umbilical}} cord. The fibrous remnant lies {{in the space of}} Retzius, between the transverse fascia anteriorly and the peritoneum posteriorly.|$|E
50|$|During {{the third}} week of development, the allantois {{protrudes}} into the area of the urogenital sinus. Between the 5th and 7th week of development, the allantois will become the <b>urachus,</b> a duct between the bladder and the yolk sac. A patent allantois can result in urachal cyst.|$|E
50|$|The {{remainder}} {{of this part of}} the urogenital sinus forms the body of the bladder and part of the prostatic urethra. The apex of the bladder stretches and is connected to the umbilicus as a narrow canal. This canal is initially open, but later closes as the <b>urachus</b> goes on to definitively form the median umbilical ligament.|$|E
50|$|Transitional cell {{carcinoma}} (TCC) also urothelial carcinoma (UCC), {{is a type}} of cancer that typically occurs in the urinary system. It is {{the most common type of}} bladder cancer and cancer of the ureter, urethra, and <b>urachus.</b> It is the second most common type of kidney cancer, but accounts for only five to 10 percent of all primary renal malignant tumors.|$|E
50|$|The medial {{umbilical}} ligament (or cord of umbilical artery) is a paired structure {{found in}} human anatomy. It {{is on the}} deep surface of the anterior abdominal wall, and is covered by the medial umbilical folds (plicae umbilicales mediales). It {{should not be confused}} with the median umbilical ligament, a different structure that represents the remnant of the embryonic <b>urachus.</b>|$|E
50|$|A urachal cyst is a sinus {{remaining}} {{from the}} allantois during embryogenesis. It is a cyst which {{occurs in the}} remnants between the umbilicus and bladder. This {{is a type of}} cyst occurring in a persistent portion of the <b>urachus,</b> presenting as an extraperitoneal mass in the umbilical region. It is characterized by abdominal pain, and fever if infected. It may rupture, leading to peritonitis, or it may drain through the umbilicus. Urachal cysts are usually silent clinically until infection, calculi or adenocarcinoma develop.|$|E

50|$|The {{umbilical}} artery regresses after birth. A portion obliterates {{to become}} the medial umbilical ligament (be careful not to confuse this with the median umbilical ligament, a different structure that represents the remnant of the embryonic <b>urachus).</b> A portion remains open as {{a branch of the}} anterior division of the internal iliac artery. The umbilical artery is found in the pelvis, and gives rise to the superior vesical arteries. In males, it may also give rise to the artery to the ductus deferens which can be supplied by the inferior vesical artery in some individuals.|$|E

50|$|Carcinoma {{is a type}} {{of cancer}} that occurs in {{epithelial}} cells. Transitional cell carcinoma {{is the leading cause of}} bladder cancer, occurring in 9 out of 10 cases. It is also the leading cause of cancer of the ureter, urethra, and <b>urachus,</b> and the second leading cause of cancer of the kidney. Transitional cell carcinoma can develop in two different ways. Should the transitional cell carcinoma grow toward the inner surface of the bladder via finger-like projections, it is known as papillary carcinoma. Otherwise, it is known as flat carcinoma. Either form can transition from non-invasive to invasive by spreading into the muscle layers of the bladder. Transitional cell carcinoma is commonly multifocal, more than one tumor occurring at the time of diagnosis.|$|E

A 25 -year-old man presented a fluid secretion from the umbilicus that bled once and had three previous episodes of abdominal pain.

40|$|Background: Urachal {{disease is}} uncommon. The {{surgical}} treatment {{consists of the}} resection of the <b>urachus</b> throughout its entire length. Our objective is to demonstrate the use of minimally invasive surgery to treat this disease. Methods: Six patients were studied and diagnosed. The technique used three 10 -mm ports on the right hemi abdomen, through which the dissection of the <b>urachus</b> was performed from the umbilical extreme to the bladder. We evaluated the perioperative records to assess morbidity and outcome. Results: Most patients suffered from episodes of umbilical discharge. The diagnosis was made mainly through clinical history and confirmed during the laparoscopic procedure. The <b>urachus</b> was resected throughout its entire length, {{and we did not}} perform a segmentary bladder resection in any patient. The average operative time was 66 minutes (range, 42 to 123), and no operative complications were associated with the technique. Discussion: Minimally invasive surgery is a safe and effective procedure that allows the dissection of the <b>urachus</b> through its entire length, providing optimal postoperative results.

30|$|The <b>urachus</b> is a vestigial {{structure}} {{arising from}} the anterior bladder wall and extending cranially to the umbilicus within the extraperitoneal fat between the peritoneum and transversalis fascia [1]. The <b>urachus</b> consists of a three-layered structure of transitional cell epithelium, connective tissue, and an outer smooth muscle layer. Derived from involution of the allantois, which begins at 4 - 5 months of gestation, it becomes a fibrous cord, called the median umbilical ligament, by birth. The umbilicovesical fascia surrounds the <b>urachus</b> and extends laterally to envelop the two obliterated umbilical arteries, called medial umbilical ligaments [1].|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Neoplasms {{originating}} from the <b>urachus</b> are rare.

A 44 -year-old woman presented with 6 months of pelvic pain {{associated with a}} sensation of progressive mass growth.

40|$|Urachal {{abnormalities}} {{are very}} rarely encountered in adults. Though the <b>urachus</b> is normally obliterated in early infancy, it may cause a lower midline lesion in adults.
