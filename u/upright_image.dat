25|$|Mirrors with curved {{surfaces}} can be modelled by {{ray tracing}} {{and using the}} law of reflection at each point on the surface. For mirrors with parabolic surfaces, parallel rays incident on the mirror produce reflected rays that converge at a common focus. Other curved surfaces may also focus light, but with aberrations due to the diverging shape causing the focus to be smeared out in space. In particular, spherical mirrors exhibit spherical aberration. Curved mirrors can form images with magnification greater than or less than one, and the magnification can be negative, indicating that the image is inverted. An <b>upright</b> <b>image</b> formed by reflection in a mirror is always virtual, while an inverted image is real and can be projected onto a screen.|$|E

Further imaging depends on local protocols which is dependent on the hospital protocols, the availability of other imaging modalities and the preference of the image interpreter. In the UK, the standard chest radiography protocol is to take an erect posteroanterior view only, and a lateral one only on request by a radiologist [...] In the US, chest radiography includes a PA and Lateral with the patient standing or sitting up. Special projections include an AP in cases where the image needs to be obtained stat and with a portable device, particularly when a patient cannot be safely positioned upright. Lateral decubitus may be used for visualization of air-fluid levels if an <b>upright</b> <b>image</b> cannot be obtained.

40|$|Generation of ground-truths is {{of great}} {{importance}} for unbiased performance evaluation of document layout analysis methods. This is especially necessary because many methods are claimed to be skew-tolerant. However, experimental evaluation of this fact is often based only on human subjective judgement and restricted to a few experiments. The main obstacle for obtaining human-independent and more automated performance evaluation is that usually there are only ground-truths for <b>upright</b> <b>images,</b> i. e., images with no skew of text lines, because currently available ground-truthing techniques are too time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a new methodology of automatic generation of ground-truths for skewed images by using the ground-truths available for <b>upright</b> <b>images.</b> This methodology is simple and quite fast because processing is done {{at the level of}} small square blocks, but not at pixel level. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{link between}} arousal and pupil {{dilation}} is well studied, {{but it is}} less known that other cognitive processes can trigger pupil responses. Here we present evidence that pupil responses can be induced by high-level scene processing, independent of changes in low-level features or arousal. In Experiment 1, we recorded changes in pupil diameter of observers while they viewed a variety of natural scenes {{with or without a}} sun that were presented either <b>upright</b> or inverted. <b>Image</b> inversion had the strongest effect on the pupil responses. The pupil constricted more to the onset of <b>upright</b> <b>images</b> as compared to inverted images. Furthermore, the amplitudes of pupil constrictions to viewing images containing a sun were larger relative to control images. In Experiment 2, we presented cartoon versions of upright and inverted pictures that included either a sun or a moon. The image backgrounds were kept identical across conditions. Similar to Experiment 1, <b>upright</b> <b>images</b> triggered pupil constrictions with larger amplitudes than inverted images and images of the sun evoked greater pupil contraction than images of the moon. We suggest that the modulations of pupil responses were due to higher-level interpretations of image content...|$|R

30|$|Many image {{segmentation}} algorithms are known, but often {{there is an}} inherent obstacle in the unbiased evaluation of segmentation quality: the absence or lack of a common objective representation for segmentation results. Such a representation, known as the ground truth, is a description of what one should obtain {{as the result of}} ideal segmentation, independently of the segmentation algorithm used. The creation of ground truth is a laborious process and therefore any degree of automation is always welcome. Document image analysis is one of the areas where ground truths are employed. In this paper, we describe an automated tool called GROTTO intended to generate ground truths for skewed document images, which can be used for the performance evaluation of page segmentation algorithms. Some of these algorithms are claimed to be insensitive to skew (tilt of text lines). However, this fact is usually supported only by a visual comparison of what one obtains and what one should obtain since ground truths are mostly available for <b>upright</b> <b>images,</b> that is, those without skew. As a result, the evaluation is both subjective; that is, prone to errors, and tedious. Our tool allows users to quickly and easily produce many sufficiently accurate ground truths that can be employed in practice and therefore it facilitates automatic performance evaluation. The main idea is to utilize the ground truths available for <b>upright</b> <b>images</b> and the concept of the representative square [9] in order to produce the ground truths for skewed images. The usefulness of our tool is demonstrated through a number of experiments with real-document images of complex layout.|$|R

40|$|Are detection, categorization, and {{identification}} of <b>upright</b> <b>images</b> of natural objects {{mediated by the}} same or different visual processes? Surprisingly, previous studies found that object detection is as fast as object categorization while object identification takes significantly longer. This suggests that object detection and categorization are mediated by the same visual processes while object identification is mediated by different visual processes (eg Grill-Spector and Kanwisher, 2005 Psychological Science 16 (2) 152 - 160). We compared (a) {{the time course of}} object detection, categorization, {{and identification}} of <b>upright</b> object <b>images</b> using a higher temporal resolution than in previous studies (Experiments 1 and 2); and (b) the sensitivity of these three recognition processes (Experiment 3). Participants saw two consecutive image presentations of which one contained an object image and the other a patch of visual noise. On every trial participants reported the object interval (detection), the object's category (categorization), and the object identity (identification). We measured participants' accuracy to conduct each of these tasks as a function of presentation time (Experiments 1 and 2), and signal-to-noise ratio (Experiment 3). We found significant differences between the psychometric functions of object detection, categorization, and identification in all three experiments. We conclude that detection, categorization, and identification are separable component processes of object recognition...|$|R
50|$|The Gregorian telescope, {{described}} by Scottish astronomer and mathematician James Gregory in his 1663 book Optica Promota, employs a concave secondary mirror {{that reflects the}} image back {{through a hole in}} the primary mirror. This produces an <b>upright</b> <b>image,</b> useful for terrestrial observations. Some small spotting scopes are still built this way.

Polarized filters are attached to the image screens and appropriately angled filters are worn as glasses.

In either case, the actual recorded footage must still be rotated 180 degrees in post-production. The one exception to this is the option to mount the camera upside down.

Compatibility effects were observed in the upright condition for both groups, but neither group exhibited any compatibility effects in the inverted position. Unexpectedly the acrobats responded significantly faster to incongruent trials compared to the control subjects, leading to the conclusion that there must be some form of priming occurring concurrently with the body compatibility task allowing the acrobats to respond faster than the control participants...|$|R

50|$|Almost {{from the}} {{invention}} of the telescope in the 17th century the advantages of mounting two of them side by side for binocular vision seems to have been explored. Most early binoculars used Galilean optics; that is, they used a convex objective and a concave eyepiece lens.

This type of construction is still used in very cheap models and in opera glasses or theater glasses. The Galilean design is also used in low magnification binocular surgical and jewelers' loupes because they can be very short and produce an <b>upright</b> <b>image</b> without extra or unusual erecting optics, reducing expense and overall weight.
