5|$|The <b>Uniate</b> Church, {{created for}} the Ruthenian {{population}} of the Commonwealth, in its administrative dealings gradually switched to the Polish language use.

5|$|The Union of Brest act was {{negotiated}} and solemnly concluded in 1595–1596. It had not merged the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox denominations, but {{led to the}} establishment of the Slavic language liturgy <b>Uniate</b> Church, which was to become an Eastern Catholic Church, one of the Greek Catholic Churches (presently Ukrainian Greek Catholic and Belarusian Greek Catholic). The new church, of the Byzantine Rite, accepted papal supremacy, while it retained in most respects its Eastern Rite character. The compromise union was flawed from the beginning, because despite the initial agreement, the Greek-Catholic bishops were not, like their Roman Catholic counterparts, seated in the Senate, and the Eastern Rite participants of the union had not been granted full general equality they expected.|$|E
5|$|While in Egypt, Zoghby {{considered}} {{the issues of}} ecumenism and the schism between the Melkite Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox Churches. As he began to study both the historical roots of the separation and the modern divisions of Middle Eastern churches {{he came to the}} opinion that the schism was unjustifiable. He also began to question the domination of the so-called <b>Uniate</b> churches by the See of Rome. Zoghby, along with other Melkite priests in Egypt such as George Hakim and Joseph Tawil, were influenced by Father Oreste Karame, who advocated the need for the Melkite Church to return to its proper traditions and work for communion with the Orthodox Church.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginnings}} of the <b>Uniate</b> movement, there have been periodic conflicts between the Orthodox and <b>Uniate</b> in Poland and Western Russia. During the Time of Troubles there was a plan (by the conquering Polish monarchy) to convert all of Russia to Roman Catholicism. Patriarch Hermogenes was martyred by the Roman Catholics during this period (see also Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth).|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the first}} Russophile tendencies began to surface, {{and came in}} face of the <b>Uniate</b> Bishop Joseph Semashko. Believing that the <b>Uniate</b> Church's role as an interim bridge between Orthodoxy and their {{eventual}} path to Catholicism is over, now that the ruler of the lands {{is no longer a}} Catholic, but an Orthodox Monarch, he began to push for an eventual reversion of all Uniates. Although the idea was shared by growing number of the lower priests, the ruling <b>Uniate</b> synod, controlled by the strong Polish influence, rejected all Semashko's suggestions. In addition many of the Latin Catholic authorities responded to this by actively converting the Uniates to Latin Rite Catholicism.|$|E

25|$|In 1831, {{the general}} discontent of the Poles with the Russian rule erupted into a revolt, {{now known as}} the November Uprising, which the <b>Uniate</b> Church officially supported. However, the {{uprising}} failed, and the Russian authorities were quick to respond to its organisers and areas of strongest support. The outcome was that the <b>Uniate</b> synod's members were removed along with most of the Polish magnates privileges' and authority being taken away. With the Polish influence in the Ruthenian lands significantly reduced and in some cases eliminated, the <b>Uniate</b> Church began to disintegrate. In Volhynia the famous Pochayiv Lavra was returned to Russian Orthodox clergy in 1833. The final blow came from the Synod of Polotsk in 1839 headed by the ex-Uniate Bishop Semashko, where it was agreed to terminate the accords of Union of Brest and all of the remaining <b>Uniate</b> property on the territory of the Belarus and Right Bank Ukraine within the Russian Empire was incorporated into the Russian Orthodox Church. Those <b>Uniate</b> clergy who refused to join the Russian Orthodox Church (593 {{out of a total of}} 1,898 in Ukraine and Belarus) were exiled to the Russian interior or Siberia. By means of mass deportations, persecution and even executions the Uniates were practically eliminated in the Russian Empire. Only a small number of Greek Catholics in the Kholm Governorate managed to preserve their faith.|$|E

25|$|Cossacks led an uprising, called Koliivshchyna, {{starting}} in the Ukrainian borderlands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1768. Ethnicity was one root cause of this revolt, which included Ukrainian violence that killed {{tens of thousands of}} Poles and Jews. Religious warfare also broke out among Ukrainian groups. Increasing conflict between <b>Uniate</b> and Orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced Polish-Russian border on the Dnieper River in the time of Catherine II {{set the stage for the}} uprising. As <b>Uniate</b> religious practices had become more Latinized, Orthodoxy in this region drew even closer into dependence on the Russian Orthodox Church. Confessional tensions also reflected opposing Polish and Russian political allegiances.|$|E

50|$|By 1750, nominal Catholics {{comprised}} about 80% of the Commonwealth's population, {{the vast}} majority of the noble citizenry, and the entire legislature. In the east, there were also the Eastern Orthodox Church adherents. However, Catholics in the Grand Duchy itself were split. Under half were Latin rite with strong allegiance to Rome. The others (mostly non-noble Ruthenians) followed the Eastern rite. They were the so-called <b>Uniates,</b> whose church was established at the Union of Brest in 1596, and they acknowledged only nominal obedience to Rome. At first the advantage went to the advancing Roman Catholic Church pushing back a retreating Orthodox Church. However, after the first partition of the Commonwealth in 1772, the Orthodox had the support of the government and gained the upper hand. The Russian Orthodox Church paid special attention to the <b>Uniates</b> (who had once been Orthodox), and tried to bring them back. The contest was political and spiritual, utilizing missionaries, schools, and pressure exerted by powerful nobles and landlords. By 1800, over 2 million of the <b>Uniates</b> had become Orthodox, and another 1.6 million by 1839.|$|R

25|$|Year 1900: 159,877 inhabitants, {{including}} the military (10,326 men).

25|$|The 1921 Peace of Riga {{treaty that}} ended the Polish-Soviet War gave the {{significant}} areas of the ethnically Ukrainian (and Belarusian) territories to the reborn Polish state.

50|$|Other Christian {{minority}} {{groups in the}} Macedonian German community include Greek Catholics, Eastern Catholics, a few <b>Uniates</b> and some Protestants.

50|$|The massive reappropriation by the Ukrainian Greek-Catholics {{of their}} former churches spurred a wave of protests {{on the part of}} the Moscow Patriarchate. Supporters of the Russian Orthodox Church accused the <b>Uniates</b> of {{illegally}} taking over churches, threatening the Orthodox faithful and persecuting the clergy.|$|R
50|$|The Ottoman {{authorities}} {{divided the}} population by religion, so all Patriarchists were counted as Greeks and the Pomaks as Muslims. The other two sources divided the population by language, so for example 24,970 Bulgarian patriarchists and 1700 <b>Uniates</b> were added by Miletich {{to the total}} figure for Orthodox Bulgarians.|$|R
25|$|Because of that Patriarch Gregory III of Constantinople reorganized the Ruthenian Church in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (until 1569 the Grand Duchy of Lithuania) and its new {{primates}} were titled as Metropolitans of Kiev, Halych and all Ruthenia. He appointed Gregory II Bulgarian {{as the new}} <b>Uniate</b> primate who in 1470 {{rejoined the}} Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople under Dionysius I of Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|In the meantime, some Bulgarian leaders {{tried to}} {{negotiate}} {{the establishment of a}} Bulgarian <b>Uniate</b> Church. The movement for union with Rome led to the initial recognition of a separate Bulgarian Catholic Millet by the Sultan in 1860. The Sultan issued a special decree (irade) for that occasion. Although the movement initially gathered some 60,000 adherents, the subsequent establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate reduced their number with some 75%.|$|E

The Eastern Orthodox and 'Greek' Catholic (Arabic: المسيحية الشرقية في سوريا) tradition {{is represented in}} Syria by two distinct albeit historically and culturally related Byzantine communities: the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, the largest and oldest Christian community in the country, closely followed by the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, itself a <b>Uniate</b> offshoot of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch.|$|E
50|$|Gorbachev {{replied to}} the pope's {{proposal}} only in August 1989. Official correspondence {{had been established}} between the Kremlin and the Moscow Patriarchate {{on one side and}} the Apostolic See on the other side. Gorbachev maintained that it was both the Vatican's and the Moscow Patriarchate's obligation to reach a consensus regarding the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic question. Shortly afterwards, in a letter addressed to Pope John Paul II on 16 August 1989, Patriarch Pimen put forth a proposal which was unacceptable to the Vatican. In his missive, the Russian Orthodox hierarch recommended the de facto liquidation of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church by way of adjoining the <b>Uniates</b> who place the Eastern Rite above Catholic dogma - to the Orthodox Church, and those <b>Uniates</b> who favor Catholicism - to the Roman Catholic Church.|$|R
5000|$|The report noted that: [...] "Moslems, Orthodox Christians, Catholics, Maronites {{and other}} <b>Uniates,</b> Anglicans have been {{represented}} by witnesses, who included priests {{of the above}} Christian bodies: {{and it has been}} impossible to avoid the conclusions that practically the whole of the non-Jewish population was united in hostility to Jews".|$|R
5000|$|St. Tikhon of Moscow once quoted Fr. Jacob's missionary {{exploits}} this way, [...] "He {{did much}} to convert the heathen to the Christian Faith and returned many <b>Uniates</b> to the Orthodox Church.

25|$|But {{diplomacy}} by {{no means}} exhausted Bezborodko's capacity for work. He had a large share in the internal administration also. He reformed the post-office, improved the banking system of Russia, regulated the finances, constructed roads, and united the <b>Uniate</b> and Orthodox churches. On the death of Catherine, Emperor Paul entrusted Bezborodko with {{the examination of the}} late empress's private papers, and shortly afterwards made him a prince of the Russian Empire, with a correspondingly splendid apanage. On the retirement of Osterman he received the highest dignity in the Russian Empire - that of imperial chancellor.|$|E
25|$|Decentralized {{authority}} and increased {{independence of the}} <b>Uniate</b> Churches were aimed at in the Canon Law/Corpis Iuris Canonici (CIC) reform. In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) Eastern marriage law (CIC Orientalis, 1949), civil law (CIC Orientalis, 1950), laws governing religious associations (CIC Orientalis, 1952) property law (CIC Orientalis, 1952) and other laws. These reforms and writings of Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as explained in the encyclical Mystici corporis.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} of Western Orthodox parishes {{has been compared}} with {{the status of the}} autonomous Eastern Catholic Churches (often called <b>Uniate</b> by Orthodox Christians) in communion with the Roman Catholic Church. For centuries, there have been hierarchical churches in full communion with Rome. Eastern Catholics, despite usages in continuity with, and closely resembling, those of the Orthodox, largely share a common dogma with Latin Catholics, a situation that is called uniatism. Analogously, the Western Rite Orthodox share the same faith as their Byzantine Rite Orthodox brethren despite a different liturgical rite.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the massacres}} of Jews, Jesuits, <b>Uniates,</b> and Polish nobility, the Polish {{language}} term Hajdamactwo became a pejorative label for Ukrainians as a whole.

Haidamaky (1841), an epic poem by Taras Shevchenko, treats its subjects both sympathetically and critically.|$|R
50|$|In 1736, a Jesuit {{mission was}} formed {{at the expense}} of a E. Linovskiy, as well as a school in 1747.

5000|$|The term [...] "union" [...] (e.g., the Union of Brest of 1596) is {{also used}} for the {{arrangement}} {{when a group of}} Orthodox Christians enters communion with the Catholic Church's Pope of Rome, while wishing to maintain their Eastern rites.
