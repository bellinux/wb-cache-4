Parking Generation provides statistics on the average peak parking demand, when the peak demand occurs, range, coefficient of variation and standard deviation data. The data that is presented is an assemblage of observations [...] conducted by various volunteers. The information is commonly provided in term of peak parked vehicles per unit of land use (for example, per 1,000 gross square feet, dwelling <b>unit,</b> <b>employee,</b> student, room, ...). The informational report is updated every five to ten years, incorporating recent observations that have been submitted to ITE. [...] While this informational report is assailed by some urban planners for lack of urban data or encouraging unnecessary parking provisions, the document does not make any recommendations for minimum parking and simply represents the single largest set of empirical data of actual parking demand observations.|$|E

The environment in which this inventory system must operate is dynamic and requires the inventory control system to change to meet the changing needs of this environment, thus the system cannot end. This dynamic environment also causes planning and implementation of the inventory plan as the needs of the environment change. The inventory control effort is not out of the planning stage since planning and implementation are ongoing phases of the inventory control system. This inventory control effort is considered a part of the writer's job. The preparation of this paper may also be considered a part of the job since he is involved with Dana's training program.
