We included moving focus targets and <b>unforeseen</b> <b>interruptions</b> in each meeting, by guiding each meeting along a predefined script of events that three participating actors were instructed to follow. Further meeting attendees were not introduced to upcoming actions or the general purpose of the meeting, hence {{we were able to}} capture their natural focus changes within this predefined dynamic scenario with an extensive setup of both visual and acoustical sensors throughout our smart room. We present an adaptive approach to estimate visual focus of attention based on head orientation under these unforeseen conditions and show, that our system achieves an overall recognition rate of 59 %, compared to 9 % less when choosing the best matching focus target directly from the observed head orientation angles...|$|E
40|$|Although the International Energy Agency (IEA) has had {{a program}} of {{maintaining}} strategic oil stockpiles since 1974 in order to cope with <b>unforeseen</b> <b>interruptions</b> to supplies, it has failed to prevent the worst effects of the 1979 and recent interruptions. This paper develops a price-based model of stock management which is then used to simulate the management of an actual supply interruption. It is argued that such a system is more appropriate {{for the kind of}} net supply shortfalls that have been, or are likely to be, experienced than the current JEA program. The JEA program relies rigidly on a predetermined net quantity shortage to activate it [...] a condition which almost guarantees that it will never be used in a real crisis. By contrast, the subtrigger approach proposed in this study has the advantage of flexibility and promptness of response which would make it relevant in a real supply interruption. ...|$|E

40|$|How {{a supply}} chain (SC) is {{configured}} can {{have a significant impact}} on the performance of global firms. More specifically, disturbance factors (i. e. those factors associated with uncertainty and risk) are increasingly important considerations. This paper focuses on endogenous, exogenous and environment-related SC disturbance factors and their relative importance when configuring global SCs. Three alternative scenarios of SC configurations for European-based pharmaceutical firms are identified - insource nearshore, outsource nearshore and outsource offshore. Through a multi-phase, mixed-method approach we find that the top five disturbance factors managers should be aware of while configuring their SCs are quality defects, <b>unforeseen</b> and random <b>interruptions</b> in manufacturing processes, order processing difficulties, untimely delivery of products, and a mismatch between market demand and supplier responsiveness. This study is able to provide insights into the impact of disturbance factors on the SC configuration strategy for Big Pharmas. We show that SC disturbances influenced the decision to bring production back home (reshoring) or to a closer location (near-shoring). To mitigate the effects of disturbances many Big Pharmas recalibrated their SC configurations by insourcing core products, outsourcing non-core products offshore and developing offshore insourcing capabilities through ‘captives’...|$|R
