The work of fishing was traditionally subdivided by gender: men were only allowed to fish for eels, while women were tasked to use nets to catch small fish, and children {{were the only ones}} allowed to fish using poles. Men and children would traditionally leave their catch on the shore for women to pick <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> back to the village.|$|E
5|$|The 722 Sunshields were {{carefully}} pre-positioned in the Martello tank-holding area near El Imayid railway station. Each was numbered.

5|$|The 1984 series {{began with}} Andy Lloyd being {{hit on the}} head, {{resulting}} in his being hospitalised. This {{would prove to be}} a common theme throughout the series, as the English batsmen struggled to cope with the West Indies bouncers. Whenever England threatened, a West Indian player would step <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> control of the match, as when Gordon Greenidge scored 214 after an England declaration to win the second Test. The series was decided at Leeds, where the West Indies gained an unassailable 3–0 lead. The final Test at The Oval saw the West Indies record the only whitewash by a visiting nation in a five Test series. This was the fifth whitewash in Test cricket and the first to be inflicted on England in England.|$|E

5|$|The 3rd Ranger Company entered {{action on}} 11 April, {{part of a}} tank-infantry task force {{conducting}} aggressive reconnaissance in a wide valley near the river. Encountering a village, the 3rd Platoon cleared the village and killed two Chinese stragglers. After the lead elements of the tank company and the 3rd Platoon had taken the Kantongyon village, the tank company commander wanted to move his company west {{into the center of}} the valley before continuing north. Captain and now Executive Officer, Bob Channon was near the rear of the company column. CO, Jess Tidwell, riding with the tank Co, called Channon on the radio and instructed him to come <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> control of the 1st and 2nd Platoons.|$|E

25|$|Birefringence can be {{observed}} in amyloid plaques such as are found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients when stained with a dye such as Congo Red. Modified proteins such as immunoglobulin light chains abnormally accumulate between cells, forming fibrils. Multiple folds of these fibers line <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> on a beta-pleated sheet conformation. Congo red dye intercalates between the folds and, when observed under polarized light, causes birefringence.|$|E
25|$|After the Dhuni fire is lit and prayers, bhajans, and devotional {{songs are}} sung, people line <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> {{a piece of}} {{sandalwood}}. In turn they dip the sandalwood stick into ghee (clarified butter) and toss it into the fire, intending the offering to represent the relinquishing of some attachment or psychological limitation that they wish to be consumed by the fire. The ritual thus symbolizes surrendering and giving up desires and limitations to God.|$|E

Kapil Dev achieved his then best innings haul of 7/20 in just 9 overs in the second innings to skittle Bengal for 58 runs in under 19 overs.

25|$|After Presley {{showed signs}} of {{rebellion}} again in 1966 and because of his flagging career, Parker {{decided that it was}} time for a new approach: marriage. Frank Sinatra had married Mia Farrow in 1966, and it had produced enough publicity for Parker to sit <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> notice. Presley had been living with Priscilla Beaulieu, ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. Jerry Lee Lewis's career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin – and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.|$|E
25|$|Public waste {{containers}} or street bins {{are provided}} by local authorities {{to be used as}} a convenient place for the disposal and collection of litter. Increasingly both general waste and recycling options are provided. Local councils pick the waste <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> it to reuse or recycling. However, there are issues with this approach. If the bins are not regularly emptied, then overfilling of bins occurs and can increase litter indirectly. Some local authorities will only take responsibility for rubbish that is placed in the bins, which means that litter remains a problem. People may blame a lack of well-placed bins for their littering. Hazardous materials may be incorrectly disposed of in the bins and they can encourage dumpster diving.|$|E

25|$|Edward {{was still}} unwilling {{to travel to}} France to give homage; the {{situation}} in England was febrile; {{there had been an}} assassination plot against Edward and Hugh Despenser in 1324, there had been allegations that the famous magician John of Nottingham had been hired to kill the pair using necromancy in 1325, and criminal gangs were occupying much of the country. Edward was deeply concerned that should he leave England, even for a short while, the barons would take the chance to rise <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> their revenge on the Despensers. Charles sent a message through Pope John XXII to Edward, suggesting {{that he was willing to}} reverse the forfeiture of the lands if Edward ceded the Agenais and paid homage for the rest of the lands: the Pope proposed Isabella as an ambassador. Isabella, however, saw this as a perfect opportunity to resolve her situation with Edward and the Despensers.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} {{of men and}} women meant that women were forced to wait long periods to have children and get married. This lengthened the timeline of independence for single women and impacted the Japanese-Canadian community after internment by creating more independent women, both of which disrupted the pre-internment way of life. Young children were forced to step <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>take</b> on more responsibilities when fathers were taken away. Accounts from children in internment camps recall the impact not having a father. One girl recalls how her sister went from being a pampered eldest child to being a head of household in their father's absence. This was disruptive to the typical family structure because not only was a child in charge, but it was a girl. Transitions such as these gave women a much greater power within the family structure and gave children more adult responsibilities.|$|E

Additional praise was given in their review of Soulcalibur IV, stating an approval of her design combined with her personality, and a preference for her over the game's unlockable characters.|$|E
