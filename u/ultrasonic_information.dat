40|$|Abstract: Laser-ultrasound is a {{technique}} currently used for the ultrasonic inspection of composites during manufacturing of advanced jet fighters. This technique {{is based on a}} shortpulse laser to generate ultrasonic waves and a long-pulse laser coupled to an interferometer to detect the resulting displacements. In theory, the signal-to-noise ratio of the signal is proportional to the square root of the collected detection light power. In practice however, noise from the laser limits the signal-to-noise ratio above a certain collected power level. When using conventional Fabry-Perot interferometers to demodulate <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>information,</b> one type of noise, amplitude relaxation noise, can be rejected using a differential configuration based on two cavities stabilized {{on opposite sides of the}} resonance peak. Another type of laser noise, phase noise, cannot be rejected using Fabry-Perot interferometers and currently limits signal-to-noise ratio. A new type of interferometer based on a photorefractive crystal can be made almost completely insensitive by matching the optical path lengths of the pump and signal beams while still rejecting amplitude noise. In this paper, the phase noise rejection capability of a commercial two-wave mixing photorefractive interferometer is experimentally demonstrated.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new calibration procedure for distance sensors {{that does not}} require independent sources of groundtruth information, i. e., that {{is not based on}} comparing the measurements from the uncalibrated sensor against measurements from a precise device assumed as the groundtruth. Alternatively, the procedure assumes that the uncalibrated distance sensor moves in space on a straight line in an environment with fixed targets, so that the intrinsic parameters of the statistical model of the sensor readings are calibrated without requiring tests in controlled environments, but rather in environments where the sensor follows linear movement and objects do not move. The proposed calibration procedure exploits an approximated expectation maximization scheme on top of two ingredients: an heteroscedastic statistical model describing the measurement process, and a simplified dynamical model describing the linear sensor movement. The procedure is designed to be capable of not just estimating the parameters of one generic distance sensor, but rather integrating the most common sensors in robotic applications, such as Lidars, odometers, and sonar rangers and learn the intrinsic parameters of all these sensors simultaneously. Tests in a controlled environment led to a reduction of the mean squared error of the measurements returned by a commercial triangulation Lidar by a factor between 3 and 6, comparable to the efficiency of other state-of-the art groundtruth-based calibration procedures. Adding odometric and <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>information</b> further improved the performance index of the overall distance estimation strategy by a factor of up to 1. 2.

A B-mode {{image of the}} artery was obtained with a 32 -element linear array transducer, and a single line of video <b>ultrasonic</b> <b>information</b> was selected for tracking the echoes from the adventitial side of the near wall to the lumen-intima interface of the far wall. This technique measured lumen diameter plus anterior wall thickness. The diastolic diameter (Dd) (mean ± SEM) of the test arteries was slightly larger than controls (2. 9 ± 0. 1 vs 2. 5 ± 0. 1 mm), whereas the fractional diameter change from diastole to systole (ΔD/Dd, where ΔD = diameter change) was slightly less (0. 062 ± 0. 010 vs 0. 082 ± 0. 011). Direct subclavian artery pulse pressure (ΔP) in the test animals (63 ± 4 mm Hg) was significantly greater than in the controls (41 ± 2 mm Hg), whereas {{there was no difference}} in diastolic pressure (85 ± 3 vs 81 ± 2), respectively. The pressure-strain elastic modulus Ep = (ΔP/ΔD) Dd was significantly greater in the test monkeys (182 ± 33 kPa) than in the controls (73 ± 9 kPa). Morphometric analysis of atherosclerosis revealed more connective tissue and intra- and extracellular lipids in the test arteries than in the controls. Based on the average of three cross-sections equally spaced along each common carotid artery, the intimal area and the maximal intimal thickness averaged 0. 89 ± 0. 16 mm 2 and 0. 26 ± 0. 04 mm for the test monkeys compared to negligible intimae from the controls. Medial area also was significantly greater in the test monkeys (0. 71 ± 0. 03 mm 2) compared to controls (0. 57 ± 0. 04 mm 2). Percentage stenosis defined as intimal area/IEL area, where IEL area is that within the internal elastic lamina, showed the test arteries to have 30 ± 5 % stenosis compared to 0 % for the controls. However, dilatation appeared to compensate for any loss in lumen area due to intimal thickening. In this study, significant carotid artery stiffening associated with diet-induced atherosclerosis is demonstrated.
