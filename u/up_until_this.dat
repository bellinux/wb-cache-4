5|$|On 5 September 2008, {{after winning}} in round 4 of the Bilbao Masters, Carlsen, aged 17 years and 280 days old, briefly became No. 1 on the {{unofficial}} live ratings list. Carlsen's {{victory in the}} 2009 Nanjing Pearl tournament raised his FIDE rating to 2801, making him, aged 18 years and 336 days, the youngest player ever to surpass 2800 Elo. The youngest before Carlsen to achieve this feat was Vladimir Kramnik {{at the age of}} 25, and <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point only Kasparov, Topalov, Kramnik, and Anand had achieved a 2800+ rating.|$|E
5|$|The Hungarian Scout {{program had}} four stages. During {{the first three}} years, Bánáthy {{advanced}} three stages. The last stage required Bánáthy to earn 25 merit badges. This last stage was called Turul, after the mythical bird of Hungary. From spring to fall, as weather permitted, the patrol had many outings. Every summer the troop went on a two- to three-week long summer camp. Bánáthy and his troop attended the 4th World Scout Jamboree in 1933. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> time, he had intended to follow his father into the ministry, but changed his mind.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} episode of The Simpsons where the {{animation}} was produced by Film Roman. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point, Film Roman had mostly worked on Garfield and Friends and Bobby's World episodes, and {{were not used to}} the speed with which The Simpsons episodes were produced. However, they quickly adjusted. Film Roman went on to do the animation {{for the rest of the}} series and eventually The Simpsons Movie. Previously, the animation was produced by Klasky Csupo.|$|E

5|$|In 1567 Qi Jiguang and Tan Lun, {{successful}} generals who fended off {{the coastal}} pirates, were reassigned {{to manage the}} Ji–Chang Defense Commands and step up the defences of the capital region. Under their ambitious and energetic management, 1200 brick watchtowers were built along the Great Wall from 1569 to 1571. These included the first large-scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall: <b>up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point, most previous towers along the Great Wall had been solid, with a small hut on top for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows; the Ji–Chang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures, allowing soldiers interior space to live, store food and water, stockpile weapons, and take shelter from Mongol arrows.|$|E
5|$|The cabinet settled upon a risky {{alternative}} {{to resolve the}} complicated situation in the Platine region. Instead of undertaking a period of conscription {{to build up the}} Brazilian Army, which would have been costly, the Council decided to rely on the standing army. It sent a contingent south to secure the region. Brazil held an advantage in possessing a powerful and modern navy, along with an experienced professional army hardened by years of internal and external warfare. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point, no other nation in South America possessed true navies or regular armies. Rosas' and Oribe's forces were largely made up of irregular troops on loan from those caudillos who supported them. Even a decade later, Argentina could only field an army of 6,000 men. Brazil also decided to adopt Rosas' own tactics by financing his opponents to weaken him both internally and externally.|$|E
5|$|Young {{missed the}} start of the 1965–66 season with an illness that {{resulted}} in a tonsillectomy. He marked his return to the team with two goals against Coventry City. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point in his career, Young had usually played on the left wing. However, encouraged by Mercer and Allison to shoot more frequently, his position began to vary. Against Leyton Orient, Young was deployed as an inside forward, and scored a hat-trick. He also played inside-forward in an FA Cup tie against Leicester City, and scored the winning goal against a team from the division above. By January, Manchester City were top of the Second Division. The club only lost one match in the remainder of the season, and won the Second Division Championship by a five-point margin. Young finished as the club's highest goalscorer, with 17 goals.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{aristocracy}} was becoming extremely rich. Several Italian towns had sided with Hannibal during the Second Punic War, and these towns were ultimately punished for their disloyalty, which opened {{up even more}} cheap farmland for the aristocrats. With the destruction of Rome's great commercial rival of Carthage, even more opportunities for profit became available. With so many new territories, tax collection (which had always been outsourced to private individuals) also became extremely profitable. While the aristocrats spent their time exploiting new opportunities for profit, Rome was conquering new civilizations in the east. These civilizations were often highly developed, and as such they opened up a world of luxury to the Romans. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point, most Romans had only known a simple life, but as both wealth and eastern luxuries became available at the same time, an era of ruinous decadence followed. The sums that were spent on these luxuries had no precedent in prior Roman history. Several laws were enacted to stem this tide of decadence, but these laws had no effect, and attempts by the Censors to mitigate this decadence were equally futile.|$|E
5|$|Eóghan Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll (died c.1268×1275) was a {{prominent}} member of Clann Somhairle, the descendants of Somhairle mac Giolla Brighde, King of the Isles (died 1164). Through Somhairle's wife, Ragnhildr, daughter of Óláfr Guðrøðarson, King of the Isles (died 1153), several leading members of Clann Somhairle claimed kingship in the Hebrides. In 1248, Eóghan and his second cousin, Dubhghall mac Ruaidhrí (died 1268), travelled to Hákon in Norway and requested the title of king in the Hebrides. Hákon subsequently bestowed the title upon Eóghan, and the following year, upon learning of Haraldr Óláfsson's death, Hákon sent Eóghan westward {{to take control of}} the Isles (at least temporarily) on his behalf. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point Eóghan had two overlords: the King of Norway, who claimed the Hebrides; and the King of Scots, who claimed Argyll and coveted the Hebrides. Unfortunately for Eóghan, soon after his return from Norway, Alexander II, King of Scots (died 1249) led an expedition deep into Argyll and demanded that Eóghan renounce his allegiance to Hákon. Eóghan refused to do so and was subsequently driven from his Scottish lordship.|$|E
5|$|Records of burghs, {{small towns}} granted legal {{privileges}} from the crown, {{can be found}} from the eleventh century. Burghs (a term derived from the Germanic word for fortress), developed rapidly {{during the reign of}} David I (1124–53). <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point there were no identifiable towns in Scotland. Most of the burghs that were granted charters in his reign probably already existed as settlements. Charters were copied almost verbatim from those used in England, and early citizens, called burgesses, that were usually English or Flemish. They were able to impose tolls and fines on traders within a region outside their settlements. Most of the early burghs were on the east coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, including Aberdeen, Berwick, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the European continent. In the south-west, Glasgow, Ayr and Kirkcudbright were aided by the less-profitable sea trade with Ireland, {{and to a lesser extent}} France and Spain.|$|E

5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to the}} king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E
5|$|The Bannatyne {{manuscript}} {{states that}} the flag was unfurled at the Battle of Bloody Bay in 1480. The manuscript related that during the battle, the clan's chief, William Dubh (historically lived c.1415–1480), was slain, and in consequence his clan began to lose heart. A priest then ordered the flag's bearer, Murcha Breac, to unfurl the Fairy Flag to rally the clan. <b>Up</b> <b>until</b> <b>this</b> point, the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan were on the opposing side of their kinsmen, the MacLeods of Lewis. However, once the MacLeods of Lewis noticed that the flag had been unfurled, they switched sides to join forces with their kinsmen. Unfortunately for both MacLeod clans, {{the outcome of the}} battle had already been determined and they were on the losing side. Among the vast numbers of MacLeods slain were Murcha Breac and the twelve guardians of the flag. William Dubh is buried on the island of Iona with his predecessors, and the body of Murcha Breac is placed within the same tomb. The manuscript states that this was the greatest honour which could be bestowed upon his remains. R.C. MacLeod suggested that the MacLeod effigy within Iona Abbey may mark the burial of the first chiefs of the clan, as well as William Dubh, and the mentioned standard bearer. William Dubh is thought to have been the last MacLeod chief buried on Iona; his son, Alasdair Crotach (1450–1547), was buried in St Clements Church, on Harris.|$|E
