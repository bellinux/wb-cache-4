5|$|Another {{departure}} from the gameplay of Final Fantasy X is in its world navigation system: players can visit almost every location in Spira from early in the game, transported via the airship Celsius. This is a deviation from the overall Final Fantasy series, where the most efficient means of transportation is typically not obtained <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
5|$|Galland {{succeeded in}} {{temporarily}} persuading Milch to support cancelling the Me 209 program {{in favour of}} producing 100 Me 262s {{by the end of}} 1943. However, because of persistent problems with its turbojet engines and later, Hitler's determination {{to use it as a}} bomber, the Me 262 was not developed as a fighter <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E
5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words. He has difficulty expressing himself directly and instead blunts the thrust of his thought with wordplay. It is not <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> play, after his experience with the pirates, that Hamlet is able to articulate his feelings freely.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} {{characters were}} not portrayed by actors <b>until</b> very <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> show's run (and rarely even after that) but were frequently discussed by Vic, Sade, Rush and Uncle Fletcher.|$|R
5|$|In March 1865, General Order 14 {{provided}} for enlisting slaves into the army, {{with a promise}} of freedom for service. The idea had been suggested years earlier, but Davis did not act upon it <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war, and very few slaves were enlisted.|$|E
5|$|Steep was {{not likely}} settled <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon period {{when it was}} first {{documented}} under the name of 'Stepe Place' in the 12th century. The church of All Saints was built around 1125, and the oldest surviving dwelling in the village dates from the late 16th century, which lies opposite the church. In the early medieval period, Steep was included as a 'sub-parish' of East Meon.|$|E
5|$|The fleet did {{not leave}} Spithead until 16 November, the {{departure}} having been delayed <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season. The delay proved disastrous: two days after departing, a westerly gale blew up, dispersing the fleet and driving the ships back to port. Several of the merchantmen were wrecked with heavy loss of life; over 200 bodies washed up on the coastline between Portland and Bridport.|$|E
50|$|The cells {{within each}} somite are {{specified}} {{based on their}} location within <b>the</b> somite. <b>In</b> addition, they retain the ability to become any kind of somite-derived structure <b>until</b> relatively <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of somitogenesis.|$|R
50|$|In 1949, Jeremiah began {{illustrating}} {{the covers of}} Interior Design magazine, an assignment that continued <b>until</b> <b>late</b> 1964. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> same period, he created illustrations for Harper's Bazaar, House & Garden and Vogue magazines.|$|R

5|$|Yorktown {{stood out}} of Callao on 4 March 1892, steamed northward via San Diego and San Francisco, and {{eventually}} arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California. The gunboat subsequently underwent repairs there <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> following month. Having weathered one diplomatic storm and international incident, Evans and his command soon set sail on another mission that, if handled wrongly, could have caused ill-feeling with the British.|$|E
5|$|After the Hokies' {{participation}} in the 2000 BCS National Championship Game, the Virginia Tech entered the 2000-2001 college football season with high expectations. <b>Until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season, those hopes were borne out, and it appeared as if the Hokies {{would return to the}} national championship game. After a late-season loss to No.3-ranked Miami, however, Tech was knocked out of contention for the national title. Following the conclusion of its 10–1 season, No. 6 Tech was selected to participate in the Gator Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the No. 16 Clemson Tigers, who had finished 9–2 during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the game {{turned into a}} {{defensive}} battle. Neither side scored <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third quarter, when Tech took advantage of a State fumble to score the first touchdown of the second half. Tech failed to convert a two-point conversion, but NC State fumbled again on the ensuing possession, and Tech was able to drive for another touchdown. Leading 22–21, Tech attempted another two-point conversion, which also failed.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the first}} {{partition}} of Poland, Ulanów was in 1772 annexed by the Habsburg Empire, and remained within Austrian Galicia <b>until</b> <b>late</b> 1918. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, {{it was a}} private town, and belonged to several noble families.|$|R
5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco did not take a stance on <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race. Murphy supported it while Tedisco eventually opposed it. Tedisco portrayed Murphy's support of the plan as a potential cause of the AIG bonus scandal. Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure {{to pay taxes on}} a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not in the Congressional district.|$|E
5|$|On 2 October 1894 the ship, {{now under}} the command of Captain Zinovy Rozhestvensky, was ordered back to the Mediterranean. In view of the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95, the Council of Ministers ordered on 1 February 1895 that the Mediterranean Squadron {{reinforce}} the 2nd Pacific Squadron. She reached the Chinese treaty port of Chefoo on 16 April and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, 2nd in command of the Pacific Fleet, on 13 May. Vladimir Monomakh remained at Chefoo <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year before sailing to Vladivostok and then to Kobe, Japan in January 1896.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, Taylor's {{offensive}} scrambling, while effective, was not Virginia Tech's primary rushing weapon. Running back Brandon Ore, Virginia Tech's starter at the position, {{would need}} to have a good game, analysts predicted, if the Hokies wanted to win the game. Ore, who suffered several injuries during the 2006 season, failed to produce meaningful offensive yardage <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season, disappointing many fans who hoped he would repeat his excellent 2006performance on the field. With a 146-yard performance against Virginia in the final game of the regular season, Ore seemed to have regained his 2006form and promised success in the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of}} the Second Age, Orcs (servants of Sauron) invaded Gundabad. The site would not be {{cleansed}} <b>until</b> very <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second Age, possibly around or {{after the fall of}} Sauron and the loss of the One Ring.|$|R

5|$|The Byzantine {{economy was}} among the most {{advanced}} in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, could not match Byzantine economic strength <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Middle Ages. Constantinople operated as a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of Eurasia and North Africa, in particular as the primary western terminus of the famous Silk Road. Until {{the first half of the}} 6th century and in sharp contrast with the decaying West, the Byzantine economy was flourishing and resilient.|$|E
5|$|<b>Until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, the {{temperature}} of Eta Carinae {{was assumed to be}} over 30,000K {{because of the presence of}} high excitation spectral lines, but other aspects of the spectrum suggested much lower temperatures and complex models were created to account for this. It is now known that the Eta Carinae system consists of at least two stars, both with strong stellar winds and a shocked colliding wind (wind-wind collision or WWC) zone, embedded within a dusty nebula that reprocesses 90% of the electromagnetic radiation into the mid and far infrared. All of these features have different temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Classical {{music was}} brought to the United States with some of the first colonists. European {{classical}} music is rooted in the traditions of European art, ecclesiastical and concert music. The central norms of this tradition developed between 1550 and 1825, centering on {{what is known as the}} common practice period. Many American classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century. When Antonín Dvořák, a prominent Czech composer, visited the United States from 1892 to 1895, he iterated the idea that American classical music needed its own models instead of imitating European composers; he helped to inspire subsequent composers to make a distinctly American style of classical music. By the beginning of the 20th century, many American composers were incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from jazz and blues to Native American music.|$|E
50|$|Belvedere Lagoon {{is owned}} and {{maintained}} by the Belvedere Lagoon Property Owners' Association. The lagoon is not accessible by boat from San Francisco Bay, and no public access is provided. <b>Until</b> somewhat <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, houseboats were present in Belvedere Lagoon.|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} the Oldham Loop Line was {{intertwined}} with {{the early history of}} railways <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Manchester and Oldham area, and to some extent also with the geography of Oldham which meant that there was no direct Manchester to Oldham line <b>until</b> quite <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 19th century.|$|R
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch. Hutton and Washbrook {{put on an}} opening {{partnership}} of 168, the best by England in the series. Washbrook refrained from the hook shot, which had caused him to lose his wicket on earlier occasions in the series. The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall. Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich, the pair batted <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first day, when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day. His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs. Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268/2, with Edrich on 41.|$|E

5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer dependable, Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal <b>until</b> <b>late</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war.|$|E
