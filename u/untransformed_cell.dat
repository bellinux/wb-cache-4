40|$|Differences in {{modes of}} control of {{glycolysis}} in tumor cells, compared with normal cells, have suggested that phosphofructokinase may not catalyse the rate-controlling step. Instead, hexokinase activity may assume a more important regulatory role. Hexokinase activities are consistently {{lower than those of}} phosphofructokinase in tumor cells, and the former enzyme may be saturated with its substrate (M. Board et al, Biochem. J. 265 : 503 - 509, 1990). The present work has focused on the glucose-phosphorylation step in tumor cell glycolysis. A range of eight human tumor cell-lines, one human tumor tissue, and four rat tumor cell lines were found to have an additional glucose-phosphorylating activity, with prop erties similar to hepatic glucokinase. Maximal activities range from 1. 1 - 20 nmol/min/mg cell protein, and the activity is consistently absent from any <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> line or tissue tested, except rat liver tissue (IS nmol/ min/mg cell protein).

40|$|The {{effect of}} SV 40 viral {{transformation}} of human fibroblasts on intercellular gap junctional communication (IJC) was investigated using a short-term quantitative assay. IJC {{was measured using}} metabolic cooperation in a coculture system of argininosuccinate synthetase- and argininosuccinate lyase-deficient human fibroblasts. These cell lines were transformed with origin-defective adenovirus/SV 40 recombinant virions, and IJC was determined both between transformed cells (homologous IJC) and between transformed and <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells</b> (heterologous IJC). At equivalent cell densities, homologous IJC between transformed cells was reduced to 25 - 55 % of the level between <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells.</b> Intermediate levels of IJC (50 - 70 % of normal) were observed in heterologous cocultures of transformed with <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells.</b> Transformed and <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells</b> were equally sensitive to inhibition of IJC by phorbol esters and by glycyrrhetinic acid, and also {{did not differ in}} the degree of upregulation of IJC by forskolin. We conclude that SV 40 transformation of human fibroblasts leads to a partial impairment of IJC which is additive when both communicating partners are transformed...|$|R

Virus-specific RNA {{isolated in the}} same manner from cells productively infected with adenoviruses did not hybridize significantly with cellular DNA. These findings suggest that RNA molecules containing covalently-linked viral and cellular sequences are transcribed in cells transformed by human adenoviruses. The high efficiency of hybridization with DNA from <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells</b> implies that viral DNA is integrated adjacent to highly reiterated cellular DNA sequences...|$|R

The results obtained show that Pd(2) -Spm is more effective against the estrogen receptors [ER(-) ] cell line MDA-MB- 231, while cDDP displayed better results for the ER(+) MCF- 7 cell line. It was shown that, like cDDP, Pd(2) -Spm triggers phosphorylation of H 2 AX, indicating that this compound damages DNA. Apart from DNA, Pd(2) -Spm also targets the cytoskeleton having {{a greater impact on}} cell morphology than cDDP. Pd(2) -Spm and cDDP have opposite antiproliferative activities {{in the presence of the}} PI 3 K inhibitor wortmannin. Furthermore, Pd(2) -Spm at an optimized concentration displays a rapid antiproliferative effect as opposed to cDDP, which seems to have a slower kinetics.

Pronase-digested glycopeptides were analysed by the combined techniques of gel filtration, exo- and endo-glycosidase digestion and concanavalin A-agarose affinity chromatography. The transformed cell glycoproteins contained more sialic acid and were enriched for more highly branched (versus biantennary) acidic-type structures compared with the <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> glycoproteins, similarly to previously reported transformation-dependent alterations. In addition, the glycopeptides from the virus-transformed cells contained several neutral-type structures that were apparently absent from the untransformed cells: small neutral-type oligosaccharides (Man 3 GlcNAc 2) that were sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase D but resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, and oligosaccharides with the property of 'truncated' precursor oligosaccharides (endoglycosidase-resistant, alpha-mannosidase-sensitive). Endoglycosidase-released oligosaccharides with the properties of hybrid-type structures were derived from the glycoproteins of both transformed and untransformed cells...|$|E
40|$|We have {{established}} a systematic high-throughput screen for genes that cause cell death specifically in transformed tumor cells. In a first round of screening, cDNAs that induce apoptosis in a transformed human cell line are detected. Positive genes are subsequently tested in a synthetic lethal screen in normal cells versus their isogenic counterparts that have been transformed by a particular oncogene. In this way, the organic cation transporter-like 3 (ORCTL 3) gene {{was found to be}} inactive in normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, but to induce apoptosis in NRK cells transformed by oncogenic H-ras. ORCTL 3 also causes cell death in v-src-transformed cells and in various human tumor cell lines but not in normal cells or <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Although ORCTL 3 {{is a member of the}} organic cation transporter gene family, our data indicate that this gene induces apoptosis independently of its putative transporter activity. Rather, various lines of evidence suggest that ORCTL 3 brings about apoptosis by an endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated mechanism. Finally, we detected ORCTL 3 to be downregulated in human kidney tumors...|$|E

A heavily labeled band with a molecular weight of approximately 250, 000 daltons was found in all <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells</b> but was absent from transformed cells. When Coomassie-blue-stained membrane preparations were compared, a band was seen in normal cells which co-migrated with the lactoperoxidase-labeled band.

40|$|Deregulated {{expression}} of oncogenes or transcription {{factors such as}} specificity protein 1 (Sp 1) is observed in many human cancers and {{plays a role in}} tumor maintenance. Paradoxically in <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells,</b> Sp 1 overexpression induces late apoptosis but the early intrinsic response is poorly characterized. In the present work, we studied increased Sp 1 level consequences in <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells</b> and showed that it turns on an early innate immune transcriptome. Sp 1 overexpression does not activate known cellular stress pathways such as DNA damage response or endoplasmic reticulum stress, but induces the activation of the OAS-RNase L pathway and the generation of small self-RNAs, leading to the upregulation of genes of the antiviral RIG-I pathway at the transcriptional and translational levels. Finally, Sp 1 -induced intrinsic innate immune response leads to the production of the chemokine CXCL 4 and to the recruitment of inflammatory cells in vitro and in vivo. Altogether our results showed that increased Sp 1 level in <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells</b> constitutes a novel danger signal sensed by the OAS-RNase L axis leading to the activation of the RIG-I pathway. These results suggested that the OAS-RNase L-RIG-I pathway may be activated in sterile condition in absence of pathogen...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe p 53 tumor {{suppressor}} {{is a key}} mediator {{of cellular}} responses to various stresses. Here, we show that under conditions of basal physiologic and cell-culture stress, p 53 inhibits expression of the CD 44 cell-surface molecule via binding to a noncanonical p 53 -binding sequence in the CD 44 promoter. This interaction enables an <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> to respond to stress-induced, p 53 -dependent cytostatic and apoptotic signals {{that would otherwise be}} blocked by the actions of CD 44. In the absence of p 53 function, the resulting derepressed CD 44 expression is essential for the growth and tumor-initiating ability of highly tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. In both tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells, CD 44 's expression is positively regulated by p 63, a paralogue of p 53. Our data indicate that CD 44 is a key tumor-promoting agent in transformed tumor cells lacking p 53 function. They also suggest that the derepression of CD 44 resulting from inactivation of p 53 can potentially aid the survival of immortalized, premalignant cells...|$|E
40|$|The anticancer peptide PNC- 27, which {{contains}} an HDM- 2 -binding domain corresponding to residues 12 - 26 of p 53 and a transmembrane-penetrating domain, {{has been found}} to kill cancer cells (but not normal cells) by inducing membranolysis. We find that our previously determined 3 D structure of the p 53 residues of PNC- 27 is directly superimposable on the structure for the same residues bound to HDM- 2, suggesting that the peptide may target HDM- 2 in the membranes of cancer cells. We now find significant levels of HDM- 2 in the membranes of a variety of cancer cells but not in the membranes of several <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> lines. In colocalization experiments, we find that PNC- 27 binds to cell membrane-bound HDM- 2. We further transfected a plasmid expressing full-length HDM- 2 with a membrane-localization signal into untransformed MCF- 10 - 2 A cells not susceptible to PNC- 27 and found that these cells expressing full-length HDM- 2 on their cell surface became susceptible to PNC- 27. We conclude that PNC- 27 targets HDM- 2 in the membranes of cancer cells, allowing it to induce membranolysis of these cells selectively...|$|E
40|$|Death receptor-mediated {{apoptosis}} is potently inhibited by viral FLIP (FLICE/caspase 8 inhibitory protein), {{which is}} composed of two tandemly repeated death effector domains (DEDs), through reduced activation of procaspase 8. Here, we show that equine herpesvirus 2 -encoded viral FLIP E 8 enhances Wnt/β-catenin signaling {{in a variety of}} cell lines. E 8 was shown to strikingly augment Wnt 3 a signaling, as shown both in a luciferase assay for T-cell factor/β-catenin and through induction of endogenous cyclin D 1. The effect of E 8 was independent of its direct binding activity with DED-containing signaling molecules, including caspase 8 and FADD, in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. E 8 enhanced Wnt signaling downstream of stabilized β-catenin, while a long form of cellular FLIP (c-FLIPL) enhanced stabilization of β-catenin in 293 T cells. Consequently, coexpression of E 8 and c-FLIPL synergistically increased Wnt signaling in 293 T cells. Moreover, E 8 -mediated stimulation of Wnt signaling induced dramatic growth retardation in <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> lines but not in transformed cell lines. Thus, viral FLIP E 8 not only inhibits death receptor-mediated apoptosis but also enhances Wnt signaling pathways that are closely related to those of both ontogenesis and oncogenesis...|$|E
40|$|Membrane vesicles {{isolated}} from untransformed Balb/c and Swiss mouse fibroblasts and from those transformed by simian virus 40 catalyzed carrier-mediated uptake of L-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid. Concentrative uptake required {{the presence of}} a Na+ gradient (external Na+ greater than internal Na+) and occurred independently of endogenous (Na+ + K+) ATPase activity. This process is electrogenic, since uptake was stimulated by a K+ diffusion gradient (internal greater external) in the presence of valinomycin or by the addition of the Na+ salt of a permeant ion, conditions expected to create an interior-negative membrane potential. Both the initial rate of concentrative uptake of L-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and its maximal accumulation, driven by a standard Na+ gradient, were decreased in vesicles from density-inhibited, <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells</b> and increased in those from cells transformed by simian virus 40 compared with vesicles from proliferating <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells.</b> An increased maximal velocity (Vmax) of uptake stimulated by Na+ gradient was observed in vesicles from transformed cells compared with those from <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells,</b> suggesting {{an increase in the number}} of carriers or in their mobility.

40|$|Normal diploid {{cells have}} a limited replicative {{potential}} in culture, with progressively increasing interdivision time. Rarely, cell lines arise which can divide indefinitely; like tumor cells, such "immortal" lines display frequent chromosomal aberrations which may reflect high rates of recombination. Recombination frequencies within a plasmid substrate were 3. 5 -fold higher in nine immortal human cell lines than in six <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> strains. Expression of HsRAD 51, a human homolog of the yeast RAD 51 and Escherichia coli recA recombinase genes, was 4. 5 -fold higher in immortal cell lines than in mortal cells. Stable transformation of human fibroblasts with simian virus 40 large T antigen prior to cell immortalization increased both chromosomal recombination {{and the level of}} HsRAD 51 transcripts by two- to fivefold. T-antigen induction of recombination was efficiently blocked by introduction of HsRAD 51 antisense (but not control) oligonucleotides spanning the initiation codon, implying that HsRAD 51 expression mediates augmented recombination. Since p 53 binds and inactivates HsRAD 51, T-antigen-p 53 association may block such inactivation and liberate HsRAD 51. Upregulation of HsRAD 51 transcripts in T-antigen-transformed and other immortal cells suggests that recombinase activation can also occur at the RNA level and may facilitate cell transformation to immortality...|$|E
40|$|The {{shortening}} of the telomeres {{that occurs}} in most somatic cells and <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> cultures is considered a hallmark of cellular senescence. Re-activation of telomerase, which is usually present in immortal cells, avoids telomere shortening and considerably extends the culture life span. Normal human endothelial cells are characterized by an accelerated rate of telomere shortening and reach replicative senescence after {{a limited number of}} cell divisions. It has recently been reported that human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression may be strongly up-regulated in human endothelial cells cocultivated with tumor cells. Due to the important implications of this finding on tumor progression, we have extensively analyzed for the presence of telomerase in primary human endothelial cells either cocultivated with tumor cells or grown with tumorconditioned medium. We found modest, but readily detectable, amounts of telomerase in all human endothelial cell cultures analyzed that disappeared as the cultures approached senescence. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR also showed a direct correlation between human telomerase reverse transcriptase expression and the proliferative index of the cultures. Nevertheless, we did not find any evidence of induction of telomerase activity by tumor cells in any of the tested conditions. All data indicate that telomerase in human endothelial cells follows an activation program that is strictly associated to the culture growth rate...|$|E
40|$|Expression of {{the gene}} {{encoding}} the cell cycle regulator cyclin D 1 is strongly repressed in adenovirus type 5 E 1 (Ad 5 E 1) -transformed cells. Since cyclin D 1 is a regulator of cell proliferation, modulation of its abun-dance may affect cell cycle control. Therefore, we studied the importance of cyclin D 1 repression for cell transformation by Ad 5 E 1. We found that forced expression of cyclin D 1 {{does not affect the}} transforming potential of Ad 5 E 1. Similarly, cyclin D 1 overexpression did not affect the efficiency of colony formation, the proliferation rate, or the cell cycle distribution of Ad 5 E 1 -transformed cell lines, whereas the colony formation of <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> lines was strongly inhibited. Thus, repression of cyclin D 1 expression is not required for initiation or maintenance of cell transformation by Ad 5 E 1. In addition, we show that the growth-suppressive effect of cyclin D 1 correlates with cyclin D 1 binding to cdk 4 rather than to proliferating cell nuclear antigen PCNA. The gene encoding cyclin D 1 has been identified in inde-pendent studies as a putative oncogene in parathyroid adeno-mas and B-cell neoplasms (34, 51), as a colony-stimulating factor-inducible gene in mouse macrophages (31), and as a gene that could rescue G 1 cyclin deficiency in yeast cells (24...|$|E

40|$|Tumorigenesis is a multistep process {{involving}} both {{genetic and}} epigenetic changes resulting in altered cellular gene expression. While many phenotypic attributes of transformed cells have been described, the cellular genes {{responsible for these}} phenotypes are largely unknown. In this study, we show that the interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) ISG 15 is expressed in all adenovirus type 5 (Ad 5) -transformed rodent cells tested, in an E 1 A-dependent manner. We find {{that the level of}} ISG 15 mRNA correlates with the level of the transcription factor ISGF 3, which has been postulated to be the transcriptional activator of ISGs. Consistent with the activation of the interferon transduction pathway in Ad 5 -transformed cells, beta interferon mRNA is expressed in all but the parental <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> line. The level of ISG 15 mRNA in Ad 5 -transformed cells correlated inversely with the ability of these cells to proliferate in soft agar. This appears to have functional significance, since the phenotype of poor growth in agar could be conferred upon a cell line that grows efficiently in soft agar by using conditioned media from cells that grow poorly in soft agar. The same effect could be mimicked by applying rat interferon. We conclude that the degree of activation of the interferon signal transduction pathway explains differences in the transformation phenotypes among Ad 5 -transformed cell lines...|$|E

Three of these antibodies (16 / 43, 16 / 77, 16 / 82), when preinjected into C 57 BL/ 6 mice, markedly reduced the number of experimental lung metastases produced by B 16 cells, possibly by interference with their adhesion to the lung endothelia. We now report that these monoclonal antibodies block in vitro attachment of the majority of human melanoma cell lines tested and also of carcinoma, neuroblastoma, and glioblastoma cells from both mice and humans but <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> lines such as 3 T 3 mouse or MRC- 5 human fibroblasts are not affected.

The appearance of de novo binding sites for insulin coincides with the increase in [3 H]thymidine uptake into nuclear DNA and clearly precedes the appearance of enlarged, morphologically transformed cells. No changes in insulin-binding are detected in unstimulated control cultures. A maximum of about 350 molecules of insulin can bind per transformed lymphocyte, while less than six insulin molecules bind to an <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell.</b> Circulating human leukemic lymphoblasts bind about as much insulin as the lymphocytes transformed in vitro.

Specific binding of insulin is a saturable process in transformed lymphocytes but not in the untransformed cells. In transformed cells, [125 I]-insulin is displaced by as little as 2 ng/ml of native insulin, while in untransformed cells no significant displacement is observed with native insulin. Digestion of transformed cells with phospholipase C (EC 3. 1. 4. 3.) enhances the specific binding of [125 I]insulin 3 -fold, but no effect occurs with untransformed cells.

However, the number of EGF receptors remained at a very low level in a non-tumourigenic revertant cell line isolated from the virus-transformed cells, indicating that an increase in EGF receptors is not a requirement for the phenotypic reversion of Kirsten MSV-transformed 3 T 3 cells. Serum-free conditioned medium from normal and virus-transformed cell lines contained similar amounts of cell growth-promoting activity as assayed by the ability to stimulate DNA synthesis in quiescent Swiss 3 T 3 cell cultures. However, the concentrated conditioned medium from these cell lines showed no evidence of beta-transforming growth factor (TGF) activity as assayed by promotion of anchorage-independent growth of untransformed normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblasts in agarose. The cellular release of alpha-TGF activity was assayed by measuring the ability of concentrated conditioned medium to inhibit the binding of 125 I-EGF to Swiss 3 T 3 cells. Conditioned medium protein from the virus-transformed cell line inhibited 125 I-EGF binding but only to the same extent as conditioned medium protein prepared from the <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> line. The alpha-TGF secretion by these cell lines was estimated to be 30 - 45 -fold lower than the level of alpha-TGF released by a well-characterized alpha-TGF-producing cell line (3 B 11). These results suggest that the induction of TGF release is not a necessary event in the transformation of NIH/ 3 T 3 cells by Kirsten MSV...|$|E
40|$|The BCR/ABL {{oncogene}} causes chronic {{myelogenous leukemia}} (CML), a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by clonal expansion of hematopoietic progenitor cells and granulocyte lineage cells. The SH 2 -containing inositol- 5 -phosphatase SHIP is a 145 -kDa protein {{which has been}} shown to regulate hematopoiesis in mice. Targeted disruption of the murine SHIP gene results in a myeloproliferative syndrome characterized by a dramatic increase in numbers of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells in the marrow and spleen. Also, hematopoietic progenitor cells from SHIP−/− mice are hyperresponsive to certain hematopoietic growth factors, a phenotype very similar to the effects of BCR/ABL in murine cells. In a series of BCR/ABL-transformed hematopoietic cell lines, Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive cell lines, and primary cells from patients with CML, the expression of SHIP was found to be absent or substantially reduced compared to <b>untransformed</b> <b>cell</b> lines or leukemia cells lacking BCR/ABL. Ba/F 3 cells in which expression of BCR/ABL was under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter showed rapid loss of p 145 SHIP, coincident with induction of BCR/ABL expression. Also, an ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, CGP 57148 B (STI 571), rapidly caused reexpression of SHIP, indicating that BCR/ABL directly, but reversibly, regulates the expression of SHIP protein. The estimated half-life of SHIP protein was reduced from 18 h to less than 3 h. However, SHIP mRNA also decreased in response to BCR/ABL, suggesting that SHIP protein levels could be affected by more than one mechanism. Reexpression of SHIP in BCR/ABL-transformed Ba/F 3 cells altered the biological behavior of cells in culture. The reduction of SHIP due to BCR/ABL is likely to directly contribute to the pathogenesis of CML...|$|E
40|$|Recombinant human tumor {{necrosis}} factor (TNF), purified {{to greater}} than 99 % homogeneity, increases surface expression of class I {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) antigens {{to a maximum of}} 9 -fold on cultured human endothelial cells (HEC) and human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). The increase is concentration dependent (peak 20 - 100 units/ml) and time dependent (nearly maximal by 4 days); expression remains elevated in the continued presence of TNF and requires greater than 7 days to return to basal levels upon TNF withdrawal. The increase in surface expression appears to result from increases in steady-state mRNA levels for the class I antigens, although the increase in mRNA is proportionately greater than for surface expression. No surface expression of or mRNA for class II MHC antigens is detectable in either control or TNF-treated HEC or HDF. These effects are similar to those produced by leukocyte or fibroblast (type I) interferons (IFNs). The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX), when added coincidentally with type I IFNs, leads to superinduction of mRNA for class I MHC antigens and, unexpectedly, leads to the appearance of mRNA for class II MHC antigens. CHX has no effect by itself upon mRNA levels for class I or class II MHC antigens, nor does it modulate the increases in mRNA produced by immune (type II) IFN. Most interesting, CHX blocks the increase in mRNA for class I MHC antigens induced by TNF. Thus TNF appears to act on MHC gene expression through a newly synthesized protein intermediate. Our results provide direct evidence that TNF can modulate gene expression in normal (<b>untransformed)</b> <b>cell</b> types and contribute to understanding the complex nature of MHC gene regulation. Finally, they suggest that TNF may act in vivo as an immunoregulatory molecule...|$|E
40|$|Vitamin A and its {{chemical}} analogues (retinoids) {{are known}} {{to play a role}} in the maintenance and differentiation of epithelial tissue. Retinoids have been shown to inhibit carcinogenesis in a number of tissues in experimental animals and to inhibit the growth of various <b>untransformed</b> and cancer <b>cell</b> lines in vitro. This study investigated the effect of retinyl acetate supplemented at concentrations of 1 μM, 5 μM, 10 μM and 100 μM to in vitro cultured <b>untransformed</b> LLCMK <b>cells,</b> and transformed BL- 6 melanoma and human hepatoma cell lines. A small but non-significant effect of vitamin A addition on the growth of the <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells</b> was observed, while substantial inhibition of proliferation of the two tumour cell lines was found. At the cytotoxic level of 100 μM supplemented vitamin A, all three cell lines showed marked inhibition of growth. This led to an electron microscopy study to examine the ultrastructural effect of the vitamin A addition. At the low non-toxic levels of vitamin A addition (1 - 10 μM), no ultrastructural changes were observed in the <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells.</b> However, at a level of 5 μM and 10 μM vitamin A addition in the tumour cells, an increase in the size of suspected lipid droplets was observed. At the cytotoxic level of 100 μM supplemented vitamin A, large lipid droplets were very apparent, as was much cellular degeneration. This effect was more marked in the tumour cells than in the <b>untransformed</b> <b>cells.</b> The lipid nature of the droplets was confirmed by using the lipid stain, Sudan IV. In order to investigate the effect of added vitamin A at the cell surface level, an ELISA system was used to quantify the level of the cell surface glycoprotein, fibronectin, in the culture media. Vitamin A plays an important role in the production of mature fibronectin by participating in the glycosylation of the molecule. This study showed no major effect of added vitamin A on the release of fibronectin into the culture media. This did not, however, exclude the possibility that the vitamin A was involved in the production and enhanced binding of fibronectin to the cell surface, and was possibly also exerting an effect on the availability of fibronectin receptors. Further studies would, however, be required to substantiate such effects of vitamin A supplementation. No single mechanism of action of vitamin A on tumour cell growth inhibition was identified, but the possibility that at least two mechanisms exist, was suggeste...|$|R
