25|$|Musō Gonnosuke Katsuyoshi {{was born}} into a samurai family, and like many other famous samurai and martial art founders, claimed to trace their lineage to a family of the {{classical}} period of samurai. His family is supposedly descendant from Kiso Kanja No Taiyu Kakumei , a retainer of the famous samurai general Minamoto Yoshinaka. Gonnosukes original family name {{is said to have been}} Hirano and that he used his given name of Gonbei in his early days. Unlike his future counterpart, Miyamoto Musashi, Gonnosuke was not a ronin (masterless samurai) through a defeat in battle such as is claimed with Musashi in the battle of Sekigahara, but had gone out on the road on a warrior pilgrimage to improve his skills in duels and by learning from different martial arts schools on the road. This was a common tradition called musha shugyō and many samurai wishing to develop their martial abilities <b>undertook</b> <b>such</b> travels frequently. Musashi had probably been a part of the losing side in the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and had since been a ronin and undertaking his own musha shugyō.|$|E

500|$|Hoffman {{was praised}} for his {{versatility}} {{and ability to}} fully inhabit any role, but specialized in playing creeps and misfits: [...] "his CV was populated almost exclusively by snivelling wretches, insufferable prigs, braggarts and outright bullies", writes the journalist Ryan Gilbey. Hoffman was appreciated for making these roles real, complex and even sympathetic; while Todd Louiso, director of Love Liza, believed that Hoffman connected to people on screen because he looked like an ordinary man and revealed his vulnerability. Xan Brooks of The Guardian remarked that the actor's particular talent was to [...] "take thwarted, twisted humanity and ennoble it". [...] "The more pathetic or deluded the character," [...] writes Gilbey, [...] "the greater Hoffman's relish seemed in rescuing them from the realms of the merely monstrous." [...] When asked in 2006 why he <b>undertook</b> <b>such</b> roles, Hoffman responded, [...] "I didn't go out looking for negative characters; I went out looking {{for people who have}} a struggle and a fight to tackle. That's what interests me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prisoner Helmut Lichtenberg, who {{had become}} {{friendly}} with a farm family he'd worked for, arranged to slip out of camp and spend much of a weekend with them.

[...] Lichtenberg was punished with solitary confinement; the Americans were ultimately both fined $300 and lectured by the judge.

He intended to add to his thesaurus an alphabet of human thought (an organisational scheme, similar to a thesaurus or the Dewey decimal system), and an [...] "algebra of thought," [...] allowing rule-based manipulation.

2500|$|In {{the first}} stage of the Tour de France Sagan came in third. He then won the second stage, which {{featured}} a finish on a category 3 climb, to claim the yellow jersey {{for the first time in}} his career. He mentioned that he did not know he had won upon reaching the finish line, thinking more riders from the breakaway had crossed the line before him. Sagan was part of the breakaway on stage 10. He finished second to Michael Matthews and won the most combative award for his efforts. On the very next stage, Sagan broke away with yellow jersey wearer Chris Froome, Geraint Thomas and his teammate Maciej Bodnar in the final kilometers. He outsprinted Froome to foil the sprinters' plans. After the stage, asked why he <b>undertook</b> <b>such</b> a daring move, he said: [...] "We are artists". Sagan claimed his 3rd victory by winning stage 16 in Bern, beating Alexander Kristoff in a sprint by few centimetres. He finished second to Greipel on the last stage in the Champs Élysées, securing his green jersey. He also was elected [...] "most combative" [...] rider of the whole Tour.|$|E

6000|$|The editor {{must first}} have written down from recitation all the {{passages}} {{that he could}} collect. Then he was obliged to construct a narrative sequence containing a plot, which he fashioned by a process of selection and rejection; {{and then he had}} to combine passages, alter them, add as much as he thought fit, remove anachronisms, remove discrepancies, accidentally bring in fresh discrepancies (as always happens), weave transitional passages, look with an antiquarian eye after the too manifest modernisms in language and manners, and so produce the [blank space]. That, in the sixth century B.C., any man <b>undertook</b> <b>such</b> a task, and succeeded so well as to impose on Aristotle and all the later Greek critics, appears to be a theory that could only occur to a modern man of letters, who is thinking of the literary conditions of his own time.

6000|$|And now, may I {{have your}} pardon for {{pointing}} out, partly {{with reference to}} matters which are {{at this time of}} greater moment than the arts--that if we <b>undertook</b> <b>such</b> recession to the vital germ of national arts that have decayed, we should find a more singular arrest of their power in Ireland than in any other European country. For in the eighth century Ireland possessed a school of art in her manuscripts and sculpture, which, in many of its qualities--apparently in all essential qualities of decorative invention--was quite without rival; seeming as if it might have advanced to the highest triumphs in architecture and in painting. But there was one fatal flaw in its nature, by which it was stayed, and stayed with a conspicuousness of pause to which there is no parallel: so that, long ago, in tracing the progress of European schools from infancy to strength, I chose for the students of Kensington, in a lecture since published, two characteristic examples of early art, of equal skill; but in the one case, skill which was progressive--in the other, skill which was at pause. In the one case, it was work receptive of correction--hungry for correction; and in the other, work which inherently rejected correction. I chose for them a corrigible Eve, and an incorrigible Angel, and I grieve to say[236] that the incorrigible Angel was also an Irish angel! ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{prediction}} {{which the}} man of God had made in favour of the ship called Santa Cruz, gave it the new name of the [...] "Saint's Vessel;" [...] and from Malacca, from whence she departed {{at the same time}} when Xavier went on board of Antonio, her reputation was extended over all the East. Wheresoever she arrived, she was received with ceremony, and saluted by all other ships with the honour of their cannon. All merchants were desirous of stowing their goods in her, and willingly paid the carriage of their wares, and the dues of custom, beyond the common price of other vessels. The weight of lading was never considered, but her freight was always {{as much as they could}} crowd into her. As she lasted very long, and that thirty years after the decease of the Father she was in being, and was used for the traffic of the Indies, they never failed of lading her with an extraordinary cargo, all worn and worm-eaten as she was. The owners into whose hands she came, during the space of those thirty years, took only this one precaution, which was to keep her off from shore; so that when she was to be refitted, that work was constantly done upon the sea. As to what remains, it is true she met with many ill accidents and hardships: she was often engaged with pirates, and combated by tempests; but she escaped clear of all those dangers, and never any one repented of embarking in her. One time it is acknowledged, sailing from Malacca to Cochin, with an extraordinary lading, she sprung a leak, and took in so much water at the beginning of the voyage, that the passengers, who were very numerous, were of opinion to unlade her of half her burden, and half her men, and to put them upon other ships which were in their company. But those vessels, which had already their whole lading, would not consent to ease the Santa Cruz; so that, fear overpowering the ship's company, they returned speedily into the port. The whole town was surprised to see the ship so suddenly come back; and they were laughed to shame for apprehending shipwreck in the vessel of the saint. Being thus publicly upbraided with their want of faith, to mend their error, they took out nothing of the lading, but put again to sea. And what every one said to them, concerning the good fortune which perpetually attended that ship, for two-and-twenty years together, so much renewed their confidence, that they performed their voyage without farther fear. The Santa Cruz continued in this manner, sailing over all the seas, and to every port of Asia, till she came into the possession of the captain who commanded the port of Diu; who perceiving her to be half-rotten, and opened in divers parts, concluded she could serve no longer, unless she were brought into harbour, and set upon the stocks. For which purpose she was sent to Cochin, and hauled ashore on the same dock where she had been built; but she was no sooner there, than she fell in pieces of herself; nothing remaining of that great bulk, besides planks and beams of timber, unprofitable for any thing but for the fire. The inhabitants of Cochin, who knew the prediction of the saint to every circumstance, came out to behold its accomplishment. An inconsiderable merchant, called George Nugnez, who happened to be there present, began to think within himself, that, there might be yet remaining in those planks somewhat of the virtue, which the blessing of the saint had imprinted in them; and thereupon took one of them, which he caused to be nailed to his own frigate, out of the persuasion he had, that with this assistance he should be secure from shipwreck. Thus being filled with a lively faith, he boldly <b>undertook</b> <b>such</b> long and hazardous voyages, that ships of the greatest burden were afraid to make; and without consideration of the weather, adventured many times to cross the most tempestuous gulphs. When he was told, that it was not the part of a prudent man to endanger himself in that manner, he answered, [...] "That the winds and seas were well acquainted with his frigate, and had a reverence for the plank of the Santa Cruz." [...] In effect, his little vessel was ever fortunate enough to escape the greatest perils; and what was most remarkable, was, that having had the same destiny with the ship in her adventures and deliverances, she ended like her, breaking in pieces of herself, on the shore of Coulan, where she was brought to be refitted.|$|E
