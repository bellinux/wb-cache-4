40|$|The basic {{strategy}} of Russian nuclear energy is propagation of a closed fuel cycle {{on the basis}} of fast breeder and thermal reactors, as well as the solution of the spent nuclear fuel accumulation and resource problems. The three variants of multiple Pu and <b>U</b> <b>recycling</b> in Russian pressurized water reactor concept reactors {{on the basis of}} REgenerated MIXture of U, Pu oxides (REMIX) reprocessing technology are considered in this work. The REMIX fuel is fabricated from an unseparated mixture of uranium and plutonium obtained during spent fuel reprocessing with further makeup by enriched natural U or reactor grade Pu. This makes it possible to recycle several times the total amount of Pu obtained from the spent fuel. The main difference in Pu recycling is the concept of 100 % or partial fuel loading of the core. The third variant is heterogeneous composition of enriched uranium and uranium–plutonium mixed oxide fuel pins in one fuel assembly. It should be noted that all fuel assemblies with Pu require the involvement of expensive technologies during manufacturing. These three variants of the full core loadings can be balanced on zero Pu accumulation in the cycle. The various physical and economical aspects of Pu and U multiple recycling in selected variants are observed in the given work...|$|E
40|$|The macrophytes {{have the}} ability accumulating {{multiple}} metals/metalloids species from the terrestrial and aquatic environments. The environmental-friendly phytoremediation technologies via these plant species have been applied for non-degradable pollutants removal. The macrophytes derived rhizofiltration is a major and efficient technology for metals/metalloids removal, especially in aquatic environments (e. g. wetland). Comparing with the common metals/metalloids often studied, aquatic U rhizofiltration via macrophytes has been just considered recently. In this study, the field investigation in a U tailing basin wetland showed that the rhizofiltration was crucial for aquatic U retention via Phragmites australis Trin ex Steud. (water to root bioconcentration factor (BCF) : 670 to 1556). The aquatic U retention efficiency in aboveground biomass of P. australis was insufficient (BCF: 0. 4 to 5. 3), comparing with the rhizofiltration. However, the high productivity (1. 2 to 1. 9 kg•m- 2 per growing season) of P. australis still resulted in a notable yearly U accumulation in the areal total aboveground biomass (0. 04 to 0. 35 mg•m- 2 per growing season). It was potentially promoted by the enhanced aquatic U rhizofiltration. The U within aboveground biomass could be released to submerse soil with the degradable or recalcitrant fallen litters. It enhanced the organic carbon supply in rhizosphere together with the root litter, and potential water to root U translocation within mobilized organic compounds. Hence the rhizofiltration stood in the crucial position of the plant-litter-water-soil <b>U</b> <b>recycling</b> in aquatic environment. The results from field investigation and mesocosm experiment further suggested that the Fe plaque (IP) on root surface was crucial for aquatic U rhizofiltration. The IP contained most of root retained U in both environments (proportion of U within IP: 55. 8 to 82. 6 % in field and 66. 7 to 86. 0 % in mesocosm). However, the efficiency of IP assisted aquatic U rhizofiltration was affected by the redox state gradient (- 179 to 220 mV) related redox processes. Field investigation suggested that high content of dissolved oxygen (up to 8. 2 mg•l- 1) was capable to rapidly oxidize soluble Fe(II) as sparingly soluble Fe(III) oxides precipitated in subhydric soil. It consequently limited the aquatic Fe availability for root uptake and precipitation as IP. However, the strong oxidation ability also relatively increased aquatic U(VI) availability incorporated with inorganics and degradable organic matters. It was adverse for controlling the aquatic U concentration (66. 7 to 92. 0 μg•l- 1 in field). On the other hand, it also benefited the U uptake by inner root tissue and upward translocation to aboveground biomass of P. australis. The different inorganic N species also significantly influenced IP assisted aquatic U rhizofiltration. The aquatic NH 4 + sustained the reduction and acidification (via nitirification) potential for Fe(III) and U(VI) bioreduction in rhizosphere (- 87 to 21 mV in NH 4 + cultured mesocosm pots). It improved the root uptake (mainly within IP) of Fe and U (2992. 9 to 5010. 7 mg•kg- 1 Fe and 45. 7 to 62. 8 mg•kg- 1 U in NH 4 + cultured root). On the contrary, the NO 3 - depended strong oxidation ability (23 to 224 mV in NO 3 - cultured mesocosm pots) inhibited the IP formation and the related aquatic U rhizofiltration efficiency (1568. 5 to 2569. 5 mg•kg- 1 Fe and 26. 2 to 49. 6 mg•kg- 1 U in NO 3 - cultured root). The aquatic U availability in rhizosphere was also increased via NO 3 - depended oxidation processes (aquatic U concentration in mesocosm: 1. 6 to 589. 3 μg•L- 1 (NO 3 -) vs. 1. 4 to 58. 2 μg•L- 1 (NH 4 +)). The sufficient nitrogen supply is also a significant driving force for high biomass productivity of P. australis. The higher biomass of P. australis increased the U accumulation capacity for root and aboveground tissues. The nitrogen related high biomass accumulation of P. australis also potentially enhanced the share of organic bound U in subhydric soil via plant litters supply. The IP assisted aquatic U rhizofiltration was also affected by the co-existing metals/metalloids in rhizosphere. The field investigation indicated that high As availability (aquatic As/U ratio: 0. 7 to 1. 6) inhibited the U retention within IP through the competitive absorption, due to its high affinity to IP. The Ca improved the aquatic U(VI) availability by forming the soluble Ca-uranyl-carbonate compounds. The Ca also potentially competed with hydrated Fe(III) oxides within IP by incorporating with U and encourage the U retention within inner root tissue. The P was beneficial for U retention within IP possibly in form of U-Fe-phosphate complexes. However, it was {{still need to be}} proofed in further studies. Despite of the biogeochemical conditions in rhizosphere, the aboveground transpiration of P. australis also affected the IP formation and related aquatic U rhizofiltration. The higher transpiration rate (TR) of P. australis (3. 3 ± 1. 2 mm•d- 1 in field, 4. 5 ± 2. 0 mm•d- 1 (NH 4 +) / 5. 0 ± 2. 2 mm•d- 1 (NO 3 -) in mesocosm) increased the aquatic nutrient/non-essential elements availability for root uptake. For this reason, the aquatic U rhizofiltration of P. australis (21. 8 ± 3. 1 mg•kg- 1 in field, 62. 1 ± 1. 0 mg•kg- 1 (NH 4 +) / 47. 6 ± 1. 8 mg•kg- 1 (NO 3 -) in mesocosm) was enhanced under higher TR. The higher TR also promoted the formation of IP and its U retention capacity. Furthermore, the U translocation from root to above ground biomass (mainly in leaves) of P. australis was also enhanced under higher TR. It was potentially benefited by the increased transpirational pull and root uptake of other active mediator (e. g. Ca). The effect of transpiration was also coupled with the different N species on IP assisted aquatic U rhizofiltration. The higher TR depended strong root uptake and assimilation of N increased the biomass accumulation of P. australis. Furthermore, the higher TR also potentially increased the share of root in biomass partition of P. australis. Consequently, the stronger transpiration resulted in the higher aquatic U accumulation in area related root biomass (up to 84. 0 ± 3. 6 mg•m- 2 (NH 4 +) and 86. 4 ± 5. 8 mg•m- 2 (NO 3 -) U per season in mesocosm). In conclusion, it was possible for eutrophic P. australis stands to retain the aquatic U via rhizofiltration. The IP on root surface was a crucial mediator contributing the aquatic U rhizofiltration, especially in iron rich milieu. The efficiency of IP assisted aquatic U rhizofiltration could be further improved under suitable environmental conditions. In this study, these conditions might include: i) reductive rhizosphere environment with active reducers (e. g. NH 4 +) encouraging Fe(II) generation for IP formation and U retention within it; ii) limited competitive elements (e. g. As and Ca) co-existed with Fe and U in rhizosphere; iii) sufficient nutrients (e. g. N) supply and related high biomass productivity of plant; iv) strong transpiration effect improved the nutrient assimilation of root and also the aquatic U/Fe availability for root uptake. By adjusting these conditions (also include other potential factors not discussed in this study), an effective rhizofiltration technology was supposed to be applied for aquatic U removal...|$|E

40|$|Disposal or {{recycling}} of electronics can have significant {{human health and}} environmental impacts. Electronics can contain lead, brominated flame retardants, cadmium, mercury, arsenic and {{a wide range of}} other metals and chemical compounds. The recycling rate is, at best, about 18 %, and most electronics collected in the <b>U.</b> S. for <b>recycling</b> have been sent to other countries for processing (US EPA 2008). In a 2008 report, the GAO found that a substantial fraction of these end up in countries where disposal practices are unsafe to workers and dangerous to the environment.

A solid waste generation study compared the daily per capita solid waste generated over one week by 25 Indian households, 15 Adult non-Indian households and 15 Family- Adult non-Indian households on the district. An analysis of variance showed that the differences in daily per capita solid waste generation among the three groups were not statistically significant at the. 05 level, and a t-test showed that differences between the Indian residents and the non-Indian residents considered as one group were not statistically significant at the. 05 level. The overall daily per capita solid waste generated by all groups, 1. 71 lbs/day, was {{less than half of the}} national average of 3. 5 lbs/day. The Adult non-Indian households had the highest daily per capita solid waste generation (1. 96 lbs), while the Indian and the Family-Adult non-Indian households generated a similar amount of solid waste daily per person (1. 67 and 1. 64 lbs respectively). Four alternative solid waste management proposals were developed: (1) a tribal-operated solid waste management and disposal service serving all residents and most organizations on the San Xavier district and trucking solid wastes off the reservation; (2) the same as Alternative One except that disposal would be in an 8. 24 acre landfill to be constructed by the tribe on the district; (3) contracting waste pickup and disposal to an outside waste management company; and (4) the same as Alternative One except that commercial organizations on the district would not be served.

A study of the literature showed a range of values. These appeared to be modified by method of assessment, by type of sludge, and by its metal content. An incubation study of soil-sludge mixtures showed that changes occurred in the values for solubility of phosphorus in 0. 5 M sodium bicarbonate. A study of six crops and three soils indicated that the most suitable crop to indicate availability of phosphorus in sludge was spinach (Spinacea oleracea cv.) with ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv.) as the next best. Soil of any texture was suitable provided the initial bicarbonate solubility of phosphorus in the soil was less than 10 mg P kg- 1.

At its core are five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes, the U 1, U 2, U 4, U 5 and U 6 snRNPs, which undergo dynamic rearrangements during splicing. Their reutilization for subsequent rounds of splicing requires reversion to their original configurations, but {{little is known about}} this process. Here, we show that ZK 863. 4 /USIP- 1 (U Six snRNA-Interacting Protein- 1) is a ribonucleotidyl transferase that promotes accumulation of the Caenorhabditis elegans U 6 snRNA.

40|$|Splicing plays a {{major role}} in {{eukaryotic}} gene expression by processing pre-mRNA to form mature mRNA. Pre-mRNAs undergo splicing to remove introns, non–protein coding regions, and religate exons, protein coding regions. This process is catalyzed by the spliceosome, which consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs: U 1, U 2, U 4, U 5 and U 6) and numerous protein factors. Proper assembly of spliceosomal components is critical for function, and thus, defects in assembly can be lethal. Several spliceosomal proteins facilitate structural rearrangements important for spliceosomal assembly and function. Prp 24 is an essential factor in U 6 snRNP assembly, and it has been proposed to assist in U 4 /U 6 formation and unwinding. Here, we address the question whether Prp 24 affects the U 2 /U 6 complex dynamics. Using single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET), we have previously shown that a minimal U 2 /U 6 complex from yeast can adopt at least three distinct conformations in dynamic equilibrium. Our new single molecule data show that Prp 24 unwinds U 2 from U 2 /U 6 complex and stabilizes U 6 in a low FRET conformation. We also show that the RNA Recognition Motifs of Prp 24 affect the binding affinity of Prp 24 for U 6 and unwinding activity.

40|$|Comparing {{different}} {{nuclear fuel}} cycles and assessing their implications require a fuel cycle simulation model as complete and realistic as possible. In this thesis, methodological implications of modeling choices {{are discussed in}} connection with development of the MIT fuel cycle simulation code CAFCA. The CAFCA code is meant to find the recycling facilities deployment rate that minimizes the time by which spent fuel in storage today is used up in order {{to lead to a}} nuclear fuel cycle with minimum inventory of transuranic elements. The deployment is constrained by the recycling plants construction capacity and also by the economic requirement that the recycling plants loading factor never drops below a certain level. First, through a simplified fuel cycle model, it is analytically proven that an optimum solution is to build recycling plants at full speed up to a certain point in time b, then to suspend construction until interim storage gets completely depleted. The shape of the optimum solution, parameterized by b, is injected into an algorithm based on a complete model of the fuel cycle. An iterative process yields the value of b assuring depletion and satisfactory loading factors. Besides providing rigorous optimization,this analytical solution underpinning the CAFCA algorithm is expected to reduce considerably the vulnerability of the results to numerical discontinuities. Degradation of fuel quality with time in interim storage occurs due to the decay of Pu 241 into Am 241. While an obvious approach to track such effects is to couple the fuel cycle code with a neutronics/decay code (ORIGEN for example), it is more efficient to derive explicit equations from a simplified irradiation and decay model, allowing for analytical tracking of the fuel composition. (cont.) All fuel cycle simulation refinements do not present the same level of importance. One should focus on the dominant parameters as those contributing the most to overall results sensitivity. A novel <b>U.</b> S. thermal <b>recycling</b> scenario called CONFU is taken as a reference case. The CONFU technology is introduced 15 years from now, with an industrial capacity allowing the construction of one 1000 MT/year spent fuel separation plant every two years. Discharged CONFU batches remain in cooling storage for 6 years. Reactors have a 60 years lifetime and economic ecovery period of 20 years, and are half financed by equity with a rate of return of 15 %. It is found that the cost of electricity is most sensitive to the reactors lifetime, since taking it back to its initial nominal value of 40 years would result in a 44 % increase in the cost of electricity. Next in importance is the financing structure of the fleet. The addition of three points to the rate of return on equity would increase the cost of electricity by 14 %. While scale effects are locally very beneficial in that they substantially reduce recycling plants operation costs, they prove to be of limited interest from an overall fuel cycle point of view. Using the scale effect model in CAFCA-II, doubling the separation plants capacity yields a 3 % reduction of the cost of electricity. The fuel cycle presents good robustness with respect to fuel decay time degradation. Increasing CONFU batches cooling time to 18 years causes a 2 % increase in the cost of electricity. by Nicéphore Bonnet. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{reduction}} of transuranic inventories of {{spent nuclear fuel}} depends upon the deployment of advanced fuels that can be loaded with recycled transuranics (TRU), {{and the availability of}} facilities to separate and reprocess spent fuel. Three recycling strategies are explored in this study: (1) Recycling in thermal Light Water Reactors (LWR) using CONFU technology (COmbined Non-Fertile and UO[subscript 2] fuel), (2) recycling of TRU in fertile-free fast cores of Actinide Burner Reactors (ABR), and (3) recycling of TRU with UO[subscript 2] in self-sustaining Gas-cooled Fast Reactors (GFR). Choosing one strategy over another involves trade-offs. The CONFU, ABR, and GFR strategies differ from each other in terms of T RU loading in the reactor, net TRU incineration, capacities of recycling facilities needed, date for technology option availability, and flexibility. The CONFU and GFR are assumed to achieve zero net TRU incineration, while the ABR is a net consumer of TRU. The TRU loading is greatest in GFR and lowest in CONFU. While both CONFU and ABR require separation (of TRU from <b>U)</b> and reprocessing (<b>recycling</b> of TRUs from fertile-free fuel), the GFR is designed to, in equilibrium, recycle TRU+U after extraction of the fission products. It is assumed that thermal recycling is available in the short-term (2015), as opposed to recycling in fast reactors (2040). Finally, thermal recycling is the most flexible as either CONFU batches or regular LWR uranium batches can be loaded; the issue of running out of TRU fuel is therefore irrelevant for this option. A fuel cycle simulation tool, CAFCA II (Code for Advanced Fuel Cycles Assessment) has been developed. The CAFCA II code tracks the mass distribution of TRU in the system and the cost of all operations. The code includes a specific model for deployment of recycling plants, with certain capacities and investment requirements. These facilities may operate with a minimum target capacity factor during the lifetime of the plant. The deployment of these facilities is also constrained by a user-specified ability to add recycling capacity within a given time interval. Finally, the CAFCA II code includes a specific model for recycling prices which reflects the economies of scale that go with increases in the nominal capacity of recycling plants. Two case studies are presented. The first explores the optimal fuel cycle and recycling plant capacities {{as a function of the}} deployment of advanced fuel cycle technologies over the next hundred years, under the assumption of the US demand for nuclear energy growing at a 2. 4 % annual rate. Key figures for comparison of the strategies are evaluated, including {{reduction of}} TRU interim storage requirements, maximization of TRU incineration, minimization of the size of the fleets of recycling plants and fast reactors, fuel cycle cost, and capital cost requirements. We found that it is not possible to minimize the construction rate of advanced reactors and advanced spent fuel recycling facilities simultaneously with the construction rate of separation facilities for UO[subscript 2] spent fuel. The latter was found to be more constraining than the former. Further, we found that reactor technologies with zero net TRU destruction rate can achieve total depletion of TRU inventories in spent fuel interim storage at a lower fuel cycle cost and with fewer recycling facilities than reactor technologies that incinerate TRU. However, the lower fuel cycle cost is achieved at the expense of a smaller reduction of total TRU inventories. Finally, if the construction rate of advanced nuclear technologies is large enough, the later introduction date of fast recycling schemes compared to thermal recycling schemes does not prevent the reduction of TRU inventories in interim storage by 2100. Recently, the potential benefits of multi-lateral approaches to the management of nuclear fuel have been widely discussed. These include cost attractiveness following from economies of scale, proliferation resistance, and more efficient nuclear waste treatment strategies. CAFCA II has been developed to quantify these implications for the back-end of the fuel cycle. Three partnership scenarios have been examined: first, a scenario where the “Fuel leasing/fuel take-back” concept is implemented; second, a scenario with “Limited Collaboration” at the back-end fuel cycle, where spent fuel recycling and advanced fuel fabrication are externalized in countries that have these technologies; and third, a scenario of “Full Collaboration”, under which two regions fully collaborate at the fuel cycle back-end: spent fuel inventories and advanced fuel cycle facilities are co-owned and co-managed. The second case study concentrates on optimizing the choice of (1) fuel cycle option, (2) recycling plant capacities, and (3) partnership scenario by analyzing the implications of these choices for the LWR-CONFU, LWR/ABR, and LWR/GFR strategies. The nuclear fuel cycle is simulated in a two-region context from 2005 to 2100 under the assumption that one region represents the US growing at a 2. 4 % annual rate and the other region represents Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico growing at a 7. 4 % annual rate until 2080, and 2. 4 % afterwards. Under this scenario, we found that a US partnership with a region representing Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia could be advantageous to the reduction of TRU storage in both regions if the construction rate of UO[subscript 2] spent fuel separation plants would be larger than one 1, 000 MT/yr plant every two years after 2050. From the point of view of the spent fuel recycling industry, use of the largest recycling plants with the lowest construction cost per unit of installed capacity becomes optimal only with multi-national approaches to the fuel cycle back-end.

We found that it is not possible to minimize simultaneously (1) the construction rate of advanced reactors and advanced spent fuel recycling facilities, and (2) the construction rate of U 02 spent fuel separation facilities. The latter was found to be more constraining than the first for purposes of TRU inventories reduction. We found also that reactor technologies with zero net TRU destruction rate can achieve total depletion of TRU inventories is spent fuel interim storage at a lower fuel cycle cost and with fewer recycling facilities than reactor technologies that incinerate TRU; the lower fuel cycle cost is achieved at the expense of a lesser reduction of total TRU inventories. (cont.) Finally, we found that, if the construction rate of advanced nuclear technologies is large enough, the later introduction date of fast recycling schemes compared to thermal recycling schemes is not discriminatory, with regards to the reduction of TRU inventories in interim storage by 2100. The potential of multi-lateral approaches to the nuclear fuel cycle has recently been widely acknowledged. Cited benefits include cost attractiveness following from economies of scale, proliferation resistance and collaborative and more efficient nuclear waste treatment strategy. CAFCA II has been developed to quantify these trade implications for the back-end of the fuel cycle Three bi-lateral scenarios of partnerships have been examined between two regions: first a scenario where the "Fuel-leasing/fuel take-back" concept is implemented, second a scenario with "Limited Collaboration" at the back-end fuel cycle, where spent fuel recycling and advanced fuel fabrication are externalized in countries that have these technologies, and third a scenario of "Full Collaboration", under which two regions fully collaborate at the fuel cycle back-end: spent fuel inventories and advanced fuel cycle facilities are co-owned and comanaged. Our second case-study concentrates on optimizing the choice of (1) fuel cycle option, (2) spent fuel recycling plant capacities, and (3) partnership scenario by analyzing the implications of these choices for the LWR-CONFU, LWR/ABR, and LWR/GFR strategies. The nuclear fuel cycle is simulated in a two-region context from 2005 to 2100 under the assumption that one region represents the US growing at a 2. 4 % annual rate and the other region represents Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico growing at a 7. 4 % annual rate until 2080, and at 2. 4 % afterwards. (cont.) We found that a US partnership with Brazil, Mexico, and Indonesia, could be advantageous to the reduction of TRU storage in both regions if the construction rate of UO 2 spent fuel separation plants would be larger than one 1, 000 MT/yr plant every two years after 2050. We found also that, from the point of view of the spent fuel recycling industry, use of largest recycling plants with the lowest construction cost per unit of installed capacity becomes optimal only with multi-national approaches to the fuel cycle back-end. by Alexandre Aquien.
