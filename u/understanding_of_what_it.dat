25|$|The de Ménils, however, did {{not limit}} their {{acquisitions}} to modern art, and their eclectic tastes became {{a hallmark of}} their collecting practices. As modernists, they recognized the profound formal and spiritual connections between contemporary works {{of art and the}} arts of ancient and indigenous cultures, broadening their collection to include works from classical Mediterranean and Byzantine cultures, as well as objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Pacific Northwest. Influenced by the teachings of Father Couturier and Father Congar, the de Menils developed a particular humanist ethos in which they understood art as a central part of the human experience. Their collection was motivated by their shared interest in the many ways individuals over different cultures and eras reveal through art their <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be human.|$|E
25|$|Russian historians {{tended to}} focus on the French {{invasion}} of Russia in 1812 and ignore the campaigns in 1813–1814 fought in Germany and France because a campaign fought on Russian soil was regarded as more important than campaigns abroad and because in 1812 the Russians were commanded by the ethnic Russian Kutuzov while in the campaigns in 1813–1814 the senior Russian commanders were mostly ethnic Germans, being either Baltic German nobility or Germans who had entered Russian service. At the time the conception held by the Russian elite was that the Russian empire was a multi-ethnic entity, in which the Baltic German aristocrats in service to the House of Romanov were considered part of that elite-an <b>understanding</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> meant to be Russian defined in terms of dynastic loyalty rather than language, ethnicity and culture that does not appeal to those later Russians who wanted to see the war as a purely a triumph of ethnic Russians.|$|E

2500|$|Stanford University {{professor}} Shelley Correll {{and colleagues}} (2007) sent {{out more than}} 1,200 fictitious résumés to employers in a large Northeastern city, and found that female applicants with children were {{significantly less likely to}} get hired and if hired would be paid a lower salary than male applicants with children. This {{despite the fact that the}} qualification, workplace performances and other relevant characteristics of the fictitious job applicants were held constant and only their parental status varied. Mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including perceived competence and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, being a parent. In a subsequent audit study, Correll et al. found that actual employers discriminate against mothers when making evaluations that affect hiring, promotion, and salary decisions, but not against fathers. The researchers review results from other studies and argue that the motherhood role exists in tension with the cultural <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> the [...] "ideal worker" [...] role and this leads evaluators to expect mothers to be less competent and less committed to their job. Fathers do not experience these types of workplace disadvantages as <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be a good father are not seen as incompatible with <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to be a good worker.|$|R

And now that period of standing humbly in the shadows before the shrine was over, and the Goddess, her veil of mystery flung aside, had come down to him and taken hold of him, a good, strong, firm hold, and walked by his side.... She liked him. What was singular was that very soon she had kissed him thrice, whimsically upon the brow, {{and he had never}} kissed her at all. He could not analyse his feelings, only he knew the world was wonderfully changed about them, but the truth was that, though he still worshipped and feared her, though his pride in his engagement was ridiculously vast, he loved her now no more. That subtle something woven of the most delicate strands of self-love and tenderness and desire, had vanished imperceptibly; and was gone now for ever. But that she did not suspect in him, nor {{as a matter of fact}} did he.|$|E

Next, the activities the students took part in are discussed, along with their reactions to these activities as outlined in the course evaluation and follow-up questionnaire. Next, evidence of their learning, as presented by the students themselves in their final paper is discussed. Finally, directions for similar courses in future are explored. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to report the results of a study which explored how {{a group of}} 11 preservice secondary mathematics teachers developed their <b>understandings</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> means to teach for understanding. This investigation is set in the context of the secondary mathematics education methods course 1 and practicum teaching experience which all 11 participants were undertaking. The paper begins with a discussion of the theoretical framework underpinning the course and its goals. Then some background to the study is provided. Next, the design and methodology of the study which is the subject of this paper is presented, followed by the results of the study.

But it is better understood as something internal: the ways poor people are integrated into the wider society define forms and experiences of marginality. In urban Ethiopia, marginality is a historical outcome, contingent on the ways that decades of integration policies have codified poor people's membership in society through an enduring politics of limited entitlements. Such inclusion can marginalize, and dissecting what poor people are included in is key to imagining new grounds for progressive politics.
