5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive in the water where they live their entire lives. In some species, the young are quite large: <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their eggs on land.|$|E

5|$|A local landmark, the Fremont Troll—a large cement {{sculpture}} of a troll clutching a real-life Volkswagen Beetle—was installed under the bridge's north end in 1990. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the $40,000 cost for the artwork was donated from Seattle's Neighborhood Matching Fund, a local program {{to raise money for}} community projects. The sculpture was heavily vandalized in the year following its construction and large floodlights were installed on the bridge to discourage further damage.|$|E
5|$|Among other pursuits, amateur dramatics {{flourish}} (even though Brasenose was an all-male college). Overall, {{the intake}} and careers of undergraduates remained {{dominated by the}} Church (<b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half),</b> drawn {{from a range of}} backgrounds. The college remained largely independent of the large public schools. Brasenose's academic record remained solid, if unremarkable; its strengths lay in classics, although one of its most prominent academics– Arthur Evans– studied modern history.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are visible to the unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E

5|$|By the 2000s most of Oliver's output {{constituted}} commissioned pieces, whether {{public or}} private. The most substantial {{of these is}} Vine, a 16.5metre high sculpture installed {{as part of the}} $400 million refurbishment of the Sydney Hilton. Taking twelve months to create and requiring a budget of <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> million dollars, the work was completed in 2005. The sculpture was fabricated from 380 kilograms of aluminium, and assembled by a team of eight Croatian welders.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds {{used to make a}} herbal tea. The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans can gather them en masse. <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E
5|$|The 1915 Singapore Mutiny, {{also known}} as the 1915 Sepoy Mutiny or the Mutiny of the 5th Light Infantry, was a mutiny {{involving}} <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of a regiment of 850sepoys (Indian soldiers) against the British in Singapore during the First World War, linked with the 1915 Ghadar Conspiracy. The mutiny, on 15 February 1915, lasted nearly seven days. It resulted in the deaths of eight British officers and soldiers, two Malay officers and one soldier, 14 British civilians, five Chinese and Malay civilians and one German internee before it was finally quelled by British forces and Allied naval detachments.|$|E

The views from the top included the Liverpool skyline, the River Mersey estuary and the River Dee. On a clear day visitors could see across the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man, along with views of the Lake District and Welsh Mountains. In its first year the tower attracted <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> a million visitors to the top. At night the tower was illuminated by fairy lights.|$|E
5|$|When Falun Gong {{was banned}} in {{mainland}} China in 1999, re-education through labor became a common punishment for practitioners. Some {{human rights groups}} claim {{that as many as}} 10,000 Falun Gong members were detained in between 1999 and 2002, with as many as 5,000 detained in 2001 alone. More recent estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of Falun Gong adherents are imprisoned in China, with some sources estimating <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the official reeducation through labor camp population is Falun Gong practitioners. In some labor camps, Falun Gong practitioners make up the majority population.|$|E
5|$|When on the beach, most of {{them get}} stuck. Those that have {{remained}} too far in the water are dragged onto the beach by putting a hook in their blowhole. When on land, they are killed by cutting down to the major arteries and spinal cord at the neck. The {{time it takes for}} a whale to die varies from a few seconds <b>Up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> a minute, depending on the cut. If the locals fail to beach the animals altogether, they are let free again.|$|E

5|$|Bacteria often {{attach to}} {{surfaces}} and form dense aggregations called biofilms, and larger formations known as microbial mats. These biofilms and mats {{can range from}} a few micrometres in thickness to <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> a metre in depth, and may contain multiple species of bacteria, protists and archaea. Bacteria living in biofilms display a complex arrangement of cells and extracellular components, forming secondary structures, such as microcolonies, through which there are networks of channels to enable better diffusion of nutrients. In natural environments, such as soil or the surfaces of plants, the majority of bacteria are bound to surfaces in biofilms. Biofilms are also important in medicine, as these structures are often present during chronic bacterial infections or in infections of implanted medical devices, and bacteria protected within biofilms are much harder to kill than individual isolated bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Binary stars form a {{significant}} portion of the total population of stellar systems, with <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of all stars occurring in binary systems. Numerical simulations of globular clusters have demonstrated that binaries can hinder and even reverse the process of core collapse in globular clusters. When a star in a cluster has a gravitational encounter with a binary system, a possible result is that the binary becomes more tightly bound and kinetic energy is added to the solitary star. When the massive stars in the cluster are sped up by this process, it reduces the contraction at the core and limits core collapse.|$|E
5|$|Delhi's {{municipal}} water supply is {{managed by the}} Delhi Jal Board (DJB). , it supplied 650million gallons per day (MGD), whereas the estimated consumption requirement is 963MGD. The shortfall is met by private and public tube wells and hand pumps. At 240MGD, the Bhakra storage is DJB's largest water source, followed by the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. Delhi's groundwater level is falling and its population density is increasing, so residents often encounter acute water shortage. Research on Delhi suggests that <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of the city's water use is unofficial groundwater.In Delhi, daily domestic solid waste production is 8000tonnes which is dumped at three landfill locations by MCD. The daily domestic waste water production is 470MGD and industrial waste water is 70MGD. A {{large portion of the}} sewage flows untreated into the Yamuna river.|$|E

5|$|During the 14th century, the Plantagenets and the House of Valois both {{claimed to}} be {{legitimate}} claimants to the House of Capet and with it France; the two powers clashed in the Hundred Years' War. The Black Death epidemic hit England; starting in 1348, it eventually killed <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> of England's inhabitants. From 1453 to 1487 civil war occurred between two branches of the royal family—the Yorkists and Lancastrians—known as the Wars of the Roses. Eventually {{it led to the}} Yorkists losing the throne entirely to a Welsh noble family the Tudors, a branch of the Lancastrians headed by Henry Tudor who invaded with Welsh and Breton mercenaries, gaining victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field where the Yorkist king Richard III was killed.|$|E
5|$|Globe Town was {{established}} from 1800 {{to provide for}} the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green, attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, with 20,000 looms being operated in people's own homes. By 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> these looms had become idle, and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>half</b> {{of those who did}} recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
