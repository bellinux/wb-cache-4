Moreover, children from age 11 upwards demonstrated improved academic achievement, particularly when there were other government-sponsored area-based initiatives operating locally. While infant health did not improve, reductions in emergency hospitalisations of young children aged 0 to 3 for severe injury and for lower respiratory infection indicated that families in SSLP areas may have been accessing routine health care, at local doctors’ offices or child health clinics, supported possibly by more ‘joined-up’ working between health and social services. It appeared that health screening of young children was enhanced over five years in SSLP areas, and children identified with special educational needs or eligible for benefits related to disability increased significantly.|$|R

During seventh period of the same day, Buessink's suspension was increased from 5 to 10 days. Because of the school's <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence</b> policy, and in conjunction with Beussink's previous 8.5 days of unexcused absences, his 10-day suspension resulted in his grades being dropped by 8.5 grade levels.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{economic}} evaluation {{of an important}} UK government education policy, the Excellence in Cities (EiC) programme aimed at alleviating poor student achievement in inner city areas. The analysis compares educational attainment in Maths and English for Year 9 (age 14) students before and after EiC introduction in EiC schools as compared to non-EiC schools. Schoollevel absences in treatment and control schools are also compared. The results show that a positive, but very small, improvement in pupil attainment took place in EiC schools versus comparison schools. There is some variation around this, such that the EiC impact is higher for pupils {{at the lower end}} of the attainment distribution. The programme has also seemed to benefit boys more than girls and has had a larger impact in schools where expenditure per pupil is higher. With regard to absences, the programme has significantly reduced authorised absences but has had no discernible effect on <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absences.</b> We interpret the findings as showing EiC to have had more of an impact at the bottom end of the education distribution...|$|R

A priori predictions were that smoking at {{entry into the}} Navy would be related to early attrition, poorer job performance, more disciplinary problems and lower likelihood of re-enlistment. Methods: A prospective cohort analysis of 5487 women entering the US Navy between March 1996 and March 1997 was conducted. Navy attrition/retention and career performance measures, such as time in service, early attrition, type of discharge, misconduct, number of promotions, demotions and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absences,</b> highest paygrade achieved, and re-enlistment were examined. Results: Compared with never smokers, daily smokers at entry into the US Navy had subsequent career outcomes consistently indicating poorer job performance (eg, early attrition prior to serving a full-term enlistment, {{more likely to have}} a less-than-honourable discharge, more demotions and desertions, lower achieved paygrade and less likely to re-enlist). Other types of smokers consistently fell between never and daily smokers on career outcome measures. Conclusions: For women entering the US Navy, being a daily smoker is a prospective predictor of poorer performance in the Navy.

40|$|Regular {{attendance}} at school provides children {{with opportunities to}} develop the basic skills for learning, and assists {{in the development of}} social skills including communication, self-esteem, teamwork and friendship building. Attendance is a precursor for learning and onward skill development. Understanding how patterns of attendance are established {{in the early years of}} school and the nature of the relationship between attendance and achievement, can help maximise learning opportunities for all students. We used data from the WA Department of Education on school enrolment, attendance and NAPLAN (literacy and numeracy) achievement from 2008 to 2012 to assess the attendance patterns of over 415, 000 primary and secondary students across the 5 -year period. We also examined how these patterns vary for students with different characteristics. We examined the extent to which authorised and <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absences</b> from school related to NAPLAN achievement after controlling for a range of factors. We investigated how absence rates in previous years relate to current achievement levels and whether there is a "safe" threshold of absence where students could catch up on missed schooling without affecting their overall achievement.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore views of the {{township}} high school principals regarding their approaches to teacher absenteeism management, with the objective of formulating an integrated strategic management model, which can be used to manage teacher absenteeism. To realise this goal, the following actions were undertaken: A literature study was conducted to uncover the absenteeism curbing strategies that will assist the school principals to deal with teacher absenteeism. A literature study was also conducted to determine the scope and the nature of teacher absenteeism as well as the legal framework that governs the management of absenteeism. A documental analysis of the policies, as provided by the Department of Education, was conducted to determine exactly what they entail regarding absenteeism management. The forces driving absenteeism and the variables involved in those forces, as well as elements making up those variables were identified and their influences were investigated. Hence, a theoretical framework consisting of these causal variables was developed to focus on the management of teacher absenteeism. As a result of this theoretical framework, an instrument in the form of a questionnaire was designed to determine the principals’ approach to teacher absenteeism as well as their consistency with the model. The survey was conducted in the township high schools in the Port Elizabeth District of Education. The findings from the empirical research indicated a strong agreement amongst the respondents, with the prevalence of <b>unauthorised</b> teacher <b>absences,</b> factors influencing absenteeism, teacher absenteeism management strategies as well as compliance with the teacher absenteeism management programme/plan...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of school improvement programmes {{has been investigated}} primarily {{with a focus on}} children’s academic attainments. Research on school improvement programmes acknowledges the importance of stakeholder inclusion in organisational change. The views and experience of school personnel were sought in order to triangulate this information with improvement indicators of school performance. The Solution Oriented Schools (SOS) Programme is a strengths-based school improvement programme which builds on school capacity and inclusive practices. The outcomes of the SOS Programme’s improvement criteria were monitored in 26 schools over one year using a mixed methodology design. Data on improvement indicators such as pupil and staff attendance, fixed-term exclusions and staff turnover was used. Average rates before and after SOS implementation were compared to identify and investigate any improvement in these indicators in line with SOS programme claims. Using a Friedman test, decreases in fixed-term exclusion reached significance. (p< 0. 001). The rate of authorised pupil absences, staff absences and turnover decreased but not significantly and <b>unauthorised</b> pupil <b>absences</b> significantly increased (p< 0. 05). The self-esteem of 316 pupils aged between 4 and 11 was measured using the LAWSEQ scale before and after SOS programme implementation and a significant increase was found (p< 0. 001). Staff self-esteem, measured using the Rosenberg scale also increased significantly (p< 0. 05) and provided a significant indicator of Programme sustainability (p< 0. 05). IV Thematic analysis of seventeen interviews undertaken with staff led to a proposed model of school improvement. This model demonstrated that the extent of the {{effectiveness of}} school improvement programmes rested on the preparation of staff in terms of capacity, perceptions of change and stability of the school before implementation of the programme. Goal Attainment Scales were significantly correlated with fidelity of Programme participation (p< 0. 05). The SOS Programme was useful in enabling schools to achieve these goals. Feedback on the process of change necessary for the success of the SOS programme indicated that there was more to school improvement programmes than simply buying one ‘off the shelf’...|$|R

However, little is heard about what those who take <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence</b> from school think that the effect has been on them; nor do we hear the voices of other pupils and their teachers. This article presents evidence from a one-year study of absence in seven local authorities in England funded by the Department for Education and Skills. It defines 'truancy', explores some issues from existing literature on pupil non-attendance, and presents evidence to show the impact that absence from school has on truants, other pupils and teachers. Finally, it suggests that although the greatest impact is on the academic and socio-psychological development of persistent absentees, the attitudes and learning of other pupils and the workload and morale of teachers are also affected...|$|E
40|$|The Centre for the Economics of Education {{was asked}} to {{investigate}} {{the factors that influence}} a range of children's academic and non-academic outcomes, including their enjoyment of school, whether they take <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence</b> from school and whether they feel they are bullied. The study also investigated whether schools can influence these non-academic outcomes. The study makes use of the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England, which is a survey of young people in secondary school that collects information on bullying, truancy and many other factors in each child's life. The data is linked to information on each child's academic achievement, enabling this study to investigate the inter-relationship between a pupil's academic performance and non academic outcomes. Pupils who enjoy school more at age 14 have, perhaps unsurprisingly, higher academic achievement by age 16. Equally, children who have higher achievement at age 11 go on to enjoy school more at age 16 though this is a not a strong relationship. In other words enjoyment of school and academic achievement are clearly linked. Pupils who were bullied or who took <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence</b> at age 14 had significantly lower educational achievement at GCSE. Pupils who experienced bullying at age 14 were also much more likely to experience bullying at age 16. Therefore early negative outcomes, such as being bullied, suggest the child is at risk of having later negative experiences at age 16. Conversely, pupils who participate in positive extra-curricular activities, such as clubs, were also found to have better academic achievement later in their schooling. High achievers at school, i. e. pupils who do well academically at age 14, were also no more likely to be bullied at age 16 than other children. The report also investigated the impact of schools on some of these non-academic outcomes between 14 - 16 and found little evidence that schools currently have different impacts on pupil's enjoyment of school, nor whether they take <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence,</b> nor their likelihood of being bullied. In other words, which school a pupil attends is likely to have small or no effect on their wider well-being. This does not mean that schools do not have the potential to impact on these factors but rather that currently there are not large differences across schools in these outcomes once socio-economic factors have been taken into account. The report concludes that non-academic factors, such as a pupil's enjoyment of school, are inextricably linked to pupils' academic achievement. We {{need to be aware of}} these relationships when considering policies to improve pupil achievement. The report also provides some useful risk indicators of future low pupil academic achievement. For example, some factors, such as being bullied or taking <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence,</b> predict low future academic achievement. Again this can be used by schools and policy-makers to identify pupils at risk of low attainment. This research report was written before the new UK Government took office on 11 May 2010. As a result the content may not reflect current Government policy.

40|$|This {{small scale}} study explores pupil and staff {{perspectives}} {{about what makes}} pupils feel safe in school. This is {{from the perspectives of}} children and staff who have been part of a project to reduce exclusion and improve attendance. The present study explored perceptions of Head Teachers and senior management {{about the impact of the}} project on children's feelings of safety. The study also explored the relationship between the implementation of the project from the perspectives of children and staff, and the initiatives put in place in relation to feeling safe. The participants were 24 children and 15 members of participating schools' senior management teams, who were interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The study also tracked exclusion and attendance figures. Thematic analysis was used to analyse interviews and descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests used to analyse exclusion and attendance data. Key findings were that children associated feeling safe with being protected and having their emotional needs met. Adults and children determined children's feelings of safety. The behaviour of peers and school behaviour management had an impact on children's feelings of safety. Children reported that specific places in school such as the playground had a role in maintaining feelings of safety, as did the school curriculum, the local community and the security of the school. The necessity for targeted work on learning and the emotional development of children to keep children safe was also a key finding. Project funding was used by schools to develop the curriculum and to employ and train additional staff. Schools reported that the playground was a key factor in maximising pupils' feelings of safety. Effective school systems which monitored and supported pupils' needs facilitated implementation of the project.

There are approximately 250 children and young people in public care in The Borough. In total, the study involved 66 children i. e. 22 looked-after children with criteria-defined emotional and behavioural difficulties at School Action Plus of the SEN Code of Practice or having a Statement of SEN for emotional and behavioural difficulties, 22 in Control Group 1 - children not in public care, but at School Action Plus of the SEN Code of Practice or having a Statement of SEN for EBD and 22 in Control Group 2 - children not in public care and not presenting emotional and behavioural difficulties. Measures of attainment, school attendance, fixed-term exclusion, authorised absence, <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence,</b> behaviour and mental health were obtained.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this research {{study was to investigate}} teachers’ understanding and perceptions of teacher absenteeism. A sample of principals, deputy principals, HODs, teachers, support staff and union members from seven different schools in Middelburg in the Nkangala District of the Mpumalanga Department of Basic Education participated in the investigation. The study was motivated by the escalating teacher absenteeism being experienced within the Mpumalanga Department of Basic Education. The abuse of teacher leave, which takes the form of various leave privileges, is being accelerated primarily by the unacceptably high occurrence of <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence</b> on the part of teachers at schools. These unauthorised absences includes arriving in class late and leaving class before time, late arrival and early departure from school, poor time management and poor monitoring of absenteeism by the SMTs at schools. The study adopted a qualitative research approach in the collection and analysis of the data with interviews and document analysis being used in order to collect the required data. The study utilises the conceptual lens of transactional stress model and occupational stress model in order to analyse the findings and identify the various stress factors that impact on teacher absenteeism in South Africa. It concludes that the causes of teacher absenteeism are being ascribed to the following: teachers are highly stressed by their own personal lack of financial management, family problems and their ever-increasing responsibilities and the curriculum changes being imposed on them. The primary value of this research investigation, therefore, lies in the belief that the study findings may help to shape the policies that direct the management of leave of absence in the department of education while simultaneously trying to uproot the perceptual misunderstandings about teacher absenteeism. It is essential that suitable policies be formulated to obviate the underlying causes of teacher absenteeism while identifying the stressors that promote teacher absenteeism and trying to provide solutions that will reduce the escalating absence of teachers at school.

40|$|Background: Ethnicity is {{associated}} with childhood obesity, with Black African origin girls in particular being more vulnerable to overweight and obesity than their White European peers. In the UK, ethnic minorities often live and attend school in poor urban areas which may influence their opportunity for physical activity and a healthy diet. Aim: To examine neighbourhood and school effects on ethnic differences in Body Mass Index (BMI) and waist circumference trends in adolescence. Methods: Multilevel analysis of longitudinal data on BMI and waist circumference [standard deviation scores (SDS) ] from 3401 adolescents in the Determinants of Adolescent Social well-being and Health (DASH) Study (870 White UK, 778 Black Caribbean, 504 Nigerian/Ghanaian, 386 Other African, 418 Indian, and 445 Pakistani/Bangladeshi). Forty-nine London schools {{participated in the study}} and the same pupils were surveyed at 11 - 13 yrs and 14 - 16 yrs. Neighbourhood measures included deprivation, crime, and ethnic density; school measures included ethnic density, school socioeconomic status (SES) (academic performance, free school meals, <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence)</b> and ethos. Individual and family characteristics were also examined (including dietary and physical activity measures, family SES, and parental overweight). Results: Between 11 and 16 yrs ethnic differences in BMI emerged in boys and persisted in girls; compared to their White UK peers Black Caribbean and Nigerian/Ghanaian boys and girls, and Other African girls, had a greater mean BMI SDS. These patterns were not observed for waist circumference, signalling ethnic differences in fat distribution or body composition. The DASH pupils overall had large waists compared to the 1990 Growth Reference population. The ethnic minority pupils, {{with the exception of the}} Indians, were more likely to live in more deprived, higher crime, less green areas than their White UK peers. However the ethnic minority pupils often attended better performing schools than the White UK pupils. The overall variance in body size at neighbourhood level or school level was small (< 4 %), and area or school context measures had little or no effect on ethnic differences in body size. Individual characteristics (such as age, pubertal status, and skipping breakfast) and maternal overweight were strong correlates of body size but did not explain the ethnic differences observed. Conclusions: There were significant ethnic differences in BMI in adolescence, emergent in late adolescence for boys. Neighbourhood and school contexts did not explain the ethnic differences in BMI age trends. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The Attendance and Absence from Scottish Schools Survey collects information on the attendance and absence records of pupils at all Scottish primary and secondary and special needs schools. The survey was first collected in 1995 / 1996 at school level. From 2003 / 04 data were collected at individual pupil level to enable more in depth analysis of attendance and absence in Scottish schools. Since 2010 / 11 the data have been collected on a biennial basis. Around 43, 000 pupils are absent from Scottish Schools every day. The main purpose of the data collection is for monitoring and policy making relating to attendance and absence in Scottish schools. In general, the Scottish Government collects {{a wide variety of}} educational data covering pupils, preschool children, teachers, schools, and free school meal eligibility. The Attendance and Absence survey data are captured {{at the end of a}} school year by local authorities and sent securely to ScotXed for validation and checking before it can be used statistical purposes by the Scottish Government. Each survey contains approximately 700, 000 pupil records. The information collected in the survey is limited but covers pupil id, gender, Scottish Candidate Number and reasons for absence. This includes whether a pupil was late in the first half or second half of a school opening, if they are sick, truant, on a family holiday or extended leave and also if they have been temporarily excluded. Some fields are collected at an individual pupil level&# 58; pupil ID, postcode, school, gender, stage, status, date of birth, candidate number, number of half days attendance or absence by type (truancy, sickness, holiday etc.). The Attendance and Absence in Scottish Schools Survey covers all pupils in all local authority primary, secondary and special schools. As specified previously, the survey has been collected since 1995 / 96 but individual pupil level data are only available from 2003 / 04. After 2010 / 11 the data have been collected on a biennial basis. The data for each academic year must be submitted by local authorities to ScotXed in September of each year. Data are then published by the Scottish Government in December of each alternate year. Pupils arriving late are marked as such by schools, with a distinction made for those arriving in the second half of a morning or the second half of the afternoon. Where a pupil has attended most of an opening it is counted as attendance, but if they have been absent for most of a session it is included as authorised absence. They are still separately identified as being late but present for some of the time in the schools’ systems for management purposes. Schools were also given the possibility of including all late marks on a pupil’s record as attendance, if it is deemed beneficial for encouraging attendance. There are some concerns with the recording of certain variables in the reason for absence field. Several local authorities in certain years do not appear to use the full range of absence categories and are recording most absences as “other authorised absence”. There is also under-recording of sickness rates in some years, with some local authorities recording no sickness at all in their primary and secondary schools. Data in the Attendance and Absence from Scottish Schools Survey are affected by ongoing differences in recording procedures across local authorities. Comparisons between authorities will therefore be affected by these differences in recording and it should not be stated that other authorities necessarily have, for example, worse sickness or truancy rates. Caution should also be taken when considering year on year national level figures, particularly for sickness, other authorised absence and truancy. Individual pupil records are available from 2003 / 04. Prior to this point, information was collected at school level, by stage up to S 5, in these four categories&# 58; attendance, authorised absence, <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence</b> due to temporary exclusion, other <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence.</b> In some authorities schools did not receive full instructions from their local authority about the new definitions, and so for 2003 / 04 were unable to provide the data in line with the new definitions. Most schools operate 380 half-day sessions during the school year. However, all schools in the Lothians and Edinburgh and three schools in Highland operate 342 (longer) half-day sessions in the school year. Research Usage and Linkage The Attendance and Absence in Scottish Schools Survey has been used specifically to research trends in pupil absence across Scottish schools. It is also used in conjunction with the Annual Survey of Exclusions from Scottish Schools to provide more detailed analysis of the reasons for temporary and permanent pupil absence from schools. The Attendance and Absence from Scottish Schools Survey contains the Scottish Candidate number (a unique number allocated to each pupil by the Scottish Qualifications Authority at Primary 1). In theory, this field will allow you to link to the other main Scottish Education datasets including the Pupil Census Survey, the Annual survey of Exclusions from Scottish Schools and also the Scottish Qualification Authority Attainment datasets to allow for more meaningful analysis of pupil characteristics at school. From 2007, the Attendance and Absence from Scottish Schools data have been included in the Scottish Longitudinal Study. Consideration is also being given to linking the Scottish Government Education data with health data using probabilistic matching techniques. </div...|$|E
40|$|The Centre for the Economics of Education {{was asked}} to bring {{together}} {{a wide range of}} academic evidence (primarily England-based) to investigate the extent to which academic and non-academic childhood outcomes are complementary to each other, or are in some way traded-off against each other. The report also investigates the drivers of both academic and non-academic outcomes {{and the extent to which}} child outcomes persist throughout a child's life and across generations. There is also a brief discussion of the implications of this evidence to education policy. The report finds that the relationships between academic and non-academic outcomes are complex in nature. For example, pupils who are bullied or who take <b>unauthorised</b> <b>absence</b> at age 14 have significantly lower educational achievement at GCSE. Pupils who experienced bullying at age 14 were also much more likely to experience bullying at age 16. Conversely pupils who participate in positive extra-curricular activities, such as clubs, were also found to have better academic achievement later in their schooling. These childhood outcomes are themselves determined by a wide variety of influences (such as the quality of parenting they receive) and environmental factors (for example whether they are exposed to passive smoke). It has been well established that children from disadvantaged backgrounds have relatively poor academic outcomes and tend to have weaker social skills than children from more advantaged households. However the evidence also suggests that these children also go on to experience more negative outcomes in adulthood, such as lower probability of employment and lower wages. Furthermore key social and academic outcomes of parents - cognitive skills, attitudes to education, smoking and drinking - are related to similar behaviours in their children. The report concludes that the complex nature of the drivers of child development, the interdependence of child outcomes, and the way that outcomes persist through an individual's life and across generations needs to be recognised in order to develop truly effective policy. While very little of the evidence highlighted in this report identifies true causal relationships (i. e. that a factor X actually directly causes a change in outcome Y), the report draws on some of the highest quality research and analysis currently available, using detailed longitudinal datasets, including the Department's own Longitudinal Study of Young People in England. This enables us to identify at the very least 'robust associations' as well as the data allows. However it does suggest that further research is required to better understand the associations outlined in this report to move to a position where we can identify credible causal relationships. This is important to foster more justified and increasingly effective policymaking. This research report was written before the new UK Government took office on 11 May 2010. As a result the content may not reflect current Government policy. This research will be of use to officials and ministers in helping to shape the future direction of education policy and Departmental strategy. education, government policy...|$|E
