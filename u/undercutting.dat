The duckers of Buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements such as the incubator, and inbreeding had dangerously weakened the breed. Meanwhile, the cost of duck food had risen fourfold over the 19thcentury, and from 1873 onwards competition from Pekin and Pekin cross ducks was <b>undercutting</b> Aylesbury ducks at the marketplace.|$|E
50|$|<b>Undercuts</b> {{should be}} avoided for ease of manufacturing. <b>Undercuts</b> {{typically}} require additional mechanisms for manufacture adding to mold cost and complexity. In addition, the part must have room to flex and deform. Clever part design or minor design concessions often can eliminate complex mechanisms for <b>undercuts.</b> <b>Undercuts</b> may require additional time for unloading molds. It is recommended that <b>undercuts</b> on a part {{should be avoided}} to the extent possible.|$|R

5|$|Throughout 2014, Miliband changed Labour's {{policy on}} immigration, partly in {{response}} to UKIP's performance in the European and local elections in May, and the close result in the Heywood and Middleton by-election in October. Miliband committed to increase funding for border checks, tackle exploitation and the <b>undercutting</b> of wages, require employers who recruit abroad to create apprenticeships, and ensure workers in public-facing roles have minimum standards of English. In November 2014, Labour announced plans to require new EU migrants wait two years before claiming benefits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Undercuts</b> on molded {{parts are}} {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an injection molding machine. They are categorized into {{internal and external}} <b>undercuts,</b> where external <b>undercuts</b> are on {{the exterior of the}} part and interior <b>undercuts</b> are {{on the inside of the}} part. <b>Undercuts</b> can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.|$|R
50|$|<b>Undercut</b> {{rocks are}} rocks {{that have been}} worn down {{underneath}} the surface by the river, or loose boulders which cantilever out beyond their resting spots on the riverbed. They can be extremely dangerous features of a rapid because a person can get trapped underneath them underwater. This {{is especially true of}} rocks that are <b>undercut</b> on the upstream side. Here, a boater may become pinned against the rock underwater. Many whitewater deaths have occurred in this fashion. <b>Undercuts</b> sometimes have pillows, but other times the water just flows smoothly under them, which can indicate that the rock is <b>undercut.</b> <b>Undercuts</b> are most common in rivers where the riverbed cuts through sedimentary rocks like limestone rather than igneous rock like granite. In a steep canyon, the side walls of the canyon can also be <b>undercut.</b>|$|R
40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters in <b>undercut</b> slopes design is {{the determination of the}} maximum stable <b>undercut</b> span. The maximum stable <b>undercut</b> span is a function of slope geometry, the strength parameters of the slope material, condition of discontinuities, underground water condition, etc. However, the desired production capacity and therefore the size of excavating equipment will sometimes ask for a wider <b>undercut</b> span. The influence of arching phenomenon in geo-material on the stability of <b>undercut</b> slopes is investigated earlier. It is believed that due to arching effect, some load transfer from the <b>undercut</b> area into stationary remaining side toes leads to a more stable slope. However, the transferred load may result in ploughing failure of side toes. One technique for preventing the ploughing failure is the use of counterweight balance on side toes. In this study, the influence of counterweight size on the stability of the <b>undercut</b> slopes was investigated through a series of numerical model tests using FLAC 3 D software. It was concluded that there is a meaningful relationship between the counterweight balance size and the maximum stable <b>undercut</b> span where increasing a counterweight size results in a wider stable span. Finally, the numerical results were compared with pre-conducted physical modeling test and a nonlinear relationship was proposed between the counterweight size and the maximum stable <b>undercut</b> span...|$|R
5|$|Because {{value added}} tax (VAT) {{has not been}} levied in the island, luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France, {{providing}} an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. The absence of VAT has also led {{to the growth of}} the fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported, avoiding VAT on arrival and thus <b>undercutting</b> local prices on the same products. In 2005, the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK until 1 April 2012, at which time this policy of the UK government was binned.|$|E

5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and <b>undercutting.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{quantitative}} study {{was made of}} pyramidal cell axon collaterals in Golgi impregnated adult cat cerebral cortex. Cellular samples were obtained from 3 groups, intact, <b>undercut</b> and long-term electrically stimulated <b>undercut</b> cortex. <b>Undercut</b> tissue had cells with significantly fewer axon collaterals and fewer branches than did intact. Long-term electrically stimulated <b>undercut</b> tissue contained neurons which were not different from intact in these two measures. There was, therefore, a preservation of axonal morphology in stimulated <b>undercut,</b> adult cortex. Results do not support a theory of axonal proliferation to explain supersensitivity in partially isolated mature cortex.

5|$|Gerard Bond {{suggests}} {{that changes in}} the flux of solar energy on a 1,500-year scale may be correlated to the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, and in turn the Heinrich events; however the small magnitude {{of the change in}} energy makes such an exo-terrestrial factor unlikely to have the required large effects, at least without huge positive feedback processes acting within the Earth system. However, rather than the warming itself melting the ice, it is possible that sea-level change associated with the warming destabilised ice shelves. A rise in sea level could begin to corrode the bottom of an ice sheet, <b>undercutting</b> it; when one ice sheet failed and surged, the ice released would further raise sea levels, and further destabilizing other ice sheets. In favour of this theory is the non-simultaneity of ice sheet break-up in H1, H2, H4, and H5, where European breakup preceded European melting by up to 1,500years (Maslin et al. 2001).|$|E
5|$|Secretary Stanton ordered McClellan {{to report}} to Trenton, New Jersey, for further orders, {{although}} none were issued. As the war progressed, there were various calls to return McClellan to an important command, following the Union defeats at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville, as Robert E. Lee moved north {{at the start of}} the Gettysburg Campaign, and as Jubal Early threatened Washington in 1864. When Ulysses S. Grant became general-in-chief, he discussed returning McClellan to an unspecified position. But all of these opportunities were impossible, given the opposition within the administration and the knowledge that McClellan posed a potential political threat. McClellan worked for months on a lengthy report describing his two major campaigns and his successes in organizing the Army, replying to his critics and justifying his actions by accusing the administration of <b>undercutting</b> him and denying him necessary reinforcements. The War Department was reluctant to publish his report because, just after completing it in October 1863, McClellan openly declared his entrance to the political stage as a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the <b>undercutting</b> of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E

5|$|Relations {{between the}} two co-prime ministers, Ranariddh and Hun Sen, {{deteriorated}} from March 1996, when the former accused the CPP of repeatedly delaying the allocation process of low-level government posts to FUNCINPECs. Ranariddh threatened {{to pull out of}} the coalition government and hold national elections in the same year if his demands were not met, stoking unease among Hun Sen and other CPP officials. The following month, Sihanouk presided over a meeting between several royal family members and senior FUNCINPEC officials in Paris. Sihanouk attempted to reduce tensions between FUNCINPEC and the CPP by assuring that FUNCINPEC would not leave the coalition government and that there were no reactionary elements planning to bring down Hun Sen or the CPP. In March 1997 Sihanouk expressed his willingness to abdicate the throne, claiming that rising anti-royalist sentiment among the populace was threatening the monarchy's existence. In response, Hun Sen tersely warned Sihanouk that he would introduce constitutional amendments to prohibit members of the royal family from participating in politics if he followed through on his suggestion. As Widyono saw it, Sihanouk remained popular with the Cambodian electorate, and Hun Sen feared that, should he abdicate and enter politics, he would win in any future elections, thereby <b>undercutting</b> CPP's political clout.|$|E

40|$|Lower canines {{often appear}} as {{abutment}} teeth of partially edentulous dental arch. Crown contours of these teeth are mostly inconvenient for placing clasps. The convex vestibular surfaces with sufficient <b>undercuts</b> for placing retention elements are obligatory on lower canines {{but it is}} not common case. Aim of this paper was to confirm a high frequency of inexistence of buccomesial and buccodistal <b>undercuts</b> of the lower canines. Measuring of buccomesial and buccodistal <b>undercuts</b> on abutment lower canines was preformed on 50 diagnostic casts of lower jaw, belonging to Kennedy class I, where the canine was a border of shortened dental arch.

Results show that unprepared lower canines have poor possibilities for retention removable partial denture with clasps. Our positive clinical experiences in recontouring vestibular surfaces of the abutment teeth point to two methods of making an artificial undercut: non-invasive (making an artificial <b>undercut</b> using composite materials) and invasive (using modified fixed restorations). Considering fact that vestibular surfaces of lower canines as abutment teeth are in most cases without <b>undercuts,</b> recontouring of this surfaces in almost all occasions is necessity. If vestibular <b>undercuts</b> don't exist, non-invasive techniques should always have advantiges to invasive techniques.
