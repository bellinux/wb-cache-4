2500|$|Many {{different}} reference ellipsoids {{have been}} used in the history of geodesy. In pre-satellite days they were devised to give a good fit to the geoid over the limited area of a survey but, with the advent of GPS, it has become natural to <b>use</b> <b>reference</b> ellipsoids (such as WGS84) with centre at the centre of mass of the Earth and minor axis aligned to the rotation axis of the Earth. These geocentric ellipsoids are usually within [...] of the geoid. Since latitude is defined with respect to an ellipsoid, the position of a given point is different on each ellipsoid: one cannot exactly specify the latitude and longitude of a geographical feature without specifying the ellipsoid used. Many maps maintained by national agencies are based on older ellipsoids, so one must know how the latitude and longitude values are transformed from one ellipsoid to another. GPS handsets include software to carry out datum transformations which link WGS84 to the local reference ellipsoid with its associated grid.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background RT-qPCR is a {{sensitive}} and increasingly used method for gene expression quantification. To normalize RT-qPCR measurements between samples, most laboratories <b>use</b> endogenous <b>reference</b> genes as internal controls. There is increasing evidence, however, that {{the expression of}} commonly <b>used</b> <b>reference</b> genes can vary significantly in certain contexts. Results Using the Genevestigator database of normalized and well-annotated microarray experiments, we describe the expression stability characteristics of the transciptomes of several organisms. The results show that a) no genes are universally stable, b) most commonly <b>used</b> <b>reference</b> genes yield very high transcript abundances {{as compared to the}} entire transcriptome, and c) for each biological context a subset of stable genes exists that has smaller variance than commonly <b>used</b> <b>reference</b> genes or genes that were selected for their stability across all conditions. Conclusion We therefore propose the normalization of RT-qPCR data <b>using</b> <b>reference</b> genes that are specifically chosen for the conditions under study. RefGenes is a community tool developed for that purpose. Validation RT-qPCR experiments across several organisms showed that the candidates proposed by RefGenes generally outperformed commonly <b>used</b> <b>reference</b> genes. RefGenes is available within Genevestigator at [URL]. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Unsatisfied by {{classes at}} Zanesville High School in 1884, R.D. Mershon joined a crew {{surveying}} for a railroad. Working under Mr. Bateman, a surveyor, he gained hands-on {{experience with a}} transit and level. Bateman would not answer Mershon's questioning, referring him instead to the Handbook of Civil Engineering by [...] John Trautwine. From that point he learned to <b>use</b> <b>reference</b> works. Given that young Merson {{had an interest in}} mechanics, a coworker suggested he study at Ohio State. Returning to Zanesville, Mershon turned to superintendent of schools William D. Lash for examination and certification. Mershon was admitted to Ohio State in the fall of 1886. His skills being evident, in his senior year he served as student assistant. In 1890 he graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering. After graduation he was an assistant instructor in electrical engineering. Working with alternating current machinery, Mershon developed a means of waveform measurement. It is described as an instantaneous potentiometer method, employing [...] a telephone receiver to indicate balance. This work attracted the attention of the Westinghouse Electric Company.|$|E
2500|$|The {{relationships}} adolescents {{have with}} their peers, family, {{and members of}} their social sphere {{play a vital role}} in the social development of an adolescent. As an adolescent's social sphere develops rapidly as they distinguish the differences between friends and acquaintances, they often become heavily emotionally invested in friends. This is not harmful; however, if these friends expose an individual to potentially harmful situations, this is an aspect of peer pressure. Adolescence is a critical period in social development because adolescents can be easily influenced by the people they develop close relationships with. This is the first time individuals can truly make their own decisions, which also makes this a sensitive period. Relationships are vital in the social development of an adolescent due to the extreme influence peers can have over an individual. These relationships become significant because they begin to help the adolescent understand the concept of personalities, how they form and why a person has that specific type of personality. [...] "The use of psychological comparisons could serve both as an index of the growth of an implicit personality theory and as a component process accounting for its creation. In other words, by comparing one person's personality characteristics to another's, we would be setting up the framework for creating a general theory of personality (and,... such a theory would serve as a useful framework for coming to understand specific persons)." [...] This can be likened to the use of social comparison in developing one's identity and self-concept, which includes ones personality, and underscores the importance of communication, and thus relationships, in one's development. In social comparison we <b>use</b> <b>reference</b> groups, with respect to both psychological and identity development. These reference groups are the peers of adolescents. This means that who the teen chooses/accepts as their friends and who they communicate with on a frequent basis often makes up their reference groups and can therefore have a huge impact on who they become. Research shows that relationships have the largest affect over the social development of an individual.|$|E
