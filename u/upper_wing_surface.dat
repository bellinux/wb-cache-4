5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The hull was a two-step design {{using the}} Linton Hope {{construction}} method. This used {{a system of}} circular formers separated by stringers {{and covered with a}} double layer of 0.125in (3.2mm) mahogany strips, the second at right angles to the first. This allowed the construction of smooth curved surfaces. The Pellet was a single-bay biplane without stagger and was often described as a sesquiplane because the lower wing was not only of smaller span but also of smaller chord. The lower wing was mounted {{on the top of the}} fuselage and carried wingtip floats mounted directly below the N-type interplane struts. There was another pair of these struts between the fuselage and upper wing supporting the engine, which was mounted tractorwise above the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> in a streamlined nacelle. The engine, a 450hp (340kW) Napier Lion was cooled with radiators fitted flush in the lower surface of the upper wing. The pilot sat in front of the propeller. At the rear of the aircraft, the braced tailplane was mounted about halfway up the single fin.|$|E
25|$|In September 1942, the G-4 appeared; {{this version}} was {{identical}} to the G-2 in all respects, including performance, except for being fitted with the FuG 16 VHF radio set, which provided much clearer radio transmissions and had three-times {{the range of the}} earlier HF sets. Externally this could be recognised by the position of the fuselage antenna lead-in which was moved further aft to between frames seven and eight on the fuselage spine. Due to the steady weight increases of the 109, from the spring of 1943 larger 660×160mm (26×6.3in) mainwheels were introduced, replacing the previously used 650×150mm (25.6×6in) type. The undercarriage legs were altered so that the wheel's vertical axis was nearly upright rather than being parallel with the oleo leg. These changes resulted in the fitting of teardrop-shaped fairings to the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> above the wheel-wells to accommodate {{the upper part of the}} mainwheels. The larger wheels and fairings were often retrofitted to G-2s. In addition, a larger 350×135mm (14×5in) tailwheel replaced the original 290×110mm (11×4in) one; the larger tailwheel no longer fitted the recess, so the retraction mechanism was disconnected and the tailwheel fixed down. Up to July 1943, 1,242 G-4s were produced, with an additional four in Győr and WNF factories in the second half of 1943. Between January and February 1943, 50 examples of a pressurized version, the G-3 were also produced; similar to the G-1 although it was equipped with the same FuG 16 VHF radio set as the G-4.|$|E
5000|$|... {{one with}} {{narrower}} white [...] "flanks" [...] on <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> - before July 1939, {{it was used}} in all six regular positions on an airframe ...|$|R
5000|$|This white, {{flexible}} fabric offered protection {{at up to}} [...] FRSI {{covered the}} orbiter's <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> <b>upper</b> payload bay doors, portions of the OMS/RCS pods, and aft fuselage.|$|R
50|$|It is a mid- wing {{monoplane}} {{with its}} wings, which have an Eppler E603 profile, swept forward at 2.5°. Airbrakes extend from the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> only. It has a T-tail and a standard, fixed glider monowheel undercarriage with a tailwheel.|$|R
500|$|The delta-shaped wings {{required}} Concorde {{to adopt}} a higher angle of attack at low speeds than conventional aircraft, but it allowed the formation of large low pressure vortices over the entire <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> maintaining lift. The normal landing speed was [...] Because of this high angle, during a landing approach Concorde was on the [...] "back side" [...] of the drag force curve, where raising the nose would increase the rate of descent; the aircraft was thus largely flown on the throttle and was fitted with an autothrottle to reduce the pilot's workload.|$|E
500|$|The bomber {{was built}} mainly of duralumin, with two steel spars in the wings, {{although}} the ailerons were fabric-covered. The pear-shaped monocoque fuselage required the pilots {{to sit in}} tandem, offset to the left. In the prototype, space for a fifth engine, an auxiliary Klimov M-100, was reserved inside the fuselage, in a fairing above the wing spars and behind the pilots. It was intended to drive a supercharger that supplied pressurized air to the Mikulin AM-34FRN engines, with the installation designated ATsN-2 (...) [...] Subsequent models omitted the internal engine, and provided seating for a flight engineer and radio operator, behind and below the pilots. The bombardier sat in the nose and manned a turret armed with a [...] ShVAK cannon that covered a 120° cone ahead. A prominent chin gondola, nicknamed the 'beard', protruded beneath the nose. The dorsal gunner sat {{at the rear of}} the ATsN fairing with a sliding hood covering a [...] ShKAS machine gun and another ShKAS mounted in a ventral hatch. The tail gunner had a powered turret with a ShVAK and, most unusually, there were manually operated ShVAK cannon mounted at the rear of each inner engine nacelle. Crewmen had access to these positions through the wing or by a trapdoor in the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> The large internal bomb bay racks held up to [...] of bombs; external racks held a single [...] FAB-500 (Fugasnaya AviaBomba - high explosive bomb) bomb under each wing.|$|E
2500|$|Engineering work {{involved}} a three-year {{commitment from the}} company and incorporated an extensive amount of wind tunnel testing at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The resultant design was a large but aerodynamically [...] "sleek" [...] airliner, incorporating the cockpit in a streamlined glazed [...] "dome". [...] The engines featured a unique nacelle tunnel cowl where air was ducted in and expelled through {{the bottom of the}} cowl, reducing turbulent airflow and induced drag across the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> After a mockup was constructed in 1938, Curtiss-Wright exhibited the innovative project as a display in the 1939 New York World's Fair.|$|E
50|$|Its YC-123D had {{introduced}} a Boundary Layer Control (BLC) {{system to the}} C-123B. This system forced pressurized air over the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the airplane, making the wing work {{as if it were}} flying at much greater airspeed. This greatly improved landing and take-off performance, gross weight capability, and lowered the C-123's stall speed.|$|R
25|$|Darker lozenge {{patterns}} {{were used for}} <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> while lighter ones {{were used for the}} undersides of the aircraft. Even darker shades were used for night operations by aircraft such as Zeppelin-Staaken R.VI and Gotha G.V heavy bombers. These aircraft were often hand-painted in similar but unrepeating patterns on their fuselages. The heaviest Riesenflugzeug were painted in lozenge patterns—they were never covered in printed fabric.|$|R
50|$|With {{an extreme}} 33:1 aspect ratio and a {{relatively}} low empty weight, the HP-15 was expected to generate less induced drag and therefore higher performance. The type achieved excellent glide ratios in fast flight, but had disappointing climbing ability, due to extensive flow separation on the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> during slow flight and Schreder and the HP-15 finished in 65th place. After the Championships Schreder re-winged the fuselage to produce his next design, the HP-16.|$|R
2500|$|The first Solar Impulse aircraft, {{registered}} as HB-SIA, was primarily {{designed as a}} demonstration aircraft. It has a non-pressurized cockpit and a single wing with a wingspan {{similar to that of}} the Airbus A340 airliner. Under the wing are four nacelles, each with a set of lithium polymer batteries, a [...] electric motor and one twin-bladed propeller. To keep the wing as light as possible, a customised carbon fibre honeycomb sandwich structure was used. 11,628 photovoltaic cells on the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> and the horizontal stabilizer generate electricity during the day to power the electric motors and to charge the batteries allowing flight at night, theoretically enabling the single-seat plane to stay in the air indefinitely.|$|E
2500|$|The Rhönbussard is an all {{wood and}} fabric aircraft, with a span 1.43m (4ft8in) {{greater than the}} Grunau Baby 1, a wing loading 50% higher and {{considerably}} more refined aerodynamically, with a cantilever wing and a smooth, oval section fuselage. [...] The wing, lacking dihedral, has a parallel chord centre section and straight tapered outer panels ending in semi-elliptical tips. [...] It is built around a single spar with plywood covering forward to form a torsion resisting D-box. [...] Behind the spar the wing is fabric covered. [...] The whole span of {{the trailing edge of}} the outer panels carries ailerons. [...] The earliest Rhönbussards had no lift losing or drag increasing surfaces but later examples followed the development of these at the DFS: first with spoilers deployed above the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface,</b> then with DFS-type airbrakes rotating out of both surfaces on a common span-wise axis at about [...] mid-chord and finally with parallel ruler action Schempp-Hirth brakes mounted just behind the spar.|$|E
2500|$|Following Breguet's {{success in}} the 1954 and 1956 World Gliding Championships with the Type901, Jean Cayla {{designed}} the Type905 for the 1958 event. It is a Standard Class sailplane with a 15m (49ft3in) span. Like its predecessor, the 905 is a cantilever mid-wing monoplane but the its structure contains glass reinforced plastic, more plastic foam and less fabric. It also has a butterfly tail. It has a wing of straight tapered planform, terminated with small [...] "salmon" [...] fairings at the squared-off wingtips. [...] The major structural component is the main spar plus nose D-box unit, skinned with a plastic foam-filled ("Klegecel") sandwich with 0.6mm (0.024in)-ply outer layers. Ribs, ailerons and Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are attached to this torsion box. [...] The whole <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> and outboard lower surface is ply, supported by an internal Klegecell lining, with fabric below, aft of the spar. [...] Slotted ailerons occupy the outer 45% of the trailing edge; there are no flaps. [...] Each complete wing weighs just 34kg (75lb).|$|E
5000|$|The first {{operational}} orbiter, Columbia, {{originally had}} the same markings as Enterprise, although the letters [...] "USA" [...] on the right wing were slightly larger and spaced farther apart. Columbia also had black markings which Enterprise lacked on its forward RCS module, around the cockpit windows, and on its vertical stabilizer, and had distinctive black [...] "chines" [...] on the forward part of its <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which {{none of the other}} orbiters had.|$|R
50|$|Austria-Hungary {{produced}} 413 seaplanes {{during the}} war. These naval aircraft were more elaborately marked. Typically, a flying boat sported a black cross pattée on {{a box of}} white background for national insignia; the boxed crosses were found on top of <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> both port and starboard, under both lower <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and {{on the sides of}} the hull. Additionally, the rudder and elevators were blocked out in red and white; broad red and white bands were sometimes applied to the outboard ends of the wings also. There were also serial numbers on the hull.|$|R
2500|$|Built as a stock Cherokee II by Larry Cook of Hershey, Pennsylvania the {{aircraft}} was damaged and rebuilt with the wing from a Miller Tern, {{giving it a}} wingspan of [...] The aircraft was later further modified by later owners adding [...] span spoilers on the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> removing the dorsal fin, increasing the fin chord, as well as adding flaps and small rear windows. The aircraft is listed by the FAA as having been built in 1966 and destroyed in 2002.|$|R
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} greater span, {{the wing of}} the Jantar 2 {{differed}} only from that of its predecessor by having less taper and a slight change of plan. [...] The leading edge remains straight and slightly swept, but the inner half-span has no sweep on the trailing edge, with the ailerons mounted on the forward swept edge of the outboard part. The wing construction {{is similar to that}} of the Jantar 1, all glass fibre with a single spar and glass cloth/foam sandwich skin. [...] There are mid-chord Schempp-Hirth airbrakes which extend both above and below the wing. [...] Its camber changing flaps are hingeless; instead the movement is provided by deflection of the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> [...] Combined with a carefully sealed sliding joint in the lower surface, these elastic flaps minimise loss in lift due to leakage and abrupt shape changes. [...] The first two prototypes had two piece wings but later aircraft have further wing divisions at about 2.5m (8ft) from the wing tips for easier handling.|$|E
2500|$|... {{there it}} went to RAF Martlesham Heath on 1 January 1925 for Air Ministry tests and {{eventually}} in June for competitive trials against other manufacturers' entrants. [...] Meanwhile the other two machines had been completed, the second going to RAE Farnborough for use in an experimental radio programme and the third retained at Cricklewood. [...] It was used to find solutions to several problems that the Martlesham flights had revealed. [...] The original fuel tanks, mounted just outboard of the innermost interplane struts and projecting both {{above and below the}} upper wing were found to be the source of aerodynamically-induced vibration at high angles of attack, so they were modified to have a top face matching the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b> [...] The exhaust pipes were modified to avoid flame dazzle and flow into the cockpit by discharging at the forward end via [...] "rams horn" [...] exits; the ventral gun position was canvassed over, for there was such a draught through the dorsal and ventral openings that neither position was usable.|$|E
2500|$|The Kittiwake was a four bay biplane {{with high}} aspect ratio, {{parallel}} chord Consuta covered wings without sweep or stagger. [...] The lower one joined the fuselage {{at the top}} of the hull, with two pairs of struts to just above the chine; the upper wing met the top of the cabin. The three outer wide chord, Consuta faired interplane struts were of I form, which simplified the interplane wire bracing. Aerodynamically, the most unusual features of the Kittiwake's wings were the interlinked camber changing devices on both the leading and trailing edges of upper and lower wings, intended to increase the speed range of a quite heavily loaded aircraft (wing loading 7.2lb/ft2). [...] Because these lift-enhancing devices occupied most of the trailing edges, the ailerons were mounted halfway between the wings on the two outboard interplane struts. [...] The two radial engines were also mounted mid-plane in seven sided nacelles, [...] supported by the innermost duralumin interplane struts and steel strut braced to the fuselage. [...] Their faired fuel tanks sat immediately above them, protruding from the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|On the Boeing YC-14, the upper-surface-blowing {{design for}} high {{aerodynamic}} lift used two jet engines that blew high-velocity airstreams over the inboard {{section of the}} wing and over special trailing-edge flaps. The large multisection flaps extended rearward and downward from the wing's trailing edge to increase the wing area, thus creating extra lift, which was further augmented by positioning the engines so their jet blast across the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> created still more lift. In addition, {{the placement of the}} engines above the wing prevented the engines from ingesting dirt and debris and shielded some of the engine noise from the ground so that the transport could make a quieter approach.|$|R
50|$|Behind {{the wing}} {{trailing}} edge the enclosed fuselage {{was replaced by}} a pair of nearly horizontal beams, one vertically above the other, which carried the tail unit. The ply-covered tailplane and fabric covered elevators were mounted on the upper fuselage beam. Fin and rudder, ply and fabric covered respectively, continued down below the horizontal surfaces to the lower beam, the rudder moving in an elevator cut-out. Like the wing, the tailplane was strut braced from below. The rear surfaces were braced against lateral deflections by pairs of wires from the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> {{to the top of the}} fin and by similar wires from below to its bottom.|$|R
50|$|The K 10 is a {{cantilever}} {{shoulder wing}} glider {{with a single}} spar wing built from pine and plywood. Its covering is mostly fabric but glass fibre is used in places where the surface has double curvature. Wortmann airfoils replaced the NACA 63 series profiles of the successful Schleicher Ka 6 {{with the intention of}} producing higher speeds. The straight leading edge is unswept, but a swept trailing edge produces a forward sweep at quarter chord of 1.2°. There is 3° of dihedral. The taper increases slightly on the outer wing panels, where ply covered ailerons are hinged on the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Schempp-Hirth airbrakes are fitted inboard.|$|R
2500|$|The M.1 was {{powered by}} a [...] le Rhône 9C nine {{cylinder}} rotary engine, fitted with a two blade propeller and an unusually large domed spinner which left only a small gap for cooling air {{between it and the}} almost complete cylindrical engine enclosure. [...] Behind the engine the fuselage was flat sided, with a curved upper decking. [...] The open single cockpit was at the wing trailing edge, and there were cut-outs in both planes to improve the pilot's view. [...] The fuselage tapered aft where the horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage; the original tail surfaces were very small and without a fixed fin. [...] Later versions had an enlarged straight edged tailplane and split pair of angle tipped elevators, a wide chord fin and enlarged rudder. [...] The M.1 had a fixed conventional undercarriage, with mainwheels on a single axle mounted on a pair of V-struts from the lower fuselage longerons and wire cross braced. The only armament was a single Lewis gun, mounted well above the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{precursor of}} the Mistral-C Club Class glider was the Strauber Mistral high performance Standard Class aircraft designed by Manfred Strauber, Alois Fries, Hartmut Frommhold and Horst Gaber. [...] Design works began in January 1970 and the Mistral {{made its first}} flight in July 1975. [...] It {{was not intended to}} be serially produced. It was a 15.00m (49ft2.5in) span shoulder wing monoplane with a T-tail which made much use of glass reinforced plastic (GRP) in its structure. [...] The wings had an area of 9.40m² (101.2sqft), an aspect ratio of 23.9 and sweepback at one quarter chord of 0.4°. The dihedral was also 0.4°. The airfoil sections used were Wortmann FX-66-S-196 at the root and FX-66-S-161 at the tips. [...] The wings were constructed from GRP/balsa sandwich with ailerons of GRP and rigid, closed cell, polymethacrylimide (PMI) foam. [...] Aluminium Schempp-Hirth airbrakes extended from the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> only. The tail unit, with an all-moving tailplane, was also formed from PMI filled GRP. The fuselage of the Mistral was a pod and boom monocoque made from GRP/balsa sandwich, with the single seat cockpit under a single piece, framed canopy. [...] Its main, single landing wheel was manually retractable and assisted by a tailskid. The Mistral had a best glide angle of 39:1 and a minimum sink speed of 0.6m/s (118ft/mim).|$|E

5000|$|Etrich {{adopted the}} format of crosswind-capable main landing gear that Louis Blériot had used on his Blériot XI cross-channel {{monoplane}} for better ground handling. The wing has thee spars and was braced by a cable-braced steel tube truss (called a [...] "bridge", or Brücke in German) under each wing: at the outer end the uprights of this structure were lengthened {{to rise above the}} <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces,</b> to form kingposts to carry bracing and warping wires for the enlarged wingtips. A small landing wheel was sometimes mounted on the lower end of this kingpost, to protect it for landings and to help guard against ground loops.|$|R

50|$|The ASW 28 is a single-seat shoulder-winged {{composite}} construction sailplane with a T-shaped horizontal tailplane and 15 metre wingspan. The <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surface</b> has Schempp-Hirth brake flaps.|$|E
25|$|A more {{reliable}} fit {{was made with}} four 20mm (.79in) Hispano Mk II cannons, two in each wing, but the weight was enough to seriously reduce performance. The Hispanos were designed for a rigid, engine based mounting and it was quickly found that the wings flexing in flight led to problems with the weapons twisting in their mounts as they fired, which caused gun jamming through misaligned shells. Changes made both to the Hispanos and to their mountings cured this problem. Small blisters on the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> were needed to clear the Hispano breeches and feed motors. The first sets of Hispano wings were modified from standard Mark I eight gun wings.|$|R

25|$|The Spitfires {{with the}} {{single-stage}} Merlin engines used four different wing types, Type A, B, C and D wings, {{which had the}} same dimensions and plan but different internal arrangements of armament and fuel tanks. All Mk Is, IIs, and Vs and their derivatives had small, rectangular undercarriage indicator pins which projected at an angle from the <b>upper</b> <b>wing</b> <b>surfaces</b> when the undercarriage legs were locked down, providing a positive mechanical indication that the landing gears were indeed down and locked, since the pilot {{could not see the}} landing gear for himself. These were a backup to the indicator lights on the instrument panel, in case the lights malfunctioned or failed. All of these variants used Dunlop AH2061 tyres, mounted on alloy mainwheels which had five openings. The fixed, castering tailwheels used Dunlop AH2184 tyres.|$|R
