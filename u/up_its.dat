5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give <b>up</b> <b>its</b> 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium has also been calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It has also been predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd centuryBC, Roman {{territory}} saw {{an overall}} decline in population, partially {{due to the}} huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of the middle classes into lower classes of the census and the proletarii. As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of}} the state, since many of the soldiers who made <b>up</b> <b>its</b> lower classes were now impoverished proletarii in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.|$|E

5|$|Each troop {{is divided}} into patrols of eight or so Scouts led by a patrol leader elected from within the patrol. Patrol {{meetings}} are generally held during the weekly troop meeting. The patrol's independence from the troop varies among troops and between activities. Patrols' autonomy becomes more visible at campouts, where each patrol may set <b>up</b> <b>its</b> own camping and cooking area. Divisions between patrols may disappear during an event which {{only a small part}} of the troop attends. Patrols may hold meetings and even excursions separately from the rest of the troop.|$|E
5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too fast for a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns <b>up</b> <b>its</b> safety line to its vantage point and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E

5|$|In Queensland, P. fimbriata is {{reluctant}} {{to jump into the}} webs of prey spiders, while other Portia species do this at any opportunity. The Queensland orb web spider Argiope appensa shakes its web violently to shake off intruders, and P. fimbriata finds a detour that allows it to abseil on to the prey. When the web spider Zosis genicularis is busy wrapping <b>up</b> <b>its</b> own prey and is less aware of other predators, P. fimbriata uses this activity as a type of smokescreen to approach the web spider.|$|E
