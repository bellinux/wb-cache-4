5|$|The Tempest is a play by William Shakespeare, {{believed}} to have been written in 1610–11, and thought by many critics to be the last play that Shakespeare wrote alone. It is set on a remote island, where the sorcerer Prospero, rightful Duke of Milan, plots to restore his daughter Miranda to her rightful place using illusion and skillful manipulation. He conjures <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm,</b> the eponymous tempest, to cause his usurping brother Antonio and the complicit King Alonso of Naples to believe they are shipwrecked and marooned on the island. There, his machinations bring about the revelation of Antonio's lowly nature, the redemption of the King, and the marriage of Miranda to Alonso's son, Ferdinand.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{his penchant}} for biting social {{criticism}} and satire, Bierce's long newspaper career was often steeped in controversy.

500|$|It {{was then}} an annual custom for the Pope {{to receive a}} {{delegation}} from Rome's Jewish community shortly after the New Year. The meeting on 2 February 1859 quickly descended into a heated argument, with Pope Pius berating the Jewish visitors for [...] "stirring <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> all over Europe about this Mortara case". When the delegation denied that the Jews of Rome had had any hand in the anti-clerical articles, the Pope dismissed Scazzocchio as inexperienced and foolish, then shouted: [...] "The newspapers can write all they want. I couldn't care less what the world thinks!" [...] The Pope then calmed down somewhat: [...] "So strong is the pity I have for you, that I pardon you, indeed, I must pardon you." [...] One of the delegates proposed that the Church should not give so much credence to Morisi's testimony, given her spurious morals—the Pope countered that regardless of her character, so {{far as he could}} see the servant had no reason to invent such a story, and in any case Momolo Mortara should not have employed a Catholic in the first place.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's {{emergence}} {{occurred during}} the advent of MTV; Chris Nelson from The New York Times spoke of pop artists like Madonna saying, [...] "MTV, with its almost exclusively lip-synched videos, ushered in {{an era in which}} average music fans might happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers just mouth the words." [...] The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows. He added, [...] "Artists like Madonna and Janet Jackson set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing." [...] Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by [...] "stay mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [...] the dance routines to her backup troupe... ather than try to croon and dance <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> at the same time." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea of a}} solo singer {{alternating}} with a chorus is extended in the following movement, the bass aria with chorus [...] (Peace be with you). A string introduction depicts in agitated forte passages in 4/4 time the attack of the enemies. John Eliot Gardiner describes it as [...] "a dramatic scena in which the strings work <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> to illustrate the raging of the soul's enemies". In sharp contrast the bass as the vox Christi (voice of Christ) sings the greeting of Jesus from verse 19 of the Gospel, [...] "Peace be with you", three times, accompanied by woodwinds in dotted rhythm in 3/4 time, marked piano. Musicologist Julian Mincham describes the music as serene, a [...] "gentle, rocking, almost cradle-like rhythm creating a perfect atmosphere of peaceful contemplation". The upper voices of the choir (without basses) answer {{to the music of}} the introduction, seeing Jesus as help in the battle (""). The greeting and answering is repeated two more times in two stanzas of the poem, reflecting the strengthening of the weary in spirit and body (""), and finally overcoming death (""). The following fourth appearance of [...] "Peace be with you" [...] is accompanied by both woodwinds and strings, and peace is finally achieved. Klaus Hofmann describes the movement as an [...] "operatic scene" [...] and continues [...] "Bach resorts to unconventional means; he shows himself as a musical dramatist and, in the process, stresses the element of contrast: he comments upon the words of the faithful with agitated, tumultuous string figures, whilst Jesus' peace greeting sounds calmly and majestically, embedded in pastoral wind sonorities." [...] Bach adapted this movement as the Gloria of his Missa in A major, BWV 234.|$|E
500|$|Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance (1993) {{observed}} that in Rhythm Nation 1814, Jackson represents a [...] "modern good fairy" [...] attempting to guide troubled youth {{to a more}} positive way of life. Each of the three segments serve a different purpose, beginning with affinity and companionship in [...] "Miss You Much", followed by anger and frustration in her rooftop solo and ending with [...] "Rhythm Nation", in which Jackson and her dancers [...] "have become a uniformed, formidable army, whose controlled energetic moves and shouts project a disciplined resolution to inspire others through dance and music." [...] Their group dynamic visually depicts a gender neutral equality, with Jackson [...] "performing asexually and anonymously in front of, but {{as one of the}} members of the group." [...] It is also noted that the success of the film is not only the final product, but in the commercial and social implications of its development. In selecting an unknown street dancer, Anthony Thomas, to develop her choreography, [...] "Janet Jackson secures a threefold achievement: she satisfies the dictates of the commercial pop music industry by creating a dance image which is significantly different from her earlier work; she demonstrates that, despite fame, she is still in touch with contemporary youth pop culture and its fashions; and finally, she , not the dance traditions of Hollywood musical... but the work of a young black man whose training is outside the institutions of Western theatre and clearly an Afro-American cultural expression of the late 1980s." [...] The film received positive reception. Jefferson Graham in USA Today commented that [...] "she dances <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> in the moody black-and-white video's three songs... and plays the role of a mystical figure to young kids." [...] Jon Pareles remarked that [...] " [...] juxtaposes her dance routines with grim urban imagery and a plot line about drugs versus dreams." [...] It was later released on VHS as the Rhythm Nation 1814 Compilation, and reissued the following year with each of the album's promotional music videos. Jackson received two MTV Music Video Award nominations for [...] "Best Dance Video" [...] and [...] "Best Choreography" [...] for [...] "Rhythm Nation", winning the latter.|$|E

2500|$|Also in {{the manner}} of Homer, the story proper begins in medias res (into the middle of things), with the Trojan fleet in the eastern Mediterranean, heading in the {{direction}} of Italy. The fleet, led by Aeneas, is on a voyage to find a second home. It has been foretold that in Italy he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous, a race which will become known to all nations. Juno is wrathful, because she had not been chosen in the judgment of Paris, and because her favorite city, Carthage, will be destroyed by Aeneas's descendants. Also, Ganymede, a Trojan prince, was chosen to be the cup bearer to her husband, Jupiter—replacing Juno's daughter, Hebe. Juno proceeds to Aeolus, King of the Winds, and asks that he release the winds to stir <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>storm</b> in exchange for a bribe (Deiopea, the loveliest of all her sea nymphs, as a wife). Aeolus does not accept the bribe, but agrees to carry out Juno's orders (line 77, [...] "My task is / To fulfill your commands"); the storm then devastates the fleet.|$|E
