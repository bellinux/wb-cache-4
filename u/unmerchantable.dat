6000|$|Before I {{finished}} my house, wishing to earn {{ten or twelve}} dollars by some honest and agreeable method, {{in order to meet}} my unusual expenses, I planted about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it chiefly with beans, but also a small part with potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips. The whole lot contains eleven acres, mostly growing up to pines and hickories, and was sold the preceding season for eight dollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said that it was [...] "good for nothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on." [...] I put no manure whatever on this land, not being the owner, but merely a squatter, and not expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe it all once. I got out several cords of stumps in plowing, which supplied me with fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould, easily distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans there. The dead {{and for the most part}} <b>unmerchantable</b> wood behind my house, and the driftwood from the pond, have supplied the remainder of my fuel. I was obliged to hire a team and a man for the plowing, though I held the plow myself. My farm outgoes for the first season were, for implements, seed, work, etc., $14.72-1/2. The seed corn was given me. This never costs anything to speak of, unless you plant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans, and eighteen bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn. The yellow corn and turnips were too late to come to anything. My whole income from the farm was ...|$|E
50|$|When natural {{regeneration}} or artificial seeding {{has resulted in}} dense, overstocked young stands, natural thinning will in most cases eventually reduce stocking to more silviculturally desirable levels. But by the time some trees reach merchantable size, others will be overmature and defective, and others will still be <b>unmerchantable.</b> The yield of merchantable wood can be greatly increased and the rotation shortened by precommercial thinning. Mechanical and chemical methods have been applied, but their costliness has militated against their ready adoption.|$|E
50|$|Over-crowded {{regeneration}} {{tends to}} stagnate. The problem is aggravated in species that have little self-pruning ability, such as white spruce. Spacing is a thinning (of natural regeneration), {{in which all}} trees other than those selected for retention at fixed intervals are cut. The term juvenile spacing is used when {{most or all of}} the cut trees are <b>unmerchantable.</b> Spacing can be used to obtain any {{of a wide range of}} forest management objectives, but it is especially undertaken to reduce density and control stocking in young stands and prevent stagnation, and to shorten the rotation, i.e., to speed the production of trees of a given size. Volume growth of individual trees and the merchantable growth of stands are increased. The primary rationale for spacing is that thinning is the projected decline in maximum allowable cut. And since wood will be concentrated on fewer, larger, and more uniform stems, operating and milling costs will be minimized.|$|E
50|$|Mr Sagar was {{a cotton}} weaver for Ridehalgh & Sons Ltd in Nelson, Lancashire. He claimed that pay had been wrongfully deducted from his wages {{allegedly}} for poor workmanship. His contract was oral, but pay was fixed by collective {{agreement with the}} Amalgamated Weavers' Association and the Cotton Spinners' and Manufacturers' Association. According to the collective agreement {{he should have been}} paid 2l. 5s. 0½d. But Ridehalgh Ltd only paid him 2l. 4s. 0½d., deducting 1s. in respect of a fault in 3 yards of the 80 yards piece. Mr Sagar had failed to piece up a broken thread of the warp. This made 3 yards of cloth <b>unmerchantable.</b> Mr Sagar said this was an unlawful deduction contrary to Truck Act 1831 section 3. But Ridehalgh Ltd argued mills in the locality had the custom of deducting for work that had been performed without reasonable care and skill in the management’s eyes. That had been so for thirty years at the workplace, though nobody had said anything in the oral agreement and no provisions concerning deductions were found in the collective agreement.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in even aged timber {{management}} is to select a suitable stand for harvest. Trees must be of merchantable size, a desirable species, and in an area accessible to harvesting equipment. Once selected, the stand is harvested (usually using feller-bunchers, skidders, and processors). Merchantable trees (trees with boles {{large enough to be}} sold to a mill) are harvested and processed whereas <b>unmerchantable</b> trees (trees that are too small or of an undesirable species) are either crushed by machinery or cut to make equipment movement easier. This process is called clearcutting, and the end result is a cutblock. At this stage, the forestry company is required to replant the same proportion of species that were there previous to harvest. Usually, silviculture techniques are employed to ensure that species survive and grow in the proper proportion. Shade-intolerant species such as trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and marsh reedgrass (Calamagrostis canadensis) will thrive in the open conditions of a clearcut, outcompeting shade-tolerant species such as white spruce (Picea glauca). Mechanical site preparation and herbicide treatments are often applied initially to allow for adequate shade-tolerant growth. This way, the shade-tolerants are given a head start and the shade-intolerants will catch up over time once silviculture treatments are stopped, resulting in an even-aged stand of trees with little vertical stratification.|$|E
40|$|The {{deterioration}} of merchantable trees over time is often {{assumed to be}} negligible in growth models and yield calculations. Although the annual probability of becoming <b>unmerchantable</b> is small, the cumulative probability over a cutting cycle is significant, and {{should be included in}} yield studies. Logistic regression analyses of permanent sample plot data revealed that changing merchantability can be modelled using species, stand basal area, tree size and time since last logging. The equation developed for the rainforests of north Queensland indicates that up to ten percent of trees may become <b>unmerchantable</b> during a forty year cutting cycle...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Two modern methods, {{centroid}} {{sampling and}} the paracone model, {{have been shown}} to be accurate approaches for obtaining the volumes of trees and logs when taper functions are unavailable or local volume estimates are desired. We show that the equation for whole-tree volume using Hossfeld 2 ̆ 7 s method, an older method that has all but disappeared from the North American literature, is nearly identical to that for centroid sampling and the paracone model. Hossfeld 2 ̆ 7 s method may be slightly simpler to implement in the field, and like the modern methods, it can be used either for whole trees or for <b>unmerchantable</b> tops. In comparison with detailed measurements taken on 186 ponderosa pine trees from the Black Hills of South Dakota, the paracone model was most accurate for whole trees, but Hossfeld 2 ̆ 7 s method was slightly more accurate than centroid sampling. Hossfeld 2 ̆ 7 s method was substantially more accurate than either modern method for estimating the volume in tops...|$|E
40|$|Recent large-scale, severe {{wildfires}} in {{the western}} United States have prompted extensive fuel treatment programs to reduce potential wildfire size and severity. Often, <b>unmerchantable</b> material is mechanically masticated because removing the material is cost-prohibitive. Mastication treatments involve shredding, chopping, or chipping small trees and/or shrubs into small chunks and leaving the material on site. While {{it is obvious that}} mechanical treatments will increase surface fuel loads, few studies have addressed how treatments alter fuel particle size and quantity. We examined how mastication treatments alter the distribution of woody material size by comparing paired masticated and untreated sites in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir (Pinus ponderosa/Pseudotsuga menziesii), and 3) Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) ecosystems 2 - 4 years after mechanical treatment. As expected, total woody fuel loadings increased in the treated areas of each ecosystem. However, the magnitude of the total increase differed among the ecosystems (lodgepole pine 3 ̆e ponderosa pine 3 ̆e pinyon-juniper). Average total woody fuel loads in the untreated areas ranged between 7 to 9 Mg/ha, but increased to 29 to 50 Mg/ha in treated areas.

40|$|At 38 {{sites in}} the dry sclerophyll forests of {{south-east}} Queensland, Australia, hollow-bearing trees were studied {{to determine the effects}} of past forestry practices on their density, size and spatial distribution. The density of hollowbearing trees was reduced at sites that had been altered by poisoning and ringbarking of <b>unmerchantable</b> trees. This was especially the case for living hollow-bearing trees that were now at densities too low to support the full range of arboreal marsupials. Although there are presently enough hollow-bearing stags (i. e., dead hollow-bearing trees) to provide additional denning and nesting opportunities, the standing life of these hollow-bearing stags is lower than the living counterparts which means denning and nesting sites may be limited in the near future. The mean diameter at breast height (DBH) of hollow-bearing stags was significantly less than that of living hollow-bearing trees. This indicated that many large hollow-bearing stags may have a shorter standing life than smaller hollow-bearing stags. Hollow-bearing trees appear to be randomly distributed throughout the forest in both silviculturally treated and untreated areas. This finding is at odds with the suggestion by some forest managers that hollow-bearing trees should have a clumped distribution in dry sclerophyll forests of south-east Queensland.

40|$|Changes in {{understory}} light levels {{following a}} partial overstory harvest with three retention levels, combined with midstory/understory removal of selected species were examined. Overstory retention levels were set at basal areas (ba) 16. 1 (BA 16), 11. 6 (BA 11), and 6. 9 (BA 6) m 2 per hectare (ha). Prior to mechanical overstory removal, non-oak <b>unmerchantable</b> midstory/understory stems ≥ 5. 1 cm were injected with an aqueous herbicide solution. Hemispherical photographs {{were used to}} calculate percent canopy closure and total understory light at 1. 4 m above ground. Percent canopy closure was reduced 3, 14, 24, and 30 percent for injection only (IO), BA 16, BA 11, and BA 6, respectfully, compared to the non-harvest control (NHC) (~ 95 percent canopy closure). Understory light levels for NHC, IO, BA 16, BA 11, and BA 6 were 7 – 9 percent, 11 – 14 percent, 24 – 28 percent, 37 – 46 percent, and 44 – 52 percent of full sunlight, respectively.

40|$|Wood {{bioenergy}} development holds important opportunities —and challenges—for sustainable forest management. In the US, {{two major}} priorities in national policy— mitigating climate change, and achieving greater energy security though increased domestic renewable energy production—have converged {{to create new}} and rapidly expanding demands on US forests for wood-based bioenergy. Forest land owners may benefit from expanding wood markets, especially new markets for previously <b>unmerchantable</b> materials. However, rapid expansion of wood bioenergy facilities leading to local overcapacity could result in excessive harvesting, with significant negative consequences for biological diversity, water quality, and other important forest conservation values. Recent federal and state laws have expanded investment incentives and tax credits for wood bioenergy. This is expected to accelerate {{the development of the}} wood bioenergy industry, more than doubling the amount of woody biomass harvested from US forestlands (Perlack et al. 2005). This paper addresses three important components to ensuring that wood bioenergy and biofuels production does not lead to overharvesting and unsustainable forest use: (1) methodologies for realistic assessments of available woody biomass supply as a basis for planning new capital investment in bioenergy facilities, (2) economic, social and ecological considerations for determining suitable type, scale, and distribution of new wood bioenergy facilities, and (3) the adequacy of the existing policy framework to safeguard forest conservation values, and provide incentives for bioenergy industry development that is financially viable and sustainable over the long term...|$|E
40|$|Log hollows provide {{important}} habitat {{for a range}} of vertebrate fauna. Despite this, {{little is known about the}} impact fire regimes have on this resource, or the role topography may play in preserving hollows through the mitigation of fire intensity. This study examined the effect different combinations of fire frequency and topography have on (i) the number of hollow bearing logs and (ii) the presence and size of hollows within logs. The influence of wildfire severity and logging were also examined. Hollow availability (i. e. density of hollow bearing logs and hollow presence within logs) was greatest at sites burnt at ‘low’ frequency. The density of hollow logs was greater in gullies, though the effect of fire frequency did not vary with topographic position. Hollows showing signs of internal fire charring typically had a greater entrance width than unburnt hollows, which suggests fire plays an important role in creating large hollows. The number of hollow bearing logs increased with logging intensity, due to <b>unmerchantable</b> timber being left in situ. Wildfire severity had little effect on log hollows. The results indicate that frequent burning may reduce hollow availability, though it is likely that gullies will still retain a high density of hollow bearing logs irrespective of burning, and may play an important role in preserving connectivity of this resource across landscapes...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The {{algorithm}} RLS-PLUS {{was developed}} to yield solutions to the multivariate control problem of diameter and species optimization for mixed conifer and hardwood stands. The problem is specified with twenty-five state variables consisting of five species groups with four merchantable diameter classes and one <b>unmerchantable</b> class. This gives twenty diameter species group control variables. The large state vector allows the algorithm to account for competitive interactions among species in the optimization process. RLS-PLUS {{is an extension of}} the RLS-PATH algorithm. Specific extensions in the application of RLS-PLUS are the differentiation of species through expansion of the controls, and greater detail of the economic parameters. RLS-PLUS and RLS-PATH both limit their search to a single state space per iteration. RLS-PLUS also relies on the assumption of a monotonically increasing production function, in accordance with the PATH algorithm. RLS-PLUS was applied to the single tree, distance independent growth model ORGANON version 3. 0 (Hann, 1983). Optimal thinning trajectories prioritized the removal of the relatively slow growing, highly competitive species when stumpage values are constant across all species. Altering the stumpage values of different species groups predictably alters the prioritization of species removal. Optimal soil expectation values (SEV) determined in the twenty control variable problem ranged from seven to sixteen percent greater than if the problem state space was reduced to four diameter class controls...|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} of the thinning was to reduce basal area to 10 – 14 m 2 ha− 1 in a non-uniform pattern to mimic natural stand patterns and increase resistance to bark beetle attack (Harrod et al. 1999). Trees were removed in a low thinning, concentrating on smaller commercial tree sizes. Yarding was done by helicopter, so that branches and tops were left on site. Thinned units were slashed (small understory trees cut mechanically by hand) after harvest to fall smaller, <b>unmerchantable</b> stems. Ignition of burn units was by hand and helicopter in spring. Fuel moistures ranged from 9 – 10 %, 11 – 13 %, and 10.5 – 12 % for 1 -hr, 10 -hr and 100 -hr timelag fuels. Live fuel moistures were not measured, but typical early season herbaceous fuel moisture {{in this area is}} 175 % (Agee et al. 2002). Air temperatures during the fires ranged from 13 – 23 °C, and relative humidities ranged from 30 – 42 %. Windspeeds varied from 0 – 16 km hr− 1. Flame lengths ranged from 0.2 – 1.0 m. Because of early greenup in 2004, fire spread was patchy. On each burn unit, post-fire sampling teams visually estimated percent area burned on a 900 m 2 plot surrounding each of 30 – 35 sampling points per unit, so approximately 30 percent of each unit was sampled. Burn-only units had fire coverage of 35 and 50 %, while thin-burn units had coverage of 23 and 51 %.|$|E
40|$|Small {{community-based}} {{biomass energy}} systems sourcing feedstocks from local small-scale forests {{are common in}} the northern hemisphere but are few in Australia. Fine-grained analyses of feedstock availability are an important precursor to increased investment in these systems in Australia. This study presents estimates of the potential biomass for energy supply from hardwood plantations within the Sunshine Coast Council region of southeast Queensland. The region’s 1, 120 ha of private farm forestry, corporate-owned and joint venture hardwood plantations are predominantly small-scale (> ha) Gympie Messmate (Eucalyptus cloeziana) monocultures. Plantation age-class and corresponding area, productivity and management history findings and informed harvest-related assumptions underpin a 20 -year forecast of biomass yields from a suggested plantation harvest schedule. The biomass yields are underbark stem-wood quantities assumed to be <b>unmerchantable</b> for higher-value solid-wood products. Future thinning (at age 12 years) and clearfell harvests (age 25 years) could provide minimum woody biomass yields of 30 and 108 GMt/ha respectively. Closer to 200 GMt/ha may be available from clearfell harvests of poorly-managed farm forestry plantations. The forecast annually available biomass supply is highly variable and mostly of small quantities. Biomass energy plants seeking a sustainable supply of feedstock must therefore access additional locally-available waste biomass. Further research is required to identify and quantify these sources. Field trials are also required to understand better the likely product mixes and available volumes of biomass for energy from the region’s various hardwood plantations and to test for efficient integrated biomass harvest and supply chain systems for the sizes and terrains that are characteristic of these plantations...|$|E
40|$|July 2013. A Thesis {{presented}} to The Faculty of the Graduate School at the University of Missouri In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Master of Science. Thesis supervisor: Dr. John P. Dwyer. Questions have risen {{in recent years}} regarding the impacts of biomass harvesting for renewable energy production and on the cost and efficiency of biomass harvesting using different harvest equipment configurations. Missouri has a set of Best Management Practices (BMPs) to guide woody biomass harvesting. This study will address the different results (mainly cost and production data) that come with incorporating various BMPs and how costs and revenues can vary when implementing these different management practices. This study applied two silvicultural treatments and a control to 72 acres of oak-hickory stands comprising poles and small sawtimber-sized stems of primarily white oak (Quercus alba) and low quality black oaks (Quercus velutina) in the Missouri Ozark highlands. Treatments were: 1) clearcut {{to establish a new}} cohort of trees and 2) intermediate thin in an attempt to improve residual stand quality, in which both small diameter trees and merchantable sawlogs were removed. Both treatments used a mechanized, integrated harvest approach. Each treatment had 3 sub-treatments (clearcut had 4 sub-treatments) that called for leaving varying levels and types of residues on the ground to maintain soil nutrient pools. Trees were merchandized for the highest value possible, with biomass chips produced from limbs and tops or stems that were otherwise <b>unmerchantable.</b> A system feasibility analysis was implemented to determine productivity, costs, and prices needed for economic feasibility. An average of 49. 4 tons of SHWP and 10. 9 tons of fuel chips were removed per acre at an average cost per ton of $ 27. 70 and $ 48. 62 in the clearcut treatments, respectively. An average of 19. 1 tons of SHWP and 3. 7 tons of fuel chips were removed per acre at an average cost per ton of $ 32. 87 and $ 64. 84 in the intermediate thinning treatments, respectively.

40|$|Large-scale {{bark beetle}} (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) {{outbreaks}} across western North America have prompted widespread concerns over changes to forest wildfire potentials. Management actions following outbreaks often include {{the harvest of}} beetle-killed trees and subsequent fuel treatments to mitigate expected changes to fuel profiles, but few data exist to inform these actions. In both lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) forests of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Wyoming, USA, we used the Forest Vegetation Simulator to evaluate how fuel profiles, stand structure, and biomass carbon storage are influenced by various post-outbreak fuel treatments (removal of beetle-killed trees [‘salvage’] followed by either no treatment, prescribed burning, pile-and-burn, or whole-tree-removal). The model was initialized with field data from five unmanaged gray-stage stands in each forest type and projected over 50 years of post-treatment time. Across all treatment methods, the strongest projected effects relative to unharvested stands were reductions in coarse woody surface fuels (after 10 – 20 yr), fewer well-decayed standing snags (after 40 yr), and reduced biomass carbon storage (throughout all 50 years). The reduction in coarse woody surface fuels suggests reduced heat release and resistance to control in future fires. Projected effects on fine fuels, both in the canopy and surface layers, were surprisingly minor or short-lived; natural fall and decay of fine material in unharvested stands led to the convergence of most fuel variables between treated and untreated stands within about a decade, especially in Douglas-fir forests. Most follow-up treatment methods – whether <b>unmerchantable</b> tree parts were left in place, burned, piled, or removed entirely – had similar impacts on most aspects of fuel and stand structure in both lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir forests. However, the prescribed burning treatment was distinct and generally had the strongest effects, owing to greater consumption of forest floor mass and mortality of small trees, which had persistent influences on both the canopy and surface fuel layers. Treatment effectiveness in reducing fuels was mirrored by reductions in biomass carbon storage and recruitment of well-decayed snags, illustrating common tradeoffs involved in fuel treatments. Harvest of beetle-killed trees and subsequent treatments altered the fuel profile and structure of outbreak-impacted stands, but overall effects were similar among treatments, suggesting flexibility in management options in post-outbreak forests...|$|E
30|$|Levels of bark beetle-caused tree {{mortality}} increased substantially on unburned split plots {{compared to}} burned split plots following our initial survey. For example, in the HiD structure, we observed a 420 % {{increase in the}} number of trees killed by bark beetles (333 versus 1731) between surveys on unburned split plots compared to a 50 % increase (1139 versus 1718) on burned split plots. Similarly, in the LoD structure, we observed a > 600 % increase (41 versus 301) on unburned split plots compared to a 38 % decrease (998 versus 616) on burned split plots. Trends were similar for all individual bark beetle species (i.e., WPB, MPB, and FE) except Ips spp. where 96 % of all Ips-caused tree mortality was detected during our initial survey (Fettig et al. 2008). Ips spp. generally colonize slash, saplings, and weakened trees. Outbreaks are often short-lived, but increase in duration and extent when suitable host material is plentiful and populations grow sufficiently to colonize apparently healthy trees (Furniss and Carolin 1977). While concerns regarding Ips-population increases in logging slash and subsequent colonization of trees are important, prescriptions at BMEF included removal and utilization of slash following thinning. Accordingly, little or no slash was left within experimental plots to serve as breeding substrates for Ips beetles (Kegley et al. 1997, DeGomez et al. 2008). The response of Ips spp. to fuel reduction treatments at BMEF appears relatively short-lived and limited to fire-injured trees in the two smallest dbh classes (94 % of all cases) (Fettig et al. 2008). However, the apparent shift in WPB, MPB, and FE activity from burned to unburned split plots three to five years after the application of prescribed fire is concerning, and warrants further monitoring of these plots. The effect is likely due to unburned areas not benefiting from the positive effects of prescribed fire (e.g., on growing space three to five years after treatment) that affect tree vigor and thus susceptibility to bark beetle attack (Fettig et al. 2007). Unburned areas (split plots) were adjacent to burned areas (split plots) that likely served as an important source of beetles once the abundance of fire-injured trees that were highly susceptible to bark beetle attack declined. Interestingly, Fettig et al. (2006) observed a similar effect (albeit on a much smaller spatial scale) in another study examining the effects of chipping of <b>unmerchantable</b> trees on bark beetle activity in ponderosa pine stands. In that study, chipping following thinning increased plot risk to bark beetle attack in the short-term by the production of large amounts of attractive monoterpenes. In the longer term, it decreased hazard by increasing the amount of growing space allocated to each residual tree. Surveys along the perimeter of chipped plots revealed large numbers of recently attacked trees in untreated areas that did not benefit from the positive effects of thinning, but suffered a similar level of risk associated with high levels of monoterpenes beneath the forest canopy.|$|E
40|$|In {{his famous}} Stanford Law Review article, When Worlds Collide, 2 ̆ 7 Professor Marc Franklin foretold the {{troubles}} for American {{law in the}} impending collision of the tort of strict liability with the warranty of merchantability. 2 We daily suffer the reverberations from that collision as courts struggle with the proper application of strict tort liability and breach of warranty in products liability cases. Lawyers who have not studied Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (U. C. C.) are {{surprised to learn that}} virtually every buyer who has a strict tort claim for an injury caused by a defective product also has a potential claim in warranty for the same injury. 3 Of course, the converse is not true; many <b>unmerchantable</b> products are not 2 ̆ 2 unreasonably dangerous, 2 ̆ 24 cannot fulfill strict tort 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 physical harm 2 ̆ 2 requirement, 5 and therefore cannot be the source of a strict tort claim. These products might cause loss of revenue or commercial disappointment but do not threaten life, limb or property. Thus, the courts must not only untangle tort from warranty where each is available, but also draw the line that marks warranty 2 ̆ 7 s exclusive domain. This line is sometimes called the 2 ̆ 2 economic loss 2 ̆ 2 doctrine; loss that is solely 2 ̆ 2 economic 2 ̆ 2 may be recovered in warranty but not in tort. 6 In Part II of this Essay, I discuss the early development of strict tort, the framers of which could not have foreseen the later erosion of warranty defenses. In Part III, I discuss the reverberations of the collision of strict tort and warranty, as evidenced by cases in which courts have struggled with the proper application of those theories in the products liability context. In Part IV, I discuss several cases that reach conflicting conclusions about the availability of damages in tort or warranty where there has been no overt failure of the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s product. As I suggest below, this is a significant reverberation from the collision of tort and warranty, for the courts have sometimes confused tort and warranty, sometimes confused liability with remedy, and frequently failed to identify the theory that they were considering. In Part V, I conclude by noting that if, as appears, some damages are often available in warranty in these cases, but not in tort, then the cases raise questions as to which outcome is better and about the res judicata effect of a modest warranty recovery on a later and larger potential tort recovery. I start by defending this endeavor. Why would anyone, who did not have to do so, write about the collision of tort and warranty? Lawyers and judges must deal with this mess in our law, but any right thinking law professor could content himself with criticizing the current regime and explaining why it should be radically modified. If there were even the smallest prospect of that modification, such criticism and explanation would be justified. But there is no prospect for real reform. Having been through a fourteen-year attempt to revise the parts of Article 2 that are much farther from the heat than the warranty of merchantability, I am certain that the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) could not propose, nor the states adopt, a uniform law on products liability that would take the place of warranty and tort. The plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 lawyers would be bitter and effective opponents of such a change, and the defense bar would pay no more than lip service. Indeed, the difficult birth of the Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability (Products Liability Restatement) in the American Law Institute (ALI), 7 where any proposal needs only the vote of the membership and not the vote of any state legislature, indicates that a more radical reform would not pass the state legislatures without great difficulty. That being so, I content myself with repair of {{a small part of the}} collision 2 ̆ 7 s damage...|$|E
