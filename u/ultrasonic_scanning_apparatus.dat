40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} the damage evolution observed in carboresin specimens {{with a central}} hole subjected to cyclic tensile loading. Damage monitoring was conducted via a purpose-designed automatic <b>Ultrasonic</b> (US) <b>scanning</b> <b>apparatus,</b> whose responses were qualified by means of micrographical observations.

40|$|The {{fact that}} there are several methods in use to {{estimate}} the age or the maturity of the fetus results in the choice of one or more techniques which can be chosen according to the information that the clinician wishes to receive and the value of the methods at his disposal.
