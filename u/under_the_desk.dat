Three {{days after the}} event, Wong, who {{was born and raised}} in Montreal and is the daughter of Chinese immigrants, wrote a front-page piece titled Get <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> in which she drew a link between all three school shootings in Quebec history (the École Polytechnique, the Concordia University and the Dawson College killings) and the nature of the Quebec society and its protective language laws.|$|E
500|$|Emanuel {{declared}} in April 2006 {{that he would}} support Hillary Clinton should she pursue the presidency in 2008. Emanuel remained close to Clinton since leaving the White House, talking strategy with her {{at least once a}} month as chairman of the DCCC. However, Emanuel's loyalties came into conflict when his home-state Senator, Barack Obama, expressed interest in the race. Asked in January 2007, about his stance on the Democratic presidential nomination, he said: [...] "I'm hiding <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> I'm very far <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and I'm bringing my paper and my phone." [...] Emanuel remained neutral in the race until June 4, 2008, the day after the final primary contests, when he endorsed Obama.|$|E

50|$|By the 1990s, Citizens’ Hall was {{in severe}} disrepair. In 1988 the second-floor hall {{was closed to}} public {{functions}} because of possible structural and fire hazards. The police department made the space its own for a few years, during which time the ballroom deteriorated further. Rust spots became noticeable on the ceiling, the floor became worn <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> and chairs of department personnel, and artifacts were screwed, taped, or otherwise affixed to the plaster walls and wood wainscoting. The first floor looked even worse, as the Board of Selectmen {{made a decision to}} forego basic maintenance in an effort to persuade the town to vote on the building’s future.|$|R
2500|$|After firing {{through the}} windows at {{evacuating}} students and the police, Klebold fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall. He removed his trench coat. As Klebold fired at the three, Harris grabbed his shotgun {{and walked toward the}} lower row of computer desks, firing a single shot <b>under</b> <b>the</b> first <b>desk</b> without looking. He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. Harris then shot <b>under</b> <b>the</b> adjacent computer <b>desk,</b> injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder and hand, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery. When she started gasping in pain, Harris tersely stated, [...] "Quit your bitching." ...|$|R
500|$|The seminal {{research}} on delayed gratification – the now-famous [...] "marshmallow experiment" [...] – {{was conducted by}} Walter Mischel in the 1960s and 1970s at Stanford University. Mischel and his colleagues were interested in strategies that preschool children used to resist temptation. They presented four-year-olds with a marshmallow and told the children that they had two options: (1) ring a bell at any point to summon the experimenter and eat the marshmallow, or (2) wait until the experimenter returned (about 15 minutes later), and earn two marshmallows. The message was: [...] "small reward now, bigger reward later." [...] Some children broke down and ate the marshmallow, whereas others were able to delay gratification and earn the coveted two marshmallows. In follow-up experiments, Mischel found that children were able to wait longer if they used certain [...] "cool" [...] distraction techniques (covering their eyes, hiding <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> singing songs, or imagining pretzels instead of the marshmallow in front of them), or if they changed the way they thought about the marshmallow (focusing on its similarity to a cotton ball, rather than on its gooey, delectable taste).|$|E

50|$|Such {{developments}} could literally {{change the}} face of current machines and have far-reaching implications on how users interact with them. Hand-held devices would be designed with larger, easier-to-view screens, as no keyboard would be required. Touch-screen devices would no longer need to split the display between content and an on-screen keyboard, thus providing full-screen viewing of the content. Laptop computers could essentially be cut in half in terms of size, as the keyboard half would be eliminated and all internal components would be integrated behind the display, effectively resulting in a simple tablet computer. Desktop computers would consist of a CPU and screen, saving desktop space otherwise occupied by the keyboard and eliminating sliding keyboard rests built <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk's</b> surface. Television remote controls and keypads on dozens of other devices, from microwave ovens to photocopiers, could also be eliminated.|$|R
2500|$|Aalto also {{designed}} the furniture, {{much of which}} was intended to fit in specific rooms {{in order to maximize}} the limited space. Several of these furniture pieces were given various animal names. Each resident has a large, wheeled wardrobe (no closets in the brick rooms) called an [...] "elephant" [...] and thigh-high rolling case of drawers called an [...] "armadillo," [...] which fits neatly <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desks.</b> Occupants of <b>the</b> largest singles, called [...] "couches" [...] because they are large enough to accommodate such furniture, also have free-standing sets of shelving called [...] "giraffes." [...] The giraffe is so-named because the piece consists of a pole, which is pressed into the floor and ceiling and thus is position-adjustable, adorned with several shelves that protrude in one direction and only rise to waist height, creating a giraffe-like shape. Many residents choose to flip their giraffes upside-down in order to have more floor space.|$|R

2500|$|The second {{modification}} {{was done}} to raise <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> by adding a separate, uniform base called a plinth. [...] The first time a base was made for <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk</b> was during <b>the</b> John F. Kennedy Administration. [...] This base was made of pine and did not match <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> very well. [...] That base is very visible in the famous photo of John F. Kennedy Jr. playing <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk.</b> In January 1977, President Carter requested <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> {{be sent back to}} the White House from the Smithsonian Institution. [...] Photos from January–February 1977 show <b>the</b> Resolute <b>Desk</b> being used with a base, but the base had been removed by late May of that year, when it was photographed without it. White House record photos from early in Ronald Reagan's presidency, one as late as October 23, 1981, show <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> being used without a base. President Reagan requested that <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> be raised higher since he was hitting his legs {{on the top of the}} knee hole. The White House's earliest image of <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> with a base during the Reagan Administration is dated August 13, 1982.

50|$|Two large fires, {{occurring}} simultaneously, {{severely damaged}} {{the school building}} 1912. The fires were discovered at 8 p.m., and it took several hours to extinguish them.

60|$|Yet their {{conviction}} that they had, that very moment, heard somebody {{moving in the}} room had amounted to a certainty.

60|$|Tuesday mornings at Wrykyn were devoted--up to {{the quarter}} to eleven interval--to {{the study of}} mathematics. That is to say, {{instead of going to}} their form-rooms, the various forms visited the out-of-the-way nooks and dens {{at the top of the}} {{buildings}} where the mathematical masters were wont to lurk, and spent a pleasant two hours there playing round games or reading fiction <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> Mathematics being one of the few branches of school learning which are of any use in after life, nobody ever dreamed of doing any work in that direction, least of all O'Hara. It was a theory of O'Hara's that he came to school to enjoy himself. To have done any work during a mathematics lesson would have struck him as a positive waste of time, especially as he was in Mr Banks' class. Mr Banks was a master who simply cried out to be ragged. Everything he did and said seemed to invite the members of his class to amuse themselves, and they amused themselves accordingly. One of the advantages of being under him was that it was possible to predict to a nicety the moment when one would be sent out of the room. This was found very convenient.|$|E
6000|$|While the doctor's {{lips were}} issuing these directions, the doctor's hands were {{occupied}} in opening a drawer <b>under</b> <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> {{on which the}} ledger was placed.

[...] When a dozen of the cards had been wrapped up in a dozen lithographed letters of invitation, and inclosed in a dozen envelopes, he next consulted a list of the families resident in the neighborhood, and directed the envelopes from the list. Ringing a bell this time, instead of speaking through a tube, he summoned the man-servant, and gave him the letters, to be delivered by hand the first thing the next morning. [...] "I think it will do," [...] said the doctor, taking a turn in the Dispensary when the servant had gone out--"I think it will do." [...] While he was still absorbed in his own reflections, the nurse re-appeared to announce that the lady's room was ready; and the doctor thereupon formally returned to the study to communicate the information to Miss Gwilt.|$|E
50|$|During {{his time}} at Colditz, Fowler took part in 'Goon Baiting', which {{involved}} harassing and annoying the German guards as much as possible, <b>under</b> <b>the</b> able direction of Douglas Bader. For this, Fowler - as many others - spent time in solitary confinement.During August 1942 an escape plan was prepared for a party of officers moving through a short tunnel which started in the German Stabsfeldwebel's (sergeant major) office located near the prisoner's sick quarters. The starting location was chosen {{because it was a}} place unlikely to be thoroughly searched. Fowler was involved from the outset. The prisoners picked the office's lock and over a few nights built a tunnel which led from <b>under</b> <b>the</b> Stabsfeldwebel's <b>desk</b> to a clothing store with access to the outside. The tunnel was partly constructed by Captain Pat Reid.|$|R

I thought first I'd draw one of him and put horns and a tail on it, but I was afraid it would hurt his feelings, and Anne says you should never hurt anyone's feelings. It seems it's dreadful to have your feelings hurt. It's better to knock a boy down than hurt his feelings if you MUST do something. Milty said he wasn't scared of me but he'd just as soon call it somebody else to 'blige me, so he rubbed out Anne's name and printed Barbara Shaw's under it. Milty doesn't like Barbara 'cause she calls him a sweet little boy and once she patted him on his head." ...|$|E

He would walk about the class-room mouthing great lines in a rich roar, and asking us with a flushed face and shining eyes {{if it was not}} [...] "GLORIOUS." [...] The very sight of Greek letters brings back to me the dingy, faded, ink-splashed quality of our class-room, the banging of books, Topham's disordered hair, the sheen of his alpaca gown, his deep unmusical intonations and the wide striding of his creaking boots. Glorious! And being plastic human beings we would consent that it was glorious, and some of us even achieved an answering reverberation and a sympathetic flush. I at times responded freely. We all accepted from him unquestioningly that these melodies, these strange sounds, exceeded any possibility of beauty that lay in the Gothic intricacy, the splash and glitter, the jar and recovery, the stabbing lights, the heights and broad distances of our English tongue. That indeed was the chief sin of him. It was not that he was for Greek and Latin, but that he was fiercely against every beauty that was neither classic nor deferred to classical canons.|$|E
