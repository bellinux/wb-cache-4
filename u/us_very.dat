For example, in the <b>US</b> <b>very</b> large intervention {{programs such as}} the Head Start Program have not produced lasting gains in IQ scores. More intensive, but much smaller projects such as the Abecedarian Project have reported lasting effects, often on socioeconomic status variables, rather than IQ.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the 2012 {{outbreak}} of meningitis in the <b>U.S,</b> <b>very</b> little was known about E. rostratum including methods for diagnosing and treating infected individuals. Only 30% of 372 patient specimens sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed PCR evidence of the fungal infection. β-D-glucan assays were suggested as a potential method for early detection. The β-D-glucan assay detects (1,3)-β-D-glucan, a major component of many fungal cell walls released during cell growth. In the case of a 44-year-old man, the galactomamman assay successfully facilitated early detection of E. rostratum. However, in a subsequent study the positive results for early detection of E. rostratum were not successfully replicated.|$|E

A writer for Idolator website said that the song's minimal production [...] "remind <b>us</b> <b>very</b> much of Madge's American Life days, allowing us {{to focus on the}} lovely lyrics and Madonna's gorgeous vocals.

The band had received interest from labels by late 1974, but chose to wait for an appropriate record deal. They turned down {{a number of major}} labels, including Island Records, for whom they had recorded demos with producer Brian Eno. Eno had produced demos of the songs [...] "Prove It", [...] "Friction", [...] "Venus", and [...] "Marquee Moon" [...] in December 1974, but Television frontman Tom Verlaine did not approve of Eno's sound: [...] "He recorded <b>us</b> <b>very</b> cold and brittle, no resonance.

Time commented favorably on Alba's physical skills portraying Max, though stated she had [...] "an emotional range unusual among action babes." [...] Conversely, Joyce Millman said [...] "Cameron and Eglee give <b>us</b> <b>very</b> little incentive to care about Max as a person, the way we care about Buffy or Faith.

As Price was based in Los Angeles, the band emailed him samples of their work for him to critique and receive his suggested mixes in return. They had mixed reactions to his suggestions; {{at one point during}} production of [...] "Hapsburg Lippp" [...] – a track which did not make the final track listing – Price returned them a reggae-inspired mix as a joke. Higgs explained to Andy Morris of Gigwise that Price had an [...] "ability to become one of <b>us</b> <b>very</b> quickly". Price joined them in person for the last nine days of recording.

Oliver later said that the joke [...] "got out of hand" [...] and never used it on the show again.

Living family members of his tell of his bravery in battle. Buffalo Bill Cody was impressed with Red Shirt. “Among the prominent chiefs thus engaged was Red Shirt, a redoubtable warrior and second only in influence to Sitting Bull himself. A short while before his engagement with us he had quelled an uprising among his people, instigated by a pretender to the chieftainship of the tribe, by invading the pretender's camp with only two of his followers and shooting the leader dead before the eyes of his affrighted wife.
