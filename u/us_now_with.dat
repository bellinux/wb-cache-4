[...] So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, [...] Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, [...] That Adam now enforc't to close his eyes, [...] Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: [...] 420 [...] But him the gentle Angel by the hand [...] Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. [...] Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold [...] Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought [...] In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd [...] Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, [...] Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive [...] Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. [...] His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, [...] Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves [...] 430 [...] New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; [...] Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood [...] Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon [...] A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought [...] First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, [...] Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next [...] More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock [...] Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid [...] The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, [...] On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. [...] 440 [...] His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n [...] Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; [...] The others not, for his was not sincere; [...] Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, [...] Smote him into the Midriff with a stone [...] That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale [...] Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. [...] Much at that sight was Adam in his heart [...] Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. [...] O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n [...] 450 [...] To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; [...] Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? [...] T' whom Michael thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. [...] These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come [...] Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, [...] For envie that his Brothers Offering found [...] From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact [...] Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd [...] Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, [...] Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. [...] 460 [...] Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! [...] But have I now seen Death? Is this the way [...] I must return to native dust? O sight [...] Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, [...] Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! [...] To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen [...] In his first shape on man; but many shapes [...] Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead [...] To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense [...] More terrible at th' entrance then within. [...] 470 [...] Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, [...] By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more [...] In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring [...] Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew [...] Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know [...] What miserie th' inabstinence of Eve [...] Shall bring on men. Immediately a place [...] Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, [...] A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid [...] Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies [...] 480 [...] Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes [...] Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, [...] Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, [...] Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, [...] Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. [...] Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair [...] Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; [...] And over them triumphant Death his Dart [...] Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't [...] With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. [...] 490 [...] Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long [...] Drie-ey'd behold? Adam could not, but wept, [...] Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd [...] His best of Man, and gave him up to tears [...] A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, [...] And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. [...] O miserable Mankind, to what fall [...] Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? [...] Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n [...] To be thus wrested from us? rather why [...] 500 [...] Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew [...] What we receive, would either not accept [...] Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, [...] Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus [...] Th' Image of God in man created once [...] So goodly and erect, though faultie since, [...] To such unsightly sufferings be debas't [...] Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, [...] Retaining still Divine similitude [...] In part, from such deformities be free, [...] 510 [...] And for his Makers Image sake exempt? [...] Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then [...] Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd [...] To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took [...] His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, [...] Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. [...] Therefore so abject is thir punishment, [...] Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, [...] Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't [...] While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules [...] 520 [...] To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they [...] Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. [...] I yeild it just, said Adam, and submit. [...] But is there yet no other way, besides [...] These painful passages, how we may come [...] To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? [...] There is, said Michael, if thou well observe [...] The rule of not too much, by temperance taught [...] In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence [...] Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, [...] 530 [...] Till many years over thy head return: [...] So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop [...] Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease [...] Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: [...] This is old age; but then thou must outlive [...] Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change [...] To witherd weak & gray; thy Senses then [...] Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, [...] To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth [...] Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne [...] 540 [...] A melancholly damp of cold and dry [...] To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume [...] The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. [...] Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong [...] Life much, bent rather how I may be quit [...] Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, [...] Which I must keep till my appointed day [...] Of rendring up, Michael to him repli'd. [...] Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst [...] Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: [...] 550 [...] And now prepare thee for another sight. [...] He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon [...] Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds [...] Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound [...] Of Instruments that made melodious chime [...] Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd [...] Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch [...] Instinct through all proportions low and high [...] Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. [...] In other part stood one who at the Forge [...] 560 [...] Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass [...] Had melted (whether found where casual fire [...] Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, [...] Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot [...] To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream [...] From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind [...] Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd [...] First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought [...] Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these, [...] But on the hether side a different sort [...] 570 [...] From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, [...] Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise [...] Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent [...] To worship God aright, and know his works [...] Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve [...] Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain [...] Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold [...] A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay [...] In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung [...] Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: [...] 580 [...] The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes [...] Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net [...] Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; [...] And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star [...] Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat [...] They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke [...] Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; [...] With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. [...] Such happy interview and fair event [...] Of love & youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, [...] 590 [...] And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart [...] Of Adam, soon enclin'd to admit delight, [...] The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. [...] True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, [...] Much better seems this Vision, and more hope [...] Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; [...] Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, [...] Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. [...] To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best [...] By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, [...] 600 [...] Created, as thou art, to nobler end [...] Holie and pure, conformitie divine. [...] Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents [...] Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race [...] Who slew his Brother; studious they appere [...] Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, [...] Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit [...] Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. [...] Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; [...] For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd [...] 610 [...] Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, [...] Yet empty of all good wherein consists [...] Womans domestic honour and chief praise; [...] Bred onely and completed to the taste [...] Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, [...] To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. [...] To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives [...] Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, [...] Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame [...] Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles [...] 620 [...] Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, [...] (Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which [...] The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. [...] To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. [...] O pittie and shame, that they who to live well [...] Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread [...] Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! [...] But still I see the tenor of Mans woe [...] Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. [...] From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, [...] 630 [...] Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place [...] By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. [...] But now prepare thee for another Scene. [...] He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred [...] Before him, Towns, and rural works between, [...] Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, [...] Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, [...] Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; [...] Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, [...] Single or in Array of Battel rang'd [...] 640 [...] Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; [...] One way a Band select from forage drives [...] A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine [...] From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, [...] Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, [...] Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, [...] But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; [...] With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; [...] Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies [...] With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field [...] 650 [...] Deserted: Others to a Citie strong [...] Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, [...] Assaulting; others from the Wall defend [...] With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; [...] On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. [...] In other part the scepter'd Haralds call [...] To Council in the Citie Gates: anon [...] Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, [...] Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon [...] In factious opposition, till at last [...] 660 [...] Of middle Age one rising, eminent [...] In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, [...] Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, [...] And Judgement from above: him old and young [...] Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, [...] Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence [...] Unseen amid the throng: so violence [...] Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law [...] Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. [...] Adam was all in tears, and to his guide [...] 670 [...] Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, [...] Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death [...] Inhumanly to men, and multiply [...] Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew [...] His Brother; for of whom such massacher [...] Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? [...] But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n [...] Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? [...] To whom thus Michael; These are the product [...] Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; [...] 680 [...] Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves [...] Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, [...] Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. [...] Such were these Giants, men of high renown; [...] For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, [...] And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; [...] To overcome in Battel, and subdue [...] Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite [...] Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch [...] Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done [...] 690 [...] Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, [...] Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, [...] Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. [...] Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, [...] And what most merits fame in silence hid. [...] But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst [...] The onely righteous in a World perverse, [...] And therefore hated, therefore so beset [...] With Foes for daring single to be just, [...] And utter odious Truth, that God would come [...] 700 [...] To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High [...] Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds [...] Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God [...] High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, [...] Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward [...] Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; [...] Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. [...] He look'd, & saw the face of things quite chang'd; [...] The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, [...] All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, [...] 710 [...] To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, [...] Marrying or prostituting, as befell, [...] Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire [...] Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. [...] At length a Reverend Sire among them came, [...] And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, [...] And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft [...] Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, [...] Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd [...] Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls [...] 720 [...] In prison under Judgements imminent: [...] But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd [...] Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; [...] Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, [...] Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, [...] Measur'd by Cubit, length, & breadth, and highth, [...] Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore [...] Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large [...] For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! [...] Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small [...] 730 [...] Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught [...] Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons [...] With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. [...] Meanwhile the Southwind rose, & with black wings [...] Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove [...] From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie [...] Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, [...] Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie [...] Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain [...] Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth [...] 740 [...] No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum [...] Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow [...] Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else [...] Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp [...] Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, [...] Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces [...] Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd [...] And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, [...] All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. [...] How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold [...] 750 [...] The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, [...] Depopulation; thee another Floud, [...] Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, [...] And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard [...] By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, [...] Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns [...] His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; [...] And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. [...] O Visions ill foreseen! better had I [...] Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne [...] 760 [...] My part of evil onely, each dayes lot [...] Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst [...] The burd'n of many Ages, on me light [...] At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth [...] Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, [...] With thought that they must be. Let no man seek [...] Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall [...] Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, [...] Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, [...] And hee the future evil shall no less [...] 770 [...] In apprehension then in substance feel [...] Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, [...] Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't [...] Famin and anguish will at last consume [...] Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope [...] When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, [...] All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd [...] With length of happy days the race of man; [...] But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see [...] Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. [...] 780 [...] How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, [...] And whether here the Race of man will end. [...] To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst [...] In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they [...] First seen in acts of prowess eminent [...] And great exploits, but of true vertu void; [...] Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste [...] Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby [...] Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, [...] Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, [...] 790 [...] Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride [...] Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. [...] The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr [...] Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose [...] And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd [...] In sharp contest of Battel found no aide [...] Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale [...] Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, [...] Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords [...] Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear [...] 800 [...] More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: [...] So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, [...] Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; [...] One Man except, the onely Son of light [...] In a dark Age, against example good, [...] Against allurement, custom, and a World [...] Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, [...] Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes [...] Shall them admonish, and before them set [...] The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, [...] 810 [...] And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come [...] On thir impenitence; and shall returne [...] Of them derided, but of God observd [...] The one just Man alive; by his command [...] Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, [...] To save himself and houshold from amidst [...] A World devote to universal rack. [...] No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast [...] Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, [...] And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts [...] 820 [...] Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre [...] Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep [...] Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp [...] Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise [...] Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount [...] Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd [...] Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, [...] With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift [...] Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, [...] And there take root an Iland salt and bare, [...] 830 [...] The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. [...] To teach thee that God attributes to place [...] No sanctitie, if none be thither brought [...] By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. [...] And now what further shall ensue, behold. [...] He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, [...] Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, [...] Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie [...] Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; [...] And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass [...] 840 [...] Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, [...] As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink [...] From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole [...] With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt [...] His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. [...] The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground [...] Fast {{on the top of}} som high mountain fixt. [...] And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; [...] With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive [...] Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. [...] 850 [...] Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, [...] And after him, the surer messenger, [...] A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie [...] Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; [...] The second time returning, in his Bill [...] An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: [...] Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke [...] The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; [...] Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, [...] Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds [...] 860 [...] A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow [...] Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, [...] Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. [...] Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad [...] Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. [...] O thou that future things canst represent [...] As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive [...] At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live [...] With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. [...] Farr less I now lament for one whole World [...] 870 [...] Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce [...] For one Man found so perfet and so just, [...] That God voutsafes to raise another World [...] From him, and all his anger to forget. [...] But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, [...] Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, [...] Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde [...] The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, [...] Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? [...] To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st; [...] 880 [...] So willingly doth God remit his Ire, [...] Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, [...] Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw [...] The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh [...] Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, [...] Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, [...] That he relents, not to blot out mankind, [...] And makes a Covenant never to destroy [...] The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea [...] Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World [...] 890 [...] With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings [...] Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set [...] His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look [...] And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, [...] Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost [...] Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, [...] Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.|$|E
