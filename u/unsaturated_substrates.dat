2500|$|Asymmetric {{hydrogenation}} is {{a chemical}} reaction that adds two atoms of hydrogen preferentially {{to one of}} two faces of an <b>unsaturated</b> <b>substrate</b> molecule, such as an alkene or ketone.

A catalytic cycle is proposed {{on the basis of the}} identification of key reaction intermediates and the study of their reactivity by NMR spectroscopy. Theoretical calculations at the DFT level support that the reaction proceeds by initial κ 1 N coordination of 2 -(2 -thienyl) pyridine followed by the loss of H 2 to afford the active catalyst. Subsequently, cyclometalation of 2 -(2 -thienyl) pyridine, coordination of the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>substrate</b> (alkyne or alkene) at the vacant position trans to the hydride, and reductive elimination of the thiophene moiety occur.

5000|$|In general, most hydroamination {{catalysts}} require elevated temperatures {{to function}} efficiently, and as such, only the thermodynamic product is observed.

50|$|Unfortunately, {{like other}} metal-catalyzed heterofunctionalizations, {{addition}} of an E-H bond to an <b>unsaturated</b> <b>substrate,</b> {{a problem is}} encountered when E is a donor (hydroamination, hydrooxygenation, hydrothiolation).

Another consideration is that the P-H addition to a carbon-carbon multiple bond can occur in a variety of different ways. The selectivity of the addition can be influenced by the design of the metal catalyst. Considerably interest has been maintained in this field due to the widespread use of phosphines in asymmetric synthesis.|$|R
40|$|We {{critically}} review recent {{experimental and}} theoretical investigations into some {{key aspects of}} the chemistry of gold(I) complexes of the type [L-Au-S]X-+(-) (L = NHC carbenes and phosphanes, S = alkenes and alkynes, and X- = weakly coordinating counterion). These systems are important intermediates formed during gold-catalyzed nucleophilic additions to an <b>unsaturated</b> <b>substrate,</b> and their specific activity is largely governed by two fundamental factors: {{the nature of the}} gold-substrate bond {{and the role of the}} ion-pair structure in solution. Both are crucially influenced by the nature and properties of the auxiliary ligand L, and on this interplay we focus our discussion. The relative anion-cation orientation, investigated by NOE NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations, shows that the exact position of the counterion is determined by the natures of the ancillary ligand and substrate: the counterion is located near the substrate in the phosphane complexes, while for the NHC complexes the preferred position of the counterion is near the ligand. This tunable interionic structure opens the way to greater control over the properties and activity of these catalysts. The bond between Au-I and the <b>unsaturated</b> <b>substrate</b> is investigated using an original and powerful theoretical method of analysis. Our approach permits a rigorous definition and assessment of the charge-displacement (CD) components at the heart of the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model: substrate-to-metal (sigma donation) and metal-to-substrate (back-donation) and how these change with different ligands. The results consistently reveal that back-donation is a large and crucially important component of the Au-I-substrate bond in all systems: back-donation penetrates the external side of coordinated alkynes, where nucleophile attack is directed, thus partially mitigating the electron depletion caused by sigma donation...|$|R

5000|$|Diimide {{reductions}} {{result in}} the syn addition of dihydrogen to alkenes and alkynes.

The cis isomer is the less stable of the two; however, acid catalysis may speed up equilibration of the trans and cis isomers.(2)Diimide is typically generated either through the oxidation of hydrazine or the decarboxylation of potassium azodicarboxylate. Kinetic experiments suggest that regardless of its method of generation, the formation of diimide is rate-limiting.
