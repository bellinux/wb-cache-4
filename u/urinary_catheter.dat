40|$|Objective The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the antimicrobial activity of different chitosans (CS) against typical colonizing pathogens of the urinary tract and to assess their efficacy against bacterial adhesion and the subsequent biofilm formation on <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters.</b> Methods The antimicrobial activity of high and low molecular weight CS (50 and 150 [*]kDa) at pH[*] 5. 0 and 6. 0 was tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli clinical isolates by time–kill studies. The anti-adhesion assays on Foley <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> were performed in Artificial Urine Medium (AUM) with the addition of each CS (AUM-CS) at the same pH values. Finally, the efficacy over time of chitosan treatments on bacterial adhesion on <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> was determined. Results A viability reduction of K. pneumoniae and E. coli isolates, regardless of pH value, was evidenced in time–kill studies, in particular in the presence of CS 50 [*]kDa. As regards the anti-adhesion efficacy on <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters,</b> high and low molecular weight CS evidenced a higher efficacy to reduce bacterial adhesion at pH[*] 5. 0. A low number of viable K. pneumoniae and E. coli cells were recovered from catheters after CS treatments, highlighting a promising efficacy over time.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> are associated, {{commonly}} with bacteriuria {{and frequently}} with urinary tract infection. Tamm-Horsfall Protein (THP) is urine's most abundant protein {{and is known}} to bind to uropathogenic bacteria. The role of THP in the pathogenesis of <b>catheter</b> associated <b>urinary</b> tract infection (CAUTI) is not clear. We examined the role of THP in facilitating bacterial binding to <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> in vivo and in vitro. Findings Twenty one <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> were obtained from 20 hospitalized patients. THP was eluted from the catheter surface and catheter segments were cultured. Additional studies were performed in vitro on unused silicone and latex catheters to determine the binding of THP, {{and the effect of}} THP on the binding of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), to the catheter surface. On catheters obtained from patients, the THP deposition was significantly more on culture positive catheters than on culture negative catheters. In the in vitro studies, THP bound to both silicone and latex catheters, and THP enhanced the adherence of E. coli and P. aeruginosa to both types of catheters. Conclusion THP binds to <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> and facilitates the binding of uropathogenic bacteria to catheters. </p...|$|R

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISI. Background: Patients with non-acute {{spinal cord}} injury that carry {{indwelling}} <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> have {{an increased risk of}} urinary tract infection (UTIs). Antiseptic Silver Alloy-Coated Silicone <b>Urinary</b> <b>Catheters</b> seems to be a promising intervention to reduce UTIs; however, actual evidence cannot be extrapolated to spinal cord injured patients. The aim of this trial is to make a comparison between the use of antiseptic silver alloy-coated silicone <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> and the use of standard <b>urinary</b> <b>catheters</b> in spinal cord injured patients to prevent UTIs. Methods/Design: The study will consist in an open, randomized, multicentre, and parallel clinical trial with blinded assessment. The study will include 742 spinal cord injured patients who require at least seven days of urethral catheterization as a method of bladder voiding. Participants will be online centrally randomized and allocated to one of the two study arms (silver alloy-coated or standard catheters). Catheters will be used for a maximum period of 30 days or removed earlier if the clinician considers it necessary. The main outcome will be the incidence of UTIs by the time of catheter removal or at day 30 after catheterization, the event that occurs first. Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, as well as a primary analysis of all patients.
