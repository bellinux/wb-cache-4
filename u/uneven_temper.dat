5000|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} events in Herrnhut's history is the arrival of Maria Heller, a self-styled prophetess who had set up a similar community at Hills Plain near Benalla, Victoria in early 1875. The Hills Plain commune failed in its first year, eight of its members (among them children) dying of famine and other related ailments. Krummnow offered to bring Heller's people to Herrnhut, which he did late that year in two convoys of wagons. In March 1876 the South Australian Register reported that Krummnow had agreed [...] "to pay all their debts and to regulate their affairs, under the condition of their joining his community, and of entering into the bosom of his Church". Some accounts recall Heller as a wild woman possessed of an <b>uneven</b> <b>temper,</b> whose followers brought discontent to the austere Herrnhut community. In August 1876 police arrested Heller [...] "as a dangerous lunatic ... suffering from religious mania" [...] upon complaint by one of the Herrnhut residents. One unsubstantiated source tells of how the Hills Plain people introduced musical instruments and dance into the community. In a short time, a rift was apparent between the old and new settlers, and by late that year, Heller and her followers left. Heller settled 23 km away in Hochkirk (now Tarrington) and married a fellow Hills Plain and Herrnhut resident, Ernst Scholtz.|$|E

40|$|Influence of {{austenitization}} {{temperature of}} chrome-molybdenum-vanadium steel on structure formation at the softening heat treatment is studied. It is {{shown that the}} decline of the austenitization temperature promotes to reduce the micro-hardness values due to the intensification of spheroidizing of pearlite after the overcooling and high tempering. Increasing the austenitization temperature leads to formation of an <b>uneven</b> structure after <b>tempering...</b>|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{failures}} in thermally toughened glass are frequently reported, although the actual percentage is quite small, suppliers in the Netherlands reporting {{one or two}} cases a year while thousands of tempered panels are supplied. These cases are rarely investigated in the Netherlands because the broken thermally toughened glass is usually not in one piece and can thus not be sent for analysis. In 2015 several sliding thermally toughened glass single curved vehicle roof windows failed within several months. A butterfly pattern was seen and NiS failure was suspected by the window manufacturer. As a coloured adhesive foil had been applied during manufacturing the glass shards were kept together. The broken glass was shipped back to the supplier and was together with several non-broken roof windows sent to Delft University of Technology for analysis. The compressive surface pre-stress in the intact roof panels was measured with a SCALP 5 device. It {{was found that the}} compressive surface pre-stress varied, as bands of low compressive surface pre-stress alternating with bands of high compressive surface pre-stress appeared in the specimens. Destructive testing of the intact windows showed that the windows failed in the bands of low compressive surface pre-stress. The actual bending strength was far below the strength thermally toughened glass should have. Microscopic analysis of the butterfly fragment of the “spontaneously” failed roof windows showed that the failure was not caused by any inclusion in the glass, but started at the surface of the glass and was probably due to overloading. It is concluded that the failures were not spontaneous but the result of overloading due to <b>uneven</b> <b>tempering</b> of the glass.
