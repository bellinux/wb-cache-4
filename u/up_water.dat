40|$|Abstract. [Purpose]	 This	research	was	designed	to	find	out	how	the	so-called	“dynamic	balance ”	 is	affected	by doing different	 types	of	warm	up	exercises. In	particular,	 the	research	is	focused	on	the	difference	in	the	effect on dynamic	Balance	of	warming	<b>up</b>	in	<b>water</b>	versus	on	the	ground. [Subjects	and	Methods]	 Twenty	healthy	adults were the	subjects	of	this	study,	 with	 10 	people	assigned	each	to	two	groups,	 one	warming	<b>up</b>	in	<b>water</b>	and	another warming up	on	the	ground. The	dynamic	balance	was	measured	for	all	subjects	before	the	warming	up. 	The	group warming up	on	the	ground	conducted	active	{{stretching}}	on	the	ground,	 and	the	group	warming	<b>up</b>	in	<b>water</b>	conducted stretching in	water	by	using	water	as	resistance. [Results]	 The	results	indicate	that	warming	<b>up</b>	in	<b>water</b>	has	a	more powerful effect	on	a	subject’s	dynamic	balance	than	warming	up	on	the	ground. [Conclusion]	 The	group	warming <b>up</b> in	<b>water,</b>	 who	made	use	of	the	viscosity	and	flow	of	the	water,	 showed	better	balance	than	the	group	warming	up on the	ground. Warming	<b>up</b>	in	<b>water,</b>	 which	entails	an	element	of	resistance,	 should	be	implemented	in	warm-up routines in	the	future...|$|R

5|$|The bulk of {{the water}} intake of Hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking <b>up</b> <b>water</b> vapour from {{saturated}} air and by eating damp sand. Water loss is minimised by the rectal epithelium, which absorbs water, ensuring that the faeces is drier than the food the animal consumed. Evaporation of water through the permeable exoskeleton may, however, provide a valuable cooling effect.|$|E

5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; {{the size of}} the storm also affects the peak surge. With any storm, the area of piled <b>up</b> <b>water</b> can flow out of the storm perimeter, and this escape mechanism is reduced in proportion to the surge force (for the same peak wind speed) when the storm covers more area (storm perimeter length per area is inversely proportional to a circular storm's diameter).|$|E
5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build <b>up</b> <b>water</b> pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (a swarm of small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{out at sea}} cause large waves, heavy rain, {{flood and}} high winds, disrupting international shipping and, at times, causing shipwrecks. Tropical cyclones stir <b>up</b> <b>water,</b> leaving a cool wake behind them, which causes the region to be less favorable for subsequent tropical cyclones. On land, strong winds can damage or destroy vehicles, buildings, bridges, and other outside objects, turning loose debris into deadly flying projectiles. The storm surge, or the increase in sea level due to the cyclone, is typically the worst effect from landfalling tropical cyclones, historically resulting in 90% of tropical cyclone deaths.|$|E

5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning <b>up</b> <b>water</b> heater thermostats.|$|E
5|$|Karen devastated Guam {{with wind}} gusts {{estimated}} up to 280 km/h (185 mph). Ninety-five percent of homes were damaged or destroyed, leaving at least 45,000 people homeless. Communication and utilities were crippled, forcing officials to set <b>up</b> <b>water</b> distribution centers to prevent disease. Total losses {{on the island}} amounted to $250 million. Despite {{the severity of the}} damage, only 11 people were killed. In the wake of the storm, a massive relief operation evacuated thousands to California, Hawaii, and Wake Island. Thousands more were sheltered in public buildings, and later tent villages, for many months. More than $60 million in relief funds were sent to Guam over the following years to aid in rehabilitation. Though the storm was devastating, it spurred new building codes and a revitalized economy.|$|E
5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of arid zones, belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking <b>up</b> <b>water</b> without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E

5|$|Sewage outfalls {{into the}} lake are {{proposed}} to be completely stopped by the interception and diversion of feeder lines. Lining the main feeders {{into the lake}} and setting <b>up</b> <b>water</b> treatment plants to continuously treat and recirculate the lake water are also envisioned. Conservation measures proposed for adoption to clean the lake are by way of desilting and deweeding, water treatment at inlet of feeders into the lake, construction of check dams, conservation of ghats, afforestation of denuded hills in the catchment, soil moisture conservation measures, stabilization of sand dunes by planting vegetation of suitable species of plants and restriction of cultivation {{in the bed of}} feeder channels. In addition, the institutional measures considered for effecting improvement of the lake are mass awareness programmes with the population's participation as well as the control of fish proliferation {{to reduce the risk of}} death of fishes during periods of inadequate water depth in the lake.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the cormorants and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof plumage. However, compared to land birds, they have far more feathers protecting their bodies. This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense layer of down feathers. The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise soak <b>up</b> <b>water.</b> This allows them to swim without fighting the buoyancy that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water.|$|E
