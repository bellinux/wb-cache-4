In this study, features of begonia cuttings which could be relevant for grading were analysed.

The {{various parts of the}} <b>cuttings</b> were identified <b>and</b> measured using knowledge based {{image processing}}.

The effect of grading <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> <b>and</b> growing them with similar-sized cuttings was still apparent 4 weeks later - the rooted cuttings in graded units were more uniform than those in random units. Two models were constructed to determine the quality of the rooted cuttings based on DIP measurements, one based on multiple linear regression and one based on a neural network. Both were able to grade at least 75 % of the rooted cuttings in the same class as the expert. The neural network-based model performed slightly (5 %) better, especially for the classification of small and large plants. The lack of objective quality criteria is a major obstacle for the development of grading models for pot plants...|$|R
40|$|Summary Changes in use of both {{stored and}} newly synthe-sized sources of carbon (C) and {{nitrogen}} (N) were investigated during rooting of leafy cuttings of Larix × eurolepis A. Henry. We used dual 13 C and 15 N long-term labeling of reserves of stock plants and followed isotope dilution of the labels in the cuttings {{to determine the}} respective proportions of C and N de-rived from stock plant reserves (QC,old, QN,old) and from newly synthesized sources (QC,new, QN,new). We also assessed their partitioning into the growing needles and roots. Because root-ing development occurred over several months, destructive harvests were made during three periods (t 0 : April 9; t 1 : May 15 to June 5; t 2 : June 12 to June 26). Total C content (QC) of cut-tings did not change with time, whereas total N content (QN) decreased significantly between t 0 and t 2. In rooted <b>cuttings,</b> unlike <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings,</b> total N concentration decreased less markedly in needles and in the lower stem component between t 1 and t 2 than between t 0 and t 2. The lower stem of rooted cut-tings contained more QN,old than that of <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> <b>and</b> showed lower C:N and 13 C: 15 N ratios. The increase in QN,new in the lower stem {{was positively correlated with}} rooting status. At t 1, new roots appeared and grew mainly at the expense of QC,new and QN,old. By t 2, root growth was mainly dependent on new as-similates. We conclude that in leafy cuttings the initial amount of N reserves, rather than C reserves, may constitute a limiting factor for rooting...|$|R

The aim of this work was to evaluate eggplant suitability to be propagated by <b>unrooted</b> grafted <b>cuttings</b> using S. torvum as rootstock {{and the influence of}} this propagation technique on plant yield and fruit quality. A two years trial was performed in nursery and open field. The eggplant cultivar Birgah was used as the scion variety as well as the ungrafted controls (seedling control <b>and</b> <b>unrooted</b> <b>cutting</b> control). Two propagation techniques of the rootstock were evaluated using S. torvum and ‘Birgah’ eggplant (self-grafted) : <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> or seedlings.

The use of <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> of S. torvum, instead of seedlings, reduced considerably the length of propagation time. The shorter propagation time of the innovative propagation technique might permit propagators to overcome the propagation issues of S. torvum and to optimize the scheduling for grafted eggplant production. The use of S. torvum rootstock for grafting eggplant confirmed to enhance plant vigour and productivity.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Entomology, Washington State UniversityHybrid poplars are a short {{rotation}} woody crop {{grown for}} a variety of target markets including paper pulp, saw timber, and biofuels in the Pacific Northwest. Development of pest control strategies within hybrid poplar plantations over the last several decades has focused on controlling foliar feeding herbivores and wood boring pests, and has overlooked the epigeal arthropod community. Understanding this unstudied suite of organisms would allow pest managers to better evaluate the impact their management strategies have on the poplar agroecosystem. Qualitative surveys of the arthropod communities in hybrid poplar plantations and nearby native habitats demonstrated that a greater arthropod diversity persists in the surrounding native areas. Additionally, the poplar plantation's epigeal arthropod community was composed of species found within sampled native areas. Historically poplar research focused on protecting trees in the years following establishment through harvest from emerging pests while discounting cutting mortality by replanting areas of failure. Describing <b>unrooted</b> <b>cutting</b> transplant morality <b>and</b> distribution within newly established planting block could provide a risk assessment tool that growers could utilize to evaluate their potential crop loss. It was determined through the examination of damaged cuttings that several pests were responsible for diminishing establishment success. Identification of these risks {{led to the development of}} a management strategy to reduce mortality in newly planted areas. Soaking cuttings in imidacloprid for 48 hrs provided superior herbivore protection for <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> until root formation allowed for uptake from chemigation treatments. An additional study was motivated by the increased concern in growing `clear wood' as poplar has migrated from pulp to saw timber. The accompanying renewed interest in reducing insect galleries in mature trees led to the exploration of deploying a mass trapping, or trap out, effort to reduce populations of Prionoxystus robiniae (Lepidoptera Cossidae) in specific areas of a hybrid poplar plantation. We show that a trap out effort of roughly 5 pheromone-baited traps/ha decimated P. robiniae populations in treated areas throughout the trap out effort and three years post application.

Rooting of dormant, <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{is the first}} biological prerequisite to stand establishment. The primary objective was evaluating three developmental systems affected by site conditions: lateral and adventitious root ontogenies, root/shoot growth rates, and temperature dependent physiologies. The study tested rooting ability of 21 clones from five taxonomic backgrounds ((Populus deltoides x Populus trichocarpa) x P. deltoides 2 ̆ 7 BC 12 ̆ 7; P. deltoides 2 ̆ 7 D 2 ̆ 7; P. deltoides x Populus maximowiczii 2 ̆ 7 DM 2 ̆ 7; P. deltoides x Populus nigra 2 ̆ 7 DN 2 ̆ 7; P. nigra x P. maximowiczii 2 ̆ 7 NM 2 ̆ 7) at Ames, Iowa; Waseca, Minnesota; and Westport, Minnesota, across three planting dates during 2001 and 2002.

40|$|The rooting {{potential}} of four types or origins of Prunus avium cuttings {{from the same}} mature trees (over 20 years-old) was compared using a mist propagation bed during early Summer (June). The cuttings originated from juvenile sucker shoots of the current and previous year, and mature crown shoots (current year's lateral `long-shoots' and multi-year terminal `short shoots'). The morphological differences in inter-node length, stem diameter and leaf area between the four cutting types were highly significant (P = 0. 05), leading to large differences in <b>cutting</b> volume <b>and,</b> so it is argued, to assimilate reserves. Juvenile cuttings rooted well (65 % and 77 % rooting for hardwood and softwood shoots, respectively), while mature cuttings rooted poorly (4 % and 7 % for mature hardwood <b>and</b> softwood <b>cuttings,</b> respectively). Leaf abscission was significantly more frequent in mature hardwood cuttings (16 - 78 %) than in the other cutting types (1. 6 - 9 %) {{at the end of}} the propagation period. Leaf loss resulted from two processes: abscission and leaf rotting. Physiologically (i. e., in carbon assimilation, leaf transpiration and stomatal conductance), the four cutting types were not significantly different early in the post-severance period (day- 4); but, by day- 22, stomatal conductance was lowest in mature hardwood cuttings that still had leaves. At this time, the most physiologically-active <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> were from juvenile hardwood and mature softwood shoots. The extent of physiological and morphological variability between <b>cutting</b> types <b>and</b> their probable impact on processes affecting rooting ability is complex and highly interactive. Consequently, it is not possible to explain the causes of the variation in rooting ability between juvenile <b>and</b> mature <b>cuttings,</b> although this study suggests that the constraints to rooting are likely to reflect physiological differences between the different cutting types. It is concluded that, to resolve the debate about factors that affect the rooting ability of juvenile <b>and</b> mature <b>cuttings</b> (i. e., ontogenetic vs. physiological ageing), there is a need to achieve morphological and physiological comparability in the tissues...|$|R

In Queensland, Australia, the most widely planted forestry taxon is the Slash x Caribbean Pine hybrid (Pinus elliottii var. elliottii x P. caribaea var. hondurensis). We used histology to observe the cellular stages of root initiation and changes in this process between four different controlled temperature environments (15, 25, 30 and 35 ºC ± 2 ºC) over 16 weeks.

However, speed of development followed a growth curve with the fastest development occurring at 25 ºC and slowest at 15 ºC with rooting percentages at week 12 of 80 % and 0 % respectively. Cutting survival was good in the three cooler temperature regimes (> 80 %) but reduced to 59 % at 35 ºC.

40|$|Populus {{species are}} among the most {{productive}} tree species in Sweden. Interest in growing them has increased during the 21 st century due to political goals to increase the share of renewable energy and to increase the proportion of hardwood species in forests. Populus species {{have been shown to be}} potentially profitable, but currently they are mostly planted on abandoned agricultural land. There is a lack of knowledge about the establishment of Populus species on forest sites. There is also a lack of knowledge of how second generations can be established by root and stump sprouts, and about management of young stands. The main objective of this thesis was to focus on these issues. Site properties are important for successful establishment of Populus species and factors such as soil pH and soil moisture should be considered. Site preparation is important to control weed competition and to modify the microclimate, including soil moisture. In this thesis, mounding in relation to patch scarification, soil inversion and no intervention, were found to provide the highest survival and growth. Hybrid aspen was in most cases found to be more robust than other Populus species, but poplar plants or long <b>unrooted</b> <b>cuttings</b> showed similar survival and faster growth at the site where soil pH was high. In general, short <b>unrooted</b> poplar <b>cuttings</b> showed high mortality on forest sites. In water saturated soils, the growth of poplar <b>cuttings</b> was inhibited <b>and</b> roots were located closer to the soil surface. This was mainly caused by the absence of callus roots originating at the base of the cutting. Poplar stump sprouts can be used successfully for regeneration if the clones can produce living straight sprouts. Variability in this trait was found in one of the studies in this thesis. A second generation of naturally-regenerated hybrid aspen can produce over 100, 000 root suckers per hectare. If no early management is conducted, biomass will be lost through self-thinning. It was shown in this study that a substantial amount of biomass can be harvested schematically through corridors or cross-corridors, resulting in stimulated stem diameter development. An additional early thinning further increased the diameter on crop trees. In this thesis, site-adapted management of Populus species is suggested to be the most important measure to achieve successful regeneration. In particular, this includes choosing species and clones adapted to specific site properties. A second generation can be established either by stump sprouts (poplars) or root suckers (hybrid aspen). If larger-dimensioned trees are desired, early thinnings are important in the second generation...|$|R
