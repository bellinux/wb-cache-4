25|$|Since the 6th century BC, {{cane sugar}} {{producers}} have crushed the harvested vegetable material from sugarcane {{in order to}} collect and filter the juice. They then treat the liquid (often with lime (calcium oxide)) to remove impurities and then neutralize it. Boiling the juice then allows the sediment to settle to the bottom for dredging out, while the scum rises to the surface for skimming off. In cooling, the liquid crystallizes, usually {{in the process of}} stirring, to produce sugar crystals. Centrifuges usually remove the uncrystallized syrup. The producers can then either sell the sugar product for <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>is,</b> or process it further to produce lighter grades. The later processing may take place in another factory in another country.|$|E
500|$|Rylands v Fletcher {{contained}} {{the principle that}} [...] "the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril, and, {{if he does not}} do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape", with a requirement that this use of land be [...] "non-natural". On the Cambridge Water Company's third claim, Kennedy was forced to consider the meaning of [...] "non-natural" [...] in this setting. He held that the use of industrial chemicals was not [...] "non-natural", given that it was on an industrial site, and that for a claim to succeed under Rylands the use must be [...] "some special use bringing increased danger to others, and must not merely be the ordinary use of the land or such a <b>use</b> <b>as</b> <b>is</b> proper for the general benefit of the community"; Eastern Counties Leather created jobs in Sawston, and was thus providing a benefit for the community. As such, the Company's claim under Rylands was not valid. Kennedy also chose to consider foreseeability of harm a factor in cases brought under Rylands, and stated the fact that harm was not foreseeable was a factor in his decision.|$|E

That canal has since closed, but the subsequent Canal du Rhone au Rhine, Canal de la Marne au Rhin and Grand Canal dAlsace are still in <b>use,</b> <b>as</b> <b>is</b> the important activity of the Port autonome de Strasbourg.
