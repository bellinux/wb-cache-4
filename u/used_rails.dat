50|$|In 1905, the East Waterford Lumber Company {{erected a}} sawmill, a double stave mill, and a lath mill on the {{southwest}} edge of East Waterford. The company owned timber lands in Kansas Valley and Horse Valley, south and east of the town, and chartered its own logging railroad, the East Waterford and Kansas Valley Railroad, to bring timber to the company's mills. The company's railroad, built with the <b>used</b> <b>rails</b> and equipment of the Perry Lumber Company, was constructed to the same gauge as the Tuscarora Valley, to which it connected. The sawmill, with a capacity of 30,000 board feet per day, was relatively small when compared to its contemporaries elsewhere in Pennsylvania. However, it was sufficient for the East Waterford operation, which shipped over the Tuscarora Valley until 1908. At that time, the logging railroad and facility were sold, dismantled, and shipped to the Midlothian, Maryland operation of the Juniata Lumber Company (a co-owner {{of which was the}} local broker H.C. Hower).|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} tracks {{consisted of}} wooden rails on transverse wooden sleepers, which helped maintain the spacing of the rails. Various developments followed, with cast iron plates laid {{on top of}} the wooden rails and later wrought iron plates or wrought iron angle plates (angle iron as L-shaped plate rails). Rails were also individually fixed to rows of stone blocks, without any cross ties to maintain correct separation. This system also led to problems, as the blocks could individually move. The first version of Isambard Kingdom Brunel's [...] broad gauge system <b>used</b> <b>rails</b> laid on longitudinal sleepers whose rail gauge and elevation were pinned down by being tied to piles (conceptually akin to a pile bridge), but this arrangement was expensive and Brunel soon replaced it with what became the classic broad gauge track, in which the piles were forgone and transoms, similar to sleepers, maintained the rail gauge. Today, most rail track uses the standard system of rail and sleepers; ladder track is used in a few applications.|$|E
40|$|Ductile {{materials}} commonly exhibit {{plastic deformation}} at {{and near the}} contact surface and their flow behaviour at large strain has a clear effect on wear resistance. These materials almost always fail while under high levels of compression, but behaviour under these conditions cannot be investigated by standard materials tests at atmospheric pressure. In this work, {{the characteristics of the}} near-surface region of one new and four <b>used</b> <b>rails</b> are examined using samples from rails which have been in service in the UK. The results are presented as stress-strain response curves from the materials under high hydrostatic compression conditions, which are typical of rail-wheel contacts. In addition, shear strain and hardness variation with depth below the worn rail surface are presented, along with micrographs of the sites examined. A thin white surface layer, frequently called white etching layer (WEL), with high hardness (up to 1040 HV) was observed on the surface of one of the <b>used</b> <b>rails.</b> These results have application in the modelling of rail failure by wear and in modelling rolling contact fatigue crack initiation, and can therefore be used to improve rail maintenance planning and risk assessments...|$|E

40|$|Rolling-sliding, cyclic contact of {{wheel and}} rail {{progressively}} alters the microstructure of the contacting steels, eventually leading to micro-scale crack initiation, wear and macro-scale crack {{growth in the}} railhead. Relating the microstructural changes to subsequent wear and cracking is being accomplished through modelling at three spatial scales: (i) bulk material (ii) multi-grain and (iii) sub-grain. The models incorporate detailed information from metallurgical examinations of <b>used</b> <b>rails</b> and tested rail material. The initial 2 -dimensional models representing the rail material are being further developed into 3 -dimensional models. Modelling is taking account of thermal effects, and traffic patterns to which the rails are exposed...|$|E

40|$|Large shear strains {{develop in}} the near-surface region under the running band of railway rails. Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) cracks often {{initiate}} in this region, causing major problems for the railway industry. However, characterization of the constitutive and fatigue behavior of this region is difficult due to the large gradient of properties. In the present thesis, the deformed microstructure in this region is characterized. An axial-torsion test rig is used to predeform cylindrical low-cycle fatigue specimens {{in order to obtain}} material properties {{similar to those of the}} near-surface region in rails. These specimens are more suitable for further mechanical testing, compared to those resulting from many of the other predeformation methods described in the literature. The obtained material is compared to field samples in terms of the material hardness and microstructure. The microstructure is evaluated with both optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. This comparison shows that the predeformed material state closely resembles what is found in some <b>used</b> <b>rails</b> at a depth between 50 and 100 μm. In order to describe the behavior of the material during the large shear deformations, a sound framework for finite strain metal plasticity is needed. Several options are available in the literature, but in this thesis two frameworks for hyperelasto-plasticity with kinematic hardening are investigated. It is shown that for appropriate choices of Helmholtz' free energy these frameworks are equivalent. Furthermore, several material models formulated within this framework are evaluated in terms of their abilities to predict the mechanical response during the predeformation. Particular emphasis is put on the role of the kinematic hardening laws and how these influence the response during the biaxial loading. It is found that by combining different models from the literature, the predeformation process can be modeled accurately...|$|E
