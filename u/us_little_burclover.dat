Speaking of stuttering tells <b>us</b> <b>little</b> about the differences that exist {{as well as at the}} level of audible symptoms as about the eventual causes of that precise stuttering moment. It is this complexity and these dynamics that are questioned in this article. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Existing studies tell <b>us</b> <b>little</b> about care quality {{variation}} {{within the}} community health center (CHC) delivery system. They also tell <b>us</b> <b>little</b> about the organizational conditions associated with CHCs that deliver especially high quality care. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the operational practices associated with a sample of high performing CHCs. METHODS: Qualitative case studies of eight CHCs identified as delivering high-quality care relative to other CHCs were used to examine operational practices, including systems to facilitate care access, manage patient care, and monitor performance. RESULTS: Four common themes emerged that may contribute to high performance. At the same time, important differences across health centers were observed, reflecting differences in local environments and CHC capacity. CONCLUSIONS: In the development of effective, community-based models of care, adapting care standards to meet the needs of local conditions may be important...|$|R
