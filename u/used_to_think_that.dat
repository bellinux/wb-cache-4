25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

People <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we would simply roll over when playing out of India, but we changed the image. [...] Absolutely, and that came from self-belief that, that we had the ability to do well outside India." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} vocals for Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid project Sun City in August 1985, Bono made {{an additional}} {{contribution to the}} album in October that was inspired by his burgeoning interest in roots music. While in New York, he spent time with musicians Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who played him blues and country music. Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genres, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. He realised that U2 [...] "had no tradition" [...] and {{felt as if they}} [...] "were from outer space". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song [...] "Silver and Gold", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood and convinced Van Zandt to add to Sun City. Until that time, U2 had been apathetic towards roots music, but after spending time with the Waterboys and fellow Irish band Hothouse Flowers, they felt a sense of indigenous Irish music blending with American folk music. Nascent friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Richards encouraged Bono to look back to rock's roots and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. He explained, [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> writing words was old-fashioned, so I sketched. I wrote words on the microphone. For The Joshua Tree, I felt {{the time had come to}} write words that meant something, out of my experience." [...] Dylan told Bono of his own debt to Irish music, while Bono further demonstrated his interest in music traditions in his duet with Irish Celtic and folk group Clannad on the track [...] "In a Lifetime".|$|E

[...] said Mrs Griffith, {{absolutely}} sobbing at {{her young}} mistress's feet {{up in her}} bed-room; [...] "I did say that it could never go on like <b>that.</b> I did <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the Lord Almighty would never let it go on like that! It couldn't be that Mr Henry Jones was to remain always landlord of Llanfeare." ...|$|R

2500|$|When the {{brothers}} have finished, Meliboeus remarks that, whilst he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> their poems/songs were uncouth and rustic, {{he thinks that}} {{the brothers}} have sung very sweetly - [...] and that he prefers it to the nectar that Paelignian bees like to taste.|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God. I hesitate to call it a vow, it was rather a promise to myself but later I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it was my obligation …" ...|$|E
2500|$|After Lewis became {{chairman}} of the defense appropriations subcommittee in 1999, earmarks in defense bills exploded. [...] "We <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Lewis would be a champion for smart spending," [...] said Keith Ashdown of the watchdog group [...] [...] "But he brought us the biggest increase in defense earmarking in history." [...] A study by that group found that Lowery's clients have had a remarkable success rate before Lewis' committee. [...] "Hundreds {{of millions of dollars}} have gone to this one firm's clients," [...] says Ashdown.|$|E

At last I had to believe what I saw. There was no <b>use</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> my eyes had made a mistake. It was all just as plain to me as you are now.|$|R
2500|$|Although {{embracing}} and propagating Universalism, {{he regarded}} Hinduism {{the best of}} all religions, and Advaita Vedanta the best of what Indian religious thought had to offer. According to Vivekananda the greatest misfortune of the world is we do not tolerate and accept other religions. In his lecture in Parliament of religions on September 15, 1893, he told a story of a frog who lived in a well for a long time, he was born there and brought up there and he <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> nothing in the world can be bigger than that. Swami Vivekananda concluded the story: ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, Coetzee criticised {{contemporary}} anti-terrorism laws as resembling those {{employed by}} the apartheid regime in South Africa: [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the people who created [...] laws that effectively suspended {{the rule of law}} were moral barbarians. Now I know they were just pioneers ahead of their time". The main character in Coetzee's 2007 Diary of a Bad Year, which has been described as blending [...] "memoir with fiction, academic criticism with novelistic narration" [...] and refusing [...] "to recognize the border that has traditionally separated political theory from fictional narrative", shares similar concerns about the policies of John Howard and George W. Bush.|$|E
2500|$|Bublé had {{a strong}} passion for ice hockey and {{wanted to become a}} {{professional}} hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but he believed he wasn't good enough. [...] "I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was any good at hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now." [...] He often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he [...] "went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> being named Michael Bublé was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla." [...] Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.|$|E
5000|$|The {{autobiography}} {{detailed the}} harrowing experiences of her early life—in a Nazi concentration camp, her search through Europe in Red Cross refugee camps for her father, and her escape from East Berlin, {{one step ahead}} of the Volkspolizei. [...] "I always had a big mouth and <b>used</b> <b>to</b> go on about the political schooling interrupting my quest for thespian glory. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> like <b>that.</b> Not good in a police state." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't look so nice," [...] Mysa replied frankly. [...] "I <b>used</b> {{at first}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> short, wavy golden hair of yours was strange, {{and that you}} would look better in a wig like other people; but now I am sorry it is gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not for me, since I cannot see myself, {{particularly}} if I {{have to call}} you Mrs. Conolly. If I may call you Marian, as I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> our conversation will contain fewer reminders of the lapse of time." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although such occurrences were commonplace on the Eastern Front {{from both}} sides, {{they were a}} rarity in the West, and the outraged Americans were {{determined}} to prosecute all those with responsibility for this massacre. Here Rundstedt's problem was his reputation. The Ardennes offensive was known to the Allies as [...] "the Rundstedt offensive", and the Allied press routinely described him as being in charge of it. The British commander in Europe, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, said on 7 January 1945: [...] "I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Rommel was good, but my opinion is that Rundstedt would have hit him for six. Rundstedt is the best German general I have come up against." [...] Since Rundstedt, {{as far as the}} Allies knew, {{was in charge of the}} offensive, it followed for them that he was responsible for what his subordinates did during it.|$|E

60|$|The boys, who {{had been}} as good as gold to me all through my trouble, felt dreadfully bad over this, and coaxed me hard to stay. They said if I'd start a {{boarding}} house I'd have all the boarders I could accommodate; but I knew it was no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of <b>that,</b> because I wasn't strong enough, and help was so hard to get. No, {{there was nothing for}} it but Northfield and stagnation again, with not a stray boy anywhere to mother. I looked the dismal prospect square in the face and made up my mind to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think so, too," [...] Mrs. Cunningham agreed. [...] "I am {{sure that}} even had the Squire's death come quietly, {{in the course of}} nature, {{it would have been a}} terrible blow to him. He was fond of you and Millicent, but his affection for your father was a passion; his face always lit up when he spoke <b>to</b> him. I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{sometimes}} <b>that</b> it was like an old dog with his master. It was quite touching to see them together. I think, Mark, with you, that it is best that it should be as it is." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'How sweet {{it is to}} {{hear you}} say so! And the {{wonderful}} thing is that you have never seemed disappointed. I always expected that some day after marriage--not immediately, perhaps, {{but at the end of}} a week or so--you would suddenly give a start, like those poor people who are hypnotised, and you would say, [...] "Why, I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she was pretty! I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she was sweet! How could I be so infatuated over a little, insignificant, ignorant, selfish, uninteresting--" [...] O Frank, the neighbours will see you?' ...|$|E
60|$|They {{would not}} let Jaquetta and {{me go to the}} funeral; and they were wise, for Hester thrust herself in--but it is of no <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about <b>that.</b> Indeed, there is not much to tell about that time, and I need not go into the investigation. It was all taken out of our hands, as my brother had said. Perrault came over from Canada, and brought his witnesses, but not Joel Lea. He had nothing to prove, had {{conscientious}} scruples about appearing in an English court of justice, and still hoped it would all come to nothing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you {{are only}} a man, and you need not be amazed," [...] said his sister. [...] "This is the way I have been {{thinking}} of it: if you ever do want to get married, I hope you will not marry Dora Bannister. I <b>used</b> sometimes <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{that might be a}} good thing to do, though I changed my mind very often about it, but I do not think so, now, at all. Dora is an awfully nice girl in ever so many ways, but since I have been at Barport with her, I am positive that I do not want you to marry her." ...|$|R
40|$|Information {{is built}} on top of single or {{aggregation}} of data, {{for quite a long}} time people <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> cyberspace is a “black hole” without memory where you pour data without any side effect. Young generations shared on line sensitive information in order to access a videogame or chat with friends or more recently posted images and clips about their private life. In the “Appification” era there are almost no limits to data collection and reuse, “someone” knows exactly where you are now and where you have been, APPs may collect your medical data, fitness program, your expenses or collect and analyse your contacts, your photos or video clips. In recent times crowd data collection, open and big data, more or less anonymised, provided the big framework. We live in a world in which there are already countless sensors and smart objects around us, all the time. The car we drive, the phone in our pocket, our wristwatch, the clothes we wear, are smart and connected, then the concept of “private” becomes far more ephemeral. This is not enough, what it is not collected by APPs it will be collected in a seamless mode by IoT[2]; of course IoT will add a lot to our life but this will cost us a significant part of our privacy. Starting from all these aspects the paper will deal with main aspects concerning ownership, moral rights, privacy, ethics, legal framework, security, OSINT and more...|$|R
