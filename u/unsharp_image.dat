50|$|This {{aberration}} {{is quite}} distinct {{from that of}} the sharpness of reproduction; in unsharp, reproduction, the question of distortion arises if only parts of the object can be recognized in the figure. If, in an <b>unsharp</b> <b>image,</b> a patch of light corresponds to an object point, the center of gravity of the patch may be regarded as the image point, this being the point where the plane receiving the image, e.g., a focusing screen, intersects the ray passing through the middle of the stop. This assumption is justified if a poor image on the focusing screen remains stationary when the aperture is diminished; in practice, this generally occurs. This ray, named by Abbe a principal ray (not {{to be confused with the}} principal rays of the Gaussian theory), passes through the center of the entrance pupil before the first refraction, and the center of the exit pupil after the last refraction. From this it follows that correctness of drawing depends solely upon the principal rays; and is independent of the sharpness or curvature of the image field. Referring to fig. 4, we have O'Q'/OQ = a' tan w'/a tan w = 1/N, where N is the scale or magnification of the image. For N to be constant for all values of w, a' tan w'/a tan w must also be constant. If the ratio a'/a be sufficiently constant, as is often the case, the above relation reduces to the condition of Airy, i.e. tan w'/ tan w= a constant. This simple relation (see Camb. Phil. Trans., 1830, 3, p. 1) is fulfilled in all systems which are symmetrical with respect to their diaphragm (briefly named symmetrical or holosymmetrical objectives), or which consist of two like, but different-sized, components, placed from the diaphragm in the ratio of their size, and presenting the same curvature to it (hemisymmetrical objectives); in these systems tan w' / tan w = 1.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} issue within radiology today {{is how to}} reduce the radiation dose during CT examinations without compromising the image quality.

Temperature jump in all directions is evident near 25 " (90. 5 kpc) corresponding to the average Mach number 1. 44 ± 0. 05, while another jump from 7. 47 keV to 9. 10 keV at 68 " (246 kpc) in the north-west direction, corresponding to Mach number 1. 22 ± 0. 06 and these jumps are associated with the cold fronts.

40|$|The Milky Way (MW) bulge shows a boxy/peanut or X-shaped bulge (hereafter BP/X) {{when viewed}} in {{infrared}} ormicrowave bands.

Although only the latter two families (comprising 7. 5 per cent of the total mass) show a distinct X-shape in <b>unsharp</b> masked <b>images,</b> we find that nearly all bar orbit families contribute some mass to the 3 D BP/X-shape.

40|$|A new {{scheme of}} <b>unsharp</b> masking for <b>image</b> {{contrast}} enhancement {{is presented in}} this paper. An adaptive algorithm is introduced so that a sharpening action is performed only in locations where the image exhibits significant dynamics. Hence, the amplification of noise in smooth areas is reduced. An adaptive directional filtering is also performed so as to provide suitable emphasis to the different directional characteristics of the detail. Because {{it is capable of}} treating high-detail and medium-detail areas differently, this algorithm also avoids unpleasant overshoot artifacts in regions of sharp transitions. Experimental results demonstrating the usefulness of the adaptive operator in an application involving preprocessing of images for enhancement prior to zooming are also included in the paper. 1.

30|$|Image {{enhancement}} {{techniques have}} been widely used in various applications in the past few decades, including face recognition [1, 2], micro-imaging [3] and intelligent video surveillance system [4] etc.. The primary purpose of image enhancement is to improve the contrast or perception of an image without losing details or introducing novel artifacts. In generally, many classical enhancement methods have been proposed, including sigmoid based algorithms [5], logarithmic domain algorithms [6], histogram equalization (HE) algorithms [7, 8], unsharp masking algorithms [9], and Retinex algorithms [10]. Sigmoid and logarithmic based methods are simple and effective for global brightness and contrast enhancement, but spatial information of images are not considered. HE algorithm is simple and widely used. But it is limited for the uneven illumination images, especially for dark areas. For <b>unsharp</b> masking algorithms, <b>images</b> are decomposed into high-frequency and low-frequency terms, which are processed respectively.

40|$|Why are the nuclei of some galaxies {{more active}} than others? If most galaxies harbor a central massive black hole, the main {{difference}} is probably in how well it is fueled by its surroundings. We investigate the hypothesis that such a difference {{can be seen in}} the detailed circumnuclear morphologies of galaxies using several quantitatively defined features, including bars, isophotal twists, boxy and disky isophotes, and strong non-axisymmetric features in <b>unsharp</b> masked <b>images.</b> These diagnostics are applied to 250 high-resolution images of galaxy centers obtained in the near-infrared with NICMOS on HST. To guard against the influence of possible biases and selection effects, we have carefully matched samples of Seyfert 1, Seyfert 2, LINER, starburst and normal galaxies in their basic properties, taking particular care to ensure that each was observed with a similar average scale (10 - 15 parsecs per pixel). Several morphological differences among our five different spectroscopic classifications emerge from the analysis. The HII/starburst galaxies show the strongest deviations from smooth elliptical isophotes, while the normal galaxies and LINERS have the least disturbed morphology. The Seyfert 2 galaxies have significantly more twisted isophotes than any other category, and the early-type Seyfert 2 s are significantly more disturbed than the early-type Seyfert 1 s. The morphological differences between Seyfert 1 s and 2 s suggest that more is at work than simply the viewing angle of the central engine. They may correspond to different evolutionary stages.

40|$|The nuclei {{of galaxies}} often host small stellar discs with scale-lengths {{of a few}} tens of parsecs and luminosities up to 10 ^ 7 Lsun. To {{investigate}} the formation and properties of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs), we look for their presence {{in a set of}} N-body simulations studying the dissipationless merging of multiple star clusters in galactic nuclei. A few tens of star clusters with sizes and masses comparable to those of globular clusters observed in the Milky Way are accreted onto a pre-existing nuclear stellar component: either a massive super star cluster or a rapidly rotating, compact disc with a scale-length of a few parsecs, mimicing the variety of observed nuclear structures. Images and kinematic maps of the simulation time-steps are then built and analysed as if they were real and at the distance of the Virgo cluster. We use the Scorza-Bender method to search for the presence of disc structures via photometric decomposition. In one case the merger remnant has all the observed photometric and kinematic properties of NSDs observed in real galaxies. This shows that current observations are consistent with most of the NSD mass being assembled from the migration and accretion of star clusters into the galactic centre. In the other simulation instead, we detect an elongated structure from the <b>unsharp</b> masked <b>image,</b> that does not develop the photometric or kinematic signature of a NSD.

Both the cavities are of ellipsoidal shape and exhibit {{an order of magnitude}} deficiency in the X-ray surface brightness compared to that in the undisturbed regions. Spectral analysis of X-ray photons extracted from the cavities lead to the temperature values equal to 1. 77 _- 0. 12 ^+ 0. 19 keV for N-cavity and 1. 53 _- 0. 06 ^+ 0. 05 keV for S-cavity, while that for the excess X-ray emission region is found to be equal to 2. 06 _- 0. 07 ^+ 0. 12 keV.

Two important links to productivity in the computed/digital radiography (CR/DR) workflow chain are the postprocessing step by technologists and the primary diagnosis step by radiologists, who may apply additional image enhancements to aid them in diagnosis. With the large matrix size of CR and DR images and the computational complexity of these algorithms, it has been challenging to provide interactive image enhancement, particularly on full-resolution images. We have used a new programmable processor as the main computing engine of enhancement algorithms for CR or DR images. We have mapped these algorithms to the processor, maximally utilizing its architecture.

40|$|We present UBR and Hα imaging of NGC 1620, {{a highly}} {{inclined}} spiral galaxy {{that contains a}} large scale, arc-like feature of radius 3 kpc in its outer disk {{at a distance of}} ∼ 11 kpc from the center. What is unusual about this arc-like feature is its stellar nature and the presence of a luminous star cluster at its center. The arc is fragmented into HII region complexes and OB star clusters and shows two kinks in optical continuum light. It spans an angle of 220 ^∘ on our U image and a full, though fragmented, circle on an <b>unsharp</b> masked R <b>image.</b> It is centered on a young star cluster that is the most luminous clump in blue optical continuum light besides the nucleus of the galaxy. This central star cluster has UBR colors and a surface brightness similar to those of other HII regions, but is a relatively weak Hα emitter. It consists of at least three unresolved condensations in optical continuum light. Its location {{at the center of the}} arc and its prominence within the galaxy suggests that it has been the site of several generations of supernova explosions that swept up the surrounding gas into a supershell. When it attained a radius of 0. 5 - 1 kpc, this shell became gravitationally unstable and formed the stars which now delineate the arc. The constraints imposed by the survival of the expanding arc against random stellar motions and the age of the stars in the arc yield a required energy input by a minimum of 400 and a maximum of 6500 supernovae. In this scenario the asymmetry in surface brightness of the arc reflects the radial gradient of the gas density in the disk of NGC 1620, while the kinks reflect inhomogeneities in the original gas distribution with respect to the central star cluster.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigated}} {{the structures of}} the central regions of galaxies. This was done by characterising {{some aspects of the}} central massive objects (CMOs) found to live in the galactic nuclei, such as studying the possible formation scenarios, stellar properties and scaling relations using a variety of methods. In Chapter 1 we highlighted the importance of understanding the physical properties of CMOs in galaxies by exploring their possible connection with the host galaxies. We reviewed the previous works on the properties, formations scenarios, and scaling relations of supermassive black holes (SBHs), nuclear star clusters (NSCs), and nuclear stellar discs (NSDs) which reside in galactic nuclei. SBHs are believed to be the cause of the past or present activity of the galaxies. The masses of the SBHs range between 10 ^ 6 and 10 ^ 10 M_⊙ and can be measured with several methods. SBHs are found to correlate with several properties of their host galaxy and their formation is still unclear. NSCs are commonly found in the centres of both elliptical and disc galaxies. They are very massive (M_NSC∼ 10 ^ 5 − 10 ^ 8 M_⊙), very compact (r_e ∼ 5 pc), and very bright (− 14 < M_I < − 10). They can have multiple stellar populations, possessing both an old spheroidal component and a younger elongated disc or ring component. The mass of NSCs tightly correlates with the total mass of the galaxy, but several other correlations have been proposed to link the properties of the NSCs with those of the host galaxy. A combined scenario where star formation occurs in the centre of galaxies after dissipation processes and mass accretes via the mergers of globular clusters seems the more plausible way to form NSCs. NSDs are small (h ∼ 10 − 50 pc) and bright (μ_ 0,V ∼ 16 − 19 mag arcsec^(− 2 ^) discs. They never dominate the light distribution of the galactic nuclei, and locally contribute at most half the galaxy surface brightness. They are fragile systems and do not survive a major merger. Their stellar population has been studied in details in only a few objects, showing a variety of phenomena. NSDs follow the same relation between the central face-on surface-brightness and the scalelength as the main discs of lenticular and spiral galaxies and embedded discs of early-type galaxies. No other relation was found with the properties of the host galaxy. The external capture or the secular infall of gas into the centre where it accumulates, dissipates and forms stars are the most studied scenarios to form NSDs. SBHs, NSCs, and NSDs have been observed to coexist in some galaxies, rising the question whether they are incarnations of the same object and share a common formation scenario. Then in Chapter 2 we investigated the formation and properties of NSDs by looking for their presence in a set of N−body simulations studying the dissipationless merging of multiple star clusters in galactic nuclei. A few tens of star clusters with sizes and masses comparable to those of globular clusters observed in the Milky Way are accreted onto a pre-existing nuclear stellar component: either a massive super star cluster or a rapidly rotating, compact disc with a scalelength of a few parsecs, mimicking the variety of observed nuclear structures. Images and kinematic maps of the simulation time-steps were then built and analysed as if they were real and at the distance of the Virgo cluster. We used the Scorza-Bender method to search for the presence of disc structures via photometric decomposition. In one case the merger remnant had all the observed photometric and kinematic properties of NSDs observed in real galaxies. This shows that current observations are consistent with most of the NSD mass being assembled from the migration and accretion of star clusters into the galactic centre. In the other simulation instead, we detected an elongated structure from the <b>unsharp</b> masked <b>image,</b> that does not develop the photometric or kinematic signature of an NSD. Thus, in the context of searches for a disc structure, the Scorza-Bender method is a robust and necessary tool. In Chapter 3 we investigated the structure and properties of the stellar population of the nuclear regions of the interacting SB 0 galaxy NGC 1023 through a detailed analysis of archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging and ground-based integral-field spectroscopy. The stars of the nuclear disc are remarkably younger and more metal-rich with respect to the host bulge. These findings support a scenario in which the nuclear disc is the end result of star formation in gas piled up in the galaxy centre. The gas can be of either internal or external origin, i. e. from either the main disc of NGC 1023 or the nearby interacting satellite NGC 1023 A. The dissipationless formation from already formed stars through the migration and accretion of star clusters into the galactic centre is rejected. In Chapter 4 we presented a dynamical analysis aimed at constraining the mass of the CMOs in the lenticular galaxy NGC 383 at a distance of 63. 4 Mpc. The central stellar velocity dispersion is consistent with a putative SBHwith a mass of 5. 8 x 10 ^ 8 M_⊙. We presented archival HST imaging and spectroscopic observations obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 mounting the F 814 W filter and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph using the G 570 M grism, respectively. The data provide detailed information on the structure and mass profile of the stellar component, the dust optical depth, and the spatial distribution and kinematics of the ionised gas within the innermost region of the galaxy. Dynamical models, which account for the observed stellar mass profile and include the contribution of a NSC and a central SBH, were constructed to reproduce the kinematics derived from the [N II]λ 6583 emission line along three slit positions crossing the nucleus and parallel to the galaxy major axis. A secure SBH detection with a mass of 8. 5 (+ 1. 8 - 1. 3) x 10 ^ 8 M_⊙ was obtained when a single CMO is considered. If we account for the presence of the NSC, then the masses of the SBH and NSC were 6. 0 (+ 1. 8 - 1. 2) x 10 ^ 8 M_⊙ and M_NSC = 8. 9 (+ 5. 0 - 3. 9) x 10 ^ 7 M_⊙, respectively. Both are consistent with the scaling relations linking the mass of CMOs with the properties of their host galaxy. These measurements prove that SBHs can coexist with NSCs and represent an important step forward in the characterisation of CMOs. The main conclusions of this thesis can be summarised as follows: 1) NSDs can form via accretion events, but a certain amount of gas is necessary; 2) the young stellar population of the NSD of NGC 1023 suggests a formation via gas dissipation; 3) a SBH and a NSD coexist in NGC 383 and follow different scaling relations with the host galaxy. For the first time we were able to disentangle simultaneously the mass of both the CMOs using dynamical modelling...|$|R
