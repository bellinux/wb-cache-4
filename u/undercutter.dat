40|$|Abstract. Input/output logics {{have been}} {{proposed}} to formalize rule based inference. They are mainly inspired by deontic logic, or the logic of obligations, although {{it has also been}} shown that they generalize for example Reiter’s normal default logic. A recent extension of the input/output logics formalizes various notions of permission. We are interested in the question whether input/output logics can be used to formalize rule based inferences as they occur in for example belief revision, default reasoning, argumentation, causal reasoning, et cetera, and in particular whether permissions correspond to notions in such inferences. In this paper, we discuss permissions and their role in deontic logic, and relate it to <b>undercutters</b> in argumentation theory. ...|$|R
40|$|In legal {{reasoning}} the Bayesian network {{approach has}} gained increasingly more attention {{over the last}} years due to the increase in scientific forensic evidence. It can however be questioned how meaningful a Bayesian network is in terms that are easily comprehensible by judges and lawyers. Argumentation mod-els, which represent arguments and defeat, are arguably closer to their natural way of arguing and therefore potentially more easy to understand for lawyers and judges. The automated extraction of rules, arguments and counter-arguments from Bayesian networks will facilitate the communication between lawyers and judges {{on the one hand and}} forensic experts on the other. In this paper we propose a method to auto-matically extract inference rules and <b>undercutters</b> from Bayesian networks from which arguments can subsequently be constructed. ...|$|R

50|$|Visitors {{learn about}} {{all aspects of}} the modern-day mining process, as well as earlier procedures, through this three-part gallery. In the Undercut and drill area, the mine is set up for the first phase of a blast. An <b>undercutter</b> is used to cut a slot {{at the base of the}} rock, making it {{possible}} for the salt to drop. In this phase, a series of carefully sited holes are drilled into the salt wall.The next pillar of the Mining Gallery is the blast area, which illustrates how the room being mined is wired with explosives. On display is a powder car. It was formerly a drill, but was modified underground as a powder car and carried all the tools and materials needed to powder a room, including the explosives and wire.The third phase of the mining process featured is the Load Area. Miners used the Joy Loader on display from the 1940s until 1983 when the rail system was discontinued. Named for its manufacturer, the Joy Loader increased efficiency by eliminating the need to hand-load ore cars. This large piece of equipment, as so many others, was brought down the shaft in pieces and welded back together underground. Once a piece of equipment is underground, it remains. When equipment finally outlives its usefulness, it is usually abandoned in an area already mined.The shuttle featured in this gallery was also used from the 1940s until 1983 to take salt from the mine face to the loading station at the main rail line. Powered by a DC extension cord, the car reduced labor and increased efficiency because miners no longer had to lay rails to get the salt from the blast site to the main rail lines.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze leading {{criminal}} cases {{taken from the}} Supreme Court of the United States, in which ad hominem arguments played a crucial role.

Their dangerous and prejudicial effect {{can be used as a}} fundamental component of more complex strategies, aimed, for instance, at shifting the burden of producing evidence or proving character. Using argumentation schemes, we provide criteria for establishing the reasonableness and the weaknesses of this type of argument in different circumstances. We show how ad hominem arguments can be used legitimately as <b>undercutters</b> aimed at undermining the conditions on w hich arguments from a source (such as arguments from expert testimony) are based. We explain the rhetorical persuasiveness of personal attacks by revealing their structure as complex strategies that fit clusters of arguments together to arouse different types of emotions...|$|R
40|$|Two recent {{computational}} {{models of}} legal argumentation, by Verheij and Gordon respectively, have interpreted criti-cal questions as premises of arguments {{that can be}} defeated using Pollock’s concepts of <b>undercutters</b> and rebuttals. Us-ing the scheme for arguments from expert opinion as an ex-ample, this paper evaluates and compares these two models of critical questions {{from the perspective of}} argumentation theory and competing legal theories about proof standards for defeating presumptions. The applicable proof standard is found to be a legal issue subject to argument. Verheij’s model is shown to have problems because the proof stan-dards it applies to different kinds of premises are “hard-wired ” into the system. Gordon’s model overcomes these problems by allowing different proof standards to be as-signed to each issue and by supporting arguments about proof standards within the same framework. These differ-ences are minor however compared to the insight gained from these models jointly about the theory of argument schemes and critical questions. They show how schemes can be used to implement tools for constructing arguments, and not just for classifying arguments ex post facto, and help clarify how critical questions confound declarative knowl-edge about conditions for using argument schemes with pro-cedural knowledge about how to evaluate and criticize ar-guments made using these schemes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Toulmin diagram layout is very {{familiar}} and widely used, {{particularly in the}} teaching of critical thinking skills. The conventional box-and-arrow diagram is equally familiar and widespread. Translation between the two throws up a number of interesting challenges. Some of these challenges (such as the relationship between Toulmin warrants and their counterparts in traditional diagrams) represent slightly different ways of looking at old and deep theoretical questions. Others (such as how to allow Toulmin diagrams to be recursive) are diagrammatic versions of questions that have already been addressed in artificial intelligence models of argument. But there are further questions (such as the relationships between refutations, rebuttals and <b>undercutters,</b> and the roles of multiple warrants) that are posed as a specific result of examining the diagram inter-translation problem. These three classes of problems are discussed. To the first class are addressed solutions based on engineering pragmatism; to the second class, are addressed solutions drawn from the appropriate literature; and to the third class, fuller exploration is offered justifying the approaches taken in developing solutions that offer both pragmatic utility and theoretical interest. Finally, these solutions are explored briefly {{in the context of the}} Araucaria system, showing the ways in which analysts can tackle arguments either using one diagrammatic style or another, or even a combination of the two...|$|R
40|$|Forty-seven {{growers in}} 10 Washington and Oregon {{counties}} agreed to purchase <b>undercutter</b> tillage implements on a 50 % cost share basis. Growers were personally interviewed in 2008, 2009, and 2010. Although {{the lack of}} eight fall 2010 interviews precludes final economic results, data to date indicate a modest profit advantage for the <b>undercutter</b> system. Statistically equivalent yields for the <b>undercutter</b> and conventional fallow/winter wheat systems generated equal gross economic returns. Nearly all individual farmers used the same input rates and other cultural practices for both fallow systems, except for primary tillage and fertilization. This pattern generated similar costs. However, injection of fertilizer with the <b>undercutter</b> provided a modest cost saving. This computed profitability advantage for the <b>undercutter</b> system coincides with the farmers ’ subjective estimate of an average 2. 8 % long run profitability advantage.

40|$|Blowing {{dust from}} {{excessively}} tilled fallow fields {{is a major}} soil loss and air quality concern in the low precipitation (< 12 inches annually) wheat production region of the Inland Pacific Northwest (PNW). A 2 -year, tillage-based winter wheat-summer fallow (WW-SF) rotation is practiced on more than 90 % of rainfed cropland in the region. Earlier research proved that the <b>undercutter</b> method for non-soil inversion primary spring tillage is not only environmentally superior but also agronomically and economically equivalent to high-soil disturbance conventional tillage. In this study, we conducted comprehensive surveys of 47 wheat farmers who purchased undercutters through the USDA-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). Farmers received 50 % cost shares {{on the condition that}} they use the <b>undercutter</b> as prescribed by university scientists on at least 160 acres of land for three consecutive years. Participating farmers were interviewed each year from 2008 to 2010 regarding the agronomic and economic performance of the <b>undercutter</b> versus conventional fallow on their farms. The survey revealed equivalent average winter wheat grain yields and profitability for the two systems from 104 paired comparisons. Survey results also showed that 90 % of farmer participants were satisfied with the <b>undercutter</b> system.

40|$|Wind {{erosion and}} blowing dust are major {{problems}} for traditional tillage winter wheat-summer fallow in eastern Washington. Wind erosion reduces soil productivity and dust particulates {{are a major}} air quality concern. Conservation tillage summer fallow can reduce wind erosion markedly, but is used by relatively few farmers in the low-precipitation (less than 12 inch/year) region of the Inland Pacific Northwest. Barriers to adoption include the cost of conservation tillage implements and reluctance to change "tried and proven"traditional tillage methods. This bulletin compares economic results for the V-sweep <b>undercutter</b> and traditional fallow tillage systems on a case study farm located near Ritzville, WA. The farm’s eight-year average wheat yield is 46 bu/ac. Grain yields are similar for the two systems. This study shows that the <b>undercutter</b> method of summer fallow farming is more profitable than the traditional system on the case study farm due to slightly lower production costs. The <b>undercutter</b> system is eligible for conservation payments, but the traditional system is not. Receipt of these payments further strengthens the profitability advantage of the <b>undercutter</b> systemcapital, labor, land and management resources, type and size of machinery complement...|$|E

The information in this publication represents costs and returns of a case study Adams County, Washington farmer using both the low-disturbance V-sweep <b>undercutter</b> conservation tillage * and traditional tillage systems for summer fallow. To avoid drawing unwarranted conclusions from this case study, you should closely examine the assumptions and data used. If these are not suitable for the situation at hand, you should make appropriate adjustments. *The Haybuster TM <b>undercutter</b> implement {{used in this study}} has 32 -inch wide V-shaped blades with 28 -inch spacing between blades (on two tiers) to slice below the soil surface with minimum soil lifting. As a primary spring tillage implement, the <b>undercutter</b> completely severs capillary pores to halt liquid water movement towards the soil surface as required to retain seed-zone moisture in summer fallow. The pitch of each blade can be individually adjusted to ensure uniform horizontal movement (i. e., minimum soil lifting) underneath the soil. This implement can be easily fitted to deliver aqua nitrogen fertilizer at the time of primary spring tillage. Depending on soil texture, farmers may or may not want to attach a finishing implement behind the <b>undercutter</b> to break large soil clods and fill air voids. In addition, the <b>undercutter</b> works well for killing Russian thistles, if needed, after wheat harvest...|$|E

The objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects}} of spring-sown cover crop mixture diversity and mechanical cover crop termination method on cover crop and/or cash crop productivity, soil moisture and N, and profitability in an organic cropping system. An experiment was conducted between 2009 and 2011 near Mead, Nebraska, where mixtures of two (2 CC), four (4 CC), six (6 CC), and eight (8 CC) cover crop species, or a summer annual weed mixture were included in a sunflower– soybean–corn rotation. Cover crops were terminated in late May using a field disk or sweep plow <b>undercutter.</b> Undercutting cover crops increased soil NO 3 –N (0 – 20 cm) by 1. 0 and 1. 8 mg NO 3 –N kg– 1 relative to disk incorporation in 2010 and 2011, respectively. Cover crop mixtures often reduced soil moisture (0 – 8 cm) before main crop planting, though cover crop termination with the <b>undercutter</b> increased soil moisture content by as much as 0. 024 cm 3 cm– 3 compared to termination with the disk during early main crop growth. Crop yields were not influenced by cover crop mixture, but termination with the <b>undercutter</b> increased corn and soybean yield by as much as 1. 40 and 0. 88 Mg ha– 1, respectively. Despite differences in productivity between spring cover crop mixtures and weed communities, crop yield was not different among these treatments; thus, profitability of the weed mixture–undercutter treatment combination was greatest due to reduced input costs...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} a U. S. Government work {{and is in the}} public domain in the U. S. A. ABSTRACT: A {{standalone}} version of the Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) erosion submodel, the Single-event Wind Erosion Evaluation Program (SWEEP), was released in 2007. A limited number of studies exist that have evaluated SWEEP in simulating soil loss subject to different tillage systems under high winds. The objective {{of this study was to}} test SWEEP under contrasting tillage systems employed during the summer fallow phase of a winter wheat–summer fallow rotation within eastern Washington. Soil and PM 10 (particulate matter ≤ 10 μm in diameter) loss and soil and crop residue characteristics were measured in adjacent fields managed using conventional and <b>undercutter</b> tillage during summer fallow in 2005 and 2006. While differences in soil surface conditions resulted in measured differences in soil and PM 10 loss between the tillage treatments, SWEEP failed to simulate any difference in soil or PM 10 loss between conventional and <b>undercutter</b> tillage. In fact, the model simulated zero erosion for all high wind events observed over the two years. The reason for the lack of simulated erosion is complex owing to the number of parameters and interaction of these parameters on erosion processes. A possible reason might be overestimation of th...|$|E

40|$|Organic grain {{cropping}} systems typically depend on intensive mechanical cultivation for weed control and manure or compost applications to meet plant nutrient demands. However, cover crops {{may contribute to}} weed suppression and soil fertility, potentially increasing crop yield and sustainability of the system. The utility of individual cover crop species have been well documented, but the agronomic benefits of diverse cover crop mixtures have received less attention. Cover crop mixtures are an appealing option for farmers, as increasing species diversity {{has been shown to}} increase resource-use efficiency, stability, resiliency, and productivity of plant communities. Despite the growing interest in cover crop mixtures, {{little is known about the}} effect of increasing cover crop diversity on cropping system performance. Moreover, organic farmers have questions about the most effective method for cover crop mixture termination. In an effort to increase knowledge about cover crop mixtures and management for the western Corn Belt, an organic {{cropping systems}} trial was initiated in 2009 at the UNL ARDC near Mead, NE. Spring-sown mixtures of cover crops, ranging from two to eight species, were included in a sunflower - soybean - corn crop rotation. Cover crops were planted in late-March and terminated mechanically with either a field disk or sweep plow <b>undercutter</b> in late-May. Changes in cover crop mixture influenced cover crop productivity and early-season weed biomass, while termination method drove differences in weed community composition, soil microbial community structure, soil moisture and nitrogen, and crop yield. Interestingly, the management of ambient weed communities as a cover crop led to unique shifts in soil microbial community structure, but did not alter soil nitrogen or crop yield when compared to cover crop mixtures. When considering cropping system performance in combination with potential environmental benefits, diverse cover crop mixtures paired with a sweep plow <b>undercutter</b> for termination seems to be a profitable and sustainable management option for organic grain farmers in the western Corn Belt. ...|$|E

40|$|The Horse Heaven Hills (HHH) {{located in}} south-central Washington {{contains}} the world’s driest rainfed wheat production region where farms receive {{as little as}} six inches average annual precipitation. Late summer establishment of winter wheat into carryover seed-zone water {{after a year of}} fallow is essential to achieve the highest grain yield potential. Tillage of fallow land during the spring is considered necessary to retain adequate seed-zone water during the dry summer months, but blowing dust from excessively tilled fallow is a major safety, environmental, and soil quality concern. The objective of this 5 -year study was to compare the effects of three fallow management systems on soil water dynamics, wheat stand establishment, grain yield, and economic returns on two farms in western and eastern portions of the HHH where long-term annual precipitation averages 6. 0 and 8. 3 inches, respectively. Fallow management treatments were: traditional tillage (TTF), <b>undercutter</b> tillage (UTF), and notillage (NTF). This publication documents that NTF in the western HHH and UTF in the eastern HHH are best management practices for farmers and the environment in a region where wind erosion from excessively tilled soils is a severe problem. Soils in the HHH are highly vulnerable to wind erosion due to the dry environment, high winds, limited straw cover, and intensive tillage during fallow. These soils contain high quantities of PM 10 -sized particulates (i. e., less than 10 micrograms in diameter) that, when exposed, are readily transmitted hundreds of miles in the air stream by suspension (Sharratt et al. 2007). Major dust storms may occur several times a year (Sharratt and Edgar 2011). Exceedances of the US Federal Air Quality Standard for PM 10 occurred 20 times between 2000 and 2010 in the city of Kennewick, WA, which is located immediately downwind of the HHH (Sharratt and Edgar 2011). The highest daily PM 10 concentration measured in Kennewick during this time period was nearly ten times the concentration allowed by law. All of these PM 10 exceedances were attributed to windblown dust...|$|E
