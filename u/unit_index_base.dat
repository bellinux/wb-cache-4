40|$|International {{trade has}} been of great {{importance}} for United States agriculture since {{the founding of the}} nation. Today, about 20 percent of agricultural production in the United States is exported, and the revenue from these exports is an important source of farm income. According to the Economic Research Service over half of U. S. wheat production is exported, as is almost 80 percent of U. S. cotton production. While agricultural exports are always greater than agricultural imports, U. S. consumers depend on imports for many commodities, notably such tropical goods as coffee, cocoa, bananas and other tropical fruits. The real values of U. S. agricultural exports and imports from 1967 to 2011 are shown in Figure 1 (on page 3). These values have been adjusted for inflation using the World Bankâ€™s manufacture <b>unit</b> value <b>index</b> (<b>base</b> year = 2005), which is the same index the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) uses to deflate its commodity price series.

We present a tool for comparing the regional contribution of each of a suite of wildlife management units to conservation goals.

We evaluate UCI for {{a subset of the}} 729 participating wetlands of the Integrated Waterbird Management and Monitoring (IWMM) Program across U. S.

40|$|Reliability {{evaluation}} is slowly moving from deterministic techniques to stochastic methods {{in order to}} recognize the probabilistic nature of the power system and its components. The application of probabilistic methods requires comprehensive data {{on the availability of}} system assets such as generating units and their constituent components. Generating unit operating and outage data have been collected for many years in North America. In Canada, these data are collected by the Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) in the Equipment Reliability Information System (ERIS) and in America they are collected by the North America Electrical Reliability Council (NERC) in the Generating Availability Data System (GADS). The generating unit operating and outage data system of the CEA ERIS is discussed in detail in this thesis. The <b>unit</b> unavailability <b>indices</b> are <b>based</b> on the data reporting procedures and the models embedded in them. The generating unit outage data reporting systems of CEA ERIS and NERC GADS are compared in this thesis. This comparison covers the generating unit states, state residence times and unavailability indices. The similarities and differences in these two systems are discussed in detail. This thesis describes and discusses a number of models including the conventional two-state model and three four-state models. The four-state model is an extension of the basic two-state model in order to incorporate the intermittent operating features of a peaking unit. An extended four-state model was developed in this research based on available CEA data on 93 gas turbine units. The <b>unit</b> unavailability <b>indices</b> for these peaking units are discussed and compared based on the two reporting systems and the different models. This thesis provides some recommendations to the CEA ERIS and NERC GADS regarding practical models for peaking <b>unit</b> unavailability <b>index</b> evaluation and peaking <b>unit</b> unavailability <b>indices...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} we propose using {{computational}} tests for appraising the inaccuracies of index numbers (for example, price and wage indices). This is done by programming a hypothetical situation where the true average index value is known and the variation of prices and quantities and the relation between them can be chosen. The indices are then calculated using the formulae of Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher, the <b>Unit</b> <b>index</b> and Normalized <b>Unit</b> <b>index</b> formulae. By comparing the average values of the above formulae with the true average index value, {{we are able to}} obtain a quantitative indication of the errors in these formulae under various situations. The Normalized <b>Unit</b> and Fisher <b>index</b> formulae were found to be consistently accurate for all our tests whereas the formulae of Laspeyres and Paasche were found to have very poor accuracy in the majority of our tests. The <b>Unit</b> <b>index</b> was also consistently accurate in all our tests but its use is appropriate in the single item case thus making this formula suitable for measuring wages. In our informal discussion of stability we indicated that the Normalized <b>unit</b> <b>index</b> and the <b>Unit</b> <b>index</b> have good stability characteristics whereas the indices Laspeyres, Paasche and Fisher have poor stability characteristics. In view of the above the Normalized <b>Unit</b> <b>index</b> is the best of the formulae we have discussed for measuring prices (many item case), and the <b>Unit</b> <b>index</b> is the best of the formulae we have discussed for measuring wages (single item case) ...|$|R
40|$|We {{continue}} {{to employ a}} minimal approach for our Chinese QA work that requires only a COTS entity extraction software and other home-built tools. In monolingual Chinese QA, questions are classified based on cue-word and meta-keyword usage patterns. Retrieval is done using sentence <b>units,</b> and <b>indexing</b> is <b>based</b> on bigrams and characters. Entities extracted from retrieved sentences form a pool of answer candidates which are ranked using five evidence factors. Our best monolingual result shows that when only Top 1 answers are considered, 63 questions out of 150 are answered correctly with sentence support, giving an accuracy and MRR of 0. 42. When unsupported answers are included, these values improve to 0. 4467. English-Chinese CLQA starts with English question classification also based on an approach similar to Chinese. Three paths of translation render the question into Chinese strings. Otherwise procedures of retrieval and answer ranking remain the same as monolingual but with different parameter values. Our best run returns corresponding Top 1 values as:. 2533 and. 28 (unsupported). These are about 60 % of monolingual effectiveness within our system. Effectiveness with Top 2 - 5 answers {{as well as the}} influence of different evidence factors are also reported...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{long history}} of {{modeling}} of prices of commodity transportation by sea. These prices are referred to as (ocean) freight rates. Early contributions go back to the work of Tinbergen and Koopmans in the 1930 s. The shipping industry is characterized by an abun-dance of individual contract data, which is collected and published by so-called charter brokers. The industry publishes this data both in raw form, as monthly and even weekly average prices for selected ship sizes and commodities on selected routes, and in the form of <b>unit</b> value <b>indices.</b> In this paper, we explore the calculation of these indices using a data set of ocean charter contracts for 1997 - 2005. We present <b>unit</b> value <b>indices,</b> which we compare with well known industry indices. We then explore the impact of weighting the subindices for aggregation, present <b>indices</b> <b>based</b> on matched models from period to period and we calculate indices are corrected for quality differences. Finally, we estimate price indices in which the duration of the contracts is reflected. We find that our <b>unit</b> value <b>indices</b> show substantial differences from current industr...|$|R

According to index construction methods, <b>index</b> <b>based</b> homology search algorithms are classified into three categories, i. e., length <b>based</b> <b>index</b> ones, trans-formation <b>based</b> <b>index</b> ones, and their combination.

40|$|Abstract â€” Query {{processing}} for location based services increased {{more attention}} {{due to the}} consideration of spatial and non spatial attributes of objects. The previous focus {{is based on the}} solving point or line based skyline queries where the query location is a static location point or a line segment.

Here the new issue rises that how to process the distance <b>based</b> skyline queries. <b>Index</b> <b>based</b> and non <b>index</b> <b>based</b> are the two algorithms used to handle queries for the mobile environments. Due to the frequent movement of objects being queried improved version of the <b>index</b> <b>based</b> and non <b>index</b> <b>based</b> algorithms are more efficient to handle the frequent movement of objects and also avoids the re computing the query index.
