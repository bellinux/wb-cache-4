40|$|Abstract. So far {{geodetic}} {{surveys of}} cliff shores were predominantly conducted with 3 D coordinates {{of the upper}} edge and the bottom <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> slope.

This paper presents the application of the scanning tacheometers to monitor <b>a</b> <b>cliff</b> <b>of</b> Baltic Sea near the Pleśnia village in Poland. It also presents the methods of visualisation of survey with DTM using TIN and GRID types. ...|$|R
