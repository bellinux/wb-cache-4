40|$|Twenty pork {{carcasses}} {{were selected}} at 13 h post mortem (pm) to contain longissimus lumborum (LL) muscles that possessed a large variation in <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH.</b> On the LL <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH,</b> colour, water holding capacity, sarcomere length, percent intramuscular fat and shear force (at 3 and 7 days pm) were assessed. In addition, eating quality (tenderness, juiciness and flavour) was determined at 5 till 8 days p. m. by a 25 -member taste panel. <b>Ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> varied from 5. 42 to 6. 25 (mean : 5. 71) and was, as expected, {{significantly related to}} colour and water holding capacity. The PSE condition was not observed. Shear forces, particularly at 7 days pm, were highly correlated with panel judgements of tenderness (r=- 0. 78) and juiciness (r=-O. 74). No significant relationships were found for sarcomere length or intramuscular fat with shear forces and panel judgements. <b>Ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> {{was positively related to}} sensory tenderness (r= 0. 78) and juiciness (r= 0. 68), but not to flavour (r=O. 02). Furthermore, <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> appeared to be more highly related to shear force at 7 days (r=- 0. 70) than at 3 days (r=- 0. 43) pm.

About 3400 reindeer carcasses from 12 different herds were included in this study. The post mortem processes in reindeer meat seemed to develop very rapidly, and therefore an early measurement (approx. 15 h post mortem) of <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> can be done without electrical stimulation of the carcasses. In a comparison between muscles, M. triceps brachii had a higher <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> value than M. longissimus and M. biceps femoris. Meat from reindeer calves had higher <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> values than meat from adult animals, indicating that calves are more susceptible to stress than adult animals and hence deplete their energy stores more readily. Road transport by lorry did not cause any increase in <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> values in bulls and calves. Reindeer cows, however, did have an increase in <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH,</b> while more borderline cases of DFD (5. 80 &lt;pH&lt; 6. 20) were observed when cows were transported over more than 500 km.

40|$|Beta-adrenergic {{agonists}} cause a {{shift in}} carcass composition of poultry, pigs, cattle and sheep. Fat content is dramatically reduced in favour of {{a higher percentage of}} muscle. Carcass yield is usually enhanced and is accompanied by muscle hypertrophy. There is a tendency for an improved growth rate and feed conversion in poultry and ruminants. In pigs, only feed conversion was positively affected. Beta-agonists alter metabolism of several important pathways. They possess lipolytic and anti-lipogenic properties and improve nitrogen retention. Glycolysis, lactate production and oxygen consumption are increased, while plasma insulin levels are decreased and adipocytes become less sensitive to insulin. Energy expenditure is increased by beta-agonists, partly due to an extra heat production. In general, meat colour is not affected by beta-agonists. However, the increased metabolism resulted in a higher <b>ultimate</b> muscle <b>pH.</b> Meat tenderness is mostly unaltered, but the carcass may be more susceptible to cold shortening due to a decreased fat cover.

The correlations between pH and pork quality traits directly related to carcass grade, and consumer’s preference were also evaluated. The pH and meat grading scores for cold carcasses of 215 purebred pigs (Duroc, Landrace, and Yorkshire) from four different farms were obtained. Meat quality parameters of the pork loin were analyzed. Duroc and female animals were more affected compared to other breeds and male pigs. Duroc animals had the highest <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH,</b> carcass back fat thickness, marbling scores, yellowness, and fat content (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Digital {{systems have}} derived {{performance}} benefits {{due to the}} scaling down of CMOS microprocessor feature sizes towards packing billions of transistors on a chip, or gigascale integration (GSI). This has placed immense bandwidth demands on chip-to-chip and chip-to-board interconnects. The present-day electrical interconnect may limit bandwidth as transmission rates grow. As such, optical interconnects have been proposed as a potential solution. A critical requirement for enabling chip-to-chip and chip-to-board optical interconnection is out-of-plane coupling for directing light between a chip and the board. Any solution for this problem must be compatible with conventional packaging and assembly requirements.

Thirty hybrid male pigs (50 % Meishan x 50 % Large White) were used. Fifteen were castrated within {{the first two days}} of age and the other fifteen remained entire. At 12 weeks of age, the pigs were divided into three groups, each consisting of five castrates and five boars. Animals were fed a basic standard commercial pelleted diet for 30, 60 or 90 days and then slaughtered, so that the actual age of the pigs at slaughter was 114, 144 and 174 days respectively. Parameters considered for carcass quality were carcass weight, initial pH (<b>pH</b> 45) and <b>ultimate</b> (final) <b>pH</b> (pHu), and P 2 backfat thickness. For pork and pork fat qualities, the following parameters were considered: backfat firmness, slip point, sensory attributes and adipose tissue fatty acid composition.

40|$|The {{advantages}} of bulls compared with steers in production efficiency, performance, and carcass leanness {{have been well}} documented. However, {{it has also been}} well documented that meat obtained from bulls is darker in color and less tender than meat produced by steers. It may be concluded that the superiority in production performance of bulls over steers has not been exploited largely due to meat characteristics that differ from those of steers. Postmortem (after slaughter) muscle color is directly associated with antemortem (pre-slaughter) muscle glycogen content, postmortem muscle <b>pH</b> decline, and <b>ultimate</b> muscle <b>pH,</b> which, in tum, is affected by live animal physiological stress.

40|$|Introduction: The <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> of meat (measured at approx. 24 hours post slaughter) {{is a key}} quality {{determinant}} of sensory attributes of sheep meat (Warner et al 2010). Between a pH of 5. 4 - 5. 7 sheep meat is tender, juicy and light in colour with better keeping qualities. Muscle glycogen levels at slaughter are governed {{by the quality of}} pre-slaughter nutrition and depletion results from stress and/or exercise prior to slaughter. Breed type may also play an important role, with Australian studies indicating that the Merino sheep breed has a higher incidence of elevated <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> compared to first and second cross lambs (sired by Border Leicester and Poll Dorsets) (Hopkins et al 2005). This is attributed to a greater sensitivity to stress and therefore a greater glycogen depletion rate than crossbred lambs (Gardner et al 1999).

40|$|An {{industrial}} and experimental electrical method for stunning farmed Atlantic cod in air and seawater (SW), respectively, were compared. The impacts of sedation with AQUI-S™ and exercise to exhaustion before electrical stunning were also assessed {{to monitor the}} possible depletion of rested muscle energy levels by electrical stunning. Stress (blood glucose, haematocrit, muscle pH, muscle excitability, high-energy phosphates and rigor mortis) and flesh quality (fillet texture, colour, liquid leakage (LL), gaping, residual blood and K-value) were assessed. For the industrial stunning method, an average of 41 V, 0. 2 A dc was applied to individual cod for 18 – 27 s. For the SW method, a bipolar square wave current (170 Hz, 33 % duty cycle) was applied for 5 s. After stunning, recovery was prevented by exsanguination in chilled SW. There were no differences (P> 0. 05) between the two stunning methods except for a higher <b>ultimate</b> fillet <b>pH</b> for cod stunned in air 8 days postmortem. Exercise before stunning depleted muscle energy levels at slaughter, increased LL and fillets had redder and darker flesh after storage on ice for 8 days.

40|$|Feed {{withdrawal}} {{should start}} 5 h before broilers are captured and {{transported to the}} processing plant. This practice results in a total feed withdrawal period of about 8 h before slaughter. To check observance of this period at the plant reliably, blood samples were collected at slaughter from broilers. These samples were analyzed for glucose and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA). Glucose levels decreased, whereas the amount of NEFA increased {{as a consequence of}} deprivation. It was found that the decrease in glucose was smaller than could be expected from data in the literature, whereas the level tended to rise again after longer deprivation periods. The increase of the NEFA was lower in males than in females, and the glucose: NEFA ratio also showed a difference between the sexes. Therefore, it was concluded that these blood metabolites were not suitable for use as an indicator of the duration of feed withdrawal. The estimation of liver pH seemed to be a more reliable indicator of the length of feed withdrawal. Longer periods of feed withdrawal resulted in higher <b>ultimate</b> liver <b>pH</b> values, which were 6. 10 to 6. 20 in full-fed broilers, increasing to 6. 60 in livers from broilers deprived during longer withdrawal periods.

Forty-eight live broilers were obtained from a processing plant and transported to the pilot plant facility of the research center. Half the birds were electrically stunned prior to death, and half were not. Birds were processed in the following manner: bled by outside neck cut for 2 min, scalded for 2 min at 53 C, feathers removed, and left pectorialis major immediately removed. The remainder of carcass was eviscerated, head, neck, and feet removed, prechilled, stored for 24 hr at 2 C, and right p. major removed. The pH was taken {{at the time of}} muscle removal, the skinless p. major weighed, cooked in water at 88 C to 82 C, cooled, and weighed. A 2. 5 -cm wide strip was removed to measure objectively tenderness as force to shear. The entire procedure was replicated twice. There was a significant stun by age interaction for pH and percent weight loss due to cooking. Breast meat from birds stunned prior to death exhibited higher pH 20 min postmortem than meat from nonstunned birds. Stunning had no effect on <b>ultimate</b> postmortem <b>pH.</b> Breast meat cooked 20 min postmortem exhibited lower percentage weight loss than meat cooked 24 hr postmortem.

The first-cross ewes were the progeny of 91 industry sires from several maternal breeds including the Border Leicester, East Friesian, Finnsheep, Coopworth, White Suffolk, Corriedale, and Booroola Leicester breeds. The first-cross ewes were generated at 3 sites over 3 years, and 3 common maternal sires were used at each site and each year to provide genetic links for combined analysis. The 2726 first-cross ewes were mated naturally to common terminal sires for 3 years at each site to quantify the variation in maternal genetics on the performance of 11 341 second-cross cross lambs. The birthweight, weaning weight (at an average age of 100 days) and post-weaning weight (at an average age of 200 days) of the second-cross lambs were analysed using mixed-model procedures. The lambs were slaughtered (n = 8878) at an average target carcass weight of 22 kg and dressing yield, carcass fat, muscle, meat colour, and meat pH were analysed.

New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 31 (1 - 2), 4 - 6 A plug sampling technique based on a modified muscle biopsy instrument, was developed for the measurement of muscle pH without mutilation of the carcase. It was found possible to routinely obtain muscle tissue samples weighing approximately 2 g and when these were incubated for 24 hours under liquid paraffin at room temperature, followed by homogenisation in a 'Colworth Stomacher', the pH of the solution {{was found to be}} an accurate measurement of the <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> of the muscle. Both the sample method and a direct probe method were found to be well suited for measuring the <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> of muscles. However, the sample method had a higher degree of precision as compared to the probe method when used for measuring pre-rigor pH values. In a longitudinal survey, in which 1536 lamb carcases were examined, 85. 2 % of carcases were found to have <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> values below 5. 80. Highly significant associations were found between season (summer period) and breed (Perendales) and unsatisfactorily high values of <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH.</b> There was also a highly significant direct correlation between the duration of holding periods of lambs and the <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> of meat, whereas there was a highly significant inverse correlation between wool score and <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH.</b> It was concluded that nutrition {{plays an important role in}} the development of high <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> values. Studies at the meat works indicated that there is a highly significant linear relationship between the number of times lambs are washed prior to slaughter and the <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> of the longissimus muscle. Subsequent resting of animals for varying periods prior to slaughter has no apparent effect on repletion of glycogen stores and may, in some cases, exacerbate the problem of high pH meat. It was also found that washing of lambs is associated with a highly significant increase in bruising of carcases and that such washing may not necessarily result in a decrease in carcase contamination. Investigations of the changes of body weights and the weights and nature of ruminoreticular contents during the preslaughter holding period indicated that the ideal time to slaughter lambs, in terms of potential carcase contamination, is 18 to 24 hours after removal from pasture. It was found that stunning by a 'head-to-leg' electrical method significantly increased the rate of pH decline compared to other methods of slaughter. A further increase in the rate of pH decline was achieved by low voltage stimulation at the time of slaughter. It was concluded that the combined effects of low voltage and high voltage stimulation can cause irreversible contraction and associated toughness in a large proportion of carcases. Studies of the occurrence of haemorrhages in carcases and organs indicated that these defects are related to the method of stunning. Although blood splash has been reported to be associated with prolonged one stage prothrombin times in lambs, no statistical association was found between this parameter and speckling. It was found that there is a two to threefold increase in arterial pressure following 'head-only' stunning whereas there was only a moderate increase in venous pressure. On the other hand, stunning by the 'head-to-back' method was followed by a decrease in arterial pressure, but venous pressure increased to levels above 50 mm Hg. Electromyographic studies indicated that there is a significant increase in the intensity of muscular activity following 'head-to-back' stunning as compared to 'head-only stunning and that there is a correlation between the increased muscular activity and the increase in venous pressure.

The effect of these three alleles on <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH,</b> pigment content, internal reflectance (FOP), surface colour measured by tristimulus colorimetry (L*, a*, b*) and fractions of deoxymyoglobin (Mb), oxymyoglobin (MbO(2)) and metmyoglobin (MetMb) of pork loin was studied. Moreover, the effect of sex, entire male versus female pigs, on these traits was also analysed. The three PRKAG 3 alleles affected <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH,</b> internal reflectance, colour and distribution of myoglobin derivatives of pork loin, while the pigment content was not influenced. <b>Ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> values of loins from the three genotypes were found to be in the order RN-/- genotypes < rn(+) /rn(+) genotype < rn(+) / genotype rn(+) /rn(+) genotype. The internal reflectance in the loin was found to be in the order RN-/- genotypes <rn(+/) rn(+) genotype = rn(+) /rn(+) genotype = rn(+) /rn(+) genotype. The RN- allele was dominant resulting in higher redness (a* value) and yellowness (b* value), while the rn* allele tended to result in lower redness and yellowness compared with the rn* allele. The RN- allele was dominant over the rn* allele in lightness (L* value) giving a lighter colour. Surface colour differences were mainly explained by differences in the distribution of the myoglobin derivatives. Finally, surface lightness was higher and pigment content, redness and fraction of MbO(2) lower in loin from entire males compared with females. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Chia (Salvia hispanica L.) seed (SHS) dietary supplementation is {{effective}} in improving the nutritional quality of rabbit meat for consumers and could contribute to the novel concept of “functional food” in human nutrition. A trial has been conducted in order to verify the effects of three levels (0, 10, or 15 %) of SHS inclusion in a rabbit diet on the meat quality, oxidative stability and sensory traits. The dietary treatment did not induce any differences in the <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH,</b> chemical composition, drip losses of the longissimus dorsi muscle or the initial and <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> of the biceps femoris muscle, but the SHS supplementation increased cooking losses of the rabbit meat. The inclusion of SHS also reduced oxidative stability during meat storage. No adverse effects were observed on the meat quality or customer acceptability. The inclusion of SHS in rabbit diets, which {{is effective}} in improving the n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids content of meat, increased the lipid oxidation in the hind leg meat. An improvement in tissue oxidative stability could be obtained by feeding rabbits {{with higher levels of}} antioxidants...|$|E
40|$|Echocardiography {{is a key}} {{screening}} tool in the diagnostic algorithm of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). It provides an estimate of right ventricular function and pulmonary artery pressure, either at rest or during exercise, and is useful in ruling out secondary causes of pulmonary hypertension (PH) such as left heart disease or congenital heart disease. Several studies have showed that echocardiography is insufficiently precise as single tool for the <b>ultimate</b> diagnosis of <b>PH</b> respect to the right heart catheterization, considered the gold standard technique. Echocardiography is valuable in assessing prognosis and treatment options, monitoring the efficacy of specific therapeutic interventions, and detecting the preclinical stages of disease. The ideal imaging modality for accurate noninvasive assessment of the right heart should be accurate and precise, not influenced by loading conditions, routinely practicable and easily repeatable. For all such reasons and considering that PAH is a rare and severe condition, a complete noninvasive assessment of right heart function requires a deep knowledge {{of the disease and}} a multimodality approach.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to study prediction of pork quality by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) technology in the laboratory. A total of 131 commercial pork loin samples were measured with NIRS. Predictive equations were developed for drip loss %, colour L*, a*, b* and <b>pH</b> <b>ultimate</b> (pHu). Equations with R 2 > 0. 70 and residual prediction deviation (RPD) = 1. 9 were considered as applicable to predict pork quality. For drip loss% the prediction equation was developed (R 2 0. 73, RPD 1. 9) and 76 % of those grouped superior and inferior samples were predicted within the groups. For colour L*, test-set samples were predicted with R 2 0. 75, RPD 2. 0, colour a* R 2 0. 51, RPD 1. 4, colour b* R 2 0. 55, RPD 1. 5 and pHu R 2 0. 36, RPD 1. 3. It is concluded that NIRS prediction equations could be developed to predict drip loss% and L*, of pork samples. NIRS equations for colour a*, b* and pHu were not applicable for the prediction of pork quality on commercially slaughtered pigs...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} the presence and the type of environmental enrichment in different collective housing systems, 504 crossbred rabbits were weaned at 33 d of age and housed in 16 pens (1. 68 m 2) with plastic slatted floor. Half of the pens were equipped with a plastic slatted platform (50 × 120 cm; 30 cm above the plastic floor). Within pens with or without the platform, half of the pens were additionally equipped with a plastic tube (ϕ 20 cm; length: 50 cm) for hiding. Within housing system, rabbits were slaughtered at 68 or 75 days of age. The presence of the platform increased slaughter weight (2495 vs. 2424 g; P< 0. 10) and the occurrence of rabbits injured at genitals (20. 6 vs. 11. 7 %; P< 0. 01). Slaughter results were not affected, but dissectible fat was higher in rabbits kept in pens with the platform compared to those without (3. 0 vs. 2. 6 %; P< 0. 01). <b>Ultimate</b> meat <b>pH</b> did not change whereas the lightness index of both l. lumborum (53. 7 vs. 51. 3) and b. femoris (50. 7 vs. 49. 8) was higher in rabbits reared in presence of the platform (P< 0. 01). The presence of the tube decreased slaughter weight (2403 vs. 2515 g; P< 0. 01) and reference carcass weight (1217 vs. 1276 g; P< 0. 10), but did not affect other carcass traits. The pH and colour of main muscles were not affected, but significantly higher shear force was measured on l. lumborum (4. 63 vs. 4. 30 kg/g; P< 0. 05) and b. femoris (3. 15 vs. 2. 83 kg/g; P< 0. 01) of the rabbits kept with the tube compared to those without. In conclusion, the presence of enrichment may affect both positively (platform) or negatively (tube) slaughter results and carcass traits in rabbits kept in collective pens. Further investigations are needed to ascertain the effects of the platform on aggression frequency...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the effect of Acacia karroo supplementation on growth, <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH,</b> colour and cooking losses of meat from indigenous Xhosa lop-eared goats. Eighteen castrated 4 -month-old kids were used in the study until slaughter. The kids were subdivided in two treatment groups A. karroo supplemented (AK) and non-supplemented (NS). The supplemented goats were given 200 g per head per d of fresh A. karroo leaves. The kids were slaughtered on d 60 and sample cuttings for meat quality assessment were taken from the Longistimus dorsi muscle. The supplemented kids had higher (p< 0. 05) growth rates than the non-supplemented ones. The meat from the A. karroo supplemented goats had lower (p< 0. 05) <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> and cooking loss than the meat from the non-supplemented goats. Acacia karroo supplemented goats produced higher (p< 0. 05) b* (yellowness) value, but supplementation had no significant effect on L* (lightness) and a* (redness) of the meat. Therefore, A. karroo supplementation improved growth performance and the quality of meat from goats...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} I 199 V {{polymorphism}} at the PRKAG 3 gene on carcass and meat quality of commercial pigs was studied independently from PRKAG 3 200 Q or RYR 1 "n" allele, known to decrease meat quality, i. e., animals were genotyped for RYR 1 R 615 C, PRKAG 3 I 199 V and R 200 Q substitutions, and only pigs without 200 Q and "n" were retained {{for the analysis}} of carcass and meat quality traits (n = 274). Genotype frequencies were 12. 0, 57. 7 and 30. 3 % for I/I, I/V and V/V, respectively. The I 199 V polymorphism affected significantly fat thickness and drip loss and tended to affect <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH.</b> Interestingly, I/V were the fattest and significantly different from V/V, with I/I pigs being intermediate. The <b>ultimate</b> <b>pH</b> of I/I was higher than the one of I/V or V/V pigs. Regarding drip loss, significant difference was detected between I/I and V/V pigs.
