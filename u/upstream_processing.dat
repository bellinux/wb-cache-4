The approach integrates <b>upstream</b> ‘continuous’ <b>processing</b> considerations {{for the production of}} active ingredients and final product formulation, with the downstream implications for packing and distribution. Currently, these upstream and downstream operations largely operate as decoupled operations with independent coordination and governance mechanisms, and the approach presented in this paper identifies opportunities for more case-specific integrated end-to-end supply chains enabled by continuous flow technologies. Three specific product (and corresponding processing technology) case studies are used to demonstrate the utility of the approach in assessing the supply network and system integration opportunities that emerge from the continuous processing of pharmaceutical products...|$|R

40|$|Tannin acyl {{hydrolase}} {{also referred}} as tannase is an enzyme with important applications in several {{science and technology}} fields. Due to its hydrolytic and synthetic properties, tannase {{could be used to}} reduce the negative effects of tannins in beverages, food, feed, and tannery effluents, for the production of gallic acid from tannin-rich materials, the elucidation of tannin structure, and the synthesis of gallic acid esters in nonaqueous media.

The need to develop methods to ensure more sustainable and efficient biofuel production processes is recommended.

The benefits and potential of using lignocellulosic and waste materials as feedstocks in the biobutanol production process are also discussed. Sustainability assessment in this paper includes cultivation, harvest/collection and <b>upstream</b> <b>processing</b> (pretreatment) of feedstocks, comparing four main biomass sources: food crops, non-food crops, food industry by-product and wood-based biomass.

Publicly available tools are needed to assemble overlapping paired-end reads while correcting mismatches and uncalled bases; many errors could be corrected to obtain higher sequence yields using quality information. Results PANDAseq assembles paired-end reads rapidly and with the correction of most errors. Uncertain error corrections come from reads with many low-quality bases identified by <b>upstream</b> <b>processing.</b> Benchmarks were done using real error masks on simulated data, a pure source template, and a pooled template of genomic DNA from known organisms.

40|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} {{for assessing the}} abundance of viable bacterial endospores is the culture-based plating method. However, culture-based approaches are heavily biased and oftentimes incompatible with <b>upstream</b> sample <b>processing</b> strategies, which make viable cells/spores uncultivable. This shortcoming highlights the need for rapid molecular diagnostic tools to assess more accurately the abundance of viable spacecraft-associated microbiota, perhaps most importantly bacterial endospores. Propidium monoazide (PMA) has received {{a great deal of}} attention due to its ability to differentiate live, viable bacterial cells from dead ones. PMA gains access to the DNA of dead cells through compromised membranes. Once inside the cell, it intercalates and eventually covalently bonds with the double-helix structures upon photoactivation with visible light. The covalently bound DNA is significantly altered, and unavailable to downstream molecular-based manipulations and analyses. Microbiological samples can be treated with appropriate concentrations of PMA and exposed to visible light prior to undergoing total genomic DNA extraction, resulting in an extract comprised solely of DNA arising from viable cells. This ability to extract DNA selectively from living cells is extremely powerful, and bears great relevance to many microbiological arenas...|$|R
40|$|Fuel-cell-based {{auxiliary}} power units {{can help to}} reduce fuel consumption and emissions in transportation. For this application, the combination of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with <b>upstream</b> fuel <b>processing</b> by autothermal reforming (ATR) is seen as a highly favorable configuration. Notwithstanding the necessity to improve each single component, an optimized architecture of the fuel cell system as a whole must be achieved. To enable model-based analyses, a system-level approach is proposed in which the fuel cell system is modeled as a multi-stage thermo-chemical process using the "flowsheeting" environment PRO/II (TM). Therein, the SOFC stack and the ATR are characterized entirely by corresponding thermodynamic processes together with global performance parameters. The developed model is then used to achieve an optimal system layout by comparing different system architectures. A system with anode and cathode off-gas recycling was identified to have the highest electric system efficiency. Taking this system as a basis, the potential for further performance enhancement was evaluated by varying four parameters characterizing different system components. Using methods from the design and analysis of experiments, the effects of these parameters and of their interactions were quantified, leading to an overall optimized system with encouraging performance data.

40|$|Many {{industrial}} processes are in cascade configuration {{in which the}} material being processed goes through a sequence of processing units. The output of an <b>upstream</b> <b>processing</b> unit is fed into the input of the unit downstream. In many cases, the variables of interests are only available via related uncertain surrogate measurements in the all the upstream stages, and directly measured at {{the output of the}} last stage. The problem of controlling such systems by adaptively calibrating the surrogate measurement model and the use of a pre-emptive control strategy was studied in [9]. In this paper, the unknown actuator dynamics is taken into account in the adaptive calibration and pre-emptive control as well. A Lyapunov based nonlinear control algorithm is derived. The proposed control algorithm is applied to a vacuum dewatering process in paper manufacturing industry. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy can regulate the exiting moisture content of each unit at the desired value...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new {{bootstrapping}} framework using cross-lingual information projection. We demonstrate that this framework is particularly effective for a challenging NLP task which is {{situated at the}} end of a pipeline and thus suffers from the errors propagated from <b>upstream</b> <b>processing</b> and has low-performance baseline. Using Chinese event extraction as a case study and bitexts as a new source of information, we present three bootstrapping techniques. We first conclude that the standard mono-lingual bootstrapping approach is not so effective. Then we exploit a second approach that potentially benefits from the extra information captured by an English event extraction system and projected into Chinese. Such a crosslingual scheme produces significant performance gain. Finally we show that the combination of mono-lingual and cross-lingual information in bootstrapping can further enhance the performance. Ultimately this new framework obtained 10. 1 % relative improvement in trigger labeling (F-measure) and 9. 5 % relative improvement in argument labeling. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{ribozyme}} self-cleavage {{site in the}} antigenomic {{sequence of}} hepatitis delta virus (HDV) RNA is 33 -nt downstream of the poly(A) site for the delta antigen mRNA. An HDV antigenomic ribozyme precursor RNA that included the <b>upstream</b> poly(A) <b>processing</b> site {{was used to test}} the hypothesis that nonribozyme sequence near the poly(A) site could affect ribozyme activity. Relative to ribozyme precursor without the extra upstream sequences, the kinetic profile for self-cleavage of the longer precursor was altered in two ways. First, only half of the precursor RNA self-cleaved. The cleaved fraction could be increased or decreased with mutations in the upstream sequence. These mutations, which were predicted to alter the relative stability of competing secondary structures within the precursor, changed the distribution of alternative RNA structures that are resolved in native-gel electrophoresis. Second, the active fraction cleaved with an observed rate constant that was higher than that of the ribozyme without the upstream sequences. Moreover, the higher rate constants occurred at lower, near-physiological, divalent metal ion concentrations (1 – 2 mM). Modulation of ribozyme activity, through competing alternative structures, could be part of a mechanism that allows a biologically significant choice between maturation of the mRNA and processing of replication intermediates...|$|R
40|$|The {{bacteriophage}} lambda cIII gene product regulates the lysogenic pathway. The cIII gene {{is located in}} the leftward operon, which is transcribed from the pL promoter. We have previously shown (S. Altuvia and A. B. Oppenheim, J. Bacteriol. 167 : 415 - 419, 1986) that mutations that show elevated expression lie within the cIII coding sequence. We isolated mutants that show decreased CIII activity. All the mutations were found to cause a drastic reduction in the rate of initiation of cIII translation. Several mutations were found to be scattered within the first 40 nucleotides of the cIII coding region. Additional mutations affected the AUG initiation codon, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, and the <b>upstream</b> RNaseIII <b>processing</b> site. Computer folding of the cIII mRNA suggested the presence of two alternative RNA structures. All the mutations within the coding region that reduce expression reduce the stability of one specific mRNA structure (structure B). Mutations that increase expression lie in the loops of this structure and may in fact stabilize it by interfering with the formation of the alternative structure (structure A). Thus, it appears that a specific mRNA secondary structure {{at the beginning of the}} cIII coding region is essential for efficient translation, suggesting that changes in mRNA structure regulate cIII expression...|$|R

The challenges in designing the new system were interfacing with many different <b>upstream</b> detector subsystems, <b>processing</b> larger volumes of data at higher speed, and minimizing the impact on running the CDF experiment during the system commissioning phase.
