2500|$|Close {{refused to}} {{recognize}} {{the legality of the}} new congressional charter. Close now argued that the [...] of <b>unimproved</b> <b>land</b> was private, not cemetery, property. Further complicating matters, Close was engaged in a lengthy and bitter divorce proceeding. He had turned over to his wife all his stock and profits in Glenwood Cemetery. A D.C. district court ordered Close to turn over his interest in Glenwood Cemetery to the other investors, to be compensated for this investment, and to continue to receive 25 percent of the profits from the cemetery. Close appealed the ruling, asking to keep all [...] of the property. Close's wife appealed as well, demanding that the property be turned over to her.|$|E
