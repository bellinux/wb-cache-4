25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some that {{this is perhaps the}} most interesting of all the series events, including the race itself. In this event there are heats of 5–8 riders, depending on the number of riders signed up for the day. These heats are seeded according to the results of each rider's ITT. Riders are placed along the starting line in order from fastest (on the inside) to slowest (on the outside) and are then given one lap to get the position they want in the pack and to gain some speed. Once they cross the start/finish line again, the race begins. The riders race around the track and every time the pack crosses the start/finish line, the last one to cross is out and must leave the track. Riders keep racing until there are only three riders left. These three riders {{move on to the next}} round. This process continues until the final heat of 8. In this heat, riders continue to race and get out <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> the last three and then they commence a one lap full out sprint and the first, second, and third-place winners are determined by the order in which the riders cross the start/finish line. This is a great event because it really measures the skill of a rider, because in order to win, a rider must be more than just fast. If a rider hopes to win, she must also have good drafting skills, the ability to find good positioning, the intuition to know when to get out of the pack and sprint around the outside, and the endurance to be able to do this all day.|$|E

500|$|In June 1953, Hayward took {{command of}} the escort carrier [...] He confessed to the crew {{that he did not}} know what he was doing, and urged any crewman who felt he was doing {{something}} wrong to tell him so at once. At the end of the Korean War, the carrier was deployed at Inchon, where a baby was found abandoned in the trash at a U.S. Army depot. The baby was brought to an orphanage, and Hayward sent Point Cruzs chaplain in response to a request for assistance. The nun running the orphanage felt the blue-eyed baby would not be safe if he remained in Korea. Hayward is said to have told the chaplain: [...] "You are not to return to this vessel <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> procured that baby." ...|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{have noted}} that the Klingons, not humans, {{are the ones who}} quote Shakespeare; Gorkon claims {{at one point in the}} film that [...] "You have not {{experienced}} Shakespeare <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> read him in the original Klingon." [...] Translating Shakespeare into Klingon proved problematic because Marc Okrand had not created a verb for [...] "to be" [...] when he developed the language. Shakespeare scholar Paul A. Cantor argues that this association is appropriate—the warlike Klingons find their literary matches in the characters Othello, Mark Antony, and Macbeth—but that it also reinforces a claim that the end of the Cold War means the end of heroic literature such as Shakespeare's. Meyer said the idea for having the Klingons claim Shakespeare as their own was based on Nazi Germany's attempt to claim the Bard as German before World War II. According to Kay Smith, the use of Shakespeare has meaning in itself and also derives new meaning (underscoring cultural politics in the film) by its rearticulation in a new form.|$|E

[...] He claimed some HNC members were disseminating coup rumors and creating doubt among the population, and that [...] "both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence". Kỳ further accused some of the HNC members of being communist sympathizers and cowards who wanted to stop the military from strengthening. He promised to explain the decision at a media conference and vowed that he and his colleagues would return to purely military roles in the near future. Thiệu added [...] "I do not see how our action has hurt the Hương government...Hương now has the full support of the Army and has no worries from the High National Council, which we have eliminated."

500|$|Gilles Grimandi, Dixon and Overmars {{scored a}} goal apiece in Arsenal's victory at Leicester City in early December. Matthew Upson {{was forced to}} come off the pitch before the half-hour mark, after {{suffering}} a knee injury. Arsenal only managed a draw against Wimbledon on 18 December 1999; Henry's second half goal cancelled out Wimbledon's opener – a cross by Marcus Gayle met Carl Cort, whose shot hit goalkeeper Alex Manninger's left leg and went in. The poor form over Christmas continued: Arsenal lost 3–2 to Coventry City on Boxing Day. Rob Hughes of The Times noted his concerns about Arsenal's defence, which: [...] "...conceded 17 goals last season but now, at the halfway stage, [...] have already let in 20", but did go on to add [...] "there was nothing lacking in the tenacity of Arsenal." [...] Vieira made his return for the match against league leaders Leeds United, who were eight points in front of Arsenal. Wenger reshuffled the defence, dropping Dixon and Winterburn for Luzhny and Sylvinho, while Grimandi replaced Keown who was injured. Ljungberg and Henry scored for Arsenal in their 2–0 win to put the team third at the end of 1999. Adams suggested after the Leeds match that his opponents' inexperience and thin squad would jeopardise their chances of winning the league: [...] "They are still involved in the UEFA Cup and the FA Cup as well. So come February time they will start to feel that pressure – and you don't know what it is like <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been through it." ...|$|E
500|$|Peale {{departed}} from New York for Le Havre on May 8, 1833, arriving in Paris {{late in the}} month. [...] At this time, it was only certain that Peale would visit Paris—a visit to England, with instruction at local mints and refineries, was still under discussion. Peale had been instructed to learn [...] "parting," [...] a newly developed method for separating gold and silver. This process, also dubbed refining, is necessary because nuggets that contain gold also contain some silver, and the latter metal must be removed before the gold can be alloyed with copper for coining. [...] The older method of removing silver involved the use of nitric and sulphuric acids, and was dangerous and expensive. Director Moore also instructed Peale to gain the method of assaying silver by the [...] "humid process" [...] (titration), and to learn everything he could of coining technology {{and how it was}} powered by steam. Moore warned, [...] "a very material object of your mission is to be regarded as unaccomplished, <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> become familiar with everything requisite for directing the formation of an establishment de novo ... and until you shall have acquired a good share of adroitness in the actual manipulations... Whatever can be added to our information in regard to the treatment of the precious metals, and Mint processes and machinery is within the scope of your inquiries." [...] Moore asked that, if Peale had any time remaining, to look into other technologies that might be useful to the United States, such as the gas illumination of cities.|$|E
