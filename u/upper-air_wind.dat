In this paper {{the potential of}} applying balloon flights for <b>upper-air</b> <b>wind</b> measurements is explored, and the meteorological content of this information is investigated. The displacement of a hot-air balloon is a measure for the wind speed and direction and thus a potential source for wind observations in {{the lower part of}} the troposphere. The response time of the balloon on the changing wind is fast in the beginning and levels off for smaller relative wind speeds. Four case studies are presented, and the balloon-derived winds are compared with other wind observations and with results from the HIRLAM–ALADIN Research on Mesoscale Operational NWP in Europe (HARMONIE) model. It turns out that hot-air balloon tracks can indeed produce useful wind observations just above and in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) ...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} version 2 of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM 2) in simulating the diurnal cycle and to diagnose the deficiencies in underlying model physics, 10 years of 3 -hourly data from a CCSM 2 control run are analyzed for global and large-scale features of diurnal variations in surface air temperature, surface pressure, <b>upper-air</b> <b>winds,</b> cloud amount, and precipitation. The model-simulated diurnal variations are compared with available observations, {{most of which were}} derived from 3 -hourly synoptic reports and some new results are reported for surface air temperatures. The CCSM 2 reproduces most of the large-scale tidal variations in surface pressure and <b>upper-air</b> <b>winds,</b> although it overestimates the diurnal pressure tide by 20 %– 50 % over low-latitude land and underestimates it over most oceans, the Rockies, and other midlatitude land areas. The CCSM 2 captures the diurnal amplitude (18 – 68 C) and phase [peak at 1400 – 1600 local solar time (LST) ] of surface air temperature over land, but over ocean the amplitude is too small (# 0. 28 C). The CCSM 2 overestimates the mean total cloud amount by 10 %– 20 % of the sky from; 158 S to 158 N during both December– January–February (DJF) and June–July–August (JJA) and over northern mid- and high-latitude land areas in DJF, whereas it underestimates the cloud amount by 10 %– 30 % in the subtropics and parts of the midlatitudes.

Conventional flight-test calibration techniques are briefly reviewed and meteorological analysis methods for estimating calibration reference values of atmospheric conditions are described.

In these cases, atmospheric wind and pressure information can be used to complement conventional techniques. Accuracy of the atmospheric measurements and the variability of <b>upper-air</b> <b>winds</b> and pressure values are discussed. Results from several flight research aircraft show that wind reference calibration is generally less accurate than calibration accuracy standards for civil and research aircraft. Examples of pressure reference altimetry derived from meteorological analyses are also presented for a variety of flight research programs.

40|$|Previous studies {{indicated}} that surface wind speed over China declined during past decades, and several explanations {{exist in the}} literature. This study presents long-term (1960 – 2009) changes of both surface and <b>upper-air</b> <b>wind</b> speeds over China and addresses observed evidence to interpret these changes. It is found that surface wind over China underwent a three-phase change over the past 50 yr: (i) it step changed to a strong wind level {{at the end of}} the 1960 s, (ii) it declined until the beginning of the 2000 s, and (iii) it seemed to be steady and even recovering during the very recent years. The variability of surface wind speed is greater at higher elevations and less at lower elevations. In particular, surface wind speed over the elevated Tibetan Plateau has changed more significantly. Changes in <b>upper-air</b> <b>wind</b> speed observed from rawinsonde are similar to surface wind changes. The NCEP–NCAR reanalysis indicates that wind speed changes correspond to changes in geopotential height gradient at 500 hPa. The latter are further correlated with the changes of latitudinal surface temperature gradient, with a correlation coefficient of 0. 88 for the past 50 yr over China. This strongly suggests that the spatial gradient of surface global warming or cooling may significantly change surface wind speed at a regional scale through atmospheric thermal adaption. The recovery of wind speed since the beginning of the 2000 s over the Tibetan Plateau might be a precursor of the reversal of wind speed trends over China, as wind over high elevations can respond more rapidly to the warming gradient and atmospheric circulation adjustment. 1...|$|E

Using the field observations taken under IGOC, an attempt is made to investigate dynamical and thermal structure and also wave activities in relation to prevailing monsoon conditions over the station. Auto-correlation analysis has been carried out to identify the dominant modes associated with the monsoon variations observed over the station. Various wave characteristics have been extracted. The study has indicated the presence of gravity waves over this tropical station, during monsoon period. It is inferred that the wind shear and tropical convection associated with weather disturbances are possible sources of excitation of such waves over the location...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, an {{exploratory}} {{study on the}} variance characteristics of <b>upper-air</b> <b>winds</b> in a near-equator monsoon region is presented. The data were obtained from historical radiosonde observations from up to 250 stations within the region of interest for the period between 1954 and 2013. An alternative method based on vector statistics was employed in this study which characterises the mean by a vector and the variance by a tensor. Unlike the conventional approach of using scalar wind speeds, this vector-tensor approach allows the directional properties of the variance to be studied. A suite of statistics to describe the geometric properties of the variance tensor was also developed. These characterise {{the size of the}} variance, its degree of anisotropy, and the alignment of the preferred direction (if anisotropy is present) with the direction of the mean wind vector. Through analysis of these statistics, several salient trends were observed for the middle troposphere. It was found that the variance size and anisotropy exhibit significant variation with height whereas the alignment with the mean vector varies with the mean wind magnitude instead. It was also found that the scalar variance increases with mean wind speed...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of undetected errors in recorded wind observations {{may have a}} biasing influence on a statistical study. In the progress of some studies {{it has been found}} necessary to reexamine the data being used. A series of <b>upper-air</b> <b>winds</b> has been checked by using available listings of vertical shear and extreme winds. The developed procedure permits correction for major errors and tolerates the minor (random) errors. The test of data by maximum wind profiles uses the highest and second highest scalar wind speed for each station and checks the data by profile scan. The test of data by vertical wind shear uses a critical value, theoretically derived, exceedance of which marks the data as suspicious. A detailed check of the wind observation verifies this suspicious value or it is corrected. In this program 3. 5 percent of the observations proved suspicious and 85 percent thereof, tha t is, 2. 9 percent of the observations, required correction. Thus the critical value is highly efficient. The errors were traced and split into clerical errors (1. 1 percent), instrumental errors (1. 3 percent), and computa-tional errors (0. 5 percent), which are quite within reasonable limits. 1...|$|R
40|$|Using the COLA (Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies) general {{circulation}} model, {{a series of}} numerical experiments were conducted to {{examine the impact of}} uplift of the Tibetan Plateau on the evolution of the monsoon climate in East Asia. An attempt was made to isolate the effect of the Plateau uplift from the changes in other forcing mechanisms. We examined the spatial and temporal variation patterns of a variety of climatic variables and indices, including monsoon intensity, sea level pressure, surface and <b>upper-air</b> <b>winds,</b> temperature at different levels, precipitation, air humidity and soil moisture. Our results suggest that the evolution of the East Asia monsoon may be more sensitive to the uplift of the Tibetan Plateau than that of the South Asia monsoon. Moreover, the effect of the Plateau uplift on the East Asia winter monsoon is more significant than that on the summer monsoon. In the northern part of East Asia (North China), the formation of the monsoon climate is marked mainly by the establishment of the northerly winds in winter, or the winter monsoon system, corresponding to the uplift of the Plateau when the height reaches approximately 50 % of its current elevation. On the other hand, the establishment of the monsoon climate {{in the southern part of}} East Asia (the Yangtze River valley and the area south of it) may be much earlier than that in the northern part. 7 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Climate in the European {{part of the}} Arctic {{underwent}} a rapid warming between the 1910 s and the 1930 s. Previous studies have addressed the role of atmospheric circulation in this period based on geopotential height fields because observations of upper-level winds in the Arctic are rare. Here we analyse winds over the Arctic and specifically over Spitsbergen in the “Twentieth Century Reanalyses” (20 CR). We compare in situ <b>upper-air</b> <b>wind</b> measurements performed in 1912 and 1913 in Spitsbergen with six-hourly 20 CR data. Furthermore, we compare monthly-to-seasonal 20 CR winds at 700 hPa over the European Arctic with statistically reconstructed winds at 3 km altitude. Finally, we analyse long-term trends in Arctic winds in 20 CR. The general agreement between observed upper-air winds and 20 CR on the day-to-day scale is rather poor, which is not surprising given the paucity of observations in the Arctic {{at that time that}} constrain 20 CR. In contrast, the seasonally averaged winds (which represent a larger spatial scale) in 20 CR compare well with statistically reconstructed winds. The analysis of long term near-surface wind time series in 20 CR shows arguably artificial trends from 1871 to around the 1950 s over sparsely observed regions, particularly oceanic regions. Densely observed regions such as Europe or the USA show no such trends. This analysis shows that great care needs to be taken when working with 20 CR in the Arctic and other sparsely observed regions...|$|E
40|$|The Sahara Desert is {{the largest}} dust source on Earth. Its dust is {{frequently}} emitted into the Mediterranean atmosphere and transported by the winds sometimes {{as far north as}} Central Europe. The accumulated particles contribute to soil forming processes, while the atmospheric mineral dust has an impact on the radiation budget, cloud forming processes, the pH of precipitation and biogeochemical cycles of marine ecosystems. The PM (particulate matter) in ambient air does not contain only primary particles but secondary particles formed in the atmosphere from precursor gases as well. Especially these latter ones have significant negative impacts to human health. There are in average four-five Saharan dust episodes annually in Hungary, sometimes in form of colour precipitation (brown rainfall, red snow). There are several possibilities for providing evidence for the Saharan origin of the dust observed in our country: back-trajectories using NOAA HYSPLIT model, TOMS satellite maps of NASA, maps of aerosol index of Ozone Monitoring Instrument, observations of spectral aerosol optical depth of Aerosol Robotic Network, satellite maps of EUMETSAT, elemental analysis of dust samples. In this study we try to reveal the suitability of the <b>upper-air</b> <b>wind</b> fields in detection of Saharan dust episodes in Central Europe.

40|$|Air {{stagnation}} is {{an important}} meteorological measure of unfavorable air pollution conditions, but {{little is known about}} it in China. We conducted a comprehensive investigation of air stagnation in China from January 1985 to December 2014 based on sounding and surface observations from 81  stations. The stagnation criteria were revised to account for the large topographical diversity in the country. It is found that the annual mean of air stagnation occurrences is closely related to general topography and climate features. Two basins in the northwest and southwest of China, the Tarim and Sichuan basins, exhibit the most frequent stagnation occurrence (50  % of days per year), whereas two plateaus (the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau and the Inner Mongolian plateau) and the eastern coastal areas experience the least (20  % of days per year). Over the whole country, air stagnation is at a maximum in summer and a minimum in winter, except for Urumchi, a major city in northwestern China where stagnation maintains a rather constant value year round with a minimum in spring. There is a nationwide positive trend in stagnation occurrence during 1985 – 2014, with the strongest increasing centers over Shandong Peninsula in eastern China and southern Shaanxi in central China. Changes in air stagnation occurrences are dependent on three components (upper- and lower-air winds and precipitation-free days). This shows that the behavior of <b>upper-air</b> <b>wind</b> speeds is the main driver of the spatial distribution and trends in air stagnation, followed by near-surface winds and dry days, which contribute the least...|$|E
40|$|Reference {{evapotranspiration}} (RET), {{an indicator}} of atmospheric evaporating capability over a hypothetical reference surface, was calculated using the Penman-Monteith method for 75 stations across the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau between 1971 and 2004.

Multivariate linear models {{were used to determine}} the contributions of climate factors to RET change, including air temperature, air humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed. Spatial differences in the causes of RET change were detected by K-means clustering analysis. It indicates that wind speed predominated the changes of RET almost throughout the year, especially in the north of the study region, whereas radiation was the leading factor in the southeast, especially during the summertime. Although the recent warming trend over the plateau would have increased RET, the combined effect of the reduced wind speed and shortened sunshine duration negated the effect of rising temperature and caused RET to decrease in general.

From the homogenized data record, the first Ny-Ålesund <b>upper-air</b> climatology of <b>wind,</b> temperature and humidity is presented, forming the background {{for the analysis of}} changes during the 22 -year period. Particularly during the winter season, a strong increase in atmospheric temperature and humidity is observed, with a significant warming of the free troposphere in January and February up to 3 K per decade. This winter warming is even more pronounced in the boundary layer below 1 km, presumably amplified by mesoscale processes including e. g. orographic effects or the boundary layer capping inversion. Though the largest contribution to the increasing atmospheric water vapour column in winter originates from the lowermost 2 km, no increase in the contribution by specific humidity inversions is detected. Instead, we find an increase in the humidity content of the large-scale background humidity profiles. At the same time, the tropospheric flow in winter is found to occur less frequent from northerly directions and to the same amount more frequent from the South. We conclude that changes in the atmospheric circulation lead to an enhanced advection of warm and moist air from lower latitudes to the Svalbard region in the winter season, causing the warming and moistening of the atmospheric column above Ny-Ålesund, and link the observations to changes in the Arctic Oscillation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the mean atmospheric conditions associated with synoptic-scale rainfall fluctuations over Central America {{during the rainy}} season. The study is based on composites of wet and dry spells; these composites are generated from six years (1990 – 94 and 1997) of daily rainfall observations from select Central American stations, one year (1997) of <b>upper-air</b> <b>wind</b> data from an enhanced sounding network over the region, National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data. Wet spells, defined as days when 75 % {{or more of the}} stations along the Pacific side of Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama reported rainfall, are associated with weaker trade winds over the Caribbean and stronger cross-equatorial flow northward over the eastern Pacific. During wet spells the intensity of eastern Pacific cross-equatorial flow exceeds by several meters per second the seasonal mean in the lower and middle troposphere, and is strongest and deepest one day before the wettest day. Dry spells, defined as the days when 35 % or less of these stations reported rainfall, are associated with stronger trade winds over Central America and weaker and shallower cross-equatorial flow. The basic flow patterns seen in the observation-based composites agree well with similar composites produced using reanalysis data, except that the observations show stronger cross-equatorial flow in the lower-mid troposphere over the eastern Pacific. OLR data shows that convective cloudiness anomalies associated with the wet and dry spells extend westward from Central America into the eastern tropical Pacific. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the initial area expansion rate of tropical convective systems and their total life duration are analyzed {{during the period of}} the Wet Season Amazon Mesoscale Campaign/Large-Scale Biosphere Atmosphere (WETAMC/LBA) experiment over tropical South America, using an objective tracking of convective systems during their life cycle from infrared Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) images. The results show {{that it is possible to}} estimate the probable lifetime of a convective system, within certain error bars, considering only its initial area expansion. This result shows that the initial area expansion could be used as a predictor of the life cycle of convective systems. The area expansion is also a good indicator of convective activity such as the diurnal cycle of convection. Over the southwest Amazon, the maximum area expansion occurs close to the time of maximum precipitation and about 4 h before the maximum cold cloud fraction at the same threshold (235 K). Also, the hypothesis that the area expansion, and hence the convective activity, impacts the high-level wind divergence has been investigated using satellite wind observations. It is found that the wind divergence fields derived are able to describe the large-scale patterns but are not able to capture the small-scale features. The diurnal cycle of the high-level wind divergence generally shows a flat response over tropical South America, although a coherent but not significant signal is observed over the WETAMC/LBA area. It is shown that the area of the cloud shield of convective systems varies not only in association with the upper-level wind divergence but also with the condensation-evaporation process. The increase of area in this initial stage is mainly due to the condensation process. During the ensuing mature stage, the <b>upper-air</b> <b>wind</b> divergence also contributes to the expansion.

The observed wind vertical profile collected during PACS-SONET and SALLJEX were used to validate the LLJ simulated by RegCM during 1999 and 2003 austral summers, respectively. The simulation domain includes practically the whole South America at 60 km horizontal resolution and 23 sigma levels in the vertical. The LLJ periods were identify by using Sugahara et al. (1994) criterion, for both observed and simulated wind profile. The Bonner criterion 1 was also applied to comparative analysis. The region in the east of Andes appears on the simulations how being the region of greater LLJ occurrence and the LLJ diurnal cycle shows the preference of occurrence at 00 : 00 UTC. The mean meridional wind maximum is higher in the simulations than in the observations. By comparing the two summers seasons was noted that the level of maximum meridional wind is higher in 2003 than in 1999. Composites of days with and without LLJ indicate that there is a relationship between LLJ occurrence and the intensification of the precipitation six hours after over south Brazil, Paraguay and north of Argentine. Composites of the wind vertical profiles for days with LLJ at Robore station shows that below 1600 m the observed wind is more intense than the simulated. Another difference in the vertical profiles is that the maximum is localized at 1300 and 1600 m in the observations and simulations, respectively. However, the mean vertical profile of the simulated wind presents the same observed vertical structure, mostly for zonal component. Pages: 607 - 61...|$|E
40|$|The Space Shuttle is an {{extremely}} weather sensitive vehicle with very restrictive constraints for both launches and landings. The most important difference between Shuttle and normal aircraft landings is that the Shuttle has no go-around capability once it begins its decent into the earth's atmosphere. The de-orbit burn decision is generally made approximately 90 minutes before landing requiring a forecast with little room for error. Because of the Shuttle's rapid re-entry to earth, the pilot {{must be able to}} see all runway and visual navigation aids from high altitude to land the Shuttle. In addition, the heat resistant tiles which are used to protect the Shuttle during its re-entry into the earth's atmosphere are extremely sensitive to any type of precipitation. Extensive damage to these tiles could occur if the Shuttle passes through any cloud that contains precipitation size particles. To help guard against changing weather conditions or any type of weather problems that might occur prior to landing, flight rules have been developed as guidelines for all landings. Although the rules vary depending on the location of the landing (Kennedy Space Center or Edwards AFB), length of mission, and weight of vehicle, most of the rules can be condensed into 4 major groupings. These are: (1) Cloud ceilings should not be less than 3048 m (10, 000 feet), (2) Visibility should not be less than 13 km (7 nm), (3) Cross-wind no greater than 5 - 8 m/s (10 - 15 knots); and (4) No showers or thunderstorms at or within 56 km (30 nm) of the Shuttle Landing Facility. This study consisted of developing a climatological database of the Shuttle Landing Facility (SLF) surface observations and performing an analysis of observed conditions one and two hours subsequent to given conditions at the SLF to help analyze the 0. 2 cloud cover rule. Particular emphasis was placed on Shuttle landing weather violations and the amounts of cloud cover below 3048 m (10, 000 ft.). This analysis has helped to determine the best and worst times to land the Shuttle at KSC.
