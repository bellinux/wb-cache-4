25|$|On the Greater Western franchise, {{the current}} fleet of HSTs is {{expected}} to remain in service until 2017, the scheduled date for introduction of the Intercity Express. Between 12 and 20 HST sets were to be retained and refurbished to carry on providing services between London and Devon and Cornwall, where no electrification is currently planned, and where the Class 800's engines would not be capable of negotiating the steep gradients along the South Devon Banks, through to the mid-2020s. A 2011 report concluded that the Mark 3 coaches could remain in service as late as 2035 with some minor rewiring and enhancements required <b>under</b> <b>disability</b> legislation. However, it was announced in March 2015 that, subject to approval and contract, the HSTs will now be replaced with the Class 802, a more powerful derivative of the bi-mode Class 800s.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1950s, {{the courts}} {{commonly}} accepted {{that they could}} approve a [...] "compromise" [...] agreement {{where there was a}} dispute over the precise meaning of words in a trust document. In some cases, the courts used this to rearrange trusts for the benefit of certain parties (such as minors) where there was no real dispute. In 1954 however, the House of Lords decided in Chapman v Chapman [...] AC 429 that this power was reserved for a genuine dispute. This decision caused frustration: where previously all trusts could be varied, either through the court's ability to create a [...] "compromise" [...] agreement or the rights granted to trusts which came under the Settled Land Act 1925, Chapman limited this right to those created under the 1925 Act. In January 1957 the Lord Chancellor asked the Law Reform Committee [...] "to consider whether any alteration is desirable in the powers of the court to sanction a variation in the trusts of a settlement in the interests of beneficiaries <b>under</b> <b>disability</b> and unborn persons, with particular reference to the decision in Chapman v. Chapman", and a report was presented to Parliament in November of that year. A draft bill was drawn up and introduced by Petre Crowder, the Member of Parliament for Ruislip-Northwood; it received its second reading in the House of Lords on 12 June 1958, and was given the Royal Assent on 23 July 1958.|$|E

Homosexuality was added in 1983, vilification of certain groups was added in 1993, transgender status and HIV/AIDS status (<b>under</b> <b>disability)</b> was added in 1996 and then in 2008, marital or domestic status was added.|$|E

50|$|In common law, a {{next friend}} (Law French prochain ami) {{is a person}} who {{represents}} another person who is <b>under</b> <b>disability</b> or otherwise unable to maintain a suit on his or her own behalf and who does not have a legal guardian. In England and Wales they are known as litigation friends. When a relative who is next of kin acts as a next friend for a person, that person is sometimes instead described as the natural guardian of the person. A next friend has full power over the proceedings in the action as if he or she were an ordinary plaintiff, until a guardian or guardian ad litem is appointed in the case; but the next friend is entitled to present evidence only on the same basis as any other witness.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, in {{the case}} of a minor, the father was prima facie the proper person to act as next friend; in the father's absence, the {{testamentary}} guardian, if any, was next friend; but any person not <b>under</b> <b>disability</b> could act as next friend so long as he has no interest in the action adverse to that of the minor. A married woman could not historically act as next friend but this practice is no longer current, at least in the United States, where either or both of a minor's parents may act as next friend. (An exception is in divorce cases or other cases affecting child custody; in such cases courts often appoint a guardian or attorney (independent of the parents) to represent the child's interests, which may not be aligned with either parent's interests.) ...|$|E

50|$|But we {{are unable}} to {{appreciate}} the force of this supposed distinction. The statute in question contains no exception in favor of claimants <b>under</b> <b>disability</b> of nonage or otherwise; the claim of the complainants against John G. Morgan was adverse to his administrator, although it may have originated in consequence of a relation of trust, and there is no ground that we are able to understand on which it can be excepted out of the operation of the statute in question. Their claim was equally against the administrator of John G. Morgan whether the latter be considered as the defaulting partner of themselves or of their father. Whatever its description, it was a claim against the estate of John G. Morgan, and for which his personal representative was in the first instance liable, and the statute is a bar to every such claim unless presented within the time prescribed.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} Christianity upon the will was very marked. For instance, {{the duty of}} bequeathing to the Church was inculcated as early as Constantine, and heretics and monks were placed under a {{disability}} to make a will or take gifts left by will. A will was often deposited in a church. The Canon law follows the Roman law with a still greater leaning {{to the advantage of}} the Church. No Church property could be bequeathed. Manifest usurers were added to the list of those <b>under</b> <b>disability.</b> For the validity of a will it was generally necessary that it should be made {{in the presence of a}} priest and two witnesses, unless where it was made in pias causes. The witnesses, as in Roman law, must be done. Gifts to the Church were not subject to the deductions in favour of the heir and the children necessary in ordinary cases. In England, the Church succeeded in holding in its own hands for centuries jurisdiction in testamentary matters.|$|E
5000|$|A {{married woman}} or a slave is also [...] "bad to meet," [...] as full {{compensation}} {{must be paid}} for any injury done to either of them. According to the better opinion, the assailant of a slave must pay even for the disgrace put upon him. The compensation for injury to a married woman, for pain and shame, is paid to her; for loss of work and healing, to her husband; for damage proper, according to one opinion, to her, according to another, to her husband. For an injury to a slave the whole compensation goes to the master. When an injury is done to an infant boy still at the father's board, the compensation should be invested in land, of which the father will receive the rents and profits till the boy attains full age (thirteen). When a father injures his infant daughter, he pays pain, cure, and shame to her at once, but neither damage nor loss of time. A married woman is excused from payment only because she has no property under her own control; a slave, because he can not own property: hence, when the woman, {{by the death of}} her husband or by divorce, comes to her own, or when the slave is manumitted, she or he may be sued for the injury done while <b>under</b> <b>disability</b> (ib. viii. 4).|$|E
