It also has ** for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125 and 9**0.5 == 3.0, {{and a new}} matrix multiply @ operator is included in version 3.5. Additionally, it has a <b>unary</b> <b>operator</b> (~), which essentially inverts all the bytes of its one argument. For integers, this means ~x=-x-1. Other operators include bitwise shift operators x << y, which shifts x to the left y places, the same as x*(2**y) , and x >> y, which shifts x to the right y places, the same as x/(2**y) [...]|$|E

The translation between modal logics and algebraic logics concerns classical and intuitionistic logics but with the introduction of a <b>unary</b> <b>operator</b> on Boolean or Heyting algebras, different from the Boolean operations, interpreting the possibility modality, {{and in the case of}} Heyting algebra a second operator interpreting necessity (for Boolean algebra this is redundant since necessity is the De Morgan dual of possibility).

5000|$|Examples of <b>unary</b> <b>operators</b> in {{mathematics}} and in programming include the unary minus and plus, the increment and decrement operators in C-style languages (not in logical languages), and the factorial, reciprocal, floor, ceiling, fractional part, sign, absolute value, complex conjugate (unary of [...] "one" [...] complex number, that however has two parts at {{a lower level of}} abstraction), and norm functions {{in mathematics}}.

5000|$|The {{position}} of the operator with respect to its operands may be prefix, infix or postfix, and the syntax of an expression involving an operator depends on its arity (number of operands), precedence, and (if applicable), associativity. Most programming languages support binary operators and a few <b>unary</b> <b>operators,</b> with a few supporting more operands, such as the ?: operator in C, which is ternary. There are prefix <b>unary</b> <b>operators,</b> such as <b>unary</b> minus , and postfix <b>unary</b> <b>operators,</b> such as post-increment and binary operations are infix, such as [...] or [...] Infix operations of higher arity require additional symbols, such as the ternary operator ?: in C, written as [...] - indeed, {{this is the only}} common example, it {{is often referred to as}} the ternary operator.

Realization of quaternary <b>unary</b> <b>operators</b> (QUOs) using quaternary multiplexer (QMUX) is presented in this paper. QUOs are divided into eight groups {{on the basis of}} the number of change overs in the output for an input sequence of 0, 1, 2, 3. This grouping reduces the hardware required to realize them. QMUX with two, three, and four input lines are proposed for the realization of QUOs belonging to the eight groups.
