40|$|The {{complex problem}} of quality {{increasing}} {{of the satellite}} spatial orientation control is examined {{by the use of}} modern methods of information treatment, algorithms of control moments forming and using of robust control methods. The moments are created with magnetic coils and reaction-wheels. For the exception of the <b>unloading</b> <b>mode</b> of reaction-wheels an integral action is entered in the control law, thus it is given only on coils. In default of angular rate sensor, it will be to decide the problem of satellite full state vector estimation on the ground of signals only position sensors - magnetometer and Sun sensor with the use of algorithm of set-valued estimation. Estimation of satellite state vector with multiplicative update of orientation estimation allows set-valued filter to provide high accuracy of estimation at uncertain environment of operating on a satellite. ??????????????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ???????????????? ?????????? ????????????? ?? ?????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????, ?????????? ???????????? ???????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ???????. ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ? ???????????-??????????. ??? ?????????? ?????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ???????????? ???????????? ? ????? ??????????, ??????, ?????? ? ?????????? ?????????. ? ????? ? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ????????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ?? ?????? ?????? ??????????? ????????. ?????????? ??????? ????????? ????? ?????????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ?? ???? ?????????? ???????????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ???????? ??????????...|$|E
40|$|Ground source cooling is {{commonly}} used for cooling of electronics in protected sites. Sometimes the boreholes are combined with free cooling from the air using a dry cooler {{to reduce the amount}} and length of the boreholes, which is the biggest part of the costs. The dry cooler can have two different running modes. In <b>unloading</b> <b>mode</b> the dry cooler is started at a certain temperature and the fans are slowed down at low temperatures so that the cooling power never exceeds the cooling demand. The extracted cooling is used to unload the boreholes. In recharging mode the dry cooler is started at a certain temperature and is operating at full capacity below this temperature. The excess cooling that is extracted in this mode is used to recharge the boreholes. The numerical simulation tool COMSOL Multiphysics was used to evaluate the borehole performance. The software can simulate tilted boreholes with good accuracy and makes it possible to adjust the geometry in any desired way. In this thesis, the performance of a 100 kW ground source cooling system is evaluated for a number of cases both with and without dry coolers in different running modes and sizes. The best solution in respect to life cycle cost, technical feasibility and environmental impact is chosen to be an unloading case with a dry cooler with 100 kW capacity at 8 °C. Using only boreholes gives less carbon dioxide emissions but much higher costs...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} ion {{treatment}} on the phase composition and mechanical {{properties of the}} near-surface layers of zirconium ceramic composition 97 ZrO[2 - 3]Y[2]O[3] (mol%) was studied. Irradiation of the samples {{was carried out by}} accelerated ions of aluminum with using vacuum-arc source Mevva 5 -Ru. Ion beam had the following parameters: the energy of the accelerated ions E= 78 keV, the pulse current density J[i] = 4 mA/cm{ 2 }, current pulse duration equal tay= 250 mcs, pulse repetition frequency f= 5 Hz. Exposure doses (fluence) were 10 { 16 } и 10 { 17 } ion/cm{ 2 }. The depth distribution implanted ions was studied by SIMS method. It is shown that the maximum projected range of the implanted ions is equal to 250 nm. Near-surface layers were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at fixed glancing incidence angle. It is shown that implantation of aluminum ions into the ceramics does not lead to a change in the phase composition of the near-surface layer. The influence of implanted ions on mechanical properties of ceramic near-surface layers was studied by the method of dynamic nanoindentation using small loads on the indenter P= 300 mN. It is shown that in ion- implanted ceramic layer the processes of material recovery in the deformed region in the <b>unloading</b> <b>mode</b> proceeds with higher efficiency as compared with the initial material state. The deformation characteristics of samples before and after ion treatment have been determined from interpretation of the resulting P-h curves within the loading and unloading sections by the technique proposed by Oliver and Pharr. It was found that implantation of aluminum ions in the near-surface layer of zirconia ceramics increases nanohardness and reduces the Young's modulus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{focuses on}} the {{enhanced}} stiffness modeling of robotic manipulators by taking into account influence of the external force/torque acting upon the end point. It implements the virtual joint technique that describes the compliance of manipulator elements {{by a set of}} localized six-dimensional springs separated by rigid links and perfect joints. In contrast to the conventional formulation, which is valid for the <b>unloaded</b> <b>mode</b> and small displacements, the proposed approach implicitly assumes that the loading leads to the non-negligible changes of the manipulator posture and corresponding amendment of the Jacobian. The developed numerical technique allows computing the static equilibrium and relevant force/torque reaction of the manipulator for any given displacement of the end-effector. This enables designer detecting essentially nonlinear effects in elastic behavior of manipulator, similar to the buckling of beam elements.

40|$|A {{pulse width}} {{modulation}} (PWM) bypass capacity control technique for air conditioners has been developed to achieve high scroll compressor efficiency over a wide capacity range, and we investigated the technique’s fundamental characteristics in this study. With this capacity control technique, the refrigerant flow rate is controlled by periodically switching a full load mode, in which the refrigerant is compressed and discharged out of the compressor, and an <b>unload</b> <b>mode,</b> in which the refrigerant is not compressed so that the power needed to compress is unnecessary. In this study, we measured the pressure and input power of a compressor using the control technique to clarify the technique’s dynamic characteristics. We also developed a numerical simulation model to predict the dynamic behavior of the refrigerant. The calculated pressures {{were found to be}} in good agreement with the measured pressures and were used to estimate the relation between the PWM period and the efficiency or the discharge flow rate. Since the PWM period could not be determined by the demanded load capacity, the estimations were used to determine it. Using this period, we carried out performance tests of a compressor with PWM bypass capacity control. The results showed the capacity reached 30 % of the lower limit of rotational speed and that the calculated efficiencies agreed well with the experimental findings...|$|R
50|$|Reciprocating {{compressors}} {{often have}} better unloading capabilities than scroll compressors. Reciprocating compressors operate efficiently in <b>unloaded</b> <b>mode</b> when flow {{to some of}} the cylinders is completely cut off by internal solenoid valves. Two-stage reciprocating compressors are also well suited for vapor injection (or what may be called economized operation) when partially expanded flow is injected {{between the first and second}} compression stages for increased capacity and improved efficiency. While scroll compressors can also rely on vapor injection to vary the capacity, their vapor injection operation is not as efficient as for the case of reciprocating compressors. This inefficiency is caused by continuously changing volume of the scroll compressor compression pocket during the vapor injection process. As the volume is continuously being changed the pressure within the compression pocket is also continuously changing which adds inefficiency to the vapor injection process. In case of a two-stage reciprocating compressor the vapor injection takes place between the two stages, where there is no changing volume. Both scroll and reciprocating compressors can be unloaded from mid-stage compression, however reciprocating compressors are also more efficient for this <b>mode</b> of <b>unloading</b> than scroll compressors, because the unloaded port dimensions in case of scroll is limited by the internal port size, which would not be the case for a reciprocating compressor where unloading again occurs from between the two stages.|$|R
40|$|The {{specified}} macro-molecule {{approach is}} tested using the reversed-torsion load {{case for the}} 30 × 10 × 10 (mm) bar made of AlMg 6 aluminium alloy. The work has two parts: the experiment part and the calculation part. The experiment is carried out using both the automatic INSTRON torsion machine and the AVERY torsion machine with manual control. The available backlash between the deformed bar and the torsion grip is taken into account. The calculation model is developed using the MSC. Adams software. The reversed-torsion load case consists of the nine modes: 1) original backlash mode (optional), 2) one-directional 90 º torsion, 3) <b>unloading,</b> 4) backlash <b>mode,</b> 5) 60 º torsion in the opposite direction, 6) <b>unloading,</b> 7) backlash <b>mode,</b> 8) 30 º torsion in the original direction, 9) unloading.

40|$|Due to the {{increased}} appeal of rotary blood pumps for long-term cardiac assist, we conducted a study of their capacity to unload the left ventricle (LV). We used a validated mathematical model of the cardiovascular system and implemented the pump characteristics of an investigational microdiagonal pump (Medos). The influence of the pump on systemic hemodynamics, LV energetic parameters, and wall stress was evaluated in continuous and synchronous pulsatile modes of operation. For the continuous mode simulations, the influence of heart rate, LV contractility, and pump speed was assessed in a parametric study. For the pulsatile mode, different onsets of a synchronous time-varying pump speed pattern were tested. Our data indicate that the effectiveness of <b>unloading</b> in continuous <b>mode</b> depends on the contractility of the native ventricle. Hypocontractile ventricles are most easily unloaded, while ventricles with moderate contractility require high continuous pump speeds to achieve notable <b>unloading.</b> In pulsatile <b>mode,</b> the pump timing is an important determinant of pump/cardiovascular system interaction, with a counterpulsation setting yielding the best unloading. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{viscosity}} {{of material}} is considered at propagating crack-tip. Under {{the assumption that}} the artificial viscosity coefficient is in inverse proportion to the power law of the plastic strain rate, an elastic-viscoplastic asymptotic analysis is carried out for moving crack-tip fields in power-hardening materials under plane-strain condition. A continuous solution is obtained containing no discontinuities. The variations of the numerical solution are discussed for mode I crack according to each parameter. It is shown that stress and strain both possess exponential singularity. The elasticity, plasticity and viscosity of material at the crack-tip only can be matched reasonably under linear-hardening condition. The tip field contains no elastic <b>unloading</b> zone for <b>mode</b> I crack. 1...|$|R
40|$|Decay heat {{power of}} {{actinides}} and fission products from {{spent nuclear fuel}} of power VVER- 1000 type reactors at long-term storage is calculated. Two modes of storage are considered: mode in which single portion of actinides or fission products is loaded in storage facility, and mode in which actinides or fission products from spent fuel of one VVER reactor are added every year in storage facility during 30 years and then accumulated nuclides are stored without addition new nuclides. Two values of fuel burnup 40 and 70 MW·d/kg are considered for the mode of storage of single fuel <b>unloading.</b> For the <b>mode</b> of accumulation of spent fuel with subsequent storage, one value of burnup of 70 MW·d/kg is considered. Very long time of storage 105 years accepted in calculations allows to simulate final geological disposal of radioactive wastes. Heat power of fission products decreases quickly after 50 - 100 years of storage. The power of actinides decreases very slow. In passing from 40 to 70 MW·d/kg, power of actinides increases due to accumulation of higher fraction of 244 Cm. These data are important in {{the back end of}} fuel cycle when improved cooling system of the storage facility will be required along with stronger radiation protection during storage, transportation and processing...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: pages 146 - 155. An {{anisotropic}} damage {{model is}} {{proposed for the}} constitutive description of microcracking processes in brittle rock under a general loading path. Experimental data and micromechanical models are reviewed to quantify the effect of microcracking on the material stiffness and the mechanisms of microcrack formation in brittle rocks under compression are discussed. The sliding crack concept is adopted as the micromechanical basis of the anisotropic damage model. Undamaged material is represented with a linear elastic constitutive equation. Damage initiation is defined by a Coulomb friction law, which excludes damage at low deviatoric stress levels. The formulation of the directional damage extends the arguments of continuum damage models for tension cracking to general, tension and compression, stress states. This is achieved by the definition of damage in a subdomain of the total strain and the characterisation of the directional microcracking by a fourth order tensor internal variable, the damaged secant stiffness of the 'crack' strain subdomain. Induced anisotropy results from the reduction of components of the initial stiffness tensor {{in the direction of}} the positive principal 'crack' strains. Evolution of the damage magnitude is determined by the principle of maximum damage dissipation in terms of the undamaged energy norm of the positive part of the 'crack' strain tensor. Versatile evolution functions, based on the Weibull probability density function, are proposed for compression and extension damage <b>modes.</b> <b>Unloading</b> and reloading criteria are developed which are consistent with the sliding crack concept and introduce hysteretic behaviour. A numerical solution scheme is presented and the model is implemented in a nonlinear finite element program...|$|R
