25|$|Mammalian cells {{carrying}} {{mutations in}} ERCC1 or XPF are especially sensitive to agents that cause DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL) Interstrand crosslinks block {{the progression of}} DNA replication, and structures at blocked DNA replication forks provide substrates for cleavage by ERCC1-XPF. Incisions may be made {{on either side of}} the crosslink on one DNA strand to <b>unhook</b> the crosslink and initiate repair. Alternatively, a double-strand break may be made in the DNA near the ICL, and subsequent homologous recombination repair my involve ERCC1-XPF action. Although not the only nuclease involved, ERCC1â€“XPF is required for ICL repair during several phases of the cell cycle.|$|E
25|$|Zorner {{claimed his}} 7th victory on 28/29 June {{southeast}} of Antwerp, Belgium at 02:20. It was recorded as a Halifax bomber. Another Wellington was claimed southwest of Sint-Truiden at 01:09. Zorner achieved his 10th victory west of Malmedy at 01:53. Zorner's 11th victory {{was shot down}} northeast of Groningen at 03:54 on 24/24 July. His victim was Halifax R5573 flown by Flight Sergeant Kenneth Hector Wally McLean from No. 106 Squadron RAF. Zorner saw the Halifax crash and explode {{which resulted in a}} fire-work display of green, red and white flashes. They assumed the aircraft to be a pathfinder, and the flashes exploding flares. Soon afterwards Zorner and his crewman had to abandon the Bf110G-4 because an engine caught fire. Zorner extinguished the fire but he could no longer calibrate the propeller pitch to a glide setting. The other power plant could not cope with the added workload and the Bf110 began to lose height. Zorner ordered his crew to leave. Zorner struggled to exit as his parachute snagged. He managed to clamber back into the cockpit and lower the flaps which slowed the aircraft and afforded him time to <b>unhook</b> the parachute from the strengthening beam in the cockpit and parachute to safety.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Using single {{molecule}} fluorescence microscopy, {{we study}} {{the dynamics of}} an electric-field-driven DNA molecule colliding with a single stationary post. The radius of the obstacle is small compared to the contour length of the molecules. Molecules that achieve hooked configurations which span the obstacle were chosen for study. Four different types of hooked configurations were found: symmetric hairpins with constant extension during <b>unhooking,</b> asymmetric hairpins with constant extension during <b>unhooking,</b> asymmetric hairpins with increasing extension during <b>unhooking,</b> and rare multiply looped entangled configurations. The important physics describing the <b>unhooking</b> dynamics for each classification differ and models are proposed to predict <b>unhooking</b> times. Surprisingly, we find that most collisions do not follow classic rope-on-pulley motion but instead form hairpins with increasing total extension during the <b>unhooking</b> process (called X collisions). Last, we show that unraveling to form a hairpin and center-of-mass motion during <b>unhooking</b> affect the overall center of mass hold-up time during a collision process...|$|R
40|$|Several {{important}} anti-tumor agents form DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), {{but their}} clinical efficiency is counteracted by multiple complex DNA repair pathways. All of these pathways require <b>unhooking</b> of the ICL from one strand of a DNA duplex by nucleases, followed by bypass of the <b>unhooked</b> ICL by translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases. The {{structures of the}} <b>unhooked</b> ICLs remain unknown, yet the position of incisions and processing of the <b>unhooked</b> ICLs significantly influence the efficiency and fidelity of bypass by TLS polymerases. We have synthesized a panel of model <b>unhooked</b> nitrogen mustard ICLs to systematically investigate how the state of an <b>unhooked</b> ICL affects pol eta activity. We find that duplex distortion induced by a crosslink {{plays a crucial role}} in translesion synthesis, and length of the duplex surrounding an <b>unhooked</b> ICL critically affects polymerase efficiency. We report the synthesis of a putative ICL repair intermediate that mimics the complete processing of an <b>unhooked</b> ICL to a single crosslinked nucleotide, and find that it provides only aminimal obstacle for DNA polymerases. Our results raise the possibility that, depending on the structure and extent of processing of an ICL, its bypass may not absolutely require TLS polymerases. ope...|$|R

Respective {{associates}} of each tag team, Spike Dudley for the Dudley Boyz, Rhyno for Edge and Christian, and Lita for the Hardy Boyz, interfered during the match.

Jeff tried to <b>unhook</b> the belts but had the ladder beneath him pulled away by Bubba Ray Dudley, leaving him hanging in the air, and allowing Edge to jump off another ladder and spear Jeff to the ground. Bubba Ray and Matt Hardy climbed the same ladder but Rhyno tipped the ladder over, sending Bubba Ray and Matt through four stacked tables at ringside. With Edge holding onto D-Von's legs, Christian sat on Rhyno's shoulders and unhooked the belts, making him and Edge the new Tag Team Champions.|$|E
