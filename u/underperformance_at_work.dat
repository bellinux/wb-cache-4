40|$|Background: Although {{the genetic}} risk to develop bipolar {{disorder}} is present from conception, the first frank {{symptoms of the}} illness generally become evident in late adolescence or early adulthood. However, except for pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD), it is still unclear when {{the first signs of}} the illness in adults become apparent and whether these are related to the genetic risk to develop bipolar disorder. This study examined whether underperforrnance at school precedes the onset of the illness and is a genetically related risk marker for developing bipolar disorder. Methods: Information on school performance was obtained using objective archival data from 53 bipolar twin pairs (24 monozygotic (MZ), 29 dizygotic (DZ)) and 42 healthy matched control twin pairs (23 MZ, 19 DZ). Results: Affected twin pairs completed significantly fewer years of education than did control twin pairs with no difference between bipolar patients and their non-bipolar cotwins. The <b>underperformance</b> <b>at</b> school in the affected twin pairs occurred in early adolescence at a significantly younger age than the control twin pairs and preceded the onset of the first frank episode of bipolar disorder by thirteen years. Median age <b>at</b> onset of <b>underperformance</b> was not different in the patients and their non-bipolar cotwins. The association between liability of bipolar disease and age of first underperformance was significant and could be explained by genetic factors. Limitations: The sample is not a population based twin sample. Conclusion: <b>Underperformance</b> <b>at</b> school during early adolescence may be a genetic marker for the vulnerability to develop bipolar disorder. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|Amblimation was the {{animation}} production arm of Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment. The studio {{was shut down}} in 1997 {{and some of the}} Amblimation staff went on to join DreamWorks Animation. It was known for its quieter atmosphere, more subdued acting, and more atmospheric pace compared to a great deal of American animated films; these qualities usually led to <b>underperformance</b> <b>at</b> American box offices and may have factored in the decision to close the studio down. The company's mascot, Fievel Mousekewitz (An American Tail), appears in its production logo. It only made 3 films.

This led to several delays in approvals during the production of Sleeping Beauty, which was finally released in 1959. At $6 million, it was Disney's most expensive film to date, produced in a heavily stylized art style devised by artist Eyvind Earle and presented in large-format Super Technirama 70 with six-track stereophonic sound.

Sources close to the film, however, believe the ultimate losses were likely $60-75 million, noting the film could do well on DVD and other home entertainment platforms. The losses for MGM were heavier, since they financed 80% of the total production budget, including marketing expenses. As a result, Paramount's share of the loss was about $13 million.

40|$|We {{examine the}} underpricing and {{long-term}} performance of Swiss {{initial public offerings}} (IPOs) from 1983 to 2000. The average market adjusted initial return is 34. 97 %. Our results support the ex ante uncertainty hypothesis, the signalling hypothesis and, to some extent, the market cyclicality hypothesis as possible explanations for the underpricing phenomenon. We also report evidence for lower initial returns under increased competition among investment banks, and more accurate pricing when book-building is used. To measure the long-term performance of Swiss IPOs, we compute buyand-hold abnormal returns as well as skewness-adjusted wealth ratios. In contrast to previous findings for the U. S. and Germany, we do not find a strong continuous underperformance of Swiss IPOs in the aftermarket. If there was any evidence for <b>underperformance</b> <b>at</b> all, Swiss IPOs show poor returns only in the very long-run after 48 months of trading...|$|R
40|$|Evidence is accumulating that {{developmental}} abnor-malities, poor neuromotor function, {{and increased}} problem behavior precede {{the manifestation of}} schizo-phrenia itself. Information on school performance and behavioral development was obtained for 49 pairs of twins in which at least one twin suffered from schizo-phrenia (20 monozygotic [MZ], 29 dizygotic [DZ]) and for 43 pairs of healthy control twins (25 MZ, 18 DZ). Cox regression was {{used to analyze the}} contribution of schizophrenia, zygosity, sex, and year of birth to the age at which developmental divergence occurred. In both MZ and DZ twin pairs with schizophrenia, diver-gence in school performance occurred about 7. 5 years earlier than it did in control twins, at 12 years of age, preceding the onset of psychosis by 10 years.

Argentina regularly reports acute cases of CD, mostly young individuals under 14 years old. There is a void {{of knowledge of}} health care seeking behavior in subjects experiencing a CD acute condition. Early treatment of the acute case is crucial to limit subsequent development of disease. The article explores how the health outcome of persons with acute CD may be conditioned by their health care seeking behavior. The study, with a qualitative approach, {{was carried out in}} rural areas of Santiago del Estero Province, a high risk endemic region for vector transmission of CD. Narratives of 25 in-depth interviews carried out in 2005 and 2006 are analyzed identifying patterns of health care seeking behavior followed by acute cases.

The misdiagnoses were a major factor in delaying a health care response. The study results expose lost opportunities for the health care system to effectively record CD acute cases...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{long-term}} post-issue performance using {{a sample of}} 1, 953 UK non-financial IPOs {{for the period of}} 1982 - 2004. Data is obtained from the LSPD. The main measure of performance includes buy-and-hold abnormal returns, cumulative abnormal returns, and calendar time regression intercepts. Our results indicate the mixed evidence on the long-term post-IPO stock performance. Event time analysis produce significant <b>underperformance</b> <b>at</b> five-year horizon while calendar time regression results show that IPOs perform as good as benchmarks. In conclusion, the relative long-term performance depends on the method and benchmark of examining performance. For example, most results based on BHAR measure suggest that the sample underperforms. Additionally, we assess the choice of data set on the conclusion of long-term post-IPO performance. We find that Datastream (DS) produces similar results as London Share Price Database (LSPD) if equal weight scheme is adopted. Additionally, there is insignificant discrepancy for the value weighted returns. Finally, the thesis reveals that two-stage IPOs do not underperform the benchmarks. Furthermore, two-stage IPOs have similar long-term performance compared to that of regular IPOs listed in AIM. Also, the underpricing for two-stage IPOs is less severe than regular IPOs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vitality <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is an {{important}} factor for optimal functioning and sustainable employability. To date, knowledge on how to promote vitality <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is fragmented. OBJECTIVE: Contribute to knowledge on how to promote vitality <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> METHODS: Determinants of vitality <b>at</b> <b>work</b> are identified from three scientific fields, and used in a comprehensive model. Regression analyses on cross-sectional data from a Dutch dairy company (N = 629) are performed to examine the associations between these factors, vitality <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and employees' perceived effective personal functioning and sustainable employability. RESULTS: Vitality <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is most strongly associated with basic psychological needs of self-determination, but also with healthy lifestyle behavior, having a balanced workstyle, and social capital. Vitality <b>at</b> <b>work</b> is also associated with effective personal functioning and with sustainable employability. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirms the multifactorial nature of vitality <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Since organizational culture may support self-determination, and cultural aspects themselves are positively associated with vitality, organizational culture seems particular important in promoting vitality <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> Additionally, a healthy lifestyle appears important. The associations between vitality <b>at</b> <b>work</b> and effective personal functioning and sustainable employability endorse the combined health-based, business-related and societal importance of vitality <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> © 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.

Furthermore, results of this thesis show that high levels of authenticity <b>at</b> <b>work</b> related is to high levels of in-role performance, work engagement, and job satisfaction. Conversely, low scores on experienced authenticity <b>at</b> <b>work</b> are associated with higher levels of burnout, boredom, and stress.

At the 2001 election they secured an increased share of the vote and returned a second Senator. Conversely the Australian Democrats, held to be the third force in Australian politics went backwards in 2001, losing a Senate seat. From 2001 to 2004 the Greens polled strongly and were buoyed by increased support for their anti-Iraq war and pro-refugee positions. As a party {{they appeared to be}} moving beyond single-issue status. Equally the Democrats were suffering from internal disunity and their support collapsed. By the time of the 2004 election the Greens were expected to win enough Senate seats to at least share {{the balance of power in}} the Senate. These high expectations were held by political commentators and the Greens themselves, buoyed by strong polling. This dissertation examines the expectations placed on the Greens.

40|$|Phd Title: Developing {{self-care}} <b>at</b> <b>work</b> ABSTRACT This PhD Study {{explored the}} practical development of self-care <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> The study enabled {{an understanding of}} self-care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> as a phenomena, and enabled the practitioners involved to free themselves from ideological and other chains holding them back from developing their own self-care <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> to such a point that in the end, they realised ‘I matter’ <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and that self-care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> matters. The findings show {{that it is not}} normal for there to be a focus on ‘me’ and consider self truly during the working day, and that many people see clients, colleagues or their boss as ‘king’ consistently putting them first before considering self. The findings also show if we do not self-care <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> and, we keep working when we are feeling under ‘par’ it is uncomfortable for us to work in this way, {{and the quality of the}} services we offer can suffer. In the implications for practice, this PhD study offers a simple conceptual framework for developing self-care <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> with a series of sequential stages and inter-connected prompts. It also offers a self observational reflective prompt to support those who choose to deepen their level of self observation, and self awareness. Self-Care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> comes in a number of guises, no one size fits all. Periods of self observation, and trying new ways of caring for self <b>at</b> <b>work</b> enables individuals to develop their own unique self-care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> approach. Self-Care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> includes not only traditionally cited aspects in workplace well-being such as exercise and nutrition, it also includes preparing and planning for work, maintaining perspective, learning to say ‘no’, and, the willingness to make self-care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> an ongoing self inquiry process, using self observation, and reflective moments. With simple yet profound effects, using the physical body as a barometer on a daily basis, guiding what works and what doesn’t work is fundamental to developing and deepening self-care <b>at</b> <b>work.</b> A profound impact of this study for practitioners is that in committing to making self-care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> a living inquiry and, breaking out of patterns or ideals getting in the way of self-care <b>at</b> <b>work,</b> self confidence can deepen, as can a deeper sense of self worth. Equally, developing self-care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> made a difference to the quality of services practitioners offered. Realising ‘I matter at work’ and that self-care <b>at</b> <b>work</b> matters whilst simple, and a ‘no brainer’ is profound, and deeply emancipating...|$|R
