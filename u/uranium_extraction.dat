5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – <b>URanium</b> <b>EXtraction)</b> type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E

25|$|The first Swedish nuclear reactor, R1, {{was started}} in 1951 and it {{was placed in a}} dug out cavern below the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

Also, the <b>uranium</b> <b>extraction</b> site in Kvarntorp reached its intended production capacity. In 1953, the Swedish scientists realized that the critical mass for the plutonium fueled nuclear weapons had been overestimated and the figure was reduced down to 5–10kg in a report by Sigvard Eklund, which meant that the production requirement for plutonium was significantly less than it was earlier anticipated. In 1955, FOA concluded that Sweden would be able to produce nuclear weapons once it had a plutonium reactor.|$|E

40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{of stainless}} steel in nitric acid media {{is a major concern}} for the nuclear industry. Several reprocessing schemes such as PUREX (Plutonium <b>Uranium</b> Reduction <b>Extraction)</b> and UREX (<b>Uranium</b> Reduction <b>Extraction)</b> utilise nitric acid media, and an understanding of the behaviour of key chemical species in these process streams is vital if their effect on associated corrosion reactions and their rates is to be accurately assessed and quantified. This will allow for more accurate prediction of the working lifetime of any stainless steel surface in contact with the process stream in question. Two such key species that are found in nuclear process streams are cerium as Ce (IV) and chromium as Cr(VI), both of which may act as corrosion accelerants. The redox chemistry of cerium and chromium in highly active liquor (HAL) will depend on nitrous acid concentration, temperature, acidity, total nitrate and possibly the influence of other dissolved species and hence an analytical technique for the on-line measurement of these quantities would be useful for lifetime prediction and corrosion prevention. As a result of this, a strategy for the simultaneous measurement of both Ce(IV) and Cr(VI) species in the presence of other ions typically found in process streams (such as Iron, Magnesium Neodymium and Aluminium) has been developed. The work presented will discuss the design and implementation of the electrochemical techniques that we have used in the development of this strategy and in the measurement of the species in question...|$|R
500|$|When {{the uranium}} ore {{is rich in}} such {{minerals}} as dolomite, magnesite, etc., those minerals consume much acid. In this case, the carbonate method is used for <b>uranium</b> <b>extraction.</b> Its main component is an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate, which converts uranium into a complex 4−, which is stable in aqueous solutions at low concentrations of hydroxide ions. The advantages of the sodium carbonate method are that the chemicals have low corrosivity (compared to nitrates) and that most non-uranium metals precipitate from the solution. The disadvantage is that tetravalent uranium compounds precipitate as well. Therefore, the uranium ore is treated with sodium carbonate at elevated temperature and under oxygen pressure: ...|$|E

40|$|Betafite is a uranium–titanium–tantalum–niobium complex oxide mineral {{generally}} {{described as}} (Ca,U) 2 (Ti,Nb,Ta) 2 O 6 (OH). Significantly lower <b>uranium</b> <b>extractions</b> {{have been observed}} when betafite containing ores has been treated via conventional process flow sheets. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} understand the leaching behaviour of this mineral in order to open the potential for it to become an economic source of uranium in the future. The leaching kinetics and reaction mechanism of uranium from a natural, metamict betafite sample have been investigated using varied temperature under oxidative acidic conditions. The practically complete <b>extraction</b> of <b>uranium</b> was observed by leaching the natural betafite in a solution containing 214. 5 g/L H 2 SO 4 and 2. 0 g/L Fe 3 + at 89 °C for a period of 48 h. Alternative leaching conditions using 57. 1 g/L H 2 SO 4 and 36. 7 g/L Fe 3 + at the same temperature also resulted in practically complete <b>extraction</b> of <b>uranium</b> but improved the selectivity for uranium over titanium, tantalum and niobium. Kinetic modelling has indicated that the rate of the leaching process is controlled by the rate of diffusion of products or reactants involved in the dissolution reaction to the reacting surface through a solid product layer containing niobium. A portion of the betafite mineral sample used in the leaching testwork was recrystallised by heating in air at 1100 °C. The crystalline form of betafite was then leached under conditions similar to those applied to the metamict mineral to determine how crystal structure may affect the <b>extraction</b> of <b>uranium.</b> Less than 12...|$|R

The {{system of}} uranyl nitrate aqueous {{solution}} and tributylphosphate (TBP) dissolved in kerosene {{is widely used}} all around the world, no matter in nuclear fuel cycle or analysis of impurities in <b>uranium.</b> The <b>extraction</b> process is mature, but the amount of consumption of organic reagent and generation of radioactive waste solution is huge, that is not environment friendly.

Here in this paper, we studied the flow situation of water and 20 %TBP-kerosene, find the relationship between width ratio and flow rate ratio. And we used chemical modification to get a good separated outlet, and we observed the stability of OTS modified glass, that is stable in our circumstance. Finally we use the modified channels to achieve the extraction process, and find the extraction ratio is increases by contact time increases, and has no relationship of initial concentration...|$|R
