25|$|Until {{shortly before}} the first {{occupation}} by Native Americans, the cavern was uninhabitable due {{to the presence of}} a large stream which occupied the entirety of the cavern. A rockfall from the cavern roof diverted the stream to one side, however, exposing a portion of the cave floor. The first occupants dwelled on this irregular floor of rock slabs. Debris from occupants and deposits falling from the ceiling slowly raised the floor. The floor ultimately was raised an additional seven to eight feet (2.0 to 2.5m) and up to 30feet (9.0m) near the <b>upper</b> <b>entrance.</b> In the 1960s, the United States Bureau of Mines installed bolts with a length of 15feet (4.5m) to prevent additional collapses of limestone rock.|$|E
25|$|The lift is {{included}} on the historical guides of Lisbon, within the down-town Pombaline Baixa area between several older historical buildings in the quarter. It is situated in the Escadinhas de Santa Justa which connects the Baixa to the Rua do Carmo. The Escadinhas are actually part of the north-eastern urban wall of the Baixa and west of the Rua de Santa de Justa. The elevator gives access {{to many of the}} important zones of the city. To the north, towards the Rossio (Praça D. Pedro IV and Avenida da Liberdade); to the south, the (Terreiro do Paço) Praça do Comércio and the river zone; while in the upper zone, there is access to the Largo do Carmo, the Trindade, Church of São Roque and the Bairro Alto quarter. In addition, the panormaic views allow glimpses of the Castle of São Jorge, the Tagus River, {{the lower part of the}} Baixa, the National Theatre D. Maria II, while the <b>upper</b> <b>entrance</b> permits a view of the ruins of the Monastery of Nossa Senhora do Vencimento do Monte do Carmo.|$|E

Rancheria Falls is located farther southeast, on Rancheria Creek. Formerly, a [...] "small but noisy" [...] waterfall and natural pool existed on the Tuolumne River marked the <b>upper</b> <b>entrance</b> to Hetch Hetchy Valley, informally known as Tuolumne Fall (not {{to be confused}} with a similarly named waterfall several miles upriver near Tuolumne Meadows). The waterfall on the Tuolumne is now submerged under Hetch Hetchy Reservoir.|$|E

60|$|It {{was indeed}} the sea--or, rather, the <b>upper</b> <b>entrance</b> to Smith Sound. The party had {{traveled}} {{too far to the}} eastward, and had now to turn southward, skirting the coast. Here the going was very rough, and the very next morning one of the sledges went down in a crack of the ice, and was smashed completely.|$|E

Just a brief examination was made, but it was sufficient {{to prove to the}} old prospectors that the lads had really rediscovered the lost Landslide Mine. Then the old miners put up the proper stakes, as a new claim for Mrs. Morr.|$|E

60|$|Scarcely had Mr. Miller {{disappeared}} on his peace-making errand, {{when there}} was a noise like a fowl going through a quickset hedge, and Mr. Saltzburg, brandishing his baton as if he were conducting an unseen orchestra, plunged through the scenery at the left <b>upper</b> <b>entrance</b> and charged excitedly down the stage. Having taken his musicians twice through the overture, he had for ten minutes been sitting in silence, waiting for the curtain to go up. At last, his emotional nature cracking under the strain of this suspense, he had left his conductor's chair and plunged down under the stage by way of the musician's bolthole to ascertain what was causing the delay.|$|E

50|$|They {{returned}} {{many times}} after and Chief Tane independently discovered the <b>upper</b> level <b>entrance</b> to the cave, {{which is now}} the current entrance. By 1889 Tane Tinorau and his wife Huti had opened the cave to visitors and were leading groups for a small fee. In 1906, after an escalation in vandalism, {{the administration of the}} cave was taken over by the government. In 1910 the Waitomo Caves Hotel was built to house the many visitors.|$|R

50|$|Cloake Board insertion: The Cloake {{board is}} placed between two hive bodies when the queen {{is known to}} be in the lower hive body. Because a Cloake board either {{contains}} or is used with a queen excluder, the laying queen will be restricted to the lower hive body from this point forward. At this time the lower entrance to the hive is reversed so that it faces the opposite direction and then closed. Without the slide in floor in place, the Cloake Board functions as an <b>upper</b> <b>entrance</b> for workers, who re-orient to enter the hive using the <b>upper</b> <b>entrance.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{bee tree}} is {{a tree in}} which a colony of honey bees makes its home. A colony of bees may live in a bee tree for many years. Most bee trees have a large inner hollow, often with an <b>upper</b> and lower <b>entrance.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mãe d’água means {{mother of}} water, this is {{misleading}} {{since there are}} no springs inside, just junctions of aqueducts. They are similar in build: cylindrical, with an entrance and rounded cupula. In 2014 they were all given a new whitish coat of cement. Inside is a “separation swirl” where the aqueducts meet, this lets sand and silt deposit thus removing from them the flowing water. The three <b>upper</b> have <b>entrances</b> to the underground whereas the lowest only has aqueducts coming, and also acts as the tool shed for the “aqueceiros” (the water men).|$|R
50|$|The city {{is located}} at the <b>upper</b> inland <b>entrance</b> of the Vomano valley, {{on the banks of the}} river with the same name. The {{territory}} of the Montorio al Vomano commune contains a mountainous area but in larger part is made up of hills and open plains. A hilly incline known as Il Colle (The Hill) leads up from the right bank of this river and provides a beautiful view of the valley below. Above the town are the ruins of the Fortress San Carlo, initiated in 1686 by the Spanish Marchese del Carpio to fight against the brigand forces.|$|R

50|$|Excalibur Pot is {{a natural}} cave in the North York Moors area of England. It is the only major cave known in the North York Moors, and is formed within the Corallian {{limestone}} of the <b>Upper</b> Jurassic.
