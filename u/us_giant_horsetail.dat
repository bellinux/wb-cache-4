5000|$|The genus Equisetum as a whole, while {{concentrated}} in the non-tropical northern hemisphere, is near-cosmopolitan, being absent only from Antarctica, though they are not known to be native to Australia, New Zealand nor the islands of the Pacific. They are most common in northern North America (Canada and the northernmost United States), where the genus is represented by nine species (arvense, fluviatile, palustre, pratense, sylvaticum, hyemale, laevigatum, scirpoides, and variegatum). Only four (bogotense, giganteum, myriochaetum, and ramosissimum) of the fifteen species {{are known to be}} native south of the Equator. They are perennial plants, herbaceous and dying back in winter as most temperate species, or evergreen as most tropical species and the temperate species rough horsetail (E. hyemale), branched horsetail (E. ramosissimum), dwarf horsetail (E. scirpoides) and variegated horsetail (E. variegatum). They typically grow 0.2-1.5 m tall, though the [...] "giant horsetails" [...] are recorded to grow as high as 2.5 m (northern <b>giant</b> <b>horsetail,</b> E. telmateia), 5 m (southern <b>giant</b> <b>horsetail,</b> E. giganteum) or 8 m (Mexican <b>giant</b> <b>horsetail,</b> E. myriochaetum), and allegedly even more.|$|R
50|$|Equisetum myriochaetum, {{also known}} as Mexican <b>giant</b> <b>{{horsetail}},</b> is a species of horsetail that is native to Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Mexico.

50|$|In the {{approximately}} 300 million year old slate from the Carboniferous Period, fossilised plants {{had already been}} found in the late 18th century. Scientifically recorded {{for the first time in}} 1835 by Ami Boué, there are 72 species of coal forest plants from the Stangalpe known today, among which are the <b>giant</b> <b>horsetails</b> (Calamites), Sigillaria, ferns (Pecopteris), Cordaites and conifers (Dicranophyllum).|$|R
50|$|Some {{plants have}} {{rhizomes}} that grow above ground or that {{lie at the}} soil surface, including some Iris species, and ferns, whose spreading stems are rhizomes. Plants with underground rhizomes include gingers, bamboo, the Venus Flytrap, Chinese lantern, Western poison-oak, hops, and Alstroemeria, and the weeds Johnson grass, bermuda grass, and purple nut sedge. Rhizomes generally form a single layer, but in <b>Giant</b> <b>Horsetails,</b> can be multi-tiered.|$|R
5000|$|Equisetum telmateia, {{the great}} <b>horsetail</b> or {{northern}} <b>giant</b> <b>horsetail,</b> is {{a species of}} Equisetum (horsetail) with an unusual distribution, with one subspecies native to Europe, western Asia and northwest Africa, and a second subspecies native to western North America. The North American subspecies is often simply but ambiguously called [...] "giant horsetail", but that name may just as well refer to the Latin American Equisetum giganteum and Equisetum myriochaetum.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the trunks}} are {{exhibited}} in the Museum of Natural History in the Chemnitz department store Kulturkaufhaus Tietz (DAStietz), including slices of trunks with polished edges. A small collection can be seen also on Zeißstraße. In 1996 another petrified trunk {{was found in the}} Hilbersdorfer corridor. Since April 4, 2008, searches on a plot on the Frankenberger street found more trunks. There researchers discovered Arthropitys bistriata, a previously undiscovered type of Calamites, <b>giant</b> <b>horsetails</b> that are ancestors of modern horsetails, with multiple branches. This exceptional find received the 2010 Fossil of the Year award of the German Paleontological Society. It was integrated into the permanent collection.|$|R
5000|$|The petrified {{forest was}} formed in {{connection}} with the eruption of the Zeisigwald volcano in the lower Permian and dates back about 291 million years. [...] The Chemnitz fossil find site largely contains strains of Cyatheales (tree ferns and <b>giant</b> <b>horsetails).</b> The tree-like plants were uprooted or snapped off by the blast of the eruption, much like the trees caught in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The trunks were then covered with hot tephra at 80 to 100 °C. In the following millions of years, the silicic acid included in the tephra ensured the fossilization of Permian plants, preserving them until today.|$|R
5000|$|In 1969 The Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust {{bought the}} lake and {{woodland}} behind the Kilns. The Trust describes the woods as follows: 'The steeply rising woodland includes beech, birch, alder, sycamore and larch. Dotted around the reserve are large sandstone boulders known as doggers on the slopes in the trees. The pond is full of aquatic plants and many toads migrate here to spawn in spring, when the garden is also full of birdsong. Moorhens and coots regularly nest here and other visitors include herons, kingfishers and warblers. <b>Giant</b> <b>horsetail</b> grows {{at the margins of}} a stream which flows in from the east and there are spectacular displays of dragonflies and damselflies in summer.' ...|$|R
50|$|After {{the valley}} {{broadens}} out below the Gauchach Viaduct (which carries the Bundesstraße 31) the first narrow section begins near the restored and functional mill of Guggenmühle. The actual gorge begins near the castle {{ruins of the}} Grünburg (wall remains measuring 15 x 12 m) and the Lochmühle mill, which was destroyed in a flood. Opposite stands the Grünburg Chapel with a votive picture of a flood in 1804 and again in 1895. Below {{the ruins of the}} Neuenburg, which is barely recognisable following a landslip, the Burgmühle Hiking Hostel run by the Friends of Nature acts as a tourist base. In the lowest part of the gorge an educational path leads past impressive tufas and communities of <b>giant</b> <b>horsetail.</b>|$|R
40|$|Equisetum telmateia Ehrh. rather often {{occurs in}} {{agricultural}} lands communities. According {{to the literature}} and one's own original research, one constructs his list which contains 16 communities, associations and subassociations (Vicietum tetraspermae, Aphano-Matricarietum, Lathvro-Melandrietum noctiflori, Echinochloo-Setarietum, Galinsogo-Setarietum, Cirsietum rivularis, Cirsetum rivularis caricetosum hartmanii, Scirpetum sylvatici, community with Mentha longifolia, community,with Equisetum telmateia, Arrhenatheretum medioeuroaeum, Arrhenatheretum mnedioeuropaeum brizetosum mediae, community with Cirsium oleraceuum, Lolio-Cynosuretum, Valeriano-Caricetum flavae, Carlino Dianthetum deltoidis). The occurrence of <b>Giant</b> <b>horsetail</b> in such differentiated communities points to its wide ecological scale {{and the ability to}} survive in different forms of anthropogenic pressure. The appearance of this species in agricultural land communities may be result of its previous existence on the land that started to be cultivated land or of the vegetative spreading of its rhizomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Equisetum giganteum is a plant used in {{traditional}} medicine as diuretic. From our knowledge {{this is the}} first time this plant is tested in an in vivo model of acute inflammation. To evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of <b>giant</b> <b>horsetail</b> (AEGH) as immunomodulatory therapy, antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) was generated in mice with methylated bovine serum albumin (mBSA). Inflammation was evaluated by articular nociception, leukocytes migration and lymphocyte proliferation. AEGH reduced nociception at 3, 6 and 24 h (P < 0. 01), decreased leukocyte migration (P < 0. 015), and inhibited lymphocyte proliferation stimulated with Concanavalin A and Lipopolysaccharide (P < 0. 05). In conclusion, AEGH has an anti-inflammatory potential in acute model of inflammation, as well as immunomodulatory effect on both B and T lymphocytes, with an action independent of cytotoxicity...|$|R

40|$|The <b>Giant</b> <b>Horsetail</b> (Equisetum telmateia) is {{the only}} {{representative}} of Equisetum genus included {{in the list of}} strictly protected species. In Central and Western Europe the species is found in communities belonging to alliances: Alno-Padion and Calthion. With progressing destruction of these biotopes, one can observe the phenomenon of this species moving to the habitats extremely anthropogenic in character. 			 			Frequent and intensive observations of this phenomenon were conducted in the Jasło - Krosno Dale area in southern Poland in three anthropogenic localities. In these localities three interesting, irregular Equisetum telmateia morphotypes were found: fo. serotinum subfo. proliferum, fo. spiralis and a morphotype with branched shoot. 			 			The phenomenon of morphological plasticity of sporophytes is thought to be connected with the action of genes, which regulate the identity of developing plant organs and their distribution. These genes perform a superior part in relation to the system of growth regulators...|$|R

40|$|Horsetails {{represent}} an enigmatic clade within the land plants. Despite consisting only of one genus (Equisetum) that contains 15 species, they {{are thought to}} represent the oldest extant genus within the vascular plants dating back possibly {{as far as the}} Triassic. Horsetails have retained several ancient features and are also characterized by a particularly high chromosome count (n = 108). Whole-genome duplications (WGDs) have been uncovered in many angiosperm clades and have been associated with the success of angiosperms, both in terms of species richness and biomass dominance, but remain understudied in nonangiosperm clades. Here, we report unambiguous evidence of an ancient WGD in the fern linage, based on sequencing and de novo assembly of an expressed gene catalog (transcriptome) from the <b>giant</b> <b>horsetail</b> (Equisetum giganteum). We demonstrate that horsetails underwent an independent paleopolyploidy during the Late Cretaceous prior to the diversification of the genus but did not experience any recent polyploidizations that could account for their high chromosome number. We also discuss the specific retention of genes following the WGD and how this may be linked to their long-term survival.
