40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have {{realized}} YBCO nanowires, with cross sections down to 40 x 50 nm^ 2, and employed them in nanoSQUIDs and optical sensors. We have overcome the limiting issues in establishing reliable nanofabrication routines for YBCO, {{due to the}} chemical instability (related to oxygen out-diffusion), and the extreme sensitivity to defects and disorder due to very short coherence length of this material. Through an improved nanopatterning procedure, based on e-beam lithography in combination with an amorphous carbon mask and a very gentle Ar^+ ion etching, by keeping a capping layer of Au {{on the top of}} the nanostructures, we have achieved nanowires preserving ``pristine'' superconducting properties, very close to the as-grown films. The benchmark of their quality is given by the very high critical current densities they carry (up to 10 ^ 8 A/cm^ 2), which are very close to the theoretical depairing limit. Therefore, these structures represent model system to study HTS, since the properties they show are strictly related to the superconducting material, scaled to the nanoscale, and they are not ruled by damages and defects associated to the nanopatterning procedure. Different experiments have been done, employing these nanowires in more complex devices. The results we got pave the way for new exciting experiments, which will be object of future works, exploring HTS superconductivity at the nanoscale both for fundamental studies and applications: We have fabricated and characterized YBCO nanoSQUIDs, employing very short nanowires in the so-called Dayem bridge configuration. These devices, working in the whole temperature range from 300 mK up to their critical temperature (~ 82 K), have revealed an <b>ultra</b> <b>white</b> low-noise below 1 μΦ_ 0 Hz^(- 1 / 2) above 10 kHz, corresponding to a predicted spin sensitivity of only 50 μ_B Hz^(- 1 / 2). These properties make our devices very attractive for many applications, as for the investigation of the magnetic moment in small ensembles of spins in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. We have realized YBCO nanorings, measuring the magnetoresistance close to T_C. Large oscillations have been measured, which can be associated to the vortex dynamics triggering our nanowires to the resistive state. The FFT spectra have shown, for the nanorings with narrower linewidth, a single sharp peak: this peak, associated to h/ 2 e periodicity, as predicted for optimally doped YBCO, represents a clear evidence of a uniform vorticity of the order parameter inside the rings, confirming the high degree of homogeneity of our structures. The homogeneity of our nanowires, together with the fast relaxation times of the YBCO, gave the boost for the realization of devices, aimed at the detection of single photons. This goal required the use of very long wires (up to 10 μm), covering large areas (~ 300 μm^ 2). We have done preliminary photoresponse measurements on these devices, detecting signals whose main origin appears to be mostly bolometric. The use of a ferromagnetic LSMO layer, employed as capping for preliminary photoresponse studies appears to be the natural route for future investigation...|$|E

50|$|Viocin is a newly {{patented}} {{technology in the}} oral care industry. Viocin is an oral care whitening gel that, when applied to teeth, counteracts the yellow that traditional whitening leaves behind to reflect white. Viocin is generally {{used in conjunction with}} Carbamide peroxide gel to increase longevity and effectiveness. Viocins new technology has recently been awarded the Best of State Utah: Science and Technology, as well as Best of State: Business Innovation. Viocin is fortified and sweetened with Xylitol.

50|$|The beach, {{which was}} {{originally}} <b>ultra</b> pure fine <b>white</b> sand has been degraded by coarser sand washed ashore during attempts {{to reclaim the}} beach further north at Aspendale in the late 1970s. This reclamation involved pumping sand onto the eroding beach from far offshore. Unfortunately this off shore sand was much coarser and yellower being harder and grittier. It's clear today to see the progressive spread of this course sand now 3 km south of its original location. Other changes to the beach include the installation of sewerage to beach front properties in the 1960s when the entire dune was bulldozed, removing all native vegetation and razing {{what was once a}} protective mound. Introduced grasses were planted to hold the sand together and this eventually spread down to near the waters edge, producing what is seen today as a creeping sand dune covering the original beach with grass.|$|R
40|$|The Feynman-Metropolis-Teller {{treatment}} of compressed atoms has been recently generalized to relativistic regimes {{and applied to}} the description of static and rotating white dwarfs in general relativity. We present here the extension of this treatment {{to the case of}} finite temperatures and construct the corresponding equation of state (EOS) of the system; applicable in a wide regime of densities that includes both white dwarfs and neutron star outer crusts. We construct the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs at finite temperatures obeying this new EOS and apply it to the analysis of <b>ultra</b> low-mass <b>white</b> dwarfs with M≲ 0. 2 M_. In particular, we analyze the case of the white dwarf companion of PSR J 1738 + 0333. The formulation is then extrapolated to compressed nuclear matter cores of stellar dimensions, systems with mass numbers A≈ (m_ Planck/m_n) ^ 3 or mass M_ core≈ M_, where m_ Planck and m_n are the Planck and the nucleon mass. For T ≪ m_e c^ 2 /k_B ≈ 5. 9 × 10 ^ 9 K, a family of equilibrium configurations can be obtained with analytic solutions of the ultra-relativistic Thomas-Fermi equation at finite temperatures. Such configurations fulfill global but not local charge neutrality and have strong electric fields on the core surface. We find that the maximum electric field at the core surface is enhanced at finite temperatures with respect to the degenerate case. Comment: Matches version to appear in Physical Review...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the topic of}} {{magnetic}} white dwarfs is addressed. In the first part are considered the instability boundaries {{that allow us to}} ensure that white dwarfs with arbitrarily large magnetic fields cannot exist in nature. We show the impossibility of the existence of these objects considering different instabilities due to inverse beta-decay, pycnonuclear reactions, general relativity or restrictions coming out from the viral theorem. In this way we discard the existence of hypothetical <b>ultra</b> magnetic <b>white</b> dwarfs (with magnetic fields as large as 10 ^ 8 G), which have been recently proposed as an explanation for some peculiar super luminous type Ia supernovae. In the second part of this thesis we consider the possibility that magnetic fast rotating white dwarfs could behave like rotationally powered pulsars. We show that under certain physical conditions this pulsar-like behaviour is possible and we show some examples of applications of this hypothesis to explain the well known Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and Soft Gamma-ray repeaters(SGRs). This White Dwarf hypothesis is an alternative to the current magnetar model that intends to explain AXPs/SGRs. Finally, in the third part of this work we consider again AXPs and SGRs and we consider the possibility that some of them could be modelled as traditional rotationally powered pulsars and not as ultra magnetic neutron stars (magnetar model). We show that using realistic neutron star configurations the number of potentially rotationally powered pulsars is increased with respect to the case when only fiducial parameters for the mass, radius and moment of inertia are considered. We consider also other observational features of these objects in the rotationally powered pulsar model such as glitches, outbursts or emission in radio wavelengths. Finally, general conclusions and proposals for future work are presented...|$|R
