An important source of failure is the inability to reserve network resources to support the session, so these resources should be allocated before the phone rings. However, in the IMS, to reserve resources the network needs to know the callee's IP address, port and session parameters and therefore it is necessary that the initial offer/answer exchange to establish a session has started (INVITE request). In basic SIP, this exchange eventually causes the callee to be alerted. To solve this problem, the concept of preconditions was introduced. In this concept the caller states a set of constraints about the session (i.e. codecs and QoS requirements) in the offer, and the callee responds to the offer without establishing the session or alerting the <b>user.</b> This <b>establishment</b> will occur if and only if both the caller and the callee agree that the preconditions are met.|$|R

We present an assessment of Jatropha plantation establishment on wastelands, using the ArcSWAT modeling tool. The assessment was made for a wasteland located in the Velchal watershed, Andhra Pradesh, India, which recently was converted to a biofuel plantation with Jatropha. The previous land use, in this case grazing, could continue in the Jatropha plantations. Several desirable effects occurred as a result of the land-use conversion: non-productive soil evaporation was reduced as a larger share of the rainfall was channeled to productive plant transpiration and groundwater recharge, and at the same time a more stable (less erosive) runoff resulted in reduced soil erosion and improved downstream water conditions. A win-win situation between improved land productivity and soil carbon content was observed for the Jatropha plantations. On the other hand, the results indicate that at the sub-basin scale, reductions in runoff generation as a result of large-scale conversion of wastelands to Jatropha cropping may pose problems to downstream water users and ecosystems. From a livelihoods perspective, Jatropha production was generally positive, creating a complementary source of income to the farmers, thus strengthening the resilience of the local community. In the future, the potential gain from Jatropha cropping is expected to increase as cropping systems improve and growing biofuel markets result in better conditions for biofuel producers...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are an {{emerging}} research area that provide low-cost and high-speed network {{services for the}} end <b>users.</b> Key <b>establishment,</b> on the other hand, {{is the most important}} and critical security concern for WMNs as all the other types of wireless networks. However, the conventional solutions for key establishment do not fit in the unique constraints and requirements of WMNs. In this thesis, we propose two efficient and secure key establishment protocols elaborated at the sake of WMNs. Our security model is based on Identity-based Cryptography (IBC) and Threshold Secret Sharing (ThSS). By the utilization of IBC, we eliminate the necessity of certificates used in infrastructure based schemes along with meeting the security requirements. With the utilization of ThSS, we provide a more resilient network working in a self-organizing way to provide the key establishment service, without the assumption of a trusted authority. In the schemes we propose, master private key of the network is distributed among the mesh nodes. The user private key generation service is handled with collaboration of k mesh nodes, where k is the threshold value. A high threshold value increases the resiliency of the network against attacks; however, this negatively affects the system performance. We performed simulative performance evaluation in order to show the effect of both the number of mesh nodes in the network and the threshold value k on the performance. For the threshold values smaller than 8, at least 90 % of the mesh nodes compute their private keys within at most 70 seconds. When we increase the number of mesh nodes in the network from 40 to 100, the rate of successful private key generations increase from 75 % to 100 % at the threshold value 8 where the latency of the key establishment is around 80 seconds. Considering the same {{increase in the number of}} mesh nodes, network performs up to 42 % better at worst case, for the threshold values larger than 8, and the latency becomes at most 90 seconds on the average...|$|R

This protocol authenticates to inspect vehicles actions confidentially and have the following characteristics (1) Anonymous authentication: a message issuer can be authenticated. (2) Privacy: Communication content is confidential. The cost must be reduced through the address configuration scheme to improve the scalability. (3) Efficiency: it attains quick message verification, low storage requirements, and in case of a dispute, provides cost efficient identity tracking.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{addresses}} network architectures in {{a constellation}} of high altitude platforms (HAPs) with overlapping coverage areas, focusing on the additional network elements/functionalities required {{to make use of}} load balancing mechanisms. According to the location within the network and the complexity of additional equipment / functionality the paper proposes two different architectures. In the case of the basic utilisation of multiple HAPs a new equipment/functionality is installed only at the user premises, supporting load balancing only for the connections initialised from the HAP user network to the Internet (i. e. the outbound connections). In the case of advanced utilisation of multiple HAPs a new equipment/functionality is needed both at the user premises and in the HAP network, thus supporting load balancing in both directions. For the performance evaluation of load balancing mechanisms we built a simulation model supporting typical applications such as e-mail, file transfer, web browsing and IP telephony. Simulation results confirm {{that in the case of}} traffic load close to the congestion load balancing mechanism significantly improves the performance of selected reference applications. In order to asses the feasibility of the proposed network architectures in a multiple HAP system, and to confirm that carefully designed and pointed directional <b>user</b> antennas allow <b>establishment</b> of multiple access links for load balancing and to improve resilience of the network, we also investigate HAP visibility distribution across the coverage area for a single HAP system and a system comprising 4 HAPs.

This study was conducted to determining fire risk level in wards of a hospital and also determining effectiveness of an emergency plan on improvement of patients and staff safety. Method: In this study, Risk assessment was conducted by fire risk assessment method engineering (FRAME) and data collection was performed by standard checklist. So, in first phase fire risk was calculated in 12 wards of a hospital and in second phase, for assessing the effect of a fire emergency plan, base on hypothesis that hospital management system, establishes a complete and obvious action plan for patients and personnel rescue, during fire events, fire risk was calculated. Results: This study revealed that in present hospital situation, fire risk level throughout all wards was more than acceptable risk level and should be recognized that minimum acceptable levels of safety in wards of hospital was not supplied. Results showed that if an integrated and performable rescue plan was afforded, fire risk level decrease up to 30 percent. Conclusion: Planning, performance and evaluation of a specific program for functioning in emergency situations have an important role in improving safety of people that are in the hospitals.

The site is located in the southwest quadrant of Pretoria Central in which a number of sites and buildings are currently being downgraded in the urban revitalisation process, due to preferred, other technologies of construction. The assessment for the rehabilitation of the site evaluates the spatial qualities and the physical forms of buildings in relation to the new <b>user,</b> while the <b>establishment</b> of the PTP focuses on maintaining, elongating and innovating the industrial manufacturing tradition of the site. The incorporation of the PTP on the PSG site is implemented through the fitting process. RESEARCH AREAThe research focuses on the three main areas dealing with: Programming and planning of the Pretoria Technology Park Rehabilitation assessment of the Pretoria State Garage Architectural fitting process 1. Programming and planning of the Pretoria Technology Park The development methodology is employed {{for the establishment of a}} sustainable Pretoria Technology Park, which stems from local technology demand, supply and transfer. As a result, different centres are established to provide accommodation and services to major activities of the park dealing with administration, provision of advanced technology services and accommodation for technology-based firms. Individual centres are discussed according to their envisaged spatial qualities and design specifications. 2. Rehabilitation assessment of the Pretoria State Garage The rehabilitation assessment explores the historic significance and architectural values of the PSG. The outcome of the rehabilitation assessment defmes the manner and the degree in which various rehabilitation interventions could be executed. The process includes proposals for the demolition of unwanted structures and elements, investigating the long-term resilience of buildings to be retained and assessing negative physical features of the site. 3. Architectural fitting process Specific dimensions and spatial requirements of both the PSG (physical) and the PTP (intellectual) respectively are compared for the purpose of mutual fitting.

40|$|The {{topic of}} {{measurement}} {{is not new}} to the library world. For some twenty years, professional literature, especially American and British, has dealt with the topic, as is shown by the 600 plus titles listed in the bibliography of the IFLA's recently-published guidelines for measuring the quality of university library services. The initial, theoretical approach was supplanted, in the early 1990 s, by a more practical stance, with numerous operational models for librarians. This is {{the direction in which}} some international bodies are also moving today; in addition to the manual promoted by IFLA, the provisional version of the ISO manual and that which originated from the PROLIB/PI project financed by the European Commission have also been published. In Italy, interest in the topic is recent. The current situation can be summarised as one of "ongoing research", {{in the sense that the}} various experiments, seminars and discussions now in progress are gradually standardising definitions and methodologies suited to the historical and cultural context of Italian libraries. As regards academic libraries, measurement studies and applications are still few and far between, there is a dearth of documentation and emphasis to date has been on the quantitative aspects of the return with a view to rationalising resources and saving costs. The work should be continued, but oriented also towards effectiveness and, hence, fostering an assessment of the value of the services and not just of their productivity and costs. The quality of client-oriented services and the need to control the effectiveness of the library's capacity for interaction with its users should become the objectives of the new climate of managerial and organisational measures and the benchmark of the suitability of the players' professionalism to sustain the change of mentality demanded by the continuous broadening and diversification of higher education <b>establishment</b> <b>users</b> and of their needs. The work, which derives from the co-ordination experience of the Sassari University libraries, and in particular from the recording of the work loads, aims to satisfy the need to monitor all organisational aspects, both quantitative and qualitative, with a renewed attention to the client. The work starts out with some methodological clarifications, dedicated to the manner of use and requisites of the indicators and to the measurement path, offers considerations regarding data collection (on finances, assets, personnel, user spaces and reading places, potential users and services) with a view to creating a computerised system as a mandatory measurement stage, and concludes by proposing some measurement instruments immediately applicable even in libraries with little experience in this field. A comparative analysis of the main sources of library performance measurement was used to draw up a list of twenty indicators, specifically adapted to the realities of Italian university libraries and oriented to the direct and indirect evaluation of the quality of the service with users as the principal reference. All indicators can respond to the measurement needs of individual libraries, but some are well suited to monitoring a university library system. The paper concludes with a description of the eleven indicators, of the twenty elaborated, which were deemed the most client-oriented. The attention paid to them meets the objective of exemplifying the approach, method, applicability and limits of use of performance indicators. For each indicator, the information is organised on the basis of a grid adopted by IFLA, which appeared the best suited to exemplify the measurement approach through performance indicators, to facilitate their use also by inexperienced librarians, and to highlight all the elements which it was deemed appropriate to take into account in the application phas...|$|R
