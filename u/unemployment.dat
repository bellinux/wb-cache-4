5|$|Economists became {{interested}} in hysteresis when <b>unemployment</b> levels spiked with the 1979 oil shock and early 1980s recessions but {{did not return to}} the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained hysteresis in <b>unemployment</b> with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed by of Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees already working at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. The unemployed, outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When <b>unemployment</b> increases, the number of outsiders increases as well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of <b>unemployment.</b> The presence of hysteresis in the labor market also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in <b>unemployment,</b> stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in <b>unemployment.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2012, <b>unemployment</b> {{dropped to}} 25 percent.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, the <b>unemployment</b> rate in Canberra was 3.4% {{which was}} lower than the {{national}} <b>unemployment</b> rate of 5.1%. As a result of low <b>unemployment</b> and substantial levels of public sector and commercial employment, Canberra has the highest average level of disposable income of any Australian capital city. The gross average weekly wage in Canberra is $1702 compared with {{the national average of}} $1485.80 (May 2013).|$|E
5|$|Thatcher's premiership {{was also}} marked by periods of high <b>unemployment</b> and social unrest, and many critics {{on the left}} of the {{political}} spectrum fault her economic policies for the <b>unemployment</b> level; many of the areas affected by mass <b>unemployment</b> as well as her monetarist economic policies remained blighted for decades, by such social problems as drug abuse and family breakdown. <b>Unemployment</b> did not fall below its 1979 level during her tenure, although in June 1990 the recorded rate (5.4%) was lower than the rate in April 1979 (5.5%). The long-term effects of her policies on manufacturing remain contentious.|$|E
5|$|The East Riding is characterised {{by a high}} {{employment}} rate and a relatively low <b>unemployment</b> level. The overall <b>unemployment</b> rate is 4.3%, which is 1.2 percentage points lower than the national average. However, there are <b>unemployment</b> hotspots in Bridlington, Goole and Withernsea. <b>Unemployment</b> levels tend to fluctuate {{over the course of}} the year with lower levels during the summer months due to increased employment in the tourism and food production sectors. A major year-round employer in the East Riding is the Defence School of Transport at RAF Leconfield, which trains 14,000 personnel from the Army, the Royal Air Force and the Royal Marines each year and provides more than 1,000 civilian jobs.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unemployment</b> {{rate for}} the Skopje Statistical Region was at 27% in 2009, three points under the {{national}} rate (30%). The neighbouring Polog Region had a similar rate, but the less affected region was the South-West, with 22%. <b>Unemployment</b> in Skopje mainly concern men, who represent 56% of job-seekers, people between 25 and 44 years old (45% of job-seekers), and non-qualified people (43%). <b>Unemployment</b> also concerns Roma people, who represent 4.63% of the city population. <b>Unemployment</b> concerns 70% of the active population in the community.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unemployment</b> peaked above 10percent in 1991 and 1992, {{before falling}} {{to a record}} low of 3.7percent in 2007 (ranking third from twenty-seven {{comparable}} OECD nations). <b>Unemployment</b> rose back to 7percent in late 2009. In the June 2017 quarter, <b>unemployment</b> had fallen to 4.8percent. This is the lowest <b>unemployment</b> rate since December 2008, {{after the start of}} the global financial crisis, when it was 4.4 percent. Most New Zealanders do some form of voluntary work, more women volunteer (92 percent) than males (86 percent). Home ownership has declined since 1991, from 73.8percent to 66.9percent in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, <b>unemployment</b> rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly and <b>unemployment</b> declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, and <b>unemployment</b> increased again.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, a {{total of}} 6,853 (59.2%) out of 11,576 {{candidates}} obtained a Full School Certificate (the Grade 12 examination). The <b>unemployment</b> rate was 10% and the youth <b>unemployment</b> rate was 14.2% in 2016. As per the Living Condition Monitoring survey of 2015, malaria {{was the most common}} illness and accounted for 14.3% of reported deaths. HIV prevalence in the province as of 201314 was 12.5% overall, 14.8% for women, and 9.8% for men.|$|E
5|$|As of April 2013, the state's <b>unemployment</b> rate is 6.4 percent.|$|E
5|$|As of January 2015, the state's <b>unemployment</b> {{rate was}} 3.7 percent.|$|E
5|$|At the 2001 UK census, Trafford had 151,445 {{residents}} aged 16 to 74. 2.5% {{of these}} people were students with jobs, 5.7% looking after home or family, 5.4% permanently sick or disabled and 2.8% economically inactive for other reasons. Trafford has a low rate of <b>unemployment</b> (2.7%) compared with Greater Manchester (3.6%) and England as a whole (3.3%). Trafford has the lowest number of <b>unemployment</b> benefit claimants compared {{to all the other}} boroughs in Greater Manchester (3.7%).|$|E
5|$|By 1982, the UK {{began to}} {{experience}} signs of economic recovery; inflation {{was down to}} 8.6% {{from a high of}} 18%, but <b>unemployment</b> was over 3million {{for the first time since}} the 1930s. By 1983, overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to their lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total <b>unemployment</b> remaining high, peaking at 3.3million in 1984.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and {{the large}} {{adjustment}} as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as <b>unemployment</b> and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, <b>unemployment</b> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (after 1948). Note that the <b>unemployment</b> rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{was also}} known {{for his work on}} the {{consumption}} function, the permanent income hypothesis (1957), which Friedman himself referred to as his best scientific work. This work contended that rational consumers would spend a proportional amount of what they perceived to be their permanent income. Windfall gains would mostly be saved. Tax reductions likewise, as rational consumers would predict that taxes would have to increase later to balance public finances. Other important contributions include his critique of the Phillips curve and the concept of the natural rate of <b>unemployment</b> (1968). This critique associated his name, together with that of Edmund Phelps, with the insight that a government that brings about greater inflation cannot permanently reduce <b>unemployment</b> by doing so. <b>Unemployment</b> may be temporarily lower, if the inflation is a surprise, {{but in the long run}} <b>unemployment</b> will be determined by the frictions and imperfections of the labor market.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} initial months {{following}} Katrina, {{the labor force}} reduced faster than the demand and <b>unemployment</b> rates skyrocketed. However, as of September 2006, the <b>unemployment</b> rates have never fallen below national average, indicating improvement. In the second quarters of both 2005 and 2007, the firms' wages were increased by 21%, twice more than national increases, indicating even further improvement, although the gains were varied across the sectors.|$|E
5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous <b>unemployment,</b> where short-term increases in <b>unemployment</b> become permanent and lead to higher levels of <b>unemployment</b> in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Since the Second World War, <b>unemployment</b> in Crawley {{has been}} low: the rate was 1.47% of the working-age {{population}} in 2003. During the {{boom of the}} 1980s the town boasted {{the lowest level of}} <b>unemployment</b> in the UK. Continuous growth and investment have made Crawley {{one of the most important}} business and employment centres in the South East England region.|$|E
5|$|Sleaford {{served the}} {{surrounding}} agricultural {{communities and the}} town maintained a weekly market throughout the 19th century and a livestock market on Northgate from 1874 until 1984. According to a 2010 council report, the public sector was the town's main employer, along with agriculture and manufacturing. <b>Unemployment</b> was lower {{than the national average}} as were wages reflecting pay in the food processing and agricultural industries. At the 2011 Census, the largest group of working-age persons by economic activity are those in full-time employment, who make up 43.8% of this section of the population, while 15% are part-time employees and 7.7% are self-employed; 15% of the working-age population are retired. 4.2% were unemployed, with 40% of those in long-term <b>unemployment</b> and roughly one third were aged 16 to 24. The largest socio-economic grouping is those working in lower-tier managerial or administrative roles (21.9%), followed by semi-routine (17.8%), routine (15%) and intermediate (12.5%) occupations; no other group comprised 10% or more. In terms of industry, the most common, based on those working in the sector, are wholesale and retail trade (including automotive repairs) at 16.9%, health and social care (13.4%), public administration and defence (13.3%) and manufacturing (10.9%), with no other groups representing 10% or more. An <b>unemployment</b> survey of Lincolnshire in 2014 found that the county experienced a decline in <b>unemployment</b> (based on Jobseekers Allowance claimants) by 29% over the preceding 12 months, while the county's <b>unemployment</b> rate was marginally below the national average.|$|E
5|$|Slightly {{more than}} 5 million people work in Switzerland; about 25% of {{employees}} {{belonged to a}} trade union in 2004. Switzerland has a more flexible job market than neighbouring countries and the <b>unemployment</b> rate is very low. The <b>unemployment</b> rate increased {{from a low of}} 1.7% in June 2000 to a peak of 4.4% in December 2009. The <b>unemployment</b> rate decreased to 3.2% in 2014 without further decrease in 2015 and 2016. Population growth from net immigration is quite high, at 0.52% of population in 2004. The foreign citizen population was 21.8% in 2004, about the same as in Australia. GDP per hour worked is the world's 16th highest, at 49.46 international dollars in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Somerset has few {{industrial}} centres, but it {{does have}} a variety of light industry and high technology businesses, along with traditional agriculture and an increasingly important tourism sector, resulting in an <b>unemployment</b> rate of 2.5%. <b>Unemployment</b> is lower than the national average; the largest employment sectors are retail, manufacturing, tourism, and health and social care. Population growth in the county is higher than the national average.|$|E
5|$|Taunton Deane had a low <b>unemployment</b> rate of 4.1% {{compared}} with {{the national average of}} 5.0% in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The recent strong {{economic}} growth and lower <b>unemployment</b> in the Telford area {{has been attributed to}} the construction of the motorway: <b>unemployment</b> in the 1980s was over 20%, but by 2004 this figure had fallen to 3.3%. The motorway enabled the development of distribution centres in Telford, and industrial estates such as Hortonwood and Stafford Park have provided employment in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{service sector}} {{contributes}} approximately 71% {{of the total}} GDP (including information technology), industry 28%, and agriculture 1%. The <b>unemployment</b> rate published by Eurostat amounts to 4.7% in January 2015, which is the lowest rate of all 28 EU member states. With 7.1% Germany also has the lowest youth <b>unemployment</b> rate of all EU member states. According to the OECD Germany {{has one of the}} highest labour productivity levels in the world.|$|E
5|$|The <b>unemployment</b> {{rate for}} February 2011 in Białystok was 13.2%.|$|E
5|$|<b>Unemployment,</b> {{especially}} among the young, and the depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major long-term economic problems. In 2008, the jobless figure was at 4%, with women over represented at 85% of the total. In 2007 Bahrain became the first Arab country to institute <b>unemployment</b> benefits {{as part of a}} series of labour reforms instigated under Minister of Labour, Dr. Majeed Al Alawi.|$|E
25|$|Structural <b>unemployment</b> {{covers a}} variety of {{possible}} causes of <b>unemployment</b> including a mismatch between workers' skills and the skills required for open jobs. Large amounts of structural <b>unemployment</b> can occur when an economy is transitioning industries and workers find their previous set of skills {{are no longer in}} demand. Structural <b>unemployment</b> is similar to frictional <b>unemployment</b> since both reflect the problem of matching workers with job vacancies, but structural <b>unemployment</b> covers the time needed to acquire new skills not just the short term search process.|$|E
25|$|While {{some types}} of <b>unemployment</b> may occur {{regardless}} of {{the condition of the}} economy, cyclical <b>unemployment</b> occurs when growth stagnates. Okun's law represents the empirical relationship between <b>unemployment</b> and economic growth. The original version of Okun's law states that a 3% increase in output would lead to a 1% decrease in <b>unemployment.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{both these}} regions, male <b>unemployment</b> was only 10%. Only Sub-Saharan Africa had a male <b>unemployment</b> rate {{as high as}} 10%. Seven percent of women are {{unemployed}} in Southeast Asia as compared to 6% of men. South Asia, which contains a few majority Muslim nations such as Bangladesh, has a higher female <b>unemployment</b> rate, 6%, than a male <b>unemployment</b> rate which is 5%. However, non-Muslim {{regions of the world}} also demonstrate disproportional employment figures. In Latin America and the Caribbean, the female <b>unemployment</b> rate was 11% in 2006 while the male <b>unemployment</b> rate was only 7%.|$|E
25|$|After being {{higher in}} the postwar period, the U.S. <b>unemployment</b> rate fell below the rising eurozone <b>unemployment</b> rate in the mid-1980s and has {{remained}} significantly lower almost continuously since. In 1955, 55% of Americans worked in services, between 30% and 35% in industry, and between 10% and 15% in agriculture. By 1980, over 65% were employed in services, between 25% and 30% in industry, and less than 5% in agriculture. Male <b>unemployment</b> continued to be significantly higher than female <b>unemployment</b> (9.8% vs. 7.5% in 2009). The <b>unemployment</b> among Caucasians continues to be much lower than African-American <b>unemployment</b> (at 8.5% vs. 15.8% in 2009).|$|E
25|$|His {{association}} with the trade union movement led to a lengthy career in government service. In 1921, Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover appointed Wolman to the Conference on <b>Unemployment,</b> a federal conference charged with studying <b>unemployment</b> during the Post-World War I recession. His service led to additional work for labor unions. Wolman helped the ACWU negotiate <b>unemployment</b> benefits for its members in the mid-1920s, and {{with the onset of}} the Great Depression he was lecturing union audiences on <b>unemployment</b> in 1930. Governor of New York Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him in October 1930 to a committee to recommend solutions to the <b>unemployment</b> problem facing that state, and he was chair of a seven-state commission on <b>unemployment</b> in 1931. He became a strong advocate for federal <b>unemployment</b> insurance, and co-authored a major study of European economies in 1932 which linked dropping standards of living to lack of <b>unemployment</b> benefits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Unemployment</b> in Poland {{appeared}} in the 19th century, {{during the process of}} industrialization, and was particularly severe during the Great Depression. During communist rule officially Poland had close to full employment although hidden <b>unemployment</b> existed. After Poland's transition to a market economy the <b>unemployment</b> rate sharply increased, peaking at above 16% in 1993, then dropped afterwards, but remained well above pre-1993 levels. Another period of high <b>unemployment</b> occurred in the early 2000s when the rate reached 20%. As Poland entered European Union (EU) in 2004 and its job market, mass emigration due to <b>unemployment</b> took place lowering the figure. Since then the rate had fallen until the onset of the 2008 Great Recession. Recent years have seen an increase in the <b>unemployment</b> rate from below 8% to above 10% (Eurostat) or from below 10% to 13% (GUS). The rate began dropping again in late 2013. Polish government (GUS) reported 9.6% registered <b>unemployment</b> in November 2015, while European Union's Eurostat gave 7.2%. According to Eurostat data, since 2008, <b>unemployment</b> in Poland has been constantly below the EU average. Significant regional differences in the <b>unemployment</b> rate exist across Poland.|$|E
25|$|Unemployment: Idle {{capacity}} under {{monopolistic competition}} expenditure leads to <b>unemployment.</b> In particular, <b>unemployment</b> of workers leads to poverty and misery in the society. If idle capacity is fully used, {{the problem of}} <b>unemployment</b> can be solved to some extent.|$|E
25|$|Wake County's <b>unemployment</b> rate is {{much lower}} than the {{national}} <b>unemployment</b> rate as of July 2010.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{models of}} <b>unemployment</b> occurs when wages {{are too high}} for {{employers}} {{to be willing to}} hire more workers. Wages may be too high because of minimum wage laws or union activity. Consistent with classical <b>unemployment,</b> frictional <b>unemployment</b> occurs when appropriate job vacancies exist for a worker, but the length of time needed to search for and find the job leads to a period of <b>unemployment.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the <b>unemployment</b> rate of {{the city}} of Milan was {{recorded}} to be 5.8%, which is much lower than the entire nation of Italy's <b>unemployment</b> rate being at 8.4% in that year. Today, the <b>unemployment</b> rate in all of Europe is much higher, and in January 2014, the <b>unemployment</b> rate in Italy rose to 12.9% from 12.7% from December, which was the highest growth since 1977 in the nation, the entire nation was affected by this job loss and growth in rate of <b>unemployment.</b>|$|E
