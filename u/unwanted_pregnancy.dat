40|$|Background: <b>Unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{remain a}} main {{public health problem}} worldwide. In Iran, {{comparative}} studies on the risk factors of <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and their effects on maternal health are rare. Objectives: This {{study was conducted to}} determine the risk factors of <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and their impact on maternal behavior during pregnancy. Patients and Methods: This case-control study was carried out on 240 pregnant women who referred to the healthcare centers of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Science for receiving routine prenatal care. Of the 240 women, 120 had <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> (case) and 120 had wanted pregnancies (control). Data collection was performed using a researcher-made questionnaire. The data were analyzed using chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests, t-tests, Mann Whitney U tests, odds ratios, and logistic regression analysis.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to compare the {{incidence}} of <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in women under 35 and those over 35 years, compare the results with the previous data, and also to determine the causes of <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in these women Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study (descriptive - analysis) is performed on 400 pregnant women who had referred to the laboratories of Shiraz. Ten laboratories were randomly selected from different parts of Shiraz. The subjects were interviewed during the period of three months they referred for the result of their pregnancy test. Questionnaire included demographic information, how to use the methods of contraception, how to treat women with <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> and the history of pregnancy. The chi-square tests, t-test, and logistic regression were utilized in order to compare two groups of women under 35 and over 35 and also to determine the factors related to <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Results: In this study, the prevalence of <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in women under study was 14. 7 %. The incidence of pregnancy in women under 35 and those over 35 was 13. 3 % and 33. 3 %, respectively. The difference between the groups was found to be statistically significant (p= 0. 01). Conclusion: the percentage of <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> has reduced in Shiraz and this is indicative of the success of family planning. However the percentage of <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in women over 35 is still high. Due to the fact that these women use unreliable methods training courses should be planned for them.   </p...|$|R

Brown remains in favor of allowing religious hospitals to refuse to provide emergency contraception on moral or religious grounds, as he stated in the January 5, 2010 candidate debate.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Approximately {{one third}} of all the {{reported}} pregnancies in Iran and one fourth {{of them in the}} Sistan and Baluchistan province are unwanted.

He is involved in Nigerian medical politics. He was influenced by Dr. Kayode Obembe, the former President of the Nigerian Medical Association, who encouraged him in the early 1980s to contest the seat of secretary to the Resident Doctors Association. In 1982, Adewole was elected as the Secretary-general of the University of Ibadan Chapter of the Association of Resident Doctors. He served in that capacity for one year. In 1984 he was elected president of the National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria and led a nationwide strike that resulted in his dismissal by the then military head of state, General Muhammadu Buhari, who is currently the President of Nigeria. When Buhari declared him a wanted man, Adewole went into exile. He worked at the Cancer Campaign Research Institute in London, where he authored four papers. He later returned to Nigeria and was elected deputy Secretary-general of the Nigerian Medical Association in 1988. In 1990 he was elected Secretary-general of the Nigerian Medical Association. He held the position for two years, and in 1993, he was elected chairman of the Oyo State chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association. In March 1992 he was elected assistant secretary-general of the Confederation of African Medical Associations and Societies, and after his tenure ended in August 1997 he was elected secretary of the African regional task force on the control of gynaecological cancers.|$|E
500|$|Canning's {{trial was}} marked by the prosecution's {{inability}} to find any evidence whatsoever {{that she had been}} anywhere but in Wells's home, and where Canning was in January 1753 remains unknown. [...] Similarly, mystery surrounds the precise movements of the Squires family, when it was supposed they were travelling through Dorset early in 1753. [...] The writer F. J. Harvey Darton suspected that the family were smugglers, and that it was significant they had passed through Eggardon, where Isaac Gulliver operated (although Gulliver was, at the time, a child). [...] The 18th-century artist Allan Ramsay claimed that Canning's initial story was [...] "exceedingly stupid", and false. [...] He viewed the lack of detail in her testimony as unsurprising to a more analytical mind. [...] The US author Lillian Bueno McCue theorised that she was an amnesiac, and that her former employer, John Wintlebury, was to blame for her imprisonment at the Wells house. [...] Treherne (1989) considers this theory very unlikely however, and instead concludes that Canning was almost certainly at Enfield Wash, but was not kept prisoner at Wells's home. [...] He suggests that Robert Scaratt implanted the suggestion that Canning had been held at the Wells's house, as a useful decoy, and that he had somehow been involved in an <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> [...] Treherne also suggests that Canning was suffering from partial amnesia, and that she may not have lied intentionally at the trial of Squires and Wells. [...] He calls Canning [...] "the first media product." [...] Although some early authors adopted the same stance as Fielding or Hill, who actively took sides in the affair, most later writers believe that Canning did not tell the truth. [...] Moore (1994), however, believes that Canning was probably innocent. Moore explains discrepancies between Canning and the Squires' testimonies as understandable omissions and modifications, and placing much emphasis on the ability of those men in power to follow their own pursuits—often at the expense of others.|$|E

2500|$|A legal {{precedent}} {{concerning the}} legality of abortion was set in Australia in 1969, by the Menhennitt ruling in the Victorian Supreme Court case R v Davidson, which held that abortion was lawfully justified if [...] "necessary to preserve the physical or mental health of the woman concerned, provided that the danger involved in the abortion did not outweigh the danger which the abortion was designed to prevent."

2500|$|An {{argument}} first {{presented by}} Judith Jarvis Thomson states {{that even if}} the fetus is a person and has a right to life, abortion is morally permissible because a woman has a right to control her own body and its life-support functions.

[...] It is argued that just as it would be permissible to [...] "unplug" [...] and thereby cause the death of the person who is using one's kidneys, so it is permissible to abort the fetus (who similarly, it is said, has no right to use one's body's life-support functions against one's will).|$|E
2500|$|In various places, {{men have}} sexual {{authority}} over their wives, {{in law and}} in practice. The men decide when and where to have sex, and wives have no power to stop unwanted sex. In certain countries marital rape is legal, and even where it is illegal it is infrequently reported or prosecuted. Often, married women also cannot stop <b>unwanted</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> because in various countries modern contraception is not available, and in some countries married women need legal permission from the husband to use contraception (and even in countries where the husband's consent is not legally required in practice it is asked for), and abortion is illegal or restricted, and in some countries married women need the consent of husband for abortion. Therefore, marriage leads to a situation which allows not only forced sex, but also forced pregnancy, and {{in some of these}} countries pregnancy and childbirth remain dangerous because of lack of adequate medical care. The effects of sexual violence inside marriage are exacerbated by the practice of child marriage; in 2013 an 8-years-old Yemeni girl died from internal bleeding after she was raped by her 40-year-old new husband. Sheila Jeffreys argues that the very institution of marriage is {{based on the idea that}} heterosexual sex is the absolute right of the man and the absolute duty of the woman; that men are entitled to demand sex on their terms and to coerce sex, and women are not allowed to ever refuse it. Lack of economic opportunity means that wives have no choice but to [...] "allow sexual access to their bodies in return for subsistence".|$|E
