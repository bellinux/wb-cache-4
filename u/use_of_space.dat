The centre, which was opened in 2004, {{regularly}} hosts concerts, exhibitions and other community events. Performers have included comedian Lucy Porter, Midge Ure, Fairport Convention, The Zombies and Sue Perkins. In 2004, the centre received the British Urban Regeneration Association Award for its innovative <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> and for reinvigorating Sale town centre.|$|E
5|$|While {{publishing}} short {{articles on}} the subject earlier in his career (for example the essay De quelques formes primitives de classification written in 1902 with Marcel Mauss), Durkheim's definitive statement concerning the sociology of knowledge comes in his 1912 magnum opus The Elementary Forms of Religious Life. This book has as its goal not only the elucidation of the social origins and function of religion, but also the social origins and impact of society on language and logical thought. Durkheim worked largely out of a Kantian framework and sought {{to understand how the}} concepts and categories of logical thought could arise out of social life. He argued, for example, that the categories of space and time were not a priori. Rather, the category of space depends on a society's social grouping and geographical <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>space,</b> and a group's social rhythm that determines our understanding of time. In this Durkheim sought to combine elements of rationalism and empiricism, arguing that certain aspects of logical thought common to all humans did exist, but that they were products of collective life (thus contradicting the tabla rasa empiricist understanding whereby categories are acquired by individual experience alone), and that they were not universal a priori's (as Kant argued) since the content of the categories differed from society to society.|$|E

25|$|The unique {{characteristic}} of Sasanian architecture was its distinctive <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> The Sasanian architect conceived his building {{in terms of}} masses and surfaces; hence the use of massive walls of brick decorated with molded or carved stucco. Stucco wall decorations appear at Bishapur, but better examples are preserved from Chal Tarkhan near Rey (late Sasanian or early Islamic in date), and from Ctesiphon and Kish in Mesopotamia. The panels show animal figures set in roundels, human busts, and geometric and floral motifs.|$|E

40|$|Principle of {{the peace}} full <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> is one <b>of</b> the basic {{principle}} of international law.

Today {{the international community is}} faced with the shift from the currently passive <b>use</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> to active military <b>use</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> <b>of</b> a destructive nature. Therefore, the principle <b>of</b> peaceful <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> should be examined from the standpoint of contemporary international law. Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and <b>Use</b> <b>of</b> Outer <b>Space,</b> including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies is considered to be the most significant instrument which establish the principle <b>of</b> peaceful <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space.</b> Beside this Treaty, there are other significant multilateral and bilateral instruments which supplement and develop the principle <b>of</b> peaceful <b>uses</b> in various ways. In this paper, the historical development of the principle <b>of</b> the peaceful <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> will be introduced, and various multilateral and bilateral treaties from this area will be examined. Since the outer space law is the part of the international law, application of the UN Charter should also be examined. Finally, current state of the development of the principle <b>of</b> peaceful <b>uses</b> <b>of</b> outer <b>space</b> and future courses of the principle will be considered...|$|R

Even though all the persons with ownership rights were losing money with the empty stores, and stores were in great demand, their competing interests got in the way of the effective <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E

Due to the tightly compacted nature of this ossuary, bones were broken or bent {{in the shape of the}} walls (particularly long bones). These fractures are not consistent with trampling and because the broken ends remained in close proximity, it was interpreted that great care was taken to minimize damage to the bones in the filling and packing of the ossuary.|$|E

25|$|After 1945, {{the focus}} was on both {{rebuilding}} structures destroyed in World War II and erecting new ones: seven high-rise buildings were built at symbolic points in the Moscow area. The construction of Moscow University (1948–1953), by Lev Rudnev and associates, is particularly notable for its <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>space.</b> Another example is the Exhibition Centre in Moscow, built for the second All-Union Agricultural Exhibition (VSKhV) in 1954. This featured a series of pavilions, each decorated in representative style. Other well-known examples are the stations of the Moscow and Saint Petersburg Metros built during the 1940s and 1950s, famous for their extravagant design and vivid decoration. In general, Stalinist architecture changed the appearance of many post-war cities; much survives to this day in central avenues and public buildings.|$|E
25|$|To {{promote the}} {{development}} and exploitation of the medicinal waters in an economically viable way, Octavio Moura Andrade conceived and designed a city focused on hydrotherapy and residential purposes: a spa town. Águas de São Pedro was created as a hydromineral spa, fully planned and aiming to serve both those who needed treatment and tourists looking for fun and leisure. The urban planner Jorge de Macedo Vieira was chosen to integrate the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> with the mineral waters, topography, soil, and climate, conducting a two-year-long detailed study of the area prior to designing the city. It was only in 1940 that the project was completed, being recorded in the Real Estate Registry Office of the District of São Pedro under number1, {{in accordance with the}} requirements of the Brazilian Federal Decree-Law No.58, of 10 December 1937.|$|E
25|$|This diagram shows a {{productive}} <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>space</b> by West Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final {{which led to}} Gerd Müller's game-winning goal against the Netherlands. German midfielder Rainer Bonhof made a long diagonal run out {{to the right side}} of the field, putting put him clear of the Dutch opposition. Deep into the Dutch half, Bonhof received a ball from Jürgen Grabowski and beat Arie Haan. Bonhof sent a low cross in to Müller, who found the back of the net. Moving diagonally is one of the best offensive movements, whether at the near or far posts, or out to the wings farther back in midfield. Diagonal movement creates added space to maneuver, compared to simply running straight ahead or laterally. It also means that players must be willing to switch positions as the situation demands.|$|E

50|$|The {{main issue}} {{since the very}} beginning, {{preventing}} the planned <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> as production spaces, has been a lack of basic infrastructure: electricity, water, toilets. While water and toilets have been fixed by Rog users, the electricity is possible only through the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> portable electric generators. During the filming of the movie Kakor v nebesih, tako na zemlji by Franci Slak, the needed electric infrastructure was installed. Despite now satisfying all regulatory requirements, the municipality, {{the owner of the}} premises, has not given the necessary allowance for permanently connecting the spaces to the electrical grid. As a consequence, to this day the only source of electricity in the Rog factory is through the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> electric generators, the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> which is more expensive and cumbersome than the connection to the grid would be. Furthermore, not all spaces and collectives have access to electric generators which limits their <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces.</b> As a consequence, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>spaces</b> shifted from mere production spaces, used by individuals and groups for their own needs, to more consumer-oriented presentation and performance spaces which were able to cover the costs through donations by visitors.|$|R

And if so, is there reason to assume that spaces could also indicate silence or missing text? The search for answers has been based on the appearance of these textual markers in Codex Leningradensis (L), Codex Aleppo (A), and Codex Cairensis (C), which are analysed by Langlamet (1984).
