The planchet was usually cast from a mold. The bottom die (sometimes called the anvil die) was usually counter sunk in a log or other sturdy surface and was called a pile.

50|$|A {{typical power}} hammer {{consists}} of a frame, an anvil, and a reciprocating ram holding a hammer head or die. The workpiece {{is placed on the}} lower anvil or die and the head or <b>upper</b> <b>die</b> strikes the workpiece. The power hammer is a direct descendant of the trip hammer, differing in that the power hammer stores potential energy in an arrangement of mechanical linkages and springs, in compressed air, or steam, and {{by the fact that it}} accelerates the ram on the downward stroke. This provides more force than simply allowing the weight to fall. Predecessors like trip hammers, steam drop hammers, board or strap hammers, used the power source to raise the ram or hammer head, but let it fall solely under gravity.|$|E
50|$|Rubber pad forming can be {{accomplished}} in many different ways, and as technology has advanced, so have the applications for this simple process. In general, an elastic <b>upper</b> <b>die,</b> usually made of rubber, is connected to a hydraulic press. A rigid lower die, often called a form block, provides the mold for the sheeted metal to be formed to. Because the upper (male) die {{can be used with}} separate lower (female) dies, the process is relatively cheap and flexible. The worked metal is not worn as quickly as in more conventional processes such as deep drawing, however, rubber pads exert less pressure in the same circumstances as non-elastic parts, which may lead to less definition in forming, and rubber pads wear more quickly than steel parts.|$|E
50|$|Experimental {{archeology}} {{suggests that}} a lower die {{could be expected to}} last for up to 10,000 strikes depending on the level of wear deemed acceptable. <b>Upper</b> <b>dies</b> seem to have a far greater range of lives with usable lives ranging from just over 100 strikes to nearly 8000 being reported. Combining archaeological evidence with historic records suggests ancient coin producers (in this case the Amphictions at Delphi) could get as many as 47,000 strikes out of an individual die.|$|R

50|$|The {{bolster plate}} {{is mounted on}} top of the press bed and is a large block of metal upon which the bottom portion of a die is clamped; the bolster plate is stationary. Large presses (like the ones used in the {{automotive}} industry) may be equipped die cushions integrated in the bolster plate to apply blank holder or counter draw forces. This is necessary when a single acting press is used for deep drawing. The ram / slide is the moving or reciprocating member that the <b>upper</b> <b>die</b> is mounted to. Ram or Slide guidance is a critical element to assure long die life between die maintenance. Different types of slide guides are available, 4 point V-Gibs or 6 point square gibs on smaller presses and 8 point full length slide guides on larger straight side frame presses. With the dies and material be fed into the die between the bolster and slide, good press designs must account for plastic deformation, other wise known as defection when frame design and loads are considered.|$|E
50|$|In the Middle Ages bars {{of metal}} were cast and {{hammered}} {{out on an}} anvil. Portions of the flattened sheets were then cut out with shears, struck between dies and again trimmed with shears. A similar method {{had been used in}} Ancient Egypt during the Ptolemaic Kingdom (c. 300 BC), but had been forgotten. Square pieces of metal were also cut from cast bars, converted into round disks by hammering and then struck between dies. In striking, the lower die was fixed into a block of wood, and the blank piece of metal laid upon it by hand. The <b>upper</b> <b>die</b> was then placed on the blank, and kept in position by means of a holder round which was placed a roll of lead to protect the hand of the operator while heavy blows were struck with a hammer. An early improvement was the introduction of a tool resembling a pair of tongs, the two dies being placed one at the extremity of each leg. This avoided the necessity of readjusting the dies between blows, and ensured greater accuracy in the impression.|$|E

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{methods for}} suppression of defects observed in zigzag bending of sheet-metal or plate. This type of bending {{is widely used}} in industry for manufacturing structural parts in automobiles. Although it is easily conducted by press forming using upper and lower dies which have zigzag shape, it often has defects, such as spring-back and dents. A series of finite element analyses and experiments were conducted for suppression of the defects in two-place bending, which has three segments. As a result, it is revealed that that the distance between two bending positions is dominant for occurrence of the dents and that the dent area {{was able to be}} reduced by selecting the optimum moving direction of the <b>upper</b> <b>die.</b> It is also revealed that the cause of spring-back is elastic recovery of the straight segments instead of the bent parts against engineers' and technicians'' intuition, and that there is an optimum moving direction of the <b>upper</b> <b>die</b> for the least spring-back. Furthermore, another realistic method for suppression of spring-back was suggested for four-place bending...|$|E

40|$|Friction has an {{important}} influence in metal forming operations as it contributes to {{the success or failure}} of the process. In the present investigation, the effect of friction on metal forming was studied by conducting compression tests of cylindrical Al-Mg alloy using Finite Element Method (FEM) technique. Three kinds of compression tests were performed. For the first test, a constant coefficient of friction (i. e., 0. 65) was employed at both <b>upper</b> <b>die</b> – work-piece and lower die- work-piece interfaces. For the second and third tests, the coefficient of friction between the <b>upper</b> <b>die</b> and work-piece interface was same as that of previous test (i. e., 0. 65). However, at the lower die-work-piece interface, two different coefficient of friction values, namely 0. 65 and 0. 35, were employed at different locations (i. e., each halves and each quarters of the cylindrical work-piece for the second and third tests, respectively) in the tests. Simulation results showed that a difference in metal flow occurs near the interfaces owing to the difference in coefficient of friction. It was concluded that the variations in coefficient of friction between the dies and work-piece directly affect the stress distribution and shape of the work-piece. This would directly affect the microstructure of the material being processe...|$|E
