25|$|In 1999 {{researchers}} at Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio, led by Hunter Peckham, used 64-electrode EEG skullcap to return limited hand movements to quadriplegic Jim Jatich. As Jatich concentrated on simple but opposite concepts like <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> <b>his</b> beta-rhythm EEG output was analysed using software to identify {{patterns in the}} noise. A basic pattern was identified and used to control a switch: Above average activity was set to on, below average off. As well as enabling Jatich to control a computer cursor the signals were also used to drive the nerve controllers embedded in his hands, restoring some movement.|$|E
500|$|Crash's {{aesthetic}} {{design in}} the games developed by Radical Entertainment has received mixed reactions from reviewers. Brian Rowe of Game Revolution noted that Crash's fingerless gloves have been replaced with [...] "equally outdated" [...] tribal tattoos and that Crash's personality had been altered from his [...] "obnoxiously extreme attitude" [...] {{to that of a}} [...] "bluthering, googly-eyed idiot". Although Rowe wondered when and why the change happened, he concluded that [...] "it's better than the popular goatee-of-rage that so many other platform giants are sporting these days". Arnold Katayev of PSX Extreme, while admitting that the character detail on Crash was [...] "pretty nice", expressed unhappiness with the artistic choices made for the character; he described Crash's tribal tattoos as [...] "a little pretentious" [...] and noted that the increased definition on his mohawk patch made Crash come off as [...] "trying too hard to be cool". He added that Crash's new fighting style begot a stance that consists of Crash [...] "putting up his dukes like a boxer", which he deemed [...] "out of character" [...] for Crash. Finally, while critiquing the voice acting in Crash of the Titans, he remarked that Crash [...] "especially sounds awful, largely because he doesn't actually speak - he just blabs annoying gibberish, which makes him sound like he's an infant". Matt Keller of PALGN also criticized Crash's voice, which he said made Crash sound [...] "like a confused baby". Louis Bedigian of GameZone stated that [...] "Crash's character design has gone from cool to goofy and now to the dreaded place of being dorky" [...] and said that the minute and gradual changes made to Crash's design throughout the series [...] "have really hurt Crash's appearance as a leading game character". GamePro named Crash's new design as the second worst video game character makeover ever. Craig Harris of IGN was more positive on Crash's new appearance and noted that Crash [...] "looks a little floofier and a lot edgier, gaining a spikier Mohawk and trading in his fingerless gloves for tribal ink all <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>his</b> arms" [...] while comparing his incoherent squawking vocalizations to Kazooie of the Banjo-Kazooie series. He concluded that [...] "ultimately he's been changed for the better. He looks a little cooler and more appealing than his more 'Japanese-inspired' edits over the years".|$|E
