50|$|An uninsured {{motorist}} clause is {{a provision}} {{commonly found in}} United States automobile insurance policies that provides for a driver to receive damages for any injury he or she receives from an uninsured, negligent driver. The owner of the policy pays a premium to the insurance company to include this clause. Although not exclusive, this coverage is typically added to an automobile insurance policy. In {{the event of a}} qualifying accident, the insurance company pays the difference between what the <b>uninsured</b> <b>driver</b> can pay and what the injured driver would be entitled to as if the uninsured motorist had proper insurance.|$|E

50|$|In a Wisconsin case (Zimmer v. City of Milwaukee), an <b>uninsured</b> <b>driver</b> of a {{car with}} faulty brakes hit and killed a six-year-old boy at a school {{crossing}}. The school crossing had a stop sign and a crossing guard.

The city (the crossing guard's employer) {{was found to be}} one percent at fault. Under proportionate liability (sometimes also called comparative negligence), the city would only have been liable for their one percent of the damages. However because the driver was uninsured (and also insolvent), the city had to pay 100% of the damages.|$|E
40|$|Following {{a review}} in 2013, the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (MIB) {{established}} the <b>Uninsured</b> <b>Drivers</b> Agreement (UDA) 2015.

In January 2017 the MIB provided its Supplementary <b>Uninsured</b> <b>Drivers</b> Agreement. If its aim was to remedy these problems we argue that it has substantially failed. Further, the updated Agreement continues {{the uncertainty of the}} law in this area and, with reference to Fuller’s ‘Eight Ways to Fail to Make Law’, we present an argument that the Secretary of State for Transport should again redraft the UDA 2015 and the 2017 Supplement to provide legal certainty, remove the inconsistencies between national and EU law, and provide the protection to which third-party victims of <b>uninsured</b> <b>drivers</b> are entitled under EU law...|$|R

40|$|In the UK, {{motor vehicle}} {{insurance}} is governed by national and EU law.

At that point, eight other states did not require individuals to prove their legal immigration status when applying for a driver's licenses.

40|$|The UK’s {{referendum}} {{decision of}} 23 June 2016, where voters elected {{to leave the}} European Union (EU), will fundamentally change aspects of national law.

The statute governing much of the law (the Road Traffic Act 1988), along with the extra-statutory agreements providing protection for the third party victims of negligent <b>uninsured</b> <b>drivers</b> and untraced vehicles, are each profoundly influenced by EU directives.

40|$|Despite {{concerns}} about US dependence on a volatile world oil market, greenhouse gases from fuel combustion, and air quality effects of mobile source emissions, substantially higher federal gasoline taxes are currently a political non-starter. Any fuel conservation measures {{that might be}} more politically palatable are generally perceived as inferior to gasoline taxes on efficiency grounds. This paper challenges the latter assertion: it shows a policy that should be far more feasible than a large increase in fuel taxes can also achieve {{a significant reduction in}} fuel demand, with a dramatically larger welfare gain. The policy is pay-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance, which is motivated on the grounds of reducing mileage, particularly by high-risk drivers, and reducing the number of <b>uninsured</b> <b>drivers</b> by lowering premiums for low-mileage vehicles. It involves auto insurance companies switching from current, annual lump-sum premiums, to premiums levied on annual miles driven, scaled by a driver’s rating factor (which varies with age, crash record, and region). By converting some of the fixed costs of vehicle ownership into costs that vary with mileage, the policy reduces the amount vehicles are driven, and thereby reduces fuel demand. And, unlike under higher fuel taxes, driving costs (fixed plus variable) for the average motorist do not increase; hence political opposition to this policy should be more muted. To some extent, we may see a market-driven transition to PAYD over the next decade or two...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three {{essays in}} microeconomics, focusing primarily but not {{exclusively on the}} labor market. Although seemingly very different, these essays all concern the efficiency of markets and the role taxation and government policy play in correcting these inefficiencies. ^ The first essay addresses the excessive and highly variable cost of automobile insurance. The thesis is that high premiums {{can be attributed to}} the large number of uninsured motorists, while simultaneously the number of uninsured motorists {{can be attributed to the}} high premiums. This circularity is made explicit in a simple non-cooperative equilibrium framework. The key assumption is limited liability which introduces a non-convexity for low income individuals. This potentially allows for equilibria with <b>uninsured</b> <b>drivers,</b> and high (yet actuarially fair) premiums. These equilibria are inefficient and dominated by full insurance. For certain parameterizations, both an optimal full insurance equilibrium and inferior high price equilibria with uninsured motorists exist, consistent with the observed variability in premiums across similar cities. ^ The second essay analyzes the effects of proportional wage and profit taxation in a search and bargaining model. While a profit tax increases employment, wage taxes decrease employment when the worker 2 ̆ 7 s untaxed unemployment benefits exceed his search costs. The net employment effect is ambiguous and a combination of taxes raises revenue without distortions. ^ The bargaining nature of wages may cause a tax 2 ̆ 7 s incidence to exceed 100...|$|R

5000|$|Opponents of the {{principle}} of joint and several liability note that its use (instead of proportionate responsibility) has led to cases in which a party with a very minor part of the responsibility unfairly shoulders the burden of damages. The classic example is the <b>uninsured</b> drunk <b>driver</b> who injures someone; the plaintiff will sue both the insolvent drunk driver and the state highway department (or automobile manufacturer), hoping to hold the latter 1% or 2% responsible, thereby forcing them to pay the entire award. Joint and several liability, reform supporters argue, leads to lawyers searching for [...] "deep pockets" [...] to sue (in the expectation that they will settle rather than risk trial), even though those defendants may only be remotely related to an incident.|$|R
50|$|Several {{states in}} the U.S. have such {{assigned}} risk systems. New York is a typical system.

The car was registered in Greece, however the driver, who was at fault, had no driving licence and was uninsured. Under motor insurance law, victims of accidents involving motor vehicles would normally seek compensation through the driver/owner's insurers (on a contractual basis). It is also possible that national law can make the contractual insurer fulfil the role of insurer where some error has occurred which would have otherwise allowed it to avoid having to satisfy claims on the policy (establishing it as a statutorily-imposed insurer). Finally, in the event that the tortfeasor holds no insurance, the victim has no insurer from which to claim, and the driver who caused the accident is unable to satisfy the award of damages, a state guarantee-fund (as required by the Motor Vehicle Insurance Directives [1] (the MVID), the latest being the sixth directive 2009 / 103 /EC, exists to act as insurer of last resort for the victims of accidents caused by <b>uninsured</b> and untraced <b>drivers...</b>|$|R
