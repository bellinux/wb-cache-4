"The {{soldiers}} on the hill with the pack-horses began to fire on <b>us.</b> <b>About</b> <b>this</b> time all the Indians had got their horses and guns and bows and arrows and war-clubs and they charged the soldiers {{in the east and}} north on top of the hill. Custer was farther north than these soldiers were then. He was going to attack {{the lower end of the}} village. We drove nearly all that got away from us down the hill along the ridge where another lot of soldiers were trying to make a stand." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 24 February 2012, in {{a speech}} in Nabi Sheet for the [...] "remembrance of the fallen martyrs Abbas al-Musawi, Ragheb Harb, and Imad Mughniyah," [...] Hasan Nasrallah said, [...] "I say that the American {{administration}} and the American mentality lacks nothing from Satanism. But that kind of behavior and that kind of mistreatment of holy books [...] and prophets, and the prophets' sanctities, and others' sanctities; this behavior is Israeli and let us say it is Jewish, between quotation marks, - now they will say that this is anti-Semitism - [...] the Holy Quran told <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> people: how they attacked their prophets, and how they killed their prophets, and how they affronted their prophets, and how they affronted Jesus Christ, peace be upon him, and how they affronted Mary, peace be upon her, and how they affronted Allah's great messenger Mohammad, May God exalt and bring peace upon him and his family. This [...] pattern about affronting holy books, and prophets, and messengers, and sanctities; this is their mentality, and maybe they want to push things more and more toward a religious war worldwide." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2013, it was {{revealed}} that due to the success of Texas Chainsaw 3D, Millennium Films began planning a sequel film to be called Texas Chainsaw 4 which was expected to begin filming later in 2013 in the state of Louisiana. Millennium Films Chairman Avi Lerner stated that the project was brought to him by Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman and that Millennium had signed on to produce, with Lionsgate distributing the finished product. Executive producer Mark Burg clarified that the sequel was prematurely announced and had not been authorised, [...] "The rights are controlled by Carl [...] and Main Line Pictures, no matter what Millennium says. Millennium simply sold the foreign rights and they will not tell us when a sequel is ready to be made. The script was developed by Carl, myself and writer/director John Luessenhop. Maybe they're looking for something to sell at Berlin, but they have no right to announce this sequel." [...] The idea for a prequel came when Seth M. Sherwood was given the chance to pitch the film to the studio. Dissatisfied with the inconsistencies of the franchise's continuity, he opted to make a Chainsaw film that wasn't just another sequel to the original: [...] "My pitch was always about doing it completely out of left field and making it different. The first thing I said to Millennium was 'I bet I can tell you what everybody else is pitching you and it’s X-Y-Z, but I want to do 1-2-3', and luckily, that's the direction they were interested in going as well." [...] The script was approached as a story of identity, based on the statements given by Tobe Hooper and Gunnar Hansen on how the character Leatherface is entirely devoid of personality beyond the masks he wears and what his family commands him to do. Sherwood chose not to have Leatherface be born as intellectually disabled, finding the story of a functional person that has their mental capabilities reduced to be more fascinating. Producer Les Whedon detailed the reasoning behind accepting Sherwood's pitch: [...] "What interested and enticed <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> production was {{the fact that we were}} presented with an opportunity to re-invent the franchise. It was the opportunity to almost go behind-the-scenes into the beginning of how Leatherface was created. What happened? Who is Leatherface and how did the whole character come to be?" [...] Despite the film's explanatory premise, co-director Julien Maury found it important to maintain some of the lead character's mystique, referring the project simply as [...] "moments from his young years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] {{he said to}} {{her that}} night, lifting his head from the books over which he had been poring, [...] "There must be a few words between <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> affair. They might as well be spoken now." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come {{and have}} a smoke with us, Mannering, and tell <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>this</b> place," [...] the latter said. [...] "The Duchess and your niece are charmed with it, {{and they want to}} stay for a few days. Are there any golf links?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} a little odd that Miles never told <b>us</b> all <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> in his letters, at the time, Lucy. When young gentlemen drag young ladies out of canals, their friends at home {{have a right to}} know {{something}} of the matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now look here, don't {{you start}} in like that, Sam," [...] came quickly from Dick, with a blush, {{for the girl}} {{mentioned}} was his dearest friend and had been for some years. [...] "Tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> houseboat, Tom," [...] he went on.|$|E
6000|$|TWISDEN. Mr Ricardos? My name is Jacob Twisden. My partner. [Holding up a finger, as RICARDOS would speak] Mr Gilman {{has told}} <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> note. You {{took it to}} him, he says, three days ago; that is, on Monday, and {{received}} cash for it? ...|$|E
6000|$|But he was {{a little}} {{surprised}} when Dexter Rice approached him gloomily. [...] "Of course," [...] he began, [...] "it ain't no call of ours to interfere in family affairs, and you've a right to keep 'em to yourself, but if you'd been fair and square and above board in what you got off on <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> per--" ...|$|E

[...] "Carson, would you {{be good enough to}} tell us what {{conceivable}} thing there is that you are entitled to warn <b>us</b> <b>about</b> after <b>this</b> exposure? Warn?

I got better rapidly and we made a few easy {{excursions}} into the mountains, but the weather was bad and we didn't like our hotel. Then Walters turned up again and told <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> place. In fact, he was rather enthusiastic about it and said we'd find good rock climbs at the door, so we agreed to move." ...|$|E
6000|$|The king joined <b>us,</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> time, mightily {{refreshed}} by his nap, {{and feeling}} good. Anything could make me nervous now, I was so uneasy--for our lives were in danger; {{and so it}} worried me to detect a complacent something in the king's eye which seemed to indicate {{that he had been}} loading himself up for a performance of some kind or other; confound it, why must he go and choose such a time as this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, my friend,' said Mr. Bounderby, whom {{he could}} not have exasperated more, quite {{unconscious}} of it though he was, than by seeming to appeal to any one else, 'if you will favour me with your attention for half a minute, I should like to have a word or two with you. You said just now, that you had nothing to tell <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> business. You are quite sure of that before we go any further.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Gregor Schoeler {{discusses}} the revisionist school and depicts the early controversies. Schoeler considers revisionism {{to be too}} radical yet welcomes the general impulse: [...] "To have made <b>us</b> thinking <b>about</b> <b>this</b> all and much more remarkable things {{for the first time}} -- or again, is without any doubt a merit of the new generation of the 'skeptics'." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{gaze at the}} {{purchase}} with the amazement expected of me, and the chair itself crinkles and shudders to hear what it went for (or is it merely chuckling at her?). ‘And the man said it cost himself five shillings,’ my mother continues exultantly. You would have thought her the hardest person had not {{a knock on the}} wall summoned <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> time to my sister’s side. Though in bed she has been listening, and this is what she has to say, in a voice that makes my mother very indignant, ‘You drive a bargain!

60|$|We {{were much}} {{provoked}} at the insult {{of playing the}} Rogue's March. Jack Reilly and I laid a plan to have our revenge, should it be repeated. Two or three days later {{we had the same}} tune, at another village, and I caught up a couple of large stones, ran ahead, and dashed them through both ends of the drum, before the boy, who was beating it, knew what I was about. Jack snatched the fife out of the other boy's hand, and it was passed from one to another among us, until it reached one who threw it over the railing of a bridge. After this, we had no more music, good or bad. Not a word was said to any of <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> affair, and I really think the officers were ashamed of themselves.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the chapter}} {{following}} this, {{which is called}} [...] "The Flying Authority," [...] I try in vain to locate and fix any authority that could rationally rule men in so rooted and universal a matter; little would be gained by ordinary men doing it to each other; and if ordinary practitioners did it they would very soon show, by a thousand whims and quarrels, that they were ordinary men. I then discussed the enlightened despotism of a few general professors of hygiene, and found it unworkable, for an essential reason: that while we can always get men intelligent enough to know more {{than the rest of}} <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> or that accident or pain or pest, we cannot count on the appearance of great cosmic philosophers; and only such men can be even supposed to know more than we do about normal conduct and common sanity. Every sort of man, in short, would shirk such a responsibility, except the worst sort of man, who would accept it.|$|E
6000|$|... "But surely, Miss Keene," [...] said Miss Chubb, {{turning to}} that young lady, {{who had taken}} only {{the part of a}} passive {{listener}} to this colloquy, and was gazing over the railing at the sinking sun, [...] "surely YOU can tell <b>us</b> something <b>about</b> <b>this</b> poor young man.

60|$|WISE. I {{am glad to}} {{hear that}} you are of this opinion, and to confirm what you have said by a few hints from the Word. Man in his birth is {{compared}} to an ass, an unclean beast, and to a wretched infant in its blood (Job 11:12; Eze 16). Besides, all the first-born of old that were offered unto the Lord, were to be redeemed at the age of a month, and that was before they were sinners by imitation (Exo 13:13, 34:20). The scripture also affirmeth, that by the sin of one, judgment came upon all; and renders this reason, 'for that all have sinned' (Rom 5:12). Nor is that objection worth a rush, that Christ by his death hath taken away original sin. First. Because it is scriptureless. Secondly. Because it makes them incapable of salvation by Christ; for none but those that in their own persons are sinners are to have salvation by him. Many other things might be added, but between persons so well agreed as you and I are, these may suffice at present. But when an antagonist comes to deal with <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> matter, then we have for him often other strong arguments, if he be an antagonist worth the taking notice of.|$|E

This is evident, because we read {{that there are some}} that not only [...] "make a fair show in the flesh," [...] that [...] "glory in appearance," [...] that [...] "appear {{beautiful}} outward," [...] that do as God's people, but have not the grace of God's people. (Gal 6:12, 2 Cor 5:12, Matt 23:27, Isa 57:3,4) (2.) It is evident also from those frequent cautions that are everywhere in the Scriptures given <b>us</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> thing: [...] "Be not deceived: Let a man examine himself: Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith." [...] (Gal 6:7, 1 Cor 11:28, 2 Cor 13:5) All these expressions intimate to us {{that there may be a}} show of, or a thing like grace, where there is no grace indeed. (3.) This is evident from the conclusion made by the Holy Ghost upon this very thing: [...] "For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself." [...] (Gal 6:3) The Holy Ghost here concludeth, that a man may think himself to be something, may think he hath grace, when he hath none; may think himself something for heaven and another world, when indeed he is just nothing at all with reference thereto. The Holy Ghost also determines upon this point, to wit, that they that do so deceive themselves: [...] "For if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself"; he deceiveth his own soul, he deceiveth himself of heaven and salvation. So again: [...] "Let no man beguile you of your reward." [...] (Col 2:18) (4.) It is manifest from the text; [...] "For many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able." [...] Alas! great light, great parts, great works, and great confidence of heaven, may be where there is no faith of God's elect, no love of the Spirit, no repentance unto salvation, no sanctification of the Spirit, and so consequently no saving grace.
