40|$|Abstract. Butadiene {{is a kind}} of {{important}} material in the chemical engineering, and it is inflammable and explosive. Once it leaks to the air, fire and explosion accident may happen. In the current experiment, the Butadiene tank in a chemical plant was taken as the example to analyze the potential hazards that the tank may cause. Some mathematical models, such as the UVCE（the <b>Unconfined</b> Vapor <b>Cloud</b> Explosion ） and the BLEVE（the Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapor Explosion）, were used to describe the results that the hazards may lead to，so that it could provide some scientific criteria to the similar companies, and help the companies to take measures to keep away from these dangers, and reduce the casualty and loss in the end...|$|R
5000|$|The 1970 Propane vapor cloud {{explosion}} in Port Hudson in Missouri {{resulted from a}} propane pipeline break, {{which led to the}} formation of a large, dense vapor cloud. Upon ignition, the vapor cloud exploded with tremendous force. Both near- and far-field damage indicate that this explosion may be attributed to the detonation of propane in air with an energy release equivalent to that from about 50 tons of detonating trinitrotoluene (TNT). The violence of the explosion is likely unprecedented. As such, the accident is widely quoted as one of the first, if not the first, confirmed accidental occurrences of an <b>unconfined</b> vapor <b>cloud</b> deflagration that turns into a detonation - a so-called deflagration to detonation transition. The accident represents a [...] "worst-possible" [...] sort of case history for assessment of the hazards of fuel transportation.|$|R

50|$|The Feyzin {{disaster}} was {{the worst}} accident which had occurred in petroleum and petrochemical plants in Western Europe, prior to the Flixborough disaster in 1974. Since then, many pressurised tanks containing liquefied gases have BLEVE'd. The hazards are now better understood and storage spheres are protected from fire engulfment by better design. However, so many firemen and emergency servicemen have been killed while trying to control large fires that the cautious philosophy is to evacuate and take shelter until the material burns itself out. BLEVE's produce intense thermal radiation from the fireball. This and blast damage from the bursting pressure vessel are relatively localised compared with <b>unconfined</b> vapour <b>cloud</b> explosions. Therefore, evacuation of up to 0.5 km will usually {{ensure the safety of}} people. Burning hydrocarbon storage vessels are very spectacular but unpredictable. Therefore, newsmen and sightseers must be kept well away for their own safety.|$|R
40|$|International audienceLPG Loading /unloading site is {{considered}} as a dangerous environment of significant risk, especially during LPG transfer operations. These risks may cause catastrophic dangers such as BLEVE (Boiling Liquid Expanding Vapour Explosion), UVCE (<b>Unconfined</b> Vapour <b>Cloud</b> Explosion), etc. The site consists of a tank (RST) containing LPG and threetransfer posts. Two posts allow loading of small carrier tankers 6 tons. The other one transfer post transfer LPG contained injumbo tankers 20 tons inside the tank. The industrial site at risks chooses to demonstrate {{the need for a}} modelling-simulation approach. The aim is to check first compliance and authorization of the truck when it enters the site for loading /unloading, to verify the authorization to make the transfer, and then, to identify the driver and his training to ensure that the transfer operations are going to take place without incident. Sometimes, it may happen that Consignment Operator (CO) is busy orabsent and thus the driver operates alone without being authorized, in this case the site risks a loss of control {{due to a lack of}} resources. The modelling-simulation will be done using multi-agent systems that will present the drivers, trucks, PO and loading unloading posts as agents in order to have a model facilitating this checking...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{assessment}} of external explosion, resulting from accidental release of jet fuel from the large commercial airliner in the nuclear power plant (NPP). The study used three widely prediction methods such as Trinitrotoluene (TNT), multi energy (TNO) and Baker-strehow (BST) to determine the <b>unconfined</b> vapour <b>cloud</b> explosion (UVCE) overpressure within the distances of 100 - 1400 m from the first impact location. The containment building was taken as the reference position. The fatalities of persons and damage of structures was estimated using probit methodology. Analysis of the results shows that both reactor building and control-room will be highly damaged with risk consequences and probability, depending on the assumed position of the crash. The structures at the radial distance of 600 m may suffer major structural damage with probability ranging from 25 to 100 %. The minor structural damage was observed throughout the bounds of the plant complex. The people working within 250 m radius may get affected with different fatality ranging from 28 to 100 %. The {{findings of this study}} is valuable to evaluate the safety improvement needed on the NPP site and on the risk and consequences associated with the hydrocarbon fuel release/fires due to external hazards...|$|R
40|$|The Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) {{approach}} {{is used to}} model partially-premixed combustion (PPC) in confined and <b>unconfined</b> fuel vapor <b>clouds.</b> The model {{is based on the}} concept of a filtered reaction progress variable to describe the premixed combustion. The premixed combustion model is implemented into the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), developed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA, and is coupled with either an equilibrium-chemistry, mixture-fraction based model (FDS Version 4) or an eddy dissipation model (FDS Version 5) for non-premixed combustion. Modifications to the model are developed and implemented with the goal of reducing the grid resolution requirement while still producing physically sound results. The modified formulation is tested using both versions of the non-premixed combustion model, and the results are compared. It is found that the modifications are capable of reducing errors associated with poorly-resolved simulations in both versions of the model...|$|R
40|$|A flash fire, or cloud fire, occurs if {{ignition}} {{takes place}} within the flammable region of an unobstructed, <b>unconfined</b> gas <b>cloud,</b> generally at a point remote from the source. When modelling the effects of such fires, it is usually assumed that all unprotected personnel caught within the fire boundary are fatalities, but {{that the proportion of}} fatalities is significantly lower for those sheltered within buildings. This report considers the likelihood of secondary ignition of the interior of buildings, based on the incident heat flux from a fire event and the duration of exposure to the event. An assessment is then made of the proportion of occupants who do not escape from the secondary fire. Thus an attempt has been made to incorporate evacuation behaviour into the assessment. Due to the lack of suitable data on the evacuation behaviour relating to external fires, selected case studies have been used to estimate particular behaviour patterns. The key finding of this study is the increased probability of fatalities of building occupants due to multi point ignition events, as compared to that for single point ignition. Multi-point ignition refers to events which engulf the complete building, i. e. flash fires, for which secondary ignition of all rooms and flame penetration is possible, whereas single point ignition refers to events such as pool fires, where only one elevation of the building is exposed to the incident flux...|$|R
40|$|Detonations can be {{initiated}} in <b>unconfined</b> fuel-oxidizer <b>clouds</b> by blast waves of sufficient energy. The ground impulse generated by such detonations can cause considerable damage. An analytical theory is {{developed in the}} present paper, which {{makes it possible to}} predict this impulse, and experimental measurements which verify the theory are reported. A plane detonation wave propagating through a one-dimensional fuel-air cloud in contact with the ground and with the inert atmosphere at height h is considered. The wave is followed by an expansion wave which propagates from the inert gases into the combustion products, and an oblique shock is induced in the inert bounding the explosive. In computing the impulse only the region behind the detonation where the expansion is reflected from the ground is considered. The impulse per unit area is found to be the product of p 2 (h/C) and a universal impulse function Us([xi]), where p 2 is the pressure behind the detonation and C is the Chapman-Jouguet velocity, and [xi] = x/l is the dimensionless distance from the detonation. Experimental values of the pressure and impulse behind a plane wave were obtained using a plastic bag, 4 x 4 x 20 ft long, filled with a stoichiometric MAPP-air mixture. The detonation was initiated using an explosive initiator {{at one end of the}} bag. Pressure transducers placed on the ground plane along the center of the bags were used to determine the variation of the pressure and impulse per unit area with time. Theory and experiment were found to be in excellent agreement...|$|R
40|$|Accidental {{releases}} of flammable gases {{may lead to}} major fires with extensive effects on the surroundings, mainly due to the intense thermal load emissions. In this paper, a computational approach based on fluid dynamics techniques was attempted aiming at the estimation of resulting thermal radiation emissions and overpressure in large scale cloud fires. In particular, the work dealt with the simulation of Coyote series trials, which conducted in 1981 by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and involved the release, dispersion, ignition and combustion of <b>unconfined</b> natural gas <b>clouds</b> in the open-air. In the computations, the CFD code CFX 5. 7 was utilized which, {{in addition to the}} standard three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, incorporates the k-epsilon. model for turbulence modeling, the Eddy Dissipation model for combustion and PI model for radiation transport modeling. Computational thermal radiation histories were compared with experimental data from totally four trials showing a reasonably good agreement for several locations in the field. Discrepancies were laid on overestimation of the thermal load receipted at a certain location, nevertheless within a factor-of-two of the observed values. Moreover, positive peak overpressures were sufficiently low to indicate that the combustion of the cloud yielded a flash fire rather than an explosion. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work presented in this thesis was undertaken {{as part of the}} safety work package of the NATURALHY project which was an integrated project funded by the European Commission (EC) within the sixth framework programme. The purpose of the NATURALHY project was to investigate the feasibility of using existing natural gas infrastructure to assist a transition to a hydrogen based economy by transporting hydrogen from its place of production to its place of use as a mixture of natural gas and hydrogen. The hydrogen can then be extracted from the mixture for use in fuel cells or the mixture used directly in conventional combustion devices. The research presented in this thesis focused on predicting the consequences of explosions and fires involving natural gas and hydrogen mixtures, using engineering type mathematical models typical of those used by the gas industry for risk assessment purposes. The first part of the thesis concentrated on modifying existing models that had been developed to predict confined vented and <b>unconfined</b> vapour <b>cloud</b> explosions involving natural gas. Three geometries were studied: a confined vented enclosure, an unconfined cubical region of congestion and an unconfined high aspect ratio region of congestion. The modifications made to the models were aimed at accounting for the different characteristics of a natural gas/hydrogen mixture compared to natural gas. Experimental data for the laminar burning velocity of methane/hydrogen mixtures was obtained within the safety work package. For practical reasons, this experimental work was carried at an elevated temperature. Predictions from kinetic modelling were employed to convert this information for use in models predicting explosions at ambient temperature. For confined vented explosions a model developed by Shell (SCOPE) was used and modified by adding new laminar burning velocity and Markstein number data relevant to the gas compositions studied. For vapour cloud explosions in a cubical region of congestion, two models were used. The first model was developed by Shell (CAM 2), and was applied using the new laminar burning velocity and other composition specific properties. The second model was based on a model provided by GL Services and was modified by generalising the flame speed model so that any natural gas/hydrogen mixture could be simulated. For vapour cloud explosions in an unconfined high aspect ratio region of congestion, a model from GL Services was used. Modifications were made to the modelling of flame speed so that it could be applied to different fuel compositions, equivalence ratios and the initial flame speed entering the congested region. Predictions from the modified explosion models were compared with large scale experimental data obtained within the safety work package. Generally, (apart from where continuously accelerating flames were produced), satisfactory agreement was achieved. This demonstrated that the modified models could be used, in many cases, for risk assessment purposes for explosions involving natural gas/hydrogen mixtures. The second part of thesis concentrated on predicting the incident thermal radiation from high pressure jet fires and pipelines fires involving natural gas/hydrogen mixtures. The approach taken was to modify existing models, developed for natural gas. For jet fires three models were used. Fuel specific input parameters were derived and the predictions of flame length and incident radiation compared with large scale experimental data. For pipeline fires a model was developed using a multi-point source approach for the radiation emitted by the fire and a correlation for flame length. Again predictions were compared with large scale experimental data. For both types of fire, satisfactory predictions of the flame length and incident radiation were obtained for natural gas and mixtures of natural gas and hydrogen containing approximately 25...|$|R
