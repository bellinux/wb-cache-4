For instance, the thinnest walls {{on the sides of}} a 4 HVL tungsten collimator 0.52 in thick will reduce the intensity of radiation passing through them by 88.5%. The shape of these collimators allows emitted radiation to travel freely toward the specimen and the x-ray film, while blocking most of the radiation that is emitted in undesirable directions such as toward workers.|$|E

Its segmentation from routine CT scans provides valuable information to assess its position and shape. In this paper, we present a novel variational segmentation method for extracting the heart on non-contrast CT images. To handle the low image contrast around the cardiac borders, we propose to integrate shape constraints using Legendre moments and adding an energy term in the functional to be optimized.

40|$|Increasing {{demands for}} mobile {{internet}} access {{have led to}} exponential developments in mobile communications technologies. The next generation mobile technology is expected to exploit electronic beam steering {{and to have a}} higher operating frequency to facilitate a higher bandwidth. This places a heavy burden on the base station antenna arrays, which should be sparse to accommodate passively cooling the system. Conventional sparse array topologies suffer from <b>undesirable</b> <b>radiation</b> pattern characteristics such as grating lobes. Therefore, this work focused on exploring methods to synthesize the antenna elements' geometrical parameters to enhance the radiation pattern and to explore the limitations that arise due to the array's sparseness. To this end, both a deterministic and a stochastic method were proposed. Starting with an analytical window function as a continuous current distribution and approximating this by adjusting the antenna elements' radial coordinates results {{in the fact that the}} desired window's radiation pattern is only approximated in a limited field of view, depending on the sparseness. Full electromagnetic wave simulations are performed to show that downscaling the topology to make it more dense gives rise to increased coupling effects that deteriorate the array's performance. In addition to the deterministic method, a genetic algorithm optimization method is employed to stochastically obtain the optimal current distribution window. Approximating the optimal continuous current distribution again leads to the array factor following the optimal window's radiation pattern in a limited field of view. Furthermore, it is shown that for the conditions used in this work, the optimum continuous current distribution is also the optimum current distribution for finite element arrays, implying that only one optimization needs to be executed when designing such an array. Concluding, the applicability of density tapering to sparse arrays is limited. The inherent undersampling causes a limited realization of the window function's characteristics. Density tapering does improve the absolute performance of a sparse array in terms of peak sidelobe level, but may be useful if the region of interest is concentrated near the main beam. The requirements and in particular the region of interest of the application determine whether density tapering can be effectively employed.

40|$|In {{radionuclide}} therapy with iodine- 131 labelled pharmaceuticals, free (131) I may be released and {{trapped by the}} thyroid, causing an <b>undesirable</b> <b>radiation</b> burden. To prevent this, stable iodide such as potassium iodide (KI) can be given to saturate the thyroid before (131) I is administered. The guidelines of the European Association of Nuclear Medicine do not, however, recommend special precautions when administering (131) I-lipiodol therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. Nevertheless, some authors have reported (131) I uptake in the thyroid {{as a consequence of}} such therapy. In this study, the influence of prophylactic KI on the thyroid uptake and dose (MIRD dosimetry) was prospectively investigated. (131) I-lipiodol was given as a slow bolus selectively in the proper hepatic artery or hyperselectively in the right and/or left hepatic artery. Patients were prospectively randomised into two groups. One group received KI in a dose of 100 mg per day starting 2 days before (131) I-lipiodol administration and continuing until 2 weeks after therapy (KI group; n= 31), while the other group received no KI (non-KI group; n= 37). Thyroid uptake was measured scintigraphically as a percentage of administered activity 7 days after (131) I-lipiodol (n= 68 treatments). The absorbed radiation dose to the thyroid was assessed by scintigraphy after 7 and 14 days using a mono-exponential fitting model and MIRD dosimetry (n= 40 treatments). The mean activity of (131) I-lipiodol administered was 1, 835 MBq in a volume of 2 (n= 17) or 4 (n= 51) ml. Thyroid uptake was lower in the KI group, being 0. 23 % 0. 06 % of injected activity (n= 31) compared with 0. 42 % 0. 20 % in the non-KI group (n= 37); the mean thyroid dose was 5. 5 +/- 1. 6 Gy in the KI group (n= 19) versus 11. 9 +/- 5. 9 Gy in the non-KI group (n= 21). These differences were statistically significant (P 0. 1). (131) I-lipiodol is associated with a generally low thyroid uptake and dose that may be significantly decreased by KI premedication.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of engineered materials, also known as meta- materials, with desirable effective constitutive parameters: electric permittivity (epsilon) and magnetic permeability (mu) to decouple antennas and noise mitigation from electromagnetic systems. An interesting phenomenon of strong relevance {{to a wide range of}} problems, where electromagnetic interference is of concern, is the elimination of propagation when one of the constitutive parameters is negative. In such a scenario, transmission of electromagnetic energy would cease, and hence the coupling between radiating systems is reduced. In the first part of this dissertation, novel electromagnetic artificial media have been developed to alleviate the problem of mutual coupling between high-profile and ow-profile antenna systems. The developed design configurations are numerically simulated, and experimentally validated. In the mutual coupling problem between high-profile antennas, a decoupling layer based on artificial magnetic materials (AMM) has been developed and placed between highly-coupled monopole antenna elements spaced by less than Lambda/ 6, where Lambda is the operating wavelength of the radiating elements. The decoupling layer not only provides high mutual coupling suppression (more than 20 -dB) but also maintains good impedance matching and low correlation between the antenna elements suitable for use in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. In the mutual coupling problem between low-profile antennas, novel sub-wavelength complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) are developed to decouple microstrip patch antenna elements. The proposed design con figuration has the advantage of low-cost production and maintaining the pro file of the antenna system unchanged without the need for extra layers. Using the designed structure, a 10 -dB reduction in the mutual coupling between two patch antennas has been achieved. The second part of this dissertation utilizes electromagnetic artificial media for noise mitigation and reduction of <b>undesirable</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation</b> from high-speed printed-circuit boards (PCBs) and modern electronic enclosures with openings (apertures). Numerical results based on the developed design configurations are presented, discussed, and compared with measurements.

The proposed design has achieved a wideband suppression of SSN and maintained a robust signal integrity performance.

30|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of electronic industries, the electromagnetic interference problem {{has become increasingly}} important and provides challenges for material researchers and radio frequency (RF) design engineers [1]. In {{order to reduce the}} <b>undesirable</b> electromagnetic <b>radiation,</b> nano-structural magnetic films have been extensively studied as one of the magnetic shielding materials. Nano-multilayer composites and nanocrystalline films exhibiting large complex permeability (real part μ' and imaginary part μ″ larger than 100) in the gigahertz (GHz) range are reported recently [2, 3]. However, the relatively large complex permittivity (exceeds 104) of these kinds of materials is difficult to satisfy the impedance-matching condition in the design method of electromagnetic wave absorption [4]. Magnetic granular films consisting of nanometer-sized ferromagnetic metallic particles (Fe, Co, Ni, and their alloys) randomly distributed in dielectric matrix (SiO 2, ZnO, and ZrO 2) are developed to solve the above problem [5 – 8]. These ferromagnetic insulators present high resistivity and hence relatively small permittivity. Nonetheless, the amplitude value of complex permeability cannot be freely tuned in the same sample. This kind of amplitude tuning has important meaning to further implement the active shielding. Therefore, exploiting new frameworks which can present different amplitude value of complex permeability according to the application requirement at room temperature are significant and challenging tasks.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] 2 ̆ 2 Despite {{the nearly}} {{universal}} {{adoption of the}} linear nonthreshold dose response model (LNT) as the primary basis for radiation protection standards for the past half century, the LNT remains highly controversial and a contentious topic of discussion among health physicists, radiation biologists, and other radiological scientists. Indeed, it has been {{pointed out that the}} LNT has assumed the status of a paradigm, synonymous with an ideal, standard, or paragon or perhaps to some, a sacred cow. Reduced to its very basics, the LNT postulates that every increment of ionizing radiation dose, however small, carries with it a commensurate increase in the chance or risk that the exposed individual will suffer some <b>undesirable</b> <b>radiation</b> effect, and that the risk thus incurred is directly proportional or linearly related to the dose. The specific effects are termed “stochastic,” which has been defined as “of a random or statistical nature. ” Stochastic or probabilistic effects of radiation may occur as a result of low doses and are generally taken to be cancers (including leukemias) and genetic defects in the progeny. The severity of these radiation-induced stochastic effects, should they occur, are independent of the dose that produced them; thus, even though the likelihood or probability of an occurrence may be small to negligible, any and all manifestations of a radiation induced stochastic effect will have equal severity. By contrast, higher doses of radiation are known to produce characteristic somatic or deterministic effects including erythema, epilation, sterility, diminution of blood cell counts, cataracts and, in very high exposures, acute and chronic radiation syndromes. Such frank biological effects are nonstochastic in nature (in fact, they were at one time termed “nonstochastic effects”) and will always be manifested once a particular minimum dose – i. e., a “threshold” – has been received. The severity of the effect is related to the dose. Below the threshold dose there will be no demonstrable effect; as the dose increases beyond the threshold, so does the severity of the effect, or the degree of harm. … The purpose of the above discussion is to illustrate the underlying controversy and confusion that surrounds the LNT today, as well to underscore the lack of precision that sometimes accompanies the arguments of both the proponents and opponents of the LNT. Given that the LNT is a low dose phenomenon, there needs to at least be consensus on what is low dose, and such a consensus needs also to include consideration of other relevant and important factors such as the dose rate and specific stochastic end point (i. e., type of cancer or mutation). With this as a backdrop, the historical development and gyrations that led to the LNT as it is currently applied (or, some would say, misapplied) in radiological protection can be examined in the context of current scientific thinking with respect to radiation effects. It is not {{the purpose of this paper}} to endorse any particular position or to take sides but rather to present the story in a factual and fair minded manner. Hopefully, what follows will successfully achieve this goal. Thus, this paper will briefly review the scientific bases and supporting studies that led to the development and acceptance of the LNT in health physics. It will briefly touch on such topics as hormesis and other studies, such as the classic work of the late Robley Evans, that clearly demonstrate a threshold and nonlinear response for certain stochastic effects such as osteogenic sarcoma, along with the plethora of studies that suggest or have been interpreted to indicate that for at least some end points (i. e., cancers), response to ionizing radiation is consistent with the LNT model. 2 ̆...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Medical accelerators {{operating}} above 10 MV are {{a source}} of <b>undesirable</b> neutron <b>radiations</b> which contaminate the therapeutic photon beam. These photo-neutrons which contaminate the therapeutic beam can also generate secondary gamma rays, via inelastic and capture reactions, which increase the undesirable dose to the patient body, the oncology staff and the general public. The purpose of the present work is to investigate, through Monte Carlo simulation, the effect of the presence of the patient on the neutron and gamma rays dose calculations. Methods: To illustrate this effect, the MCNP 5 code was used to model a radiotherapy room of a medical linear accelerator operating at 18 MV and to calculate the neutron and the secondary gamma ray energy spectra and the dose equivalent, at various points along the centerline of the maze, in the absence and presence of the patient. Results and Conclusion: The obtained results show a significant change in the neutron energy spectra {{in the presence of the}} patient especially in the thermal neutron energy region.

This thesis presents a study on 2. 45 GHz rectifying antennas (rectennas). The rectenna is a major component in a microwave power transmission system. The main feature is the conversion efficiency from microwave power to direct current (DC) power. Major circuit components of the rectenna element include the antenna, input and Output low pass filters, rectifying diode, and DC resistive load. Each component plays a vital role in maximizing the conversion efficiency. Thus, each component is reviewed separately. The rectifying diode is the key component in the rectenna circuit and understanding its characteristics is vital. A method has been devised to experimentally characterize a packaged GaAs Schottky barrier diode by inserting it in a microstrip test mount. The nonlinear equivalent circuit parameters of the diode are determined by a small signal test method. The method analyzes the diode's scattering parameters at various bias levels. A large signal measurement using the same test mount has also been configured to determine the power conversion efficiency from microwave to DC as well as determining the deembedded network impedance of the diode. A 85 % conversion efficiency was achieved in the test mount when the diode was properly tuned. A small 6 element rectenna was manufactured, tested and flown onboard a Japanese sounding rocket in the first demonstration of a microwave power transmission system in space. The dual polarized rectenna was configured as a detector of microwave power. Test results and flight data from the Microwave Energy Transmission in Space (METS) experiment are given.

Our approach uses magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) made of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) conjugated with curcumin, a natural compound that specifically binds to amyloid plaques. Coating of curcumin-conjugated MNPs with polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid block copolymer and polyvinylpyrrolidone by antisolvent precipitation in a multi-inlet vortex mixer produces stable and biocompatible curcumin magnetic nanoparticles (Cur-MNPs) with mean diameter < 100 nm. These nanoparticles were visualized by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, and their structure and chemistry were further characterized by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Cur-MNPs exhibited no cytotoxicity in either Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) or differentiated human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY 5 Y). The P-app of Cur-MNPs was 1. 03 x 10 (- 6) cm/s in an in vitro blood brain barrier (BBB) model. Amyloid plaques could be visualized in ex vivo T 2 {*}-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of Tg 2576 mouse brains after injection of Cur -MNPs, and no plaques could be found in non-transgenic mice. Immunohistochemical examination of the mouse brains revealed that Cur-MNPs were co-localized with amyloid plaques. Thus, Cur-MNPs have the potential for non-invasive diagnosis of AD using MRI.
