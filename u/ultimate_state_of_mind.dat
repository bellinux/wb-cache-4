50|$|Vishalta (Hindi & Sanskrit: विशालता) {{comes from}} the word Vishal and is a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> that is often embraced by {{different}} religious and spiritual leaders in India. The word embodies the <b>ultimate</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> selflessness, or belief that the body, mind, and all worldly possessions belong to God. One in a <b>state</b> <b>of</b> Vishaltha believes that the body is only a tool for carrying out {{the wishes of the}} Lord.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a simple {{analysis}} method of axial deformation of base-isolation rubber bearings in a building subjected to earthquake loading and present its applicability to the analysis of the bound of the aspect ratio of base-isolated buildings. The base shear coefficient is introduced as a key parameter for the bound analysis. The bound of the aspect ratio of base-isolated buildings is analyzed based on the relationship of the following four quantities; (i) <b>ultimate</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the tensile stress of rubber bearings based on a proposed simple recursive analysis for seismic loading, (ii) <b>ultimate</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> drift of the base-isolation story for seismic loading, (iii) <b>ultimate</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the axial compressive stress of rubber bearings under dead loads, (iv) prediction of the overturning moment at the base for seismic loading. In particular, a new recursive analysis method of axial deformation of rubber bearings is presented taking into account the nonlinear tensile behavior of rubber bearings and it is shown that the relaxation of the constraint on the <b>ultimate</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the tensile stress of rubber bearings increases the limiting aspect ratio...|$|R

5000|$|Spiritual materialism is {{the belief}} that a certain {{temporary}} <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> is a refuge from suffering. An example would be using meditation practices to create a peaceful <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind,</b> or using drugs or alcohol to remain in a numbed out or a euphoric state. According to Trungpa, these states are temporary and merely heighten the suffering when they cease. So attempting to maintain a particular emotional <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> as a refuge from suffering, or constantly pursuing particular emotional <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> like being in love, will actually lead to more long term suffering.|$|R

50|$|A 'Cannot Classify' {{category}} {{has also}} been delineated by Hesse and Main {{which is used to}} describe interviews in which no single predominant attachment <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>mind</b> can be identified.

Cannot classify interviews are rare in samples drawn from low-risk contexts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This {{study is}} aimed {{to analyze the}} <b>ultimate</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> bridges with rocking {{isolation}} of spread foundations under extreme earthquakes. The Vector Form Intrinsic Finite Element method (VFIFE) is adopted to simulate the failure procedure of bridges with and without rocking isolation. To simulate the highly nonlinear behaviors between soil and foundations, Winkler-based models are established in the VFIFE in this study. A practical five-span bridge with spread foundations is chosen to study the effect of rocking isolation and discuss the influence of altering parameters of bridges. The analytical results are compared between linear soil springs and nonlinear soil springs. Furthermore, the <b>ultimate</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> bridges is simulated to realize the dynamic behaviors of bridges under extreme earthquakes...|$|R
