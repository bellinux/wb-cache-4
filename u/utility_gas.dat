50|$|In {{the early}} years of MGP operations, the goal of a <b>utility</b> <b>gas</b> works was to produce the {{greatest}} amount of illuminating gas. The illuminating power of a gas was related to amount of soot-forming hydrocarbons (“illuminants”) dissolved in it. These hydrocarbons gave the gas flame its characteristic bright yellow color. Gas works would typically use oily bituminous coals as feedstock. These coals would give off large amounts of volatile hydrocarbons into the coal gas, but would leave behind a crumbly, low-quality coke not suitable for metallurgical processes. Coal or coke oven gas typically had a calorific value between 10 and 20 MJ/m³ (250-550 Btu/ft3 (std)); with values around 20 MJ/m³ (550 Btu/ft3 (std)) being typical.|$|E
50|$|During {{the late}} 1940s Westinghouse applied its {{aviation}} gas turbine technology {{and experience to}} develop its first industrial gas turbine.

This {{was the beginning of}} a 50-year history of Westinghouse industrial and <b>utility</b> <b>gas</b> turbine development, prior to the sale by Westinghouse of the power generation business to Siemens, AG in 1998. Evolving from the Small Steam and Gas Turbine Division formed in the early 1950s, the Westinghouse Combustion Turbine Systems Division was located in Concordville, PA, near Philadelphia and the old Lester, PA plant, until it was relocated to Power Generation headquarters in Orlando, FL in 1987.|$|E

5000|$|In the mid 1970s the [...] "MUST" [...] {{designation}} was applied, (Medical Unit, Self Contained, Transportable). During the [...] "Cold War", {{with the}} possible conflict with the Warsaw Pact, active duty MUST units would be staffed by all the basic personnel necessary (Medics, X-Ray Techs, Pharmacist, Cooks, Clerks etc.) Doctors, Nurses and Specialist would be mobilized and mate up with the unit in the Field. The Unit would be flown to West Germany, withdraw Pre-positioned complete Hospital MUST equipment and Military Vehicles from warehouses and then deploy. It contained all necessary functions to provide care for 200 beds, including 2 intensive care units, 8 medical wards, emergency room, 4 operating rooms, orthopedic room, laboratory, X-ray, pharmacy and the Unit's transport vehicles. It consisted of hard containers, which would be transported to the designated site, then the wheels would be removed and then expanded. They housed the operating rooms, laboratory, X-ray, and pharmacy. Inflatable shelters were used to provide double wall insulated areas for the patient care areas of the hospital. These [...] "inflatables" [...] required a power system called a Utility Pack (also known as a U-Pack or power station) to provide utility services, Heat, Cooling, Inflation, Hot Water, Filtered Air from CBR Contaminants. The Utility Pack (Power Plant, <b>Utility,</b> <b>Gas</b> Turbine Engine Driven - Libby Welding Co. Model LPU-71, Airesearch Model PPU85-5, AmerTech Co. Model APP-1, or Hollingsworth Model JHTWX10/96), powered by a centrifugal flow gas turbine engine, provided electricity (60 Hz AC, 400 Hz AC, and 24vdc). At 250 beds the hospital required 8 U-Packs. Each consumed 30 gallons of jet fuel per hour. After several years of using inflatables they were abandoned in the mid 1980s, {{largely due to the}} weight of the inflatables, and the amount of fuel required just to keep the tents from collapsing.|$|E
